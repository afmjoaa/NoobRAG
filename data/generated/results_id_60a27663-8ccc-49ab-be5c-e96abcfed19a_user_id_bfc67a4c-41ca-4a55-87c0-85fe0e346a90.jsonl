{"question":"What is the relationship between early adversity and mental health disorders, and how can epigenetic changes help us understand this connection?","answer":"Early adversity, such as malnutrition, emotional or physical abuse, or harsh parenting during early life or in utero, can lead to various mental health difficulties including depression, impulsivity, and eating disorders. The connection between early adversity and mental health operates through epigenetic changes that can be detected in both blood and brain tissue. These epigenetic modifications alter how genes function without changing their DNA sequence and have been implicated in various psychiatric diseases. For example, changes in the FKBP5 gene, which is involved in stress response, have been linked to depression, bipolar disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Research has shown that these epigenetic changes persist even after stress hormone levels normalize, making them reliable indicators of overall stress exposure and potential risk factors for mental illness in humans and other mammals.","context":["Dr. Linda Booij , PhD\nAssociate Professor, Psychology\nNumerous studies have shown that adverse exposures in utero or in the first years of life (e.g., malnutrition, emotional or physical abuse, harsh parenting) can lead to a variety of mental health difficulties later on. These difficulties include (but are not limited to) depression, impulsivity or eating disorders.\nEarly adverse exposures in utero or in the first years of life can affect the brain in many different ways; however, the neurotransmitter serotonin is of particular interest. That is because serotonin is (i) widely implicated in a variety of psychopathologies and (ii) important for brain development, especially during infancy or childhood (i.e., serotonin, in fact, helps to actually “build up the brain”). The overarching theme of our research program is that early adversity could disrupt the stability of certain brain chemicals (e.g., serotonin). This in turn influences the early development of brain regions involved in emotion regulation, and could predispose the individual to psychological problems later in life, particularly when exposed to subsequent stressful events. The studies we are conducting are done in clinical and non-clinical populations and use neuro-imaging (fMRI/PET), epigenetics (DNA methylation, HDACs) and/or cognitive-behavioural assessments, and is funded by various sources, including CIHR, NSERC, NARSAD and QBIN.\n- DNA methylation and eating disorders\n- Gene-environment studies on brain and mental health, using twin designs\nPhD (Leiden University, the Netherlands)\nMood, Anxiety and Personality Disorders (psyc440)\nBiological basis and treatment of psychopathology (psyc724)\nSelected recent publications\nIsmaylova, E., Di Sante, J., Gouin, J-P, Pomares, F.B., Vitaro, F., Tremblay, R.E., & Booij, L.(2018).

But the researchers say they have discovered the same blood and brain matches in dozens more genes, which regulate many important processes in the brain.\n“Many human studies rely on the assumption that disease-relevant epigenetic changes that occur in the brain — which is largely inaccessible and difficult to test — also occur in the blood, which is easily accessible,” says study leader Richard S. Lee, Ph.D., an instructor in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. “This research on mice suggests that the blood can legitimately tell us what is going on in the brain, which is something we were just assuming before, and could lead us to better detection and treatment of mental disorders and for a more empirical way to test whether medications are working.”\nFor the study, the Johns Hopkins team worked with mice with a rodent version of Cushing’s disease, which is marked by the overproduction and release of cortisol, the primary stress hormone also called glucocorticoid. For four weeks, the mice were given different doses of stress hormones in their drinking water to assess epigenetic changes to FKBP5. The researchers took blood samples weekly to measure the changes and then dissected the brains at the end of the month to study what changes were occurring in the hippocampus as a result of glucocorticoid exposure. The hippocampus, in both mice and humans, is vital to memory formation, information storage and organizational abilities.\nThe measurements showed that the more stress hormones the mice got, the greater the epigenetic changes in the blood and brain tissue, although the scientists say the brain changes occurred in a different part of the gene than expected. This was what made finding the blood-brain connection very challenging, Lee says.\nAlso, the more stress hormone, the more RNA from the FKBP5 gene was expressed in the blood and brain, and the greater the association with depression. However, it was the underlying epigenetic changes that proved to be more robust. This is important, because while RNA levels may return to normal after stress hormone levels decrease or change due to small fluctuations in hormone levels, epigenetic changes persist, reflect overall stress hormone exposure and predict how much RNA will be made when stress hormone levels increase.\nThe team of researchers used an epigenetic assay previously developed in their laboratory that requires just one drop of blood to accurately assess overall exposure to stress hormone over 30 days. Elevated levels of stress hormone exposure are considered a risk factor for mental illness in humans and other mammals.\nOther Johns Hopkins researchers involved in the study include Erin R. Ewald; Gary S. Wand, M.D.; Fayaz Seifuddin, M.S.; Xiaoju Yang, M.D.; Kellie L. Tamashiro, Ph.D.; and Peter Zandi, Ph.D. James B. Potash, M.D., M.P.H., formerly of Johns Hopkins, also contributed to this research.\nThe study was funded by grants from the National Institutes of Health’s National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (UO1 AA020890) and the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (HD055030), the Kenneth A. Lattman Foundation, a NARSAD Young Investigator Grant, the Margaret Ann Price Investigator Fund and the James Wah Fund for Mood Disorders via the Charles T.

{"question":"How do medical equipment planning and custom home design processes address the challenge of managing changes during implementation?","answer":"Medical equipment planning emphasizes that changes to equipment selections once production activities have started can have devastating effects on budget and schedule, particularly for Group 1 and 2 equipment with 180+ day lead times. Similarly, in custom home design, changes are strongly discouraged after entering the Construction Documents Phase as they would require extensive drawing revisions. Both processes recommend thorough upfront planning - medical equipment planning through comprehensive equipment lists and technology evaluation, and custom home design through detailed preliminary design and development phases - to minimize costly changes during implementation.","context":["Integrating Medical Equipment Planning Into The Construction Process\n- Sep 04, 2018\nMedical equipment planning as a service has transformed markedly since its conception. From the early beginnings of one or two individuals developing a simple list categorizing and naming user-selected medical equipment, successful planning is now a dynamic process involving an entire team, typically comprising clinicians, architects and project managers.\nThe evolution of medical equipment planning has coincided with the ongoing desire of healthcare institutions to have the most state-of-the-art technology in their facilities. A strong medical equipment planning team is key to a successful project outcome, ensuring the future proofing of the facility as well as to mitigate risk and ensure that capital expenditures are handled wisely.\nSimilar to the architectural design process, medical equipment planning tends to have a handful of significant milestones during the health facility construction process. First among these typically is preliminary budgeting for financial approvals or certificate of need. A second notable milestone, or series of milestones, are the document submissions associated with the design process (e.g., end of schematic design, end of design development). The development of the medical equipment list should advance in lock step with the architectural and engineering design phases, and at each submission point should be available for issuance to the appropriate parties.\nThe medical equipment planner serves as an objective and well-informed voice outside of the healthcare facility’s operational staff. Wielding their expertise and knowledge as a client advocate, they are able to shepherd the decision-making process through to conclusion without bias or influence other than what is best for the client and project.\nBuilding information modeling (BIM) is now utilized on almost every healthcare project currently in design. As designers, planners and clients are still identifying roles and responsibilities in projects utilizing BIM, the overall project model now requires a new way of creating, updating and maintaining the equipment list. BIM enables the entire team to understand the impact changes from one manufacturer and model to another without tremendous loss of time or efficiency.\nThe third major milestone involves client approval and sign-off of medical equipment lists and plans. This is a vital point for a number of reasons.Sign-offs documents the final selections on medical equipment during the design phases. Having the client sign off on the lists can also serve to limit conflict over the selections of medical equipment at later points in the project. Because the sign-offs are typically conducted in an open forum with all parties present, the process has a measure of transparency that can mitigate “political” issues that would otherwise crop up.\nLater in the project, there are a series of somewhat smaller milestones involving the selection and purchase of medical equipment with significant installation and utilities requirements. These items are traditionally identified as Group 1, categorized as fixed equipment such as imaging systems, or Group 2, which is comprised of non-fixed equipment with complex utilities requirements.\nThe vast majority of equipment in those groups have substantial utilities and installation requirements that impact the design and engineering of a healthcare facility. In addition, they also require considerable lead times from execution of a purchase order until delivery to the project site (e.g., 180 days for an MRI scanning system, etc.). This time is required for the manufacturer to finalize options, develop site specific, or “shop” drawings, specifications, and commence production. Changes to equipment once these activities have started can have devastating results to the project’s budget and schedule.\nWhile a healthcare facility may wish to hold out for the latest technology from a vendor, decisions on major medical equipment selection cannot be delayed without impact to the schedule. In many instances the space and utilities are driven by a specific manufacturer’s installation and technical requirements. All too often, health care facilities put off equipment selection while they negotiate pricing or attempt to wait for the next technology advances. It is imperative that the medical equipment planner clearly and concisely outlines to the project team the challenges of delaying or changing decisions (e.g., change orders, schedule delays, increased costs of acquisition) associated with Group 1 and 2 equipment.\nPlanning a Win\nCommunication is vital among all team members as the project progresses. It ensures everyone has the most complete information regarding medical equipment in the project, and can mitigate or avoid costly problems in construction. Except for sensitive issues as noted by project administration, such as project budget status, communication should be as transparent as possible. This can diffuse issues that arise from rivalries between departments or clinicians, and greatly reduce misunderstandings regarding project goals and decisions.\nStrong project management with a clear vision can make a tremendous difference in a project, particularly where physician preferences intersect with medical equipment selections. While the medical equipment planner can guide particularly difficult decisions on healthcare technology, the project management team must be the final arbiter of those decisions.\nThe “wish list” mind-set is an ever-present problem with medical equipment planning. A weak project manager will find it difficult to contain the pressure from clinicians with strong opinions on vendors and models to include nice to have, but not always relevant equipment. One good way to manage this problem is by having the medical equipment planner incorporate a healthcare organization’s equipment standards, group purchasing organization contract items and other pre-identified models and manufacturers. This can accelerate the process of planning, and remove potential issues regarding clinician preferences when they are at odds with the overall organization’s procurement philosophy.\nForward-thinking review and analysis of the equipment list goes a long way to helping create a successful medical equipment planning engagement. This important, but often overlooked, process offers an opportunity to capitalize on changes in technology, strategic vision by the health care organization or in the medical equipment marketplace. However, new technology and equipment should be studied objectively and rationally before being included in a project — especially a renovation project. The risk of technology or equipment disrupting the operational processes of clinicians, is always present.\nIn some cases, it may be prudent to decide against adding a new technology if infrastructure requirements or associated operational activities would incur additional costs, or delay the project schedule. It may be possible to make some adjustments to the design and engineering of a project to incorporate that technology or equipment at a point after the new facility opens (e.g., including conduit runs for operating room integration, but delaying purchase of the system itself).\nThe true benefit of medical equipment planning over the long term is having a healthcare facility that is not only prepared to provide patient care aligned with the client’s strategic vision from the first day of operation, but flexible enough to do so years afterwards. By utilizing a well-experienced medical equipment planning firm, the client will be able to develop healthcare facilities that are forward-thinking, and based on rational and objective decision-making where medical equipment technology is concerned. Given the ever-changing landscape of healthcare, there is a risk of including new and emerging medical equipment technology in a project when it may not be appropriate for the vision of patient care in a new facility. This can represent a tremendous capital cost that may have been expended needlessly, for selecting the wrong equipment – no matter how new or state-of-the-art — poorly serves a facility’s clinical, operational and financial goals. One example would be the use of surgical robotics in the operating room. The cost for such systems is quite high (e.g., $1.8M USD for a currently available system in the US), but the clinical indications for use are somewhat limited.\nAdditionally, some of the companies selling surgical robotics systems are quite adept at convincing surgeons to be strong advocates for their products, in spite of these issues. A well-experienced and knowledgeable medical equipment planner can assist healthcare organizations in navigating the issues related to this kind of medical equipment technology, and assist them in making informed and reasoned decisions on whether or not it makes sense to include in a particular project.\nIncreasing the odds\nMedical equipment planning can greatly increase the likelihood of a project meeting the owners’ vision of patient care in their new facility. Unfortunately, many facility professionals who have never utilized a medical equipment planning consultant feel it’s a luxury. Typically, it takes only one large project (and the myriad details surrounding medical equipment) that goes over budget or is delayed to change that view.\nGood medical equipment planning adjusts to the healthcare facility’s vision of the project, while steering them through the issues of health care technology, equipment infrastructure requirements and procurement tasks. The equipment selected for a new facility helps drive the team members’ mission and goals while navigating the always-present challenges inherent in any project.\nAlso published in Medical Construction & Design Magazine – Page 35 “All Hands On Deck”","Custom Home Design Process\nThe Design of a Custom Home or a Remodeling involves literally hundreds of decisions in many different areas of design and construction. Each area is a specialization in itself and requires a great deal of knowledge and experience to make well informed decisions. In fact, a home is one of the most complex design problems and is more involved than many other commercial or industrial projects of a limited nature. As a professional Architect, I am educated, trained and licensed to assist you throughout the entire design and building process. An Architect protects a client’s interests and organizes the design procedure by guiding the clientele through a decision-making process. In choosing your Architect one must feel comfortable with their methods of communication and confident with their level of experience. This initial decision is a critical key to the success of your project.\nA typical project involves one or more initial meetings to determine your design needs, budget, scope of services and to analyze the site and all other project requirements. This is followed by “Three Design Phases” and may include the Bidding and/or the Construction Administration phases. The number of meetings varies from client to client, depending upon several factors including client involvement, extent of details and specified time frames.\n1. Preliminary Design Phase\nThe first phase is the Preliminary Design Phase and it involves the initial process of evaluating your needs, special relationships, and functional requirements. Your Architect would design the site plan, floor plans, exterior elevations and sections with multiple design ideas for your review. These ideas are usually sketched freehand, to scale, and are open to discussion for revision and redesign until you are pleased with all decisions. At this phase, an Architect will discuss room finishes, ceiling heights, structural members, air conditioning routing, and other details. We suggest that you acquire 2 preliminary bids at the end of this phase to verify that the established budget is still accurate.\n2. Design Development Phase\nWhen the Preliminary Design layout is determined to be within your square footage range, approximate budget and is well suited to your needs, the Design Development Phase is initiated upon your approval. This phase consists of basic, computerized one-quarter inch scale drawings of the plans, elevations, roof, sections, and other relevant drawings necessary to describe the design of the custom home or remodeling. Once the computer-generated drawings are approved then we begin to involve a structural engineer for the foundation and framing.\n3. Construction Documents Phase\nYour Architect then proceeds to the Construction Documents Phase. Changes to the plan should be minimal after this point to eliminate what would be extensive revisions to the drawings. An Architect adds many dimensions and notes to the floor plans; draws finished exterior elevations, the roof plan layout, electrical layouts, interior elevations and cabinetry, detailed house and wall sections, the site plan, and all other necessary drawings. The Construction Documents are drawn to local standards and codes in order to obtain your building permit and are used by your general contractor to build from. These drawings are considered to be your legal documents describing the nature of the home you are building. It is very important that these drawings be thorough, clear, and complete. This will eliminate many of the stresses and miscommunications related to building or remodeling.\n4. Bidding Phase\nYour Architect can assist you in obtaining and reviewing formal bids from several contractors. This phase would be considered the Bidding Phase. If requested, your Architect will hold a bid conference answering questions for all contractors. It is recommended that complete specifications on materials and construction procedures be written so that all bidders understand the same requirements for construction. Get an insight to your bidders. See the quality of their construction both in process and completed. You should also talk with homeowners that the contractor has completed a custom home or remodeling for.\n5. Construction Administration Phase\nArchitects are also knowledgeable to assist throughout the Construction Administration Phase. Your Architect makes periodic site visits to observe that the home is being built according to plans and specifications. If required, the Architect can administer the construction contract by verifying construction draws from the contractor through the bank.\n6. Architectual Fees\nArchitectural fees for a Custom Home are typically quoted on a cost per square foot of construction. Fee schedules vary with each individual project due to size and complexity, the scope of services performed and the amount of information supplied. We recommend that you collect pictures of ideas that fit your lifestyle and tastes. These pictures can assist the Architect. She will take your desires, add ideas to them, and develop your designs faster.\nThe more you know you want, the less time it will take her to develop your plans, therefore possibly lowering fees. It also takes more time to design and draw a complete and thoroughly detailed set of house plans. The saying “you get what you pay for” is very true in this situation. Also, Many times the fees of an Architect’s service can be easily compensated due to their knowledge and experience in the construction practices, the utilization of standard material sizes and by the avoidance of potential delays, revisions and added expenses. Be aware that it costs less to put your plans on paper thoroughly now than it does to make changes or additions in the field during construction with labor and materials.\nIf you are planning to Remodel an existing home, your Architect would perform the same design phases with minor variations. It is recommended that you try to obtain a set of plans of your existing home from the past owners, the builder, the architect or the homeowner’s association. Remodeling is usually billed hourly and original plans can reduce your initial design costs.\nThe process of designing “Your Custom Home” or remodeling can, and should, be a pleasant and exciting experience. Your Architect knows what information is needed and when, and takes pleasure in seeing your dream home evolve as you work together throughout the “Custom Design Process.” Attention to detail and good communication skills with your Architect will assure your success. Consider the day-to-day enjoyment that you will get from your custom home and the added dimension that good design and planning can bring to you and your family’s life."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"english_native_fluent"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:0d0dd4e4-3b6e-427e-9828-1439ee262688>","<urn:uuid:5cac9bed-b0aa-40b1-ad1e-7a8265372228>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How did scientists contribute to both the development and control of nuclear weapons, and what were the changing views on nuclear deterrence?","answer":"Scientists like Hans Bethe made significant contributions to nuclear weapons development through projects like the Manhattan Project, where he headed the theoretical division at Los Alamos. However, scientists later became involved in efforts to control nuclear weapons, with Bethe himself joining the Union of Concerned Scientists to oppose anti-ballistic missiles. These shifting roles reflected broader changes in nuclear weapons perspectives - while they were initially seen as peace maintainers during the Cold War, later views emphasized the risks of proliferation, leading to control measures like the 1968 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty focused on limiting nuclear spread.","context":["Hans Bethe was born in Strasbourg in 1906 which, at the time, was part of the German Empire of Kaiser Wilhelm II. Today, Strasbourg, as part of Alsace, is in France, though it borders the German region of Baden. Hans' parents were Albrecht, a physician, and Ella whose father was a professor of medicine at the university in Strasbourg. Hans was an only child whose father was a protestant and whose mother had converted from Judaism to Lutheranism, though religion was by no means a major force in his childhood. His mother was an accomplished musician who, sadly, lost much of her hearing just prior to World War I.\nHans, it is safe to say, was well above his age in mathematical ability as a child. Recollections of both his own and of relatives include his ability to compute square roots at the age of four, a full understanding of fractions by the age of five, and the ability to find prime numbers by the age of seven. The latter is evidenced by the fact that he was able to compute and memorize a table of primes that included 214 - 3 and 310 + 2. By the age of fourteen he had taught himself calculus.\nBut mathematics and the word of numbers was not his only forte. He learned to write very early and, soon after, began to fill notebooks with stories. In an unusual twist, he wrote first from left to right on one line, and then from right to left on the following line, a manner of writing he much later learned was employed by the ancient Greeks on some of their tablets.\nUpon completion of his high school education in 1924, he began attending the University of Frankfurt, studying theoretical physics because he felt:-\n... mathematics seemed to prove things that are obvious.\nHis interest and ability were beyond what Frankfurt could offer and he was advised to go to Münich where, in 1926, he began studying with the legendary Arnold Sommerfeld. By 1928 he had completed his doctorate summa cum laude with a thesis on the diffraction of electrons in crystals. This remarkable thesis was one of his most enduring and important works.\nBy treating the electrons as waves he realized that the wavefunction had to contain certain terms with the same periodicity as the crystal's lattice structure. This meant that for certain angles of incidence, no wavefunctions existed for an electron in a lattice. This was a major contribution not only to solid state physics but also to the foundations of quantum mechanics as it further demonstrated the unusual consequences of the wave-like properties of matter.\nIn 1929 Hans was awarded a Rockefeller Foundation fellowship that allowed him to spend time in Cambridge working with Ralph Fowler and time in Rome working with Enrico Fermi. While in Cambridge he coauthored a paper on the quantum theory of absolute zero with fellow visitors Guido Beck and Wolfgang Riezler that turned out to be a hoax concocted to embarrass another Cambridge physicist (and good friend of Fowler's), Arthur Eddington. Eddington had just published a 'derivation' of the fine structure constant which is thought to be an underivable experimental value. The paper by Bethe, Beck, and Riezler was later officially retracted.\nWhile in Rome that year, Hans found the atmosphere even more informal than Cambridge. He enjoyed Cambridge, and particularly Fowler, quite a bit but his relationship with Fermi might be described as having been more organic and less mechanistic. Fermi taught Bethe the value of qualitative reasoning and that physics need not -- in fact should not -- be drudgery, but rather enjoyable. After his stay in Rome, he returned to Germany and served as a lecturer at the University of Tübingen until 1933.\nWith Hitler's rise to power in 1933 and the enactment of the racial laws, Hans lost his job due to his mother's Jewish heritage. Sommerfeld did manage to secure for him a summer fellowship in Münich but initially few long-term possibilities were forthcoming. Sommerfeld made an attempt to obtain a post for him in Manchester with William Lawrence Bragg, but, thanks to an unusual set of circumstances he was to end up elsewhere. As it happened, Bragg was visiting Cornell at the very time that Hans was searching for a position and at the very time Lloyd P Smith, who had studied with Hans in Münich, recommended him for a vacant theorist position at Cornell. Bragg spoke very highly of Hans, passing along Sommerfeld's praise as well, and the job was his. Hans was to remain at Cornell for the rest of his life.\nHans' work grew to be focused primarily on nuclear research. Despite this it was only after repeated urging on the part of his friend Edward Teller that he attended the 1938 Washington Conference that was dedicated to the problem of energy generation in the cores of stars. It would be a watershed moment in his life for he was able to finally solve the problem of energy generation by applying the theoretical tools of nucleosynthesis to the data that had been so far collected in this field. It was for this work that he won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1967.\nThe crowning achievement in this work came in 1939 when he published a paper in Physical Review that essentially showed how stars shine. Oddly, though, he left the neutrino out of the proton-proton reaction equation. This was because he had, with Rudolf Peierls five years earlier, concluded that such a process would be unobservable. Nonetheless, his conclusion -- that the CNO cycle drove energy generation in stars much more massive that the sun while the p-p reaction drove energy production in lighter stars -- is a staple of nearly every introductory textbook on astronomy.\nWith his work on quantum mechanics in solid state crystal lattices and his work on stellar nucleosynthesis, he was already a highly accomplished physicist in more than one subfield. And yet, he was still able to make significant contributions to yet another distinct subfield: quantum electrodynamics (QED).\nHans had learned QED from Fermi in 1931 while he was visiting Rome, having come by way of Cambridge. It was just after this that he published a review for the Handbuch der Physik dealing heavily with the quantum theory of hydrogen and helium. The seeds of his work in stellar nucleosynthesis can be seen here since these atoms play a fundamental role in stellar processes. His work in QED included the calculation of bremsstrahlung with Walther Heitler, perhaps one of the most important results in QED in the 1930s. But QED was a controversial theory until, in 1947, after attending the Shelter Island Conference, Hans was able to successfully show that QED (particularly as descended from Dirac's theory of the electron) could, in fact, make accurate predictions of electron transitions in real hydrogen atoms. In particular, he was able to successfully calculate the fine structure levels in these atoms (this seems somewhat at odds with his paper mocking Eddington, though Eddington's approach was unusual and not at all correct).\nOutside of Hans' theoretical contributions to physics, he was also a major contributor to the Manhattan Project during World War II. Having become a US citizen around the time America entered the war, he was able to participate in defense-related projects and began working on the radar project at MIT's radiation laboratory. He was convinced to participate in a summer study organized by J Robert Oppenheimer in 1942 which led to the creation of Los Alamos Laboratory in 1943 with Hans as head of the theoretical division. Among the members of his group was Edward Teller who was, at the time, still one of his best friends. But Teller's singular obsession with developing a thermonuclear device (the hydrogen or H-bomb) led to a cooling off in their relationship (in Hans' own words).\nHans continued to make contributions to physics not only through direct publication but through his mentoring of younger Cornell faculty members throughout the remainder of his life. He often advised members of the government, including a number of presidents, on numerous topics (though mostly nuclear weapons issues). He was one of the first members of the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) founded partly to oppose the development of anti-ballistic missiles (ABMs).\nFreeman Dyson remembers he always preferred to be called 'Hans' and that he had an unusual sense of humor, not only evident in his hoax publication with Beck and Reizler, but also in his lending his name to a paper (a serious one at that) he had virtually nothing to do with, simply so the ever-jocular George Gamow could publish a paper with his student Ralph Alpher, whose author line would read: R Alpher, H Bethe, and G Gamow. This is now known as the famous (infamous?) a, b, g paper.\nHans remained fairly active well into his later years, most recently participating in several organized forums regarding Michael Frayn's award-winning play Copenhagen. A telling sign of his immense influence on the world of physics was the dedication of an entire issue of Physics Today, published by the American Physical Society, to him after his death in early 2005. Bethe was honoured with the award of the Max Planck Medal in 1955 and the United States Atomic Energy Commission's Enrico Fermi Award in 1961. In 1957 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of London, as well as a member of the National Academy of Sciences (United States) in Washington, D.C.\nArticle by: Ian T Durham Saint Anselm College","Perceptions regarding nuclear weapons presents a contradiction in terms of the existence of a “peaceful nuclear past and a fearful nuclear future” (Sagan 66). Such a contradiction exists in terms of our current understanding regarding nuclear weapons and deterrence. Consider for example that during the Cold War period, nuclear weapons were widely believed to be one of the most important factors in maintaining the peace between the United States and the Soviet Union (Cimbali 224).\nCurrently, on the other hand, it is widely believed that enabling the continuing spread and development of nuclear weapons will only increase the risk of the development of a nuclear war. This is based upon the assumption that rival countries that are considered nuclear powers are unlikely to maintain stable deterrence. Due to this concern regarding the prevention of such an event, the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty was formulated during 1968. The treaty imposed an international limitation to the spread of nuclear weapons. It is based upon three main tenets: non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, disarmament of nuclear weapons, and the peaceful use of nuclear energy. What follows is an analysis of the nuclear proliferation argument.\nAs was stated above, the main rationale for the Nuclear Proliferation Treaty (NPT) was the prevention of nuclear wars caused by the unstable deterrence between nuclear weapons states. According to the Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy, the agreement is based upon international mechanisms that operate within the foundations of international laws and norms.\nAnxworthy further states that the NPT opts “to promote and achieve a world without nuclear weapons” hence a world without a nuclear war impending in its historical future (1). As opposed to this, it has been argued by political scientists that if the main rationale for the treaty was the prevention of nuclear wars, then the treaty by prohibiting the proliferation of nuclear weapons defied itself in so far as enabling the proliferation of nuclear weapons ensures the prevention of nuclear wars.\nAccording to Kenneth Waltz, “nuclear weapons have been given a bad name” (731). Waltz argues that it is fallacious to assume that since nuclear weapons may cause catastrophic nuclear exchanges, nuclear wars will thereby cause global destruction. Waltz argues that nuclear weapons will enable the development of stability and peace since “a nation will be deterred from attacking if it believes that there is a possibility that its adversary will retaliate” (734).\nIt is important to consider that Waltz’s claim is based upon the assumption that major wars amongst states occur as a result of the estimation of zero or low retaliation costs of a state from another state. In lieu of this, it is thereby possible to conclude that allowing the proliferation of nuclear weapons lessens the possibility of the development of nuclear wars since it ensures that countries will consider the high amount of risk involved in launching a nuclear attack towards a state with similar military capacities.\nIn lieu of this, I would like to conclude that it is indeed true that the choice between a more peaceful and co-operative versus a war-ridden and hostile world is highly dependent or critically dependent on the future of nuclear weapons however, it does not necessarily necessitate the prevention of their further spread.\nCimbali, Stephen.

{"question":"How do Natün's programs for Maya communities in Guatemala compare to Justice in Motion's legal services in terms of addressing historical discrimination?","answer":"Both organizations address historical discrimination but through different mechanisms. Natün works to counter the systemic discrimination that has led to Maya communities being under-resourced since Spanish colonization in the 1500s, providing education, healthcare, and economic development programs that respect Indigenous traditions while improving access to essential services. Justice in Motion, on the other hand, fights discrimination through legal channels, helping Indigenous workers who have faced exploitation and abuse in foreign worker programs to access justice across borders, even after returning to their home countries. They provide crucial support for overcoming barriers in transnational litigation and advocate for policy changes to protect workers' rights.","context":["Natün works within the Maya communities of Sololá, Guatemala, combining Native wisdom with Western methodologies in order to bring sustainable improvements to the local people's quality of life.\nKeep reading to find out how Onaway’s recent partnership with Natün is helping to provide Maya midwives with vital training and equipment which will allow them to make the most of their traditional knowledge.\nFormerly known as Mayan Families, Natün is an inspiring organisation working within Indigenous Maya communities in the area of Lake Atitlán in Sololá, Guatemala to foster sustainable improvements in education, nutrition, healthcare and economic development.\nNatün focuses on integrating local Indigenous wisdom and resources into their programmes in effective and culturally respectful ways which allow the community to feel supported, understood and, ultimately, to become more self-sufficient. For this reason, almost all of the 60 members of staff are local Maya people, who can bring their unique insights to guide the development and implementation of Natün’s programmes within their own communities.\nWith Maya people accounting for over half of the Guatemalan population, Onaway hopes that this new partnership with Natün will help to address some of the injustices preventing this vibrant and resilient community from truly thriving.\n“In Kaqchikel, Natün means to unite or come together, to align behind a common cause. And that is the work and the future of the organization, to unite for community, to grow and learn and to become our best together.”Erin Mooney, Executive Director\nGuatemala’s Indigenous Maya population has been oppressed, marginalised and persecuted ever since their lands were colonised by the Spanish in the 1500s. In addition to this ongoing genocide, Maya people find their rights are still frequently violated through actions such as land theft, labour exploitation and political exclusion. Although on paper the treatment of Indigenous peoples has improved in the past 500 years, the remnants of this discrimination are still having a profound impact on people’s daily lives.\nSystemic discrimination and prejudice has led to Maya communities being disproportionately under-resourced, causing many personal and social problems. During Guatemala’s 36-year civil war, many people escaped to remote areas with a lack of essential public services, particularly those catering to Indigenous languages and customs. This has resulted in widespread poverty, with an average income of only £1 per day among those in need of Natün’s support. 66% of children in the Lake Atitlán area suffer from chronic malnutrition, reflecting Guatemala’s reputation as one of the most malnourished countries in the world.\nIn light of this, Onaway is proud to be partnering with Natün for the first time on a project seeking to provide Maya midwives with access to vital training and equipment. Local midwives recognise that, despite their extensive and invaluable knowledge of traditional medicine and midwifery skills, additional training in emergency procedures during childbirth would support their growth and improve birth outcomes. For this reason, a group of Maya midwives has requested training that, while introducing standard Western medical techniques and theories, also respects their Indigenous traditions and expertise in this area.\nWith Onaway’s help, Natün will be able to deliver two training modules to 20 midwives across 11 communities in Sololá, as well as providing essential sterile medical equipment which they are currently lacking such as thermometers, scissors and paediatric scales. With 50% of Indigenous women choosing to give birth outside of hospital, this is invaluable knowledge which will hopefully spread among the wider community as Maya midwives put their increased confidence and new skills into practice.\nSince the project started, nine midwives have so far been provided with protective equipment and birth care kits and trained in their proper use. They have also been supported in growing 20 different medicinal herbs in gardens created at their own homes and the group has discussed and shared knowledge about their many practical uses. A further 42 midwives from across the region have participated in an interactive training session with a highly-qualified Kaqchikel OBGYN and reported that, having had their important questions and doubts addressed, they now feel more confident in dealing with difficult situations.\nNUTRITION AND HEALTH\nNatün runs a wide range of programmes working to tackle other issues faced by the Maya people in the areas of nutrition and health, education, and economic development. As the community’s poor health and malnutrition has a knock-on impact on productivity and increases expenses, this leads to further economic difficulties and social struggles for local families.\nFortunately, Natün helps to address the root source of the problem with programmes treating and preventing malnutrition from the first moment of life, working with pregnant women and babies for the first 1000 days after birth, as well as providing community outreach medical care for isolated communities. Their 6-month transitional support programme provides emergency food assistance, health checkups and help with long-term sustainable food and income generation.\nThis work continues in the community agriculture project, which helps local people to grow crops and native medicinal plants to sell and for personal use by following traditional Maya agroecological farming methods for better crop resilience and higher yields. As well as providing a source of income, the improvements in nutrition resulting from this programme will increase the community’s wellbeing and, in turn, productivity, demonstrating the circular nature of Natün’s projects.\nAs with the midwifery project, these healthcare programmes combine international best-practices and data with the traditional wisdom and practices of Indigenous healers in order to provide the best care for the community. Local Maya women are regarded as the experts and are thus granted the responsibility of leading programmes by drawing on their wealth of sacred experience, knowledge and wisdom which has been passed down through the generations.\nEDUCATION AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT\nNatün has also created multiple programmes to provide quality, culturally-enriching education for the often disadvantaged and overlooked children of the Maya community. This vital support begins as early as 3 to 5 years old in the preschool nutrition centres where, in addition to receiving nutritious meals, children are given a bilingual education not offered in the public education system. In this way, children are able to develop the Spanish language skills they may need to succeed in later life, while being encouraged to nurture their connection to their Indigenous roots via classes taught in the Mayan language, Kaqchikel.\nRunning alongside this initiative are the community learning programme, providing one-on-one tutoring and mentoring to students who are struggling academically, and the scholarship programme, which is currently making a quality education accessible to over 800 students from preschool to university level thanks to the life-changing financial grants of generous donors.\nAdults are also offered an education through the artisan and trade school programmes, providing training in traditional and technical skills such as carpentry, sewing, embroidery and entrepreneurship. Learning and honing these practical skills is allowing local people to become more economically self-sufficient in order to support their families and improve their overall quality of life, while continuing to work in alignment with their cultural roots. Natün sells the artisans’ creations in their shop in Panajachel while also helping to connect them with the wider market, including online shops such as Etsy, in order to expand their reach and ensure fair prices for their work.\nIMPACTS AND FUTURE\nThe positive impacts of Natün’s approach are clear to see, with significant improvements in health and education and an increase in public awareness of the difficulties facing the 15,000+ individuals receiving direct assistance each year. Following the introduction of the education programmes, local children have seen a 16% improvement in their grades after just one year of preschool. 81% of scholarship students stayed in school during the COVID-19 pandemic, compared to less than 50% nationwide, while 85% of students surpassed the national average of 73% who passed first grade.\nGoing forward, Natün hopes to continue to build on the promising results they have produced in Maya communities so far. The organisation plans to provide training to the remaining 60 midwives in Sololá who they were unable to work with directly in this initial project, while advocating for the recognition and inclusion of Indigenous healers in the public health system on both a local and national level.\nThe Onaway Trust is proud to be partnering with an organisation so devoted to their mission of helping this long-neglected community to achieve the respect and quality of life they deserve.

In other cases, they are about to go to trial and the U.S. lawyers cannot obtain a visa for the client who is back home in Guatemala but needs to return to testify. Or, U.S. lawyers simply have trouble tracking down migrant clients they represented once they have left the country to disburse the wages that they recovered for them.\nThese are just a few examples of the many challenges that attorneys face when representing migrant workers in transnational employment litigation. Some attorneys find it cost-prohibitive to keep in contact or track clients down when the case goes to trial and forgo representing them entirely. Our goal is to help advocates and migrants overcome these barriers to portable justice. Our unique cross-border model helps to ensure that migrants who suffered exploitation abroad are able to access justice even if they have returned to their home countries. Our organization is at the center, connecting advocates and defenders, and supporting the development of cases to ensure that transnational litigation is working effectively on behalf of migrants. We have also play an important role in persuading attorneys throughout the region to work on cases with a transnational dimension, and to not simply give up because of the legal or logistical obstacles. This has led to a significant increase in the number of advocates in the region providing transnational legal services to migrants.\nThrough our case facilitation procedure, we match U.S. lawyers with a Justice in Motion Defender Network member in the client’s country of origin to partner on specific cases. U.S. lawyers work directly with the Defender to execute the specific assignment.\nLegal Action Abroad\nNot all legal violations that clients suffer can be adequately addressed in the country of destination. Sometimes the solution can only be achieved in the migrants' country of origin.\nWe support Defenders to initiate strategic litigation challenging abusive contractors hired by U.S. or Canadian companies to recruit in the countries of origin for temporary foreign worker visas.\nThe Defender Network can provide legal support to assist in abuses that occur in the country of origin. Common abuses suffered include:\n- Recruitment Abuse: Workers are charged illegal fees for job offers.\n- Recruitment Fraud: Workers are defrauded of hundreds of dollars and their identity documents, for jobs that do not exist.\n- Threats: Workers experience intimidation to force them to drop their legal claims.\n- Retaliation: Workers are often not rehired to return on temporary worker programs after they have complained of abuses.\n- Trafficking: Trafficking often starts in the home countries. Additional remedies, both civil and criminal, may be available for the trafficked person.\nAdvice & Referral\nOur staff maintains expertise related to transnational litigation issues as well as the regulatory framework related to migrant workers in the U.S. and their struggle to access the justice system across borders. We are available for advice and referral services.\nTransnational litigation Training to U.S. attorneys\nWe frequently conduct lectures and trainings for U.S. advocates and attorneys on transnational litigation issues. To assist U.S. advocates with the legal challenges they face when representing clients who have left the U.S., we publish a Challenges in Transnational Litigation Manual that describes strategies and practice pointers for U.S. lawyers who represent migrant plaintiffs. There is currently no charge for the manual, but we appreciate any donation to support the development of this resource.\n“This manual is the Rosetta Stone for lawyers representing H-2 workers in litigation in U.S. courts. If you represent transnational low-wage workers with employment claims and you're not using this manual, you should start now.”\nOUTREACH & EDUCATION\nThe Defender Network\nOur Defender Network currently includes more than 40 organizations in Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, and Nicaragua.\nJustice in Motion provides ongoing trainings to the Defender Network equipping them with the knowledge they need to engage in this cross-border work. The trainings cover many topics such as human trafficking, employment rights, immigration, and recruitment fraud and abuse. Defenders use that knowledge to conduct community outreach and education, positioning themselves as a resource in their communities. They are trained by Justice in Motion to handle legal actions and engage in local policy advocacy on behalf of people from their communities migrating to the US and Canada.\nCentro de Acompanamiento a Migrantes, A.C.

{"question":"Does Lovelock's theory about glacial periods being 'healthier' for Earth match what we know about the Sun's future evolution and its impact on climate?","answer":"No, there is a mismatch between these views. Lovelock argues that Earth was healthier during glacial periods because it helped the planet stay cool as the Sun warmed over geological time. However, the detailed solar evolution models show that the Sun's natural brightening will make maintaining cool temperatures impossible - the Sun will become 10% brighter in just 1.1 billion years, triggering a moist greenhouse effect, and 40% brighter in 3.5 billion years, causing a runaway greenhouse effect. This indicates that Earth can't maintain a 'healthy' cool glacial state long-term due to the Sun's inevitable evolution, regardless of any self-regulating mechanisms.","context":["James Lovelock, renegade Earth scientist and creator of the Gaia hypothesis, has written a gloomy new book called “Revenge of Gaia”, in which he argues that we should be stashing survival manuals, printed on good old-fashioned paper, in the Arctic where the last few breeding pairs of humans will likely be found after a coming climate catastrophe. The book is not published in the U.S. yet, but it is available from amazon.co.uk. Lovelock has never been one to shrink from a bold vision. What is it he sees now?\nGaia In the first biogeochemistry class I took, I was assigned to read the first few chapters of Lovelock’s 1978 book, “Gaia: A new look at life on earth”. Since then, I have assigned those same chapters to every biogeochemistry class I have ever taught. Lovelock wrote very eloquently about the eerie stability of the earth system. The sun has been warming throughout its lifetime, and yet the climate of the earth has remained stable between the relatively narrow range of the boiling and freezing points of water. This observation was labeled the “faint young sun” paradox by Carl Sagan , and now has at least a partial explanation in terms of the weathering of silicate rocks, the silicate weathering thermostat [Walker et al., 1981]. Lovelock also points out that the oxygen concentration of the atmosphere has been remarkably stable over the half-billion years since multicellular life appeared in the fossil record, never high enough to explode (doubled atmospheric oxygen would lead to unstoppable continent-scale forest fires), nor low enough to wipe out the animals. Nitrogen, Lovelock points out, ought thermodynamically to exist as nitrate dissolved in the oceans; the reason that most of Earth’s nitrogen exists as nitrogen gas in the atmosphere is because of life.\nLovelock’s bold leap was to envision life on Earth as a single unified organism, capable of regulating the environment on Earth for its own well-being, analogous to the way that you or I regulate the temperature and chemistry of our bodies. A weak version of the Gaia hypothesis would state that the geochemistry of the biosphere is regulated by negative feedback mechanisms, many of which include the effects of life on Earth as integral components. This statement is no longer controversial among Earth scientists. A stronger version of the Gaia hypothesis might conclude, as Lovelock did, that methane is produced by bacteria because Gaia requires a flux of hydrogen to the stratosphere and hence to space, as a long-term balance of her oxidation state. A new idea in “Revenge of Gaia” is that we animals dispose of excess nitrogen in a bioavailable form as urine, rather than saving water and energy by exhaling it as the biologically less available nitrogen gas, because Gaia prefers for us to keep the nitrogen available for plants.\nThe strong Gaia hypothesis raises issues of altruism and cooperation among different components of Earth’s biota. I personally don’t understand how a Gaian biota would be stable, in the face of competition between organisms. If an organism spent metabolic energy for the common good, would it not be out-competed by another more selfish organism? The evolution of Gaia is another difficulty. Darwinian evolution is essentially a process of trial and error. Evolving a Gaia leaves very little room for error.\nThe closest I ever came to believing the strong Gaia hypothesis was during a talk I heard by Lynn Margulis, coauthor with Lovelock on the first Gaia paper in the scientific literature [Lovelock and Margulis, 1974]. Margulis’ claim to fame is that she championed the idea that organelles in eukaryotic cells might have originated as symbiotic relationships between multiple cells sharing the same external cell walls. This idea was ridiculed but is now settled as being probably correct. In her talk, she said something like, “The more we look, the more we see symbiosis in life. Gaia is simply symbiosis as seen from space”. For an instant there, I saw the vision.\nGloom So what does visionary Lovelock see now? There is no specific, mechanistic scenario for the downfall of civilized man, but rather a gut feeling of approaching catastrophe. Lovelock’s foreboding arises in part from his impression that Gaia is healthiest in the glacial climate state, such as Earth was in 20,000 years ago. The interglacial climate states, such as we inhabit now, he describes as fevers that Gaia must overcome. The origin of this seemingly peculiar perspective is twofold. First, the sun has been warming over geologic time, so the challenge facing Gaia at present is to stay cool. The glacial Gaia is more in control of this challenge than is the interglacial Gaia, so the glacial Gaia must have been the healthier. Second, the CO2 concentration was lower in the glacial atmosphere, which Lovelock interprets as a product of a healthier, more robust biosphere. (I feel compelled to point out here that the carbon isotopic composition of the deep ocean tells us that there was less organic and biosphere carbon during glacial time than there is now. Plants must have struggled to grow in the lower-CO2 atmosphere. It’s not clear to me how the glacial biota was happier than today. Forgive me, I’m small minded, I nitpick.)\nLovelock argues that a cooler land surface retains water better; a warm land surface is either desert or it could be rain forest, which has learned tricks to recycle water efficiently but is very fragile and would collapse with any further warming. A cool surface ocean is biologically productive, while a warm surface ocean is nutrient-limited and therefore a biological desert. Lovelock argues that a robust thriving biosphere is essential for Gaian regulation. (Small-minded me again. The regulation of CO2 by silicate weathering, alluded to above, in theory doesn’t really require trees or life as a central component. The terrestrial biosphere apparently is taking up carbon from the atmosphere, but the real heavy-hitting mechanisms for regulating CO2 on the long term involve dissolution of rocks, chemical reactions that can be influenced by life but do not really require it. A stronger case can be made for life as a necessary part of atmospheric O2 regulation, but it would take millions of years to change O2, so we are not really concerned about asphyxiating in the next century. The critical process is burial of organic matter in ocean sediments, however, not some process associated with forests on land. Despite what you may have read, the rain forests are not actually the lungs of the planet.)\nThe argument for approaching doom is made by analogy. (Again I feel compelled to editorialize. Argument by analogy is a powerful rhetorical tool, at which Lovelock is a master. Reasoning by analogy however is not a reliable divining rod for scientific discovery. “As above, so below” was a central tenet of the alchemists. We don’t do that anymore.) The analogy is to the failure of natural regulation of a human body, requiring artificial intervention. If the kidneys fail, a doctor has to take over regulation of blood chemistry using dialysis. If the pancreas fails, the patient requires manual regulation of sugar metabolism by insulin injection. It is generally bad news when the doctor tells you that your body’s natural regulation mechanisms are failing, because artificial, technological fixes are typically not as reliable as the natural ones. There is no doubt that mankind is taking over the reins of global geochemical balance. Industrial production of fixed nitrogen for fertilizer now matches the natural rate of nitrogen fixation on the planet. Rates of fossil-fuel CO2 emission dwarf the natural rate of CO2 release in volcanic gases. Lovelock’s conclusion, by analogy, is that the biosphere of the Earth will soon be beset by all manner of unanticipated complications.\nThis does not seem to me an unreasonable conclusion, I must admit. Consider Biosphere II. This was a sealed greenhouse in the Arizona desert, an attempt to create a managed, self-contained biosphere. A very humbling effort it turned out to be, all in all. Biological control proved to be completely out of reach. Several species of birds were introduced into the system, based on rational design of ecological balance, and all of them went extinct. The only birds that flourished in BII were a local species that invaded the structure while it was under construction that they never managed to eradicate. Ants and cockroaches became so abundant in BII that the biospherians took to sucking them up into vacuum cleaners and feeding them to their domesticated chickens. Geochemically, the oxygen concentration plummeted and nitrous oxide rose, until the structure became uninhabitable.\nAt this point in the book, about half-way through, Lovelock diverts from the question of our impending doom into various other, much smaller issues like whether nitrates in food are really bad for you. It felt surreal, like the serving staff on the Titanic arguing about whether a time card had been properly punched or not. Lovelock uses this material to make the point that people worry about all the wrong stuff. OK, that’s a legitimate point, but I was left wishing for some discussion of what shape the catastrophe might take.\nBased on the experiences of the Biospherians, I would imagine that the wildest instabilities might be biological. We can cope with bacteria, at least better than humankind could back in the days of the Black Death in Europe, but bacteria are adept at evolving defenses to our chemical weapons, and viruses are much more difficult to attack. A new plague would spread globally, much faster than it did in the middle ages. A biological collapse might be attributable to human overpopulation, or monoculture agriculture, perhaps more so than to climate change.\nGeochemically, I could imagine the chemistry of the atmosphere shifting to a new equilibrium, in which (say) carbon monoxide could suddenly rise up to harmful levels. The oxidation chemistry of the atmosphere has been altered in all different directions by human emissions of organic compounds, nitrogen compounds, and methane. No one understands why the lifetime of methane in the atmosphere is as stable as it appears to been over the past decades. Surprises could lurk here.\nMethane hydrates seem dangerous, because there is so much methane. If all of the hydrates were to melt within a few years, we would have a methane spike in the atmosphere that would be catastrophic, because methane is such a powerful greenhouse gas. But it seems more likely that the hydrates would melt slowly, over centuries and millennia. If that is the case, the climate impact might be comparable to fossil fuel CO2 combustion. It could double the human climate impact, but probably not make it 10 times worse or anything like that.\nPhysically, there have been abrupt climate changes in the past, which we are just beginning to figure out. Transitions between stable climate states may be sudden. Some transitions are driven by sharp changes in physical properties of substances like water. There is a sharp boundary between a stable and a runaway greenhouse effect, because of the sharp phase boundary between water vapor and liquid. Abrupt climate changes in the glacial North Atlantic may have been amplified by freezing of sea ice. Dynamical systems may also change states quickly. Ocean circulation seems to have multiple configurations, also apparently generating abrupt glacial North Atlantic climate changes. The dynamical balance in hurricanes on earth is between latent heat and wind friction with the ground, but if the pressure dropped low enough, ground friction fails as a regulator and a new beast, called a “hypercane”, could arise [Emanuel et al., 1995]. No one is suggesting that hypercanes will arise on Earth, but this is an example of a sharp transition in a dynamical system. It would be extremely difficult to forecast abrupt climate changes such as this for the future.\nThe Earth has existed in hot-house configuration before, and contrary to Lovelock’s vision, I don’t know of anything intrinsic to the hot-house Earth which would preclude human life. The transition from present-day climate to a radically new climate could be catastrophic from the point of view of human civilization however, especially given that Earth is loaded with so many people already. Past climate transitions often drove extinctions and eventually new speciation. Past societies, such as the Classic Mayans, apparently vanished from the face of the earth, leaving behind mute relics of past social structure. These societal collapses were regional, often triggered by regional climate changes. The world today is globalized to an extent that was never a factor in the past, and climate is poised to change in a global way such as civilized humanity has not before witnessed.\nWe should be very clear. No one, not Lovelock or anyone else, has proposed a specific, quantitative scenario for a climate-driven, all out, blow the doors off, civilization ending catastrophe. Mr. Lovelock has a feeling in his gut that something terrible is going to happen. He could be right, but for what it’s worth, there aren’t any models that explode as catastrophically as this. We can never say that it’s impossible that something might fall out of balance, something we haven’t thought of. But I think in general the consensus gut feeling among small-minded working scientists like me is that the odds of such a catastrophe are low.\nLow odds of catastrophe does not imply negligible. Nordhaus  considered the possibility of catastrophe in his analysis of the economics of climate change. He defined catastrophe as comparable to the Great Depression, a 25% decrease in global economic activity that lasts for a long time. The probability of such an event he estimated by polling the gut instincts of a group of climate scientists; for what it’s worth, they came up with probabilities of a few percent. Economically, Nordhaus found that this possibility imposed the largest cost of adapting to climate change, greater than the costs of sea level rise, potential change in storminess, and so on. My own belief is that economics is a flawed tool for managing global climate, because it neglects issues of fairness, and reduces the value of the natural world to units of money. The point is that, within this framework, a small possibility of a large catastrophe looms large as a practical issue.\nEmanuel, K.A., K. Speer, R. Rotunno, R. Srivastava, and M.

The SMI task force focuses on providing insurance-based solutions, including developing at least two new insurance products to protect priority industries like nuclear energy, hydrogen, and offshore wind. They also aim to implement sustainable processes across the insurance supply chain to incentivize sustainable behaviors. In contrast, BBVA's approach is more finance-focused, offering sustainable alternatives for all its products and solutions. They are the first bank to use data analytics to help corporate clients calculate their carbon footprint, and they have already mobilized over €50 billion in green financing, sustainable infrastructure, social entrepreneurship, and financial inclusion as part of their Pledge 2025 strategy.","context":["HRH The Prince of Wales has launched his Sustainable Markets Initiative (SMI) insurance task force today during a visit to Lloyd’s of London.\nChaired by Lloyd’s, the task force is composed of executives from many of the world’s largest re/insurers and aims to provide an influential platform for the sector to collectively advance the world’s progress towards a resilient, net-zero economy.\nMembers include CEOs from companies such as AIG, Allianz, Aon, AXA, Beazley, Conduit Re, Hiscox, Howden, Marsh McLennan, Munich Re and Tokio Marine Kiln.\nIts statement of intent includes a commitment to providing climate positive financing and risk management solutions to support and encourage individuals and businesses around the world to accelerate their transition to a sustainable future.\nDuring his visit to the historic insurance and reinsurance marketplace, Prince Charles underlined the importance of adapting and expanding coverage for offshore wind projects, keeping pace with the rapid growth of new technologies, and efforts to “build back better” by encouraging customers to rebuild sustainably.\nThe SMI task force will also work with governments to establish a public-private disaster resilience, response and recovery framework, which will help protect developing nations from the evolving economic and societal impacts of climate change.\nA framework will be developed to help unlock the more than $30 trillion in assets under management, increasingly directing capital towards investments that drive climate-positive outcomes in both developed and developing nations.\nAdditionally, the task force will launch at least two new insurance products to protect priority industries, such as nuclear energy, hydrogen and offshore wind.\nSustainable processes will also be implemented across the insurance supply chain to encourage and incentivise individuals to take positive actions to live more sustainably.\nFurthermore, public-private disaster resilience, response, and recovery framework will be developed to help protect developing nations from the evolving economic and societal impacts of climate change, including the effects of increasingly frequent and severe weather events.\nOnce developed, this solution will be rolled out across vulnerable countries to support better disaster response and recovery, with a pilot being initiated in 2021.\n“The insurance industry is exceptionally well placed to understand the impact of climate change and the damage it can cause to us all if we don’t take action now,” said His Royal Highness.\n“This is why I am so pleased that a large number of the world’s leading insurance companies have joined together to identify how the insurance industry can help put Nature, People and the Planet at the heart of our entire economy.”\nLloyd’s Chairman Bruce Carnegie-Brown added, “As the world begins to recover from a pandemic that has caused significant and far-reaching financial and societal challenges, it does so with an opportunity to build back with sustainability as a foundation and guiding principle.\n“Although climate change poses unprecedented systemic risk, it is one which – through partnership and accelerated action – we have the means to address.\n“As a task force, we are making a resolute commitment to be a catalyst for action to help create a more sustainable future through the risks we manage and the capital we invest.”","BBVA has joined the Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA) as one of the 43 founding members.\nBanks in this international alliance commit to ensuring that all of their credit and investment portfolios are neutral in net emissions of greenhouse gases by 2050, in line with science and the most ambitious targets in the Paris Agreement. In addition, the direct impact of their activities must also be neutral - something that BBVA already achieved in 2020.\n“Our world needs more ambition [and a global joint effort such NZBA´s] to accelerate the change toward a net zero economy by 2050. At BBVA, our own activity is already carbon-neutral and we also want to be so in our indirect emissions, taking into account those related to our clients’ production. We want to lead this transformation, supporting society in its transition toward a more sustainable future,” said Carlos Torres Vila.\nWith this alliance, each bank commits to set intermediate decarbonization goals for 2030 in line with the goal to reach net zero emissions by 2050. By the end of this year, after announcing that it would no longer finance coal, BBVA will complete its plans and objectives for sectors with the greatest CO2 emissions: oil, gas, the automotive industry, steelmaking, cement and transportation.\nBBVA announces coal phase-out\nBBVA will reduce to zero its exposure to coal-related activities, stopping the financing of companies in this business by 2030 in developed countries, and by 2040 in the rest of the countries of its footprint. This decision, which is included in the updated BBVA’s Environmental and Social Framework, is in line with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) proposal. This aims to limit the rise in temperatures to a maximum of 1.5ºC and achieve the ambition of a carbon neutral economy in 2050.\nIn 2020, BBVA attained carbon neutrality for its own activities thanks to the use of renewable energy and offsetting its entire carbon footprint with CO2 mitigation projects, which also have a positive impact on the local communities where they take place. With this announcement, it will also be carbon neutral for indirect emissions; in other words, taking into account the impact of its clients’ activities.\nIt is a milestone that means that all banks in the alliance are aligning to the most ambitious scenario in the Paris Agreement. This means limiting the temperature increase to 1.5ºC from levels prior to the Industrial Revolution.\nIt is an alliance that emerged from the heart of the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI). It aims to provide legitimacy, credibility and transparency to the journey to reach emission neutrality by 2050. Furthermore, it will allow banks to cooperate in accelerating the development of the tools and methodologies needed for this transition.\nIn its accession document, the alliance recognizes “the vital role of banks in supporting the transition of the real economy to net-zero emissions, but we will only succeed in achieving this objective if our clients and other stakeholders also play their part.” They assume this commitment “with the expectation that governments will follow through on their own commitments to ensure that the objectives of the Paris Agreement are met.”\nBBVA’s announcement marks yet another step forward following its signing (as a founding member) of the Collective Commitment to Climate Action (CCCA) and the Principles for Responsible Banking in September 2019; and the Katowice Commitment in December 2018.\nBBVA will accompany its clients in this energy transition toward a more sustainable future with concrete plans and goals. In this journey, BBVA is the first bank in the world to use data analytics to allow its corporate clients to calculate their carbon footprint. BBVA also offers a sustainable alternative for all of its products and solutions in Spain - both for individuals and businesses.\nIn 2018, BBVA announced its Pledge 2025: its climate change and sustainable development strategy that aims to mobilize €100 billion by 2025. Three years later, BBVA has mobilized over €50 billion in green financing, sustainable infrastructure, social entrepreneurship and financial inclusion.\nBBVA is the second most sustainable bank in the world in 2020, and the most sustainable in Europe, according to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI)."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"english_native_fluent"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:8dd3350e-d465-4583-b097-db813186c075>","<urn:uuid:1b9ee727-5670-4669-afd7-0ade1c1da634>"],"error":null}

It would prove to be a turning point in both their lives.\nIt was here that Mr. Theara was introduced to the world of heavy rock by Swiss-German musician Timon Seibel, who had just joined the country’s only metal label Yab Moung Records in 2014, and would visit the NGO to share his passion for the music.\n“Before I just listened to music, but then Timon came and he played guitar,” Mr. Theara said. “Then he showed me bands from the U.S. like Rage Against The Machine. I liked it and then I just told him that I wanted to play guitar, drums or sing.”\n“I kept going…and then I knew Slipknot. I liked them and I decided I wanted to be the same as Slipknot.”\nThere was something about the uncompromising aggression and rebelliousness in the music that Mr. Theara identified with.\nHe soon started seeking out metal himself. When Mr. Seibel took him to see Sliten6ix, a pioneer of Cambodian metal, playing at Phnom Penh’s Show Box bar in 2014, he decided to set up a band of his own the following year.\nHis brother, Ouch Hing, became the drummer; long-time best friend Sok Vichey took on guitar; the bassist, Sochetra Pic, was also living under the NGO’s care. All the band’s members had come from the Stung Meanchey dump and grown up together, creating a bond that runs deep.\nMr. Theara decided on the group’s name Doch Chkae, which translates to “like a dog.” A widely pejorative term in Khmer, he said it was used to portray how he felt society perceived him as an orphan from a dumpsite.\nDoch Chkae perform in their former neighborhood at the Stung Meanchey dumpsite. (Yab Moung Records)\n“We chose this name because our lives are like dogs. For a dog, at least they have owners, but for us, we don’t have parents to take care of us, we only have siblings. Therefore, we named ourselves ‘Like Dog,’” he said.\nThe band released two singles online through label Yab Moung last year, including “Kham Knea Doch Chkae,” or “Bite Each Other Like Dogs,” which was accompanied with a video of the band wearing collars and leashes and screaming from the confines of cages to imitate the canines they identify with. Theara’s snarling vocals are matched by the intensity of the drums and guitars. It has since racked up tens of thousands of views online.\nLyrics to another song, “Chkout Doch Chkae,” or “Crazy Like a Dog,” include the lines “I am crazy like a dog, like a dog is rabies crazy. I really hate my f—ing life, so really f—ing hateful much. I like to be a f—ing crazy dog, because then you’re starving poor without anything.”\nMr. Theara finds the whole process cathartic, the frenetic music giving him an outlet to let off steam, a release for the anger and frustration inside. When he’s not making his own music, he can be found at his job, teaching kids at Moms Against Poverty to play drums.\nThe band members write music collaboratively and have played live around Phnom Penh, including at last month’s Golden Street Festival on Street 278.\nDespite the growing popularity of the band, Mr. Theara admits that many perceive his death metal music—the anthesis of the cheesy bubble-gum pop beloved by many young Cambodians—in a derogatory way.\n“When we play the music…it’s common that people say ‘like dog, like dog’ both older and younger people,” he said. “They say it’s just noise. They say, ‘What are these stupid songs you are singing? It is not listenable.’”\nNot that 17-year-old guitarist Vichey is fazed.\n“They cannot understand the words that we sing. It’s just screams and nobody understands,” he said. “Who cares? I don’t care.”\n“I just want to get better and better so a Khmer metal band can be famous.”\nDoch Chkae’s emergence has coincided with something of a comeback for Khmer metal in Phnom Penh.\nA budding scene emerged around 2012 with a few bands and growing crowds, but it disappeared back into the darkness in 2014 after numerous groups, including Sliten6ix, went their separate ways. Last year, however, the pioneers of Khmer metal made their ferocious return.\nSpeaking in the Phnom Penh bar-cum-tattoo parlor where he works when he’s not on stage, Sliten6ix lead vocalist Vanntin Hoeurn, 24, explained how he discovered his love for metal while learning English as a teenager.\n“I started off just listening to English music in general because I was learning English and then I saw some alternative rock bands and I was like, ‘this is heavy,’” said Mr. Hoeurn, better known around town as Tin, who speaks with a broad British Mancunian brogue—picked up from the friends he learned English from—despite living in Cambodia his whole life.\nIt was soon after discovering his love for metal that Mr. Hoeurn started Sliten6ix in 2011.\n“At the time I didn’t know I could sing so I was just like, ‘F— it. If I can’t sing I’m just gonna scream.’ That’s why I was like, ‘Let’s go really heavy,’” he said.\nAlthough it’s debatable whether Sliten6ix was the country’s first metal band, there was no real precedent for what they were doing when they started. The band quickly built up a following in certain circles, while their music was met with confusion in others.\nSliten6ix perform at a Phnom Penh street party earlier this month. (Steve Porte)\n“The family were just bemused. They don’t know what it is, but were like, ‘You do what you do. You still go to school; that’s good enough for us,’” he said.\n“I think our first two gigs we did at one of my friend’s houses,” he said. “We got a lot of confused neighbors popping their heads around. We didn’t really care. We just did it.”\nIt didn’t take long for Sliten6ix to begin making waves in Phnom Penh, with bigger crowds attending their chaotic shows, column inches being devoted to their rise and the feeling of a real scene beginning to form.\n“It was such a tight-knit group back then. Some people didn’t know what the f— they’d got themselves into,” Tin said, laughing.\nBut as things were on the up, in true rock ‘n’ roll style, it all fell apart in 2014.\n“The band was so jaded,” he said. “We just got sick of each other.”\nDuring a couple of years apart, in which Mr. Hoeurn embarked on his Tom Waits-esque growling blues project Phnom Skor, he never turned his back on his heavier roots and his disdain for the “commercialized, plagiarized music” popular on the Cambodian airwaves.\n“Metal has been a big part of my life since I was young. There was always a tingling idea at the back of my head that maybe I could do it again, but couldn’t really see people that could see eye-to-eye,” he said.\nLast year, a call came from the band’s drummer Alan Ou, who wanted to give Sliten6ix another shot. With a new guitarist, Nara Tsitra, on board—who Tin says “forced everyone to not be lazy f—wits”—the band was reborn.\nSliten6ix swiftly penned and recorded their first EP “Hiraeth,” which was released in December, and this month embarked on their first foreign shows in Ho Chi Minh City, where heavy metal is more enthusiastically embraced.\nAlthough the band’s sound has evolved since the early days, he said, Sliten6ix has maintained its nihilistic ethos that has rekindled the spirit of six years ago.\n“Since we got ourselves off to Saigon, I think the boys got a bit of a taste for the touring, seeing all these different people and seeing that scene doesn’t just exist here, it’s all around the world. I think touring is very good to maintain that spirit,” he said.\nRejuvenated and back on the road, Mr. Hoeurn is optimistic—albeit realistic—about how far Sliten6ix and Khmer metal can go.\n“Of course, I would love to see [major success], but right now I just want to tell other people, ‘OK, we don’t get famous, maybe the scene is not going to go [big], but who cares?’” he said, dragging on the last of a cigarette.\n“If you like doing it, just keep on doing it.”\nDoch Chkae frontman Mr. Theara is dreaming big, however. He hopes to follow in the footsteps of his heroes.\n“I want my band to be famous in Cambodia, for people to know us and to let them follow us. Our country doesn’t have aggressive music like this.”\n(Additional reporting by Buth Kimsay)\n© 2017, The Cambodia Daily.

{"question":"Looking at both the historical development of fishing tourism in Trøndelag and tourism in New Orleans' French Quarter, how have these regions become internationally renowned destinations in their respective fields?","answer":"Both regions developed strong international tourism reputations starting in the 19th century. Trøndelag's reputation for fishing began when English salmon lords started visiting in the early 19th century, making rivers like Gaula, Orkla, and Namsen internationally famous in salmon fishing circles. The region also attracts thousands of Europeans, particularly Germans, to coastal fishing spots like Hitra and Frøya. Similarly, New Orleans' French Quarter, which survived from the original 1718 townsite, has become one of America's most popular tourist destinations. The Quarter maintains its distinctive style combining Spanish and French influences from its colonial period, and the city became renowned as a destination for both business and pleasure, known for its nightlife, social scene, and as the birthplace of jazz music.","context":["There was not an exact match for the language you toggled to. You have been redirected to the nearest matching page within this section.\nIf you are type that goes round for nine months of the year waiting for June to come so you can test all the new flies you have tied to get through the winter darkness, then you are probably a pretty eager salmon fisher. You would use to yearn to let your fly touch the surface of the river Gaula, Orkla or Namsen to imitate an elusive fly so that the salmon builds up its appetite enough to bother to open its mouth for its small but delightful meal. In all likelihood you think the sound of deep-sea fishing with an echo sounder is partially or completely uninteresting. Boring in fact.\nIf, on the other hand, your biggest desire is to get so far out to sea that you can barely see land then let the echo sounder tell you that there are fish at great depths in the deep blue sea below – perhaps even a fat halibut that may present great struggle – then you are probably a sworn sea angler. Half asleep, you imagine assembling the right hook and getting it down, down and down before the big fish disappears. In all likelihood, you think that playing with a salmon or the puny worm and flimsy rod of the freshwater anglers is almost unenterprising.\nIf you are dreaming of going on a hike, deep into the forest, feeling the fresh air, imagining that your small bucket is full of worms, and you are on your way to the lake you would barely dare to mutter the name of out loud, it would indicate that you are an experienced freshwater angler. You think the hysteria surrounding the gear of salmon and deep-sea anglers has taken off completely, and that they should learn to calm down a bit and enjoy the scenery while they are waiting for a bite, perhaps while taking a brief nap.\nWell, here in Trøndelag we have experiences to suit all three, and several of the places offer conditions that are among the best in Europe. As good luck would have it, we don’t have to mention this to the tourists because they mention it to us first.\nEver since the English salmon lords started visiting Trøndelag in the early 19th century, several of the rivers in Trøndelag have become just as well known in international salmon fishing circles as they are among Norwegian anglers. For the salmon fishermen it has a lot to do with reputation, about knowing the river or more precisely the beat or even the pool they tend to fish in. In that sense, salmon fishermen are a loyal breed, they don’t travel around much, but instead prefer to develop a relationship with the place and its whims.\nThe aforementioned rivers Gaula and Orkla in the south are both among the better salmon rivers in Norway, while the Namsen in north is probably a few notches above them. Any brave soul who tries to say otherwise will soon be argued down. Steady salmon stocks, good pools and good water quality are among the factors that mean owning a salmon beat in these rivers is a relatively enjoyable affair. Knowledge of the river, which reaches a new level every year, means that many are regarded as experts within an extremely limited geographical area, but often it is just that which makes the big difference. Knowing how the salmon runs, where the fly should land and how long it can flow in the water before it needs to be raised into the air and cast again is all a science that is part of the sphere of which salmon fishers are a part.\nIn the same way that a salmon fisher feels a pull on their rod, Germans in particular become dreamy-eyed at the bare mention of the islands Hitra and Frøya, at the southern end of the Trøndelag coast. “Hiitra und Froya,” they say, while imagining that their lure is already on its way down into the depths.\nEvery year thousands of Germans and other Europeans come to the coast of Trøndelag to take advantage of the first-class coastal fishing. Although they may not all admit it, there is little doubt that they have halibut at the top of their wish list every time. Just ask them and if they don’t answer ask them again. If you catch a halibut, you gain automatic membership to a sort of club. The name of the club is nothing more exciting than “we who have caught a halibut”, but the intense battle with the beast that may be up to two metres long and weigh up to 300 kg is not something you can understand simply by imagining it. It’s something that has to be experienced. For many, it is viewed as a mandatory part of entering manhood, but fortunately this is not absolute.\nFor those who don’t catch a halibut, it comes as a consolation that the Trøndelag coast is extremely rich in species. In this sense, there is considerable anticipation linked to what is coming up from the deep, although the most experienced ones know that long before the fish breaks the surface.\nAmong the many tourists who come to Trøndelag every summer to fish at sea, some believe that the Namdal coast is best, others think that the Fosen peninsula offers the best spots, while yet others swear by the islands of Hitra and Frøya. It matters little who is right. The beauty is that you can feel confident that wherever you go along the coast of Trøndelag, you will find a host who will ensure that you can experience deep-sea fishing of the highest quality with an exciting catch as part of the experience.\nThe fishing group with the most myths and secrecy associated with their activity is almost certainly the freshwater anglers, those who fish in mountain lakes, secret mountain lakes, lakes located “up there”. Let’s put it this way, if they are happy to tell you the name of the lake and how to get there, you can be extremely confident that it's not the place where the big trout are jumping. But storytelling aside, the truth is there are countless wonderful fishing lakes in Trøndelag. Among other areas, you have seven national parks and two nature reserves at your disposal, so there is no shortage of places on offer in this region, and most have wonderful lakes with stocks of fish. The river Nea, which runs between Tydal and Selbu, has a reputation for being a first-class trout river – also on a European scale – so if the fishing is more important than the nature-based experiences on the way, this is a hot tip.\nAnd as always: if you are heading into the mountains, remember the mountain code; if you are heading out to sea, remember the boat safety rules; and if you are planning to go salmon fishing from the riverbank, remember to fill your thermos with coffee before you set off.\nRight since the English \"salmon lords\" started visiting the region in the early 19th century, local rivers such as the Gaula, Orkla and Namsen have continued to attract salmon-fishers from across Europe.","Memphis in Shelby County, Tennessee — The American South (East South Central)\nNew Orleans, Louisiana\nPanel #8 Mississippi Riverwalk\nMile 95.0 AHP\nThroughout its long and colorful history, New Orleans has been both a center of commerce and Mecca for seekers of a good time. As the Mississippi’s gateway to international trade, it has become the third largest port in the world, but the city is equally renowned as the birthplace of jazz music, and the home of the annual Mardi Gras celebration.\nFounded by the French in 1718, the original New Orleans townsite has survived in the district known as French Quarters. It was the first capital of the Louisiana Territory but the low-lying area proved difficult for early settlers. Most of the city lies below sea level, and New Orleans was continually leagued with floods and swampy conditions until modern levees and pumping stations were built in the 20th Century.\nResidents at first rebelled when Spain took control in the 1760’s, but Spanish rule was a time of growth. Great fires in 1788 and 1795 nearly destroyed the city, and it was rebuilt in a distinctive style combining Spanish and French influences that are still visible in the French Quarter.\nThe first Mississippi River steamboat arrived at New Orleans in 1812, and hundreds more followed. New Orleans became the nation’s largest international port and attracted a colorful array of new3 residents. Artists established studios wealthy planters came for business and stayed for the social whirl, nightlife thrived with pleasures both legal and illicit. The prosperity and gaiety were periodically interrupted by floods, an outbreak of disease-1,000 died in 1853 Yellow Fever epidemic-but the city continued to grow.\nDespite its strategic importance on the river, New Orleans was poorly defended during the Civil War and surrendered to Union forces in 1862. Shipping was reduced, but the busy cotton smuggling business kept the port active. Recovery from post-war Reconstruction was slow, and decline of river traffic was balanced by New Orleans’ new position as a southern rail hub.\nRevival of river traffic in the 1920’s began a new era of growth for New Orleans, and the port again became the foundation of its economy. The harbor is now connected to the Gulf Intercoastal Waterway, an inland channel between Mexico and Florida, and to the Mississippi-Gulf Outlet, a straight man-made channel that shortened the distance to the Gulf of Mexico by 35 miles. The rapid development of Louisiana’s petrochemical industry in the mid-1900’s spurred new industrial development around the city, and the French Quarter continues as one of America’s most popular tourist destinations.\nPhoto Credit: (1) the Mississippi River at New Orleans by Michael Maples/USACE, (2) Royal Cafe; New Orleans French Quarter - Louisiana Office of Tourism\nErected by Mississippi Riverwalk.

{"question":"What are root cause analysis tools for investigations, and how does bar code scanning affect their implementation?","answer":"Root cause analysis tools include brainstorming, the 5 Whys, flowcharting, and fishbone diagrams, which can be used in combination to identify true root causes. However, bar code scanning implementation can create work-arounds that compromise investigation effectiveness. Studies show nurses develop alternative strategies when workflow isn't properly considered, such as scanning medications after administration or skipping scans due to damaged barcodes or missing labels, which can lead to medication errors and complicate root cause determination.","context":["OR WAIT null SECS\nSusan J. Schniepp is a fellow at Regulatory Compliance Associates, Inc. and a member of Pharmaceutical Technology's Editorial Advisory Board.\nGetting to the root of the cause can prevent future problems, says Susan Schniepp, executive vice-president of post-approval pharma and distinguished fellow, Regulatory Compliance Associates.\nQ: I am a quality professional in charge of investigations. Sometimes our company has trouble coming up with the root cause for some of our investigations. Can you provide some advice on how to effectively determine root causes for our investigations?\nA: You aren’t alone in your concerns regarding the inability to identify the root cause when performing an investigation. The regulations for the United States and the European Union require investigations to be performed when deviations occur in the manufacturing process. The ultimate goal of these investigations is to determine why something went wrong, what caused it to go wrong, and how to address the issue and prevent its recurrence. Root-cause analysis is simply a systematic problem-solving approach used for determining the cause of a deviation that occurred during processing and identifying solutions to prevent recurrence.\nThe following are a few general considerations to keep in mind while conducting investigations:\nOnce you have recorded the basics of the deviation, you can begin the root-cause analysis portion. Many tools can assist you in this process. Choosing the right root-cause analysis tool is crucial in assuring the process is effective and ensuring the true root cause has been identified. Keep in mind there is no one right tool to use for root cause analysis, and the tool you choose does not need to be complex to achieve its purpose. Some of the available tools include brainstorming, the 5 Whys, flowcharting, and fishbone diagrams. Using some or all of these tools in combination during an investigation is practical and necessary. Most investigation teams start off with the brainstorming technique. This technique is ideal for flushing out theories about the deviation but may not be ideal for compiling the data needed to prove the correct root cause has been identified. Using the 5 Whys or the fishbone diagram in conjunction with brainstorming adds assurance that you have found the true root cause and have gathered the supporting data. Root-cause analysis tools can be detrimental to the outcome of an investigation if they are improperly used, so it is important to train people in their proper use.\nThe information needed to determine the root cause for any investigation should be appropriately documented. The first piece of information to be recorded should be a thorough and precise description of the event. A timeline that discusses the process up to the time the deviation occurred should be established. Once the event and timeline are properly recorded, a number of questions should be asked and information collected to ferret out the root cause. To make sure the true root cause is identified, each investigation must address the following elements:\nWhatever tool/tools you use to identify the root cause of an issue, they need to be supported by a robust, well-documented investigation. Some of the critical elements needed to be addressed in the investigation to support the root cause include a clear, concise description of the issue that delineates what happened, when it happened in the process, and an accounting of who was involved or observed the incident. Other information that should be addressed in the investigation is a record of the immediate action that was taken to minimize or contain the situation.\nThe investigation should be broad so that all possible causes of the deviation can be captured and evaluated as the possible root cause. Avoid jumping to conclusions and investigate all possible causes so they can be properly eliminated, thus exposing the true root cause. Also, remember that there could be more than one possible root cause to a deviation. If you keep these investigational elements in mind, properly apply your root cause tools, and thoroughly document the investigation, you should have no trouble identifying the true root cause of a deviation and defending it during an inspection.\nVol. 43, No. 2\nWhen referring to this article, please cite it as S.

The “five rights” are regarded as a basic goal for safe medication administration: right patient, right medication, right time, right dose, and right route. Many errors, including lethal errors, still occur when practitioners firmly believe that they have verified the five rights before administering a medication. How can this happen? Because the “five rights” are procedural goals of medication administration practices and provide little guidance on “how” to effectively accomplish these goals.1 The “five rights” also focus on the performance of the individual practitioner and do not fully take into account the multidisciplinary efforts involved in medication administration. Poor lighting, inadequate staffing, poorly designed infusion devices, ambiguous or difficult to read medication labels, and lack of an effective double check system for high alert medications can contribute to a failure of the “five rights.”\nIn addition, the impact of human factors is not considered in the “five rights.” Confirmation bias has been noted in errors involving the selection of the wrong product. Practitioners involved in such incidents report that they are sure that they verified the product they selected, when according to human factors researchers, what they experienced was a misperception that occurs when products look too similar. According to an ISMP alert, “We ‘see’ with both our eyes and our mind. While our eyes, with proper eyesight, have the capacity to take in all information, our mind learns to screen out information that it considers less useful to prevent information overload. Additionally, as we gain experience, we develop a picture in our mind of items in our environment. Thus, as we attempt to locate or recognize items through comparison with our mind’s picture, we are often unable to see any disconfirming evidence if the wrong product is selected.”1 In 2007, ISMP reiterated their position on use of the “five rights” in another safety alert by stating that “To be clear, nurses and other practitioners cannot be held accountable for achieving the five rights; they can only be held accountable for following the processes that their organizations have designed and held out as the best way to verify the five rights.” 2 Therefore, medication administration protocols must be developed by organizations that support practitioners in achieving these goals.\nMany hospitals have implemented bar code medication administration (BCMA) as a method of decreasing medication errors. This technology creates a safety barrier between the nurse and the patient that assists the nurse in confirming the patient’s identity, as well as the name, dose, time and form of the medication being delivered. BCMA was developed to specifically decrease the following types of errors: unauthorized drug, wrong form, wrong dose, wrong route, extra dose, and omission.3 However, a false sense of security overshadows medication administration as practitioners assume that BCMA eliminates the risk of human error and will prevent all medication administration errors.\nWhile adoption of BCMA technology has increased, few studies have been conducted to establish its effects on reducing medication error rates. Helmons, Wargel and Daniels conducted a study to evaluate medication administration practices one month before and three months after BCMA implementation in two medical-surgical units and two intensive care units (ICUs) at a 386-bed academic teaching hospital in southern California.3 They discovered that implementation of BCMA resulted in improved patient identification on the medical-surgical units and improved charting and labeling of medication administration in the ICUs. There were fewer omitted medications and a decrease in the number of medications that were not available on the unit. However, total medication errors were not affected by BCMA implementation and, unfortunately, the observers determined that more distractions occurred and the nurses spent less time explaining the medication to the patient. Of note, a 52% increase in I.V. mini-bag errors occurred after BCMA implementation in the ICUs, which may suggest a false sense of security around correct I.V. mini-bag selection with use of BCMA. Most BCMA implementations do not confirm that the correct pump is used for the selected mini-bag or that the mini-bag selected matches the mini-bag it is replacing, particularly when the patient is receiving multiple mini-bag medications.\nOn average, nurses spend 25% of their time on medication-related activities.4 The potential for BCMA to prevent errors is diminished if nursing workflow is not considered in the implementation of BCMA. Several studies have highlighted work-around strategies that nurses have created to accomplish medication administration using BCMA when work-flow was not adequately considered in policy development.5 A 2010 investigation published by the Joint Commission cited the most frequent reasons why medications were not scanned prior to administration (Table 1).6\nTable 1. Most Frequent Reason Why Medications Not Scanned Prior to Administration\nNo bar code on dose\nLiquid medication in syringe\nBar code on outer box/wrapper discarded with first use (ointment, eye drops, inhalers)\nPatient’s own medication; no bar code\nBar code damaged\nBar code torn when unit dose peeled open\nBar code on ointment “crimped” with successive administrations\nBar code hard to read with the scanner\nTo avoid system default to the next scheduled dose when the current dose is being administered beyond the acceptable time frame set in the bar coding system\nPatient off nursing unit; bar code administration system not available\nPatient registration not complete; emergency medication needed\nNurses are a resilient group of professionals who will create solutions to overcome barriers to efficiently and effectively deliver care to their patients; they are often praised and take pride in their ability to do so. However, these choices sometimes lead to risky behavior. A nurse in Madison, Wisconsin inadvertently administered bupivacaine intravenously to a mother in labor, resulting in a fatal medication error.6 Upon investigation, the nurse revealed that she pulled the bag of bupivacaine while also pulling the bag of penicillin she was about to deliver in order to be prepared for the anesthesia staff when they arrived. The anesthesia department had recently complained to leadership that the nursing staff was not prepared for them when they arrived to place an epidural. This resulted in the nursing staff taking shortcuts and multi-tasking. The recognized procedure was to only remove and bring medications to the patient’s room that were intended for immediate delivery, but it had now become common practice for the nursing staff to also bring the bupivacaine to the room prior to the anesthesia staff’s arrival. Because of multiple problems with the implementation of BCMA, it had also become routine practice for the nursing staff to scan medications after they were delivered in order to prevent delays in administration. Therefore, the bag of bupivacaine was not scanned prior to delivery. If it had been, the error might have been identified.\nBCMA technology has been shown to be a cost-effective intervention and is recommended for safe medication practices, but is only effective at reducing medication administration errors when it is implemented to support nursing workflow in achieving the “five rights”. Barriers to the use of established protocols for safe medication administration should be recognized and addressed in order to prevent workarounds and risky staff behaviors.\nThe “Five Rights”.

{"question":"How far did scientists achieve quantum teleportation through fiber optic cable?","answer":"Scientists at the National Institute of Standards and Technology achieved quantum teleportation by transferring data from one photon to another through a 60-mile fiber optic cable. This was accomplished using four high-detection-efficiency superconducting detectors that were nanometers wide.","context":["A recent demonstration from scientists at the National Institute of Standards and Technology suggests that we may be one step closer to developing quantum teleportation.\nPhysicists have just shattered a new record in the quest to develop quantum teleportation this week by transferring data from one photon to another through a 60-mile fiber optic cable. According to a report from CS Monitor, researchers from the National Institute of Standards and Technology have demonstrated a new design that allows photon detectors to take accurate measurements of even the weakest signals.\nThe report explains that quantum teleportation over fiber optic cables was possible with the use of four high-detection-efficiency superconducting detectors that were just nanometers wide. These SNSPDs allow “highly efficient multifold photon measurements,” which confirm that the quantum states of the original protons were transmitted successfully to the receiving end.\nSubatomic particles behave differently than most observable matter in the universe. The rules of physics fail to apply to photons and other quantum particles as physicists study them. They can become ‘entangled’ with each other, and outside forces have an effect on both as if they were one, regardless of the distance that separates them. This property allowed physicists at the National Institute of Standards and Technology to transfer the quantum state of one particle to a remote location.\nThere still may be a ways to go before we can teleport people instead of just photons. The study can offer new insights into the field of quantum encryption, which could lead to information that is impossible to hack by ordinary means. Over the past twenty years, the information security field has increasingly looked toward the quantum properties of light and matter to increase the speed and distance over which secure information can travel. At this point, engineers have figured out how to transfer a message via a key that unlocks secured information, but not yet an entire message.\nQuantum properties refer to the German scientist Heisenberg’s “uncertainty principle.” It states that if you measure one thing, it is impossible to measure another thing accurately. What does this mean? For example, the position of an electron orbiting an atom cannot be measured at the same time you’re measuring its velocity. If you measure its speed, you are unable to tell exactly where it is at that moment.\nThe uncertainty principle is interesting because it only becomes true when you’re trying to measure something. If you were unable to measure someone’s height and weight at the same time, both would exist in an intermediate state. Luckily, these properties don’t necessarily apply to people like they do to quantum particles.\nPhotons are the easiest particles to observe these properties in. They travel in a wave like formation and are polarized, which means they are constantly tilted in a specific direction.\nQuantum properties are believed to be constant throughout all of time and space. Even if two photons are millions of light-years away at a given instance, the polarity of one photon affects the other. If you could place two observers watching the photon pair at each end of the distance between the particles, a switch in polarity on one end to vertical would result in a shift to a horizontal polarity on the part of the other photon.\nEinstein was famously quoted, “God does not play dice with the universe.” Quantum mechanics were difficult to comprehend, and still are for the most part. Star Trek was famous for citing quantum mechanics as the secret to teleporting across the universe.\nEven half a century after their discovery, quantum mechanics continue to baffle scientists. While the recent NIST demonstration proves that it is possible to alter the state of a photon in a deliberate and calculated fashion, recent developments could very soon lead to increased security for communications."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"english_native_fluent"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:0684809e-5abd-4b6f-b86e-7487fd49ebf1>"],"error":null}

It is a tightly wound work where the four movements proceed without decisive breaks - the second and third movements emerge attacca from what preceded them, while the third movement and finale are completely fused. In contrast, Thompson's Symphony No. 2 follows a more traditional four-movement structure described as 'lithe' and 'well-judged in length,' with clear separations between movements.","context":["Here are recordings of three tonal and melodic American symphonies.You are\ndestined to make life-log friends with them.\nROY HARRIS SYMPHONY NO 3.\nI have been a keen supporter of Roy Harriss music ever since I heard\nthe RCA Victrola LP of the Boston SO/Koussevitsky account of No. 3. Wasnt\nit coupled with some Sibelius: Pohjolas Daughter? All very apt as this\nsymphony, with its single movement, has obvious Sibelian references (Symphony\nNo 7) without being totally in thrall. Harris adds his own brand of intensity\nand emotional concentration usually concentrated on the longest singing lines\non the strings but also distinguished by stormy monumental brass. Listen\nout also for the yearning flute at 5:25 leading into a great chorale and\nthe same instruments arabesquing leaf-fall at 7:00.\nHarris builds a delicious tension at 7:24 onwards with lightly undulating\nSibelian rustlings and a magical vibraphone note resonating three times (8:00).\nThe twists and turns of a typical Harris melody (established long before\nthis symphony - try the first symphony 1933 and see what I mean) are\nirresistible. At 10:20 we get a resolute striking of attitudes soon to develop\ninto an exciting Waltonian brass and drum dance echoing down eternity (12:50).\nThe antiphonal effects pervading the heights and depths of the orchestra\nregister wonderfully in the refurbished 20 bit sound (13:23). The sense of\ntragic homecoming is tangible in the closing minutes.\nThere are few better performances than Bernsteins though sad to say\nI have never heard Matas nor Ormandys. This collection, anyway,\nis special. I hope that if you do not know this piece and you like Sibelius,\nJanaceks Sinfonietta or Szymanowski you will want to hear this symphony.\nHow sad that Bernstein did not record the other symphonies.\nRANDALL THOMPSON wrote three dynamic symphonies but he is better known\nfor his choral music. This SYMPHONY NUMBER TWO (four movements) is\nperfection. It is lithe, well-judged in length, poetic (especially in the\nsecond movement), exciting and rich in antiphonal dialogue. The third movement\nbubbles, capers and jumps: a feverish cauldron. There is then a substantial\ncentral pastoral interlude with much Sibelian birdsong for cor anglais, oboe\nand flute. It even swoons like Bax and perhaps Delius.\nThe finale opens with a feeling of decisive steadily paced resolution and\ngradually accelerates the confident march into a Waltonian complex of colliding\ntides and recollections of the first movement's themes. At 2:40 we get a\nhint of exhilarating syncopation (which always makes me think of Waltons\nSinfonia Concertante). This slips with inevitability into a determined\nTchaikovskian finale: perky, joyous, irrepressible, cheeky. There is nothing\ndense or less than pellucid about this work - a gem and in a recording and\nrealisation worthy of the work.\nThe Thompson is lighter than Harris 3 but not at all flippant or inconsequential.\nThe best way of thinking about it is as a midway point between Prokofievs\nClassical Symphony (in its poise and balance) and the scampering and dark-toned\nenergy of the British composer E J Moeran. There is a good collection of\nall three Thompson symphonies on Koch International but the performance of\nNo 2 though c../graphics/reditable, and with quite a jolt to it, does not\nequal the Bernstein. Just listen to his yieldingly responsive control of\ntempo towards the end of the finale from 7:10 onwards!\nDAVID DIAMONDS FOURTH SYMPHONY opens in grand impressionistic,\nsurging romantic melos - all swirling banks of mist. This is quite Sibelian\nand also surprisingly like Rubbra (Symphonies 3 and 4 and piano concerto)\nsometimes. The colours are touched in with highlights from the solo piano.\nThe theme resolves into a spider-web gossamer march. Roy Harris puts in an\nappearance once or twice. This first movement is extraordinarily\nattractive. The second of the three movements kicks in with solo piano wrestling\nwith starkly high harsh trumpets but this relaxes into an at first reverent\nand then increasingly passionate string dream which caught me thinking of\nFinzis New Year Music or In Terra Pax.\nThe last movement is busily headlong but despite (or because of) the attractions\nof the two preceding movements this does not quite meet the symphonic\nchallenge. This is the oldest of the four recordings.\nIt comes as a jolt to realise that this recording was made forty years ago.\nThere is a hint of hard glare in the strings and the more strident brass.\nI have the Delos recording which is excellent technically but it does not\nhave Bernsteins heavenly responsiveness to the music. There are some\nloveable Tippett-like touches and a Rubbra is not lost sight of. The off-beat\ncross the bars brass chord punctuation works wonderfully with long woodwind\nlines from 6:00 onwards but it does not end convincingly; it simply ends.\nNevertheless some memorable music here.\nI know these recordings of the Thompson and Diamond quite well. In the early\n1980s BBC Radio 3 broadcast a series of rare recordings celebrating the American\nsymphony.

Adolphe explains:\nDiesen Kuss der ganzen Welt! (This Kiss to the Whole World) is a famous line from the “Ode to Joy” by Friedrich Schiller, the text set by Beethoven in his Ninth Symphony. As this work was commissioned specifically to be on the same program with the Ninth, I chose this quote to be both the title and the message: that all humankind is together in this world, we are all related, and we should celebrate our humanity with love and joy. In addition to the title, there are several musical connections to Beethoven’s Ninth in this work: the opening tremolo in the violins; the use of recitative-like phrases in the cellos; the shapes of some melodic fragments; the presence of timpani solos.\nSAINT-SAËNS: Piano Concerto No. 2 in G minor, Op. 22\nPiano Concerto No. 2 in G minor, Op. 22 (1868)\nCAMILLE SAINT-SAËNS (1835-1921)\nCamille Saint-Saëns’s five concertos for piano span 40 years of his long career. He composed the Second at the behest of Anton Rubinstein, who in 1868 appeared in Paris as piano soloist in a series of concerto performances that Saint-Saëns conducted. Near the end of his stay, Rubinstein expressed regret that he hadn’t managed to work in an engagement as a conductor. Saint-Saëns immediately booked the Salle Pleyel for three weeks hence and quickly wrote this concerto, which he then performed with Rubinstein conducting.\nA critical bon mot maintains that this concerto “begins like Bach and ends like Offenbach,” which is witty and half true. The opening resembles the sort of organ preluding found in reams of Baroque keyboard works, including those of Bach. Saint-Saëns claimed that the opening solo derived from an improvisation that had come to him while playing the organ. By the time Saint-Saëns wrote this concerto, Franz Liszt (whom he admired) had made a splash with his own solo-piano transcriptions of Bach organ music. The concerto’s opening is in that mold, and it may be that Saint-Saëns was as much inspired by Bach-Liszt as by “pure Bach.” Following the solo prelude, the piece moves on to the main body of the movement, the principal theme of which Saint-Saëns actually borrowed from his pupil Gabriel Fauré, who had written it—and rejected it—for a motet he was working on. The idea that the finale resembles Offenbach is more questionable. It is a glittering tarantella, though not one that specifically relates to Offenbach’s operettas. In any case, the most famous part of this concerto is its middle movement, ostensibly a tossed-off intermezzo but in fact a memorable scherzo in which sections of gossamer lightness surround a central expanse with a galumphing bass line and an unforgettable melody.\nSCHUMANN: Symphony No. 4 in D minor, Op. 120\nSymphony No. 4 in D minor, Op. 120 (1841, rev. 1851)\nROBERT SCHUMANN (1810-56)\nRobert Schumann was prolific during 1841, the year in which he first devoted himself to symphonic music. He worked on his D-minor Symphony furiously through the summer and finished it on September 9, in time to offer it to his wife, Clara, as a birthday present on September 13, the day after their first anniversary. “One thing makes me happy,” he inscribed in their joint diary, “the consciousness of being still far from my goal, of being obliged to keep doing better, and with this the feeling that I have the strength to reach it.”\nThe symphony meeting with no success at its premiere that December, Schumann laid it aside, authorized no further performances, and withheld it from publication. Nearly a decade later, he reworked the piece, thickening his orchestration into his dense signature sound. In 1853, he inscribed a private dedication of the work to his young violinist-friend Joseph Joachim, who conducted the symphony in Hanover in January 1854. By that time Schumann’s best days were over. That February, he threw himself into the Rhine in a failed suicide attempt, and on March 4 he committed himself to the asylum where he would spend his remaining two-and-a-half years wavering between semi-productive sanity and hopeless dementia. The D-minor Symphony therefore covers Schumann’s career as a symphonist nearly from its beginning to its end.\nThis is a tightly wound work, intense in emotion and compact in structure. Its four movements proceed without decisive breaks; the second and third movements emerge attacca from what preceded them, while the third movement and the finale are fused into a completely unseparated span. Although the divisions between sections are softened, the work adheres to the standard symphonic structure of four movements: Lively, Romance, Scherzo (Lively), and Lively again. Liveliness obviously describes the work’s overriding spirit.\nFabio Luisi (conductor) is a maestro of major international standing.\nAlessio Bax won First Prize at both the Leeds and Hamamatsu International Piano Competitions, and is now a familiar face on five continents as a recitalist, chamber musician, and concerto soloist.\nFabio Luisi (conductor) is a maestro of major international standing.

{"question":"Which prestigious music institutions did Ben Rosenblum and Fernando Garcia attend for their advanced musical education?","answer":"Fernando Garcia attended the Inter-American University of Puerto Rico for his bachelor's degree in Música Popular, then received the Juan Luis Guerra Scholarship to complete a master's degree at Berklee College of Music in Valencia, Spain, and later earned a second master's in Music Education at Teachers College Columbia University. Ben Rosenblum graduated from the Columbia-Juilliard program and studied with influential jazz pianists including Frank Kimbrough, Bruce Barth, Ben Waltzer and Roy Assaf.","context":["In 2018 the drummer, percussionist, composer, educator Fernando Garcia’s Guasabara Puerto Rico (Zoho) showcased his modern vision and flair for combining Puerto Rican folklore with jazz music and other elements.\nLast April, amid the pandemic, Garcia composed a tune whose tumbao, cadence and lyrics magically lifted his spirits. “The primary rhythm is Bomba Holandes, which shares rhythmic similarities with Plena. I wrote the bass line first and let it flow without realizing it was in 13 (meters). The vibe was so joyful and uplifting; the only name I could come up with is Alegria (Joy).”\nAs the lyrics clearly and joyously state:\nAlegria Te Traigo Pa’ Que Te Olvidas Las Pena\nI Bring You Joy, Forget Your Sorrows.\nBomba Con Cadencia Por Que La Cosa Esta Buena!\nBomba with Swing, the Rhythm is Good!\nBomba con Swing\nBomba with Swing\nBomba en Trese, Que Locura!\nBomba in 13, What Madness!\nGarcia became interested in Bomba when he was a student at the Inter-American University in Cupey (PR) and researched the genre. His friend, the percussionist Oscar Carrasco, suggested he study with Bomba musicians in Loiza, a region known for upholding Afro-Puerto Rican culture. “Also, I hung out with the Bombero, percussionist, dancer, Rafael Maya (leader of the group, Desde Cero), who taught me a lot about Bomba. I started to realize the richness of the rhythms, variations, and songs. So, all that led me to a way of fusing our own Puerto Rican and African roots with contemporary jazz.”\nThe video showcases the band’s prowess and Garcia’s vision. It also gives listeners and viewers an indication of how Puerto Rican music is evolving. “In terms of the music, Bomba culture and players tend to be conservative,” says Garcia. “I’m taking Bomba’s elements and expanding on them with, among other things, odd meters and modal harmonies. Occasionally, I will take a folkloric tune and mess with the chords a little, but mostly, it’s traditional.”\nThe band members include bassist, Dan Martínez, percussionist Victor Pablo, Guitarist Gabriel Vicéns, Pianist Gabriel Chakarji, Saxophonist Jan Kus, and the Vocalist, Claudia Tebar. Alegria is available on all digital platforms.\nI’m happy to report, after a long COVID-related hiatus, Fernando and his Band will perform Friday, August 28, 2020, at 8 PM at Terraza 7’s Outdoor Concert Series. For information visit: http://terraza7.com/events/ https://youtu.be/2ydWNgCJZrQ\nABOUT FERNANDO GARCIA\nBorn in San Juan and raised in Guaynabo, Puerto Rico, García studied guitar at the extension program of the Conservatory of Music of Puerto Rico and drumset at Micheo Music Academy (Santurce), while later receiving a bachelor’s degree in Música Popular from the Inter-American University of Puerto Rico (Graduating in May 2011). Furthermore, he was awarded the Juan Luis Guerra Scholarship to complete a master’s degree in Contemporary Performance at Berklee College of Music, Valencia, Spain (Graduating in July 2013). In May 2018, García completed a second master’s degree in Music Education at the prestigious Teachers College Columbia University.\nIn New York City, he has established himself as a drummer, percussionist, composer, and educator. Throughout his career, he has worked equally as a bandleader as well as a sideman. Some of the musicians García has toured and/or recorded with include Abraham Laboriel, Perico Sambeat, Ricardo Pons, Héctor Matos, Pepe Rivero, Alain Pérez, Guillermo Klein, Julio Montalvo, Victor Mendoza, John Benitez, Ximo Tébar, Nathaniel Townsley, Jim Ridl, Boris Koslov, and Miguel Zenón among others. As a bandleader, García has produced three studio recordings: Desde Arriba (Fernando García Music, 2012), Subidor (Montalvo Records, 2013), and Guásabara Puerto Rico (ZOHO Music, 2018).\nRECOMMENDED LISTENINGFernando Garcia – Guasabara Puerto Rico (Zoho, 2018)\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED","dlj entertainment family\nWorld-Renowned Drummer| Composer | Arranger | Recording Artist\nDrummer WINARD HARPER is passionate about jazz. “This music is powerful,” he says. “It can do a lot of good for people. If they’d spend some time each day listening to it, we would see many changes in the world.”\nInspired by the musicianship of greats such as Clifford Brown, Max Roach, Jackie McLean, Cannonball Adderley, Dr. Billy Taylor, Art Blakey and Billy Higgins, Harper has been the leader and musical inspiration for a vibrant sextet for almost a decade. The group appears regularly all over the United States from the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. to Yoshi’s, the legendary West Coast jazz club. Although clearly the dominant force behind this extraordinarily gifted ensemble, Harper has surrounded himself with superbly talented young guardians of the jazz tradition (including Lawrence Clark, Ameen Saleem, Josh Evans, Stacy Dillard and Alioune Faye), who are as entertaining to watch as they are to listen to.\nBorn in Baltimore in 1962, Winard had a natural affinity for drumming. He was encouraged to play the drums by his father, who noticed him beating on cans when he was three or four years old. At the age of five, Winard was developing his skills and making guest appearances with his older brother Danny’s nightclub band. A turning point was reached when Winard heard a recording of Clifford Brown and Max Roach. It was then that he was irreversibly inspired to play jazz. “I was fascinated hearing Max do the things he did playing with mallets and everything,” he remembers.\n“Early on,” Harper continues, “I transcribed a couple of Max solos, but I really just loved listening to him. He was a big influence as well as Art Blakey, and more so than anybody, Billy Higgins. The joy and the passion and his love of playing really made an impact on me. I could see similarities between myself and him, and then we became such great friends. A lot of the concept of my band was inspired by Billy. A lot of the African influences and different instruments I use in the band, Billy was always exploring as well.”\nConstantly in reverence of his predecessors while remaining innovative in his own right, Harper has become one of the most celebrated drummers in jazz. He is a virtuoso on the drum set as well as the balafon, the West African equivalent of the marimba. Critics have written that Winard is as pleasing and entertaining to watch as he is to hear. “As tasteful a drummer as one could ask for,” according to Jeff Kaliss of JazzTimes. Franz Matzner recently wrote in All About Jazz that the sextet’s performance “culminated in an evening of fireworks with a sustained display of percussive pyrotechnics by Harper so rapid fire, so mind bogglingly dexterous, and so expressively diverse, as to be truly awe-inspiring.” And in a Washington Post review, Mike Joyce said, “Winard Harper’s wonderfully orchestrated solos alone might have forced a corpse to grin!”\nHarper’s first major gig was with Dexter Gordon in 1982, and shortly thereafter with Johnny Griffin. It wasn’t long before his drumming skills captured the attention of Betty Carter. He spent four years working with Ms. Carter’s band, inevitably honing his jazz-as-entertainment sense of showmanship.\n“With Betty I learned consistency and persistence,” Harper recalls. “Working with her prepared me to become a bandleader; I learned a lot about the business from her. When I left Betty’s band, I came out with enough information to get the Harper Brothers on the way. She gave me the inside track on bookings, clubs, most of the places we worked were the same places I worked with her.”\nDuring the 1980s while Winard worked as a sideman to such jazz legends as Ray Bryant, Abdullah Ibrahim, Pharoah Sanders and Clifford Jordan, he also laid the foundation for what would become The Harper Brothers band. He and his brother Philip launched a band that would blaze a brilliant trail both on the charts and on the international touring circuit.\n“Man for man, The Harper Brothers Quintet … is the most brilliant new jazz group of the new decade,” declared Leonard Feather in his review of the band’s Los Angeles performance in early 1990. Remembrance, the band’s second album went to #1 on Billboard’s jazz chart in 1991.\nPiadrum recording artist Winard Harper is one of the hardest working drummers in jazz today, not only leading his very exciting and hard-swinging sextet, but also continuing as an in-demand sideman. When not touring with his band, Harper continues to work and record with such artists such as Joe Lovano, Avery Sharpe, Steve Turre, Wycliffe Gordon, Frank Wess, Ray Bryant, and Jimmy Heath. His newest CD, Make It Happen, goes further than any of his previous six releases to highlight his talent as drummer, composer and bandleader.\nAnd now the Winard Harper Sextet moves to a new level of success. Not only is the band gaining increased air play around the globe, they regularly appear in festivals, on jazz cruises, in concert halls and in top jazz clubs, the Winard Harper Sextet is doing their part to bring the power of jazz to audiences everywhere. The response has been nothing short of remarkable. But then again, so is Winard Harper.\nPianist | Composer | Arranger | Recording Artist\nAward-winning jazz pianist, composer and accordionist Ben Rosenblum has been described as “mature beyond his years,” (Jon Neudorf, Sea of Tranquility), and as an “impressive talent” (C. Michael Bailey, All About Jazz), who “caresses [the music] with the reverence it merits” (Bob Doerschuk, Downbeat Magazine). Ben is based primarily in New York City, and is a graduate of the Columbia-Juilliard program (in 2016). His original music combines his extensive knowledge of the history of jazz with a free-wheeling, modern melodic sensibility and powerful narrative approach to the piano. His profound passion for jazz, swing and world music genres finds expression in his unique fusion of harmonic and rhythmic elements from a wide array of sources, and gives rise to a signature compositional sound and style at once iconoclastic and deeply rooted in such figures as Bill Evans and Wynton Kelly. Ben’s first priority in his composition and in his playing is always narrative – to tell a compelling story with his music, while reaching the hearts of his audience, connecting on an emotional, an intellectual and a spiritual level.\nReviewers of his debut album Instead – released in 2017 with bassist Curtis Lundy and drummer Billy Hart – have been impressed by his musicality and his tasteful playing in light of his immense technical skill. Bob Doerschuk of Downbeat Magazine gave the album four stars, and wrote, “He has the chops to shoot off a few fireworks, … but that doesn’t seem to be a priority when covering sacred material.” C. Michael Bailey notes approvingly: “there do emerge conservatoire aces with grit in their imagination and a facility to express such in their playing. Ben Rosenblum is one such performer/composer. The Julliard-Columbia trained pianist brings a freighter of technique to the keyboard, while still maintaining enough earthiness in his playing to satisfy even the fussiest listener.” Fred Stal of RG Magazine most recently described his experience of listening to Ben’s live CD release performance: “The music keeps you on your feet and not wanting to miss a single moment of magic. … Raindrops from heaven poured down with style and grace from Rosenblum’s piano.”\nBorn and raised in New York City, Ben had the opportunity to study with some of the most influential figures in jazz piano, including Frank Kimbrough, Bruce Barth, Ben Waltzer and Roy Assaf. At the early age of sixteen, the originality of his work was already being recognized with numerous awards, including the ASCAP Young Jazz Composers Award (2010), the Downbeat Student Music Award for Best Original Song (2010) and the Downbeat Student Music Award for Best Arrangement (2011). As a result, even before entering Columbia, Ben was commissioned by the XIBUS World Orchestra to write a piece for performance at New England Conservatory’s Jordan Hall in 2012. Ben has continued to earn numerous distinctions and honors in recent years. In 2015, he was a finalist at the American Jazz Pianist Competition in Melbourne, Florida, and in 2016, at the Jacksonville Jazz Piano Competition in Jacksonville, Florida.\nIn addition to his own work, Ben often collaborates with other musicians. He has worked extensively with Grammy-nominated singer Ryland Angel on several compositional projects, including the project Unspoken, which premiered at the Weisman Art Museum in Minneapolis, in November of 2016. His debut album Insteadhas received very favorable reviews from a wide range of sources throughout the world, including Downbeat Magazine, All About Jazz, Drumset Magazine (Italy) and The Jazz Writer (Germany).\nBen performed with the Bachiana Brasileira Orchestra at Lincoln Center (conducted by Joao Carlos Martins and featuring Dave Brubeck), and he was a featured soloist at Carnegie Hall’s Stern Auditorium with the New York Harmonic Band (conducted by Reona Ito). He traveled to New Delhi, India, to perform at a Max India Benefit, and was a participant at Il Grande Veggio, in Perugia, Italy. He has played at the Masten Jazz Festival (Buffalo), the Richmond Jazz Festival (Richmond), the Mid-Atlantic Jazz Festival (Maryland), Lincoln Center Out of Doors Festival (Manhattan), the DUMBO Arts Festival (Brooklyn), Musikfest (Bethlehem, PA) and the Music Mountain Festival (Connecticut). He has also appeared at Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola, the Appel Room at Lincoln Center, Ryles Jazz Club, Webster Hall, Symphony Space, The Blue Note, Mezzrow, Smalls and a host of other music venues throughout the northeast.\nBen has worked extensively with such jazz luminaries as Curtis Lundy, Neal Smith, Winard Harper, Wayne Escoffery and Deborah Davis, and he has performed in bands led by Bobby Watson, TS Monk, Chris Washburne and Warren Wolf. In addition, he has shared the stage with many other jazz legends, including Wycliffe Gordon, Brian Lynch, Phil Woods, Houston Person, Jerry Dodgion, Eliot Zigmund, Clarence Penn, Craig Handy, Dave Stryker, James Cammack, Ameen Saleem, Bob Nieske, Steve Nelson, Yasushi Nakamura, Essiet Essiet, Willie Williams, Patience Higgins, Josh Evans, Kenny Davis and Rogerio Boccato.\nWhile at Columbia University, Ben founded the Columbia Jazz House, a student-run jazz advocacy group that promotes jazz on campus through concerts, educational workshops and jam sessions. On December 28th, 2015, the Columbia Jazz House was featured in a New York Times article titled “Melodies Night and Day in this Columbia Dorm.”\nSaxophonist | Clarinetist | Flutist | Composer | Arranger | Recording Artist\nNew Jersey native, James E.

{"question":"How do the Iranian calendar and the tropical year compare in terms of their accuracy in tracking the Earth's orbit around the Sun?","answer":"The Iranian calendar and tropical year both aim to track Earth's orbit but have different approaches. The Iranian calendar is observation-based, beginning each year precisely at the vernal equinox as determined by astronomical observations from Tehran, making it more accurate than other calendars like the Gregorian. The tropical year, which measures Earth's complete orbit around the Sun, is approximately 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes, and 45 seconds long, though it can vary by up to 30 minutes each year. While the Iranian calendar adjusts through direct astronomical observation, the tropical year serves as a standard measurement of Earth's orbital period.","context":["|This page uses content from the English Wikipedia.

See Wikia:Licensing.|\nThe Iranian calendar (گاهشماری هجری خورشيدى) also known as Persian calendar or the Jalāli Calendar is a solar calendar currently used in Iran and Afghanistan. It is observation-based, rather than rule-based, beginning each year on the vernal equinox as precisely determined by astronomical observations from Tehran (or the 52.5°E meridian) and Kabul. This makes it more accurate than Gregorian calendar, but harder to work out which years are leap years.\nBackground[edit | edit source]\nPersians have been keen on the idea and importance of having a calendar system throughout their recorded history. They were among the first cultures to employ a solar calendar, and have long favored a solar approach rather than lunar or lunisolar models. In general, the sun has always had an important symbolic significance in the Iranian culture.\nAfter a first try by the second Persian parliament on February 21, 1911 which mandated the use of the solar years and months for official governmental use, the present Iranian calendar was legally adopted by the Persian parliament on March 31, 1925, specifying the origin on the calendar (Hegira of Muhammad from Mecca to Medina in 622 CE), mentioning that the beginning of the year is the first day of spring, that the year is the \"true solar\" year \"as it has been\" (کماکان), and specifying the month names and the number of days in each month. The law goes further and officially deprecates the 12 year cycles of the Chinese-Uighur calendar which were unofficially but commonly used.\nAfghanistan legally adopted the new Iranian calendar in 1957, using the same number of days in each month but different month names. In Afghan Persian (also known as Dari), the Arabic language names of the zodiac signs for the months are used instead of the names adopted in Iran in 1925. (These zodiac names were also used in Iran before 1925.) In Afghan Pashto, native Pashto names of the zodiac signs are used.\nHistory of calendars in Persia[edit | edit source]\nThe first calendars based on Zoroastrian cosmology appeared during the later Achaemenian period (650 to 330 BCE) and though they have evolved and changed over the centuries, the names of the months have remained more or less the same till now. Before this period, old Persian inscriptions and tablets indicate that early Iranians used a 360-day calendar based on the Babylonian system modified according to their own beliefs, and their own named days. Months were divided into two or three divisions depending on the phase of the moon. Twelve months were named for various festivals or activities of the pastoral year with 30 days in each month. A thirteenth month every six years was added to keep the 360-day calendar in harmony with the seasons.\nUnder the unified empire of the Achaemenians it was necessary to create a distinctive Iranian calendar, and one was devised based on the Egyptian tradition, with twelve months of thirty days, each dedicated to a yazata (Eyzad), and with four divisions resembling the Semitic week. Four of the days in the month were dedicated to Ahura Mazda and seven days were named after the six Amesha Spentas. Thirteen days were named after Fire, the Waters, Sun, Moon, Tiri and Geush Urvan (the soul of all animals), Mithra, Sraosha (Soroush, yazata of prayer), Rashnu (the Judge), Fravashi, Bahram (yazata of victory), Raman (Ramesh meaning peace), and Vata, the divinity of the wind. Three were dedicated to the female divinities, Daena (yazata of religion and personified conscious), Ashi (yazata of fortune) and Arshtat (justice). The remaining four were dedicated to Asman (lord of sky or Heaven), Zam (earth), Manthra Spenta (the Bounteous Sacred Word) and Anaghra Raocha (the 'Endless Light' of paradise).\nThe calendar had a significant impact on religious observations. Not only did it fix the pantheon of major divinities, but ensured that their names were continually uttered, since at every Zoroastrian act of worship the yazatas of both day and month were invoked. With the new system, the pattern of festivities became clear as well. For example, Mitrakanna or Mehregan was celebrated on Mithra day of Mithra month, and the Tiri festival (Tiragan) was celebrated on Tiri day of the Tiri month.\nAfter the conquests of Alexander the Great and his subsequent death, the Persian territories fell to one of his generals Seleucus (312 BCE) and the Seleucid dynasty of Iran was formed. Based on the Greek tradition, they introduced the practice of dating by era rather than dating by the reign of the individual kings. Their era became known as that of Alexander, or later the Seleucid era. The Zoroastrian priests, having lost their function at the royal courts since the new rulers were not Zoroastrians, resented the Seleucids. Although they followed the new trend of dating by eras, they established their own era of Zoroaster.\nThis marked the first serious attempt to determine the dates associated with the prophet Zoroaster's life. With no Zoroastrian historical sources they turned to Babylonian archives famous throughout the ancient world. From these records they learned that a great event in Persian history took place 228 years before the era of Alexander. The date was 539 BCE, which was in fact the conquest of Babylon by Cyrus the Great. The Zoroastrian priests, however, misinterpreted this date to be the time the \"true faith\" was revealed to their prophet, and since Avestan literature indicates that revelation happened when Zoroaster was thirty years old, 568 BCE was taken as his year of birth. The date entered written records as the beginning of the era of Zoroaster, and indeed, the Persian Empire. This incorrect date is still mentioned in many current encyclopedias as Zoroaster’s birth date.\nThe Parthians (Arsacid dynasty) adopted the same calendar system with minor modifications, and dated their era from 248 BCE, the date they succeeded the Seleucids. Their names for the months and days are Parthian equivalents of the Avestan ones used previously, differing slightly from the Middle Persian names used by the Sassanians. For example in Achaemenian times the modern Persian month ‘Day’ was called Dadvah (Creator), in Parthian it was Datush and the Sassanians named it Dadv/Dai (Dadar in Pahlavi).\nThe next major calendar change happened during the reign of Ardashir I the founder of the Sassanid dynasty in 224 CE. In 46 BCE, Julius Caesar adopted the Egyptian solar calendar system of 365 days with some modifications. Iranians had known about the Egyptian system for centuries but never used it. Ardashir, however, changed the length of the calendar year to 365 days by adding five extra days at the end, and named these ‘Gatha’ or ‘Gah’ days, after the ancient Zoroastrian hymns of the same name. The new system created confusion and was met with resistance, and many Zoroastrian feasts and celebrations have two dates, to this day. Many rites were practiced over many days instead of one day and duplication of observances was continued to make sure no holy days were missed.\nThe situation became so complicated that another calendar reform had to be implemented by Ardeshir’s grandson Hormizd I. The new and old holy days were linked together to form continual six-day feasts. No Ruz was an exception as the first and the sixth day of the month were celebrated separately, with the sixth becoming more significant as Zoroasters’ birthday rather than a continuation of No Ruz itself. The reform however did not solve all the problems, and Yazdgerd III, the last ruler, introduced the final changes. The year 631 CE was chosen as the beginning of a new era, and this last imperial Persian calendar is known as the Yazdgerdi calendar. However, before work on the new calendar was completed, Muslim Arabs overthrew the dynasty in the 7th century and with their victory, a new lunar calendar based on Islamic principles replaced the old solar calendar of the Sassanid period.\nThe Islamic calendar was outlined in the prophet Muhammad's revelation, the Qu'ran, and in his last sermon during his farewell pilgrimage to Mecca. It was the same as the old pagan Meccan calendar except that the intercalary month was eliminated, effective at the end of AH 10 (March 632 CE). Umar, the second caliph, began numbering its years in AH 17 (638 CE), regarding its first year as the year during which Muhammad's Hijra (emmigration) from Mecca to Medina occurred, in September 622 CE. The first day of the year was not changed—it continued to be the first day of Muharram. Years of the Islamic calendar are designated AH from the Latin Anno Hegirae (in the year of the Hijra).\nThe Iranian calendar was revised in the 11th century by a panel of scientists, allegedly including Omar Khayyám. The recalibration was completed during the reign of Jalaal ad-Din Malik Shah Seljuki, one of the Seljuk sultans, and named in his honor.\nThe Islamic lunar calendar was widely used till the end of the 19th century. During the early Pahlavi era in 1925, the lunar calendar was officially replaced by the modern Iranian calendar. The act of 1925 mentioned that \"the true solar year\" should be used for computing the first day of the year, and also fixed the number of days in each month (which was previously different in each year, corresponding with the tropical zodiac). It also revived the ancient Persian names, which are still in use today.\nDetails[edit | edit source]\nThe Iranian calendar year begins on the midnight between the two consecutive solar noons which include the instant of the Northern spring equinox, when the sun enters the northern hemisphere; in other words, the start of Spring in the northern hemisphere. The calendar consists of twelve months with Persian names. The first six months are 31 days each, the next five 30 days, and the last month has 29 days but 30 days in leap years. The reason the first six months have 31 days and the rest 30 was not a random decision by the designers – it has to do with the fact that the sun moves slightly more slowly along ecliptic in the northern spring and summer than in the northern autumn and winter. It should also be noted that before the adaptation of the modern Persian calendar in 1925 (1304 AP), the length of the months were different each year, and a month could also consist of 32 days. For example, the length of the Persian months in the year 1303 AP were respectively 30, 31, 32, 31, 32, 30, 31, 30, 29, 30, 29, and 30 days, while the length of the months in 1302 AP were 30, 31, 32, 31, 31, 31, 31, 29, 30, 29, 30, and 30 days.\nIn other words, the Persian new year is determined by noon-time observation of the Northern spring equinox. If between two consecutive noons the sun's altitude rises through its equinoctial altitude then the first noon is on the last day of one calendar year and the second noon is on the first day (Norouz) of the next calendar year.\nTypically leap years are devised and used by various solar calendar systems, usually every four years. Four-year leap years add 0.25 day to each year in the period, but that is a slight overcompensation compared to the actual behaviour of the sun. To remedy this overcompensation, after about every seven four-year leap year intervals, the Persian solar calendar produces a five-year leap year interval. It usually follows a thirty-three year cycle with occasional interruptions by single twenty-nine year or thirty-seven year subcycles.\nThis general picture of the Persian calendar's leap-year behaviour contrasts with less accurate predictive algorithms which are based on confusion between the astronomers average tropical year (365.2422 days, approximated with near 128-year cycles or 2820-year great cycles) and the mean interval between spring equinoxes (365.2424 days, approximated with a near 33-year cycle).\nMonth Names[edit | edit source]\n|Order||Days||Persian name||Kurdish name||Afghan name\n(Arabic translation of Zodiac signs)\n|Afghan Pashto name|\n|4||31||Tir||تیر||Poshper||پووش په ر||Saratan||سرطان||tʃungaʂ||چنګاښ|\n|7||30||Mehr||مهر||Rezber||ره زه به ر||Mizan||میزان||Təla||تله|\n|8||30||Aban||آبان||Gelarêzan||گه لا ريژان||Aqrab||عقرب||Laɻam||لړم|\n|9||30||Azar||آذر||Sermawez||سه ر ما وه ز||Qaws||قوس||lindəy||لیندۍ|\n|12||29/30||Esfand||اسفند||Resheme||ره شه مه||Hout||حوت||kab||کب|\nThe first day of the calendar year is also the day of the greatest festival of the year in Iran and its surrounding regions, called Norouz (a single word made up of two parts, no (new) and rouz (day), meaning \"new day\").\nDays of the week in Iranian calendar[edit | edit source]\nIn Iranian Calendar, every week begins on Saturday and ends on Friday. Names of the days of the week are as follows:\nShanbeh (شنبه in Persian) equivalent to Saturday.\nYekshanbeh (یکشنبه in Persian) equivalent to Sunday.\nDoshanbeh (دوشنبه in Persian) equivalent to Monday.\nSeshanbeh (سه شنبه in Persian) equivalent to Tuesday.\nChaharshanbeh (چهارشنبه in Persian) equivalent to Wednesday.\nPanjshanbeh (پنجشنبه in Persian) equivalent to Thursday.\nJom'eh (جمعه in Persian, originally Arabic) or Adineh (آدینه in Persian) equivalent to Friday.\nIn most Islamic countries, Jom'eh is the holiday.\nCalendar seasonal error[edit | edit source]\nIn the 11th century, a team of astronomers, allegedly including Omar Khayyam, proposed certain rules. While the details of the exact rule is debated, some claim that it inserted 8 leap days in every cycle of 33 years (different rules, such as the 2820-year cycle have also been accredited to Omar Khayyam). This replaced a previously common calendar that had a leap day every four years, and was adopted by Jalaal ad-Din Malik Shah Seljuki and became known as the Jalaali calendar.\nThis image shows the difference between the Iranian calendar (using the 33-year arithmetic approximation) and the seasons. The Y axis is \"days error\" and the X axis is Gregorian calendar years.\nEach point represents a single date on a given year. The error shifts by about 1/4 day per year, and is corrected by a leap year every 4th year regularly, and one 5 year leap period to complete a 33-year cycle. One can notice a gradual shift upwards over the 500 years shown.\nCalculating the day of the week[edit | edit source]\nCalculating the day of the week is easy. You just need an anchor date to start with. One good day to choose is Sunday, 1 Farvardin 1372, which equals 21 March 1993.\nAssuming the 33-year cycle approximation, to jump ahead by one 33-year cycle: move back by one weekday. Similarly, to jump back by one 33-year cycle, move ahead by one weekday.\nAs in the Gregorian calendar, dates move forward exactly one day of the week with each passing year, except if there is an intervening leap day. The leap day will make the date move an additional day forward. The chosen anchor date (1 Farvardin 1372) is chosen so that its 4th, 8th, ..., 32nd anniversaries come immediately after leap days, yet the anchor date itself does not immediately follow a leap day.\nSee also[edit | edit source]\n[edit | edit source]\n- An online Jalali(shamsi)/Gregorian/Islamic(hijri) Date Convertor\n- The Persian Calendar : A simple explanation\n- The Persian Calendar : How the leap years are calculated\n- System.Globalization.PersianCalendar class documentation in MSDN Library (Microsoft .Net 2.0 class for Persian Calendar calculation and conversions from/to Gregorian Calendar.)\n- An Interactive Iranian Calendar\n- The Zoroastrian Calendar","By Konstantin Bikos and Aparna Kher\nThere are two equinoxes every year: one in March and one in September. In March, the Sun crosses the equator from south to north.\nOn the equinox, the Earth’s axis is perpendicular to the Sun’s rays.\nSun Crosses Celestial Equator\nThe March equinox is the moment the Sun crosses the celestial equator—an imaginary line in the sky above Earth’s equator—from south to north. This happens on March 19, 20, or 21 every year.\nEquinox Local Time & Date\nIn Tauranga, Bay of Plenty, New Zealand: Monday, 21 March 2022 at 4:33 a.m. NZDT This corresponds to Sunday, 20 March 2022 at 15:33 UTC.\nWhy Does the Sun Move North and South?\nDuring the course of a year, the subsolar point—the spot on the Earth’s surface directly beneath the Sun—slowly moves along a north-south axis. Having reached its southernmost point at the December solstice, it starts moving northward until it crosses the equator on the day of the March equinox. The June solstice marks the northernmost point of its journey.\nThe Sun: Our home star\nThe subsolar point moves north and south during the year because the Earth’s axis is tilted at an angle of about 23.4° in relation to the ecliptic, an imaginary plane created by Earth’s path around the Sun. In June, the Northern Hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun, and the subsolar point is north of the equator. As the Earth travels toward the opposite side of its orbit, which it reaches in December, the Southern Hemisphere gradually receives more sunlight, and the subsolar point travels south.\nHow do seasons work?\nEarth is tilted as it orbits the Sun, which is why equinoxes and solstices happen.\nWhy Is It Called “Equinox?”\nOn the days of the equinoxes, the Earth’s axis is perpendicular to the Sun’s rays, meaning that all regions on Earth receive about the same number of hours of sunlight. In other words, night and day are, in principle, the same length all over the world. This is the reason it’s called an “equinox,” derived from Latin, meaning “equal night.”\nHowever, this is literal translation not entirely true. In reality, equinox days don’t have exactly 12 hours of daylight and 12 hours of dark.\nAstronomical terms & definitions\nThe Equinoxes and the Seasons\nThe March and September equinoxes mark the beginning of the spring and autumn seasons on Earth, according to one definition. The equinox in March is the start of spring in the Northern Hemisphere and the beginning of fall south of the equator.\nEquinox and solstice dates—years 1-2149\nMeasuring the Tropical Year\nThe March equinox can be used to measure a tropical year, the mean time it takes for the Earth to complete a full orbit around the Sun. Also known as a solar year, a tropical year is approximately 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes, and 45 seconds long. It can vary by up to 30 minutes each year.\n|March 2019 – March 2020||365||5||51||4|\n|March 2020 – March 2021||365||5||47||55|\n|March 2021 – March 2022||365||5||55||54|\n|March 2022 – March 2023||365||5||50||55|\n|March 2023 – March 2024||365||5||42||8|\nWhy Does the Date Vary?\nThe date of the equinoxes and solstices varies because a year in our calendar does not exactly match the length of the tropical year—the time it takes the Earth to complete an orbit around the Sun.\nToday’s Gregorian calendar has 365 days in a common year and 366 days in a leap year. However, our planet takes about 365.242199 days to orbit the Sun. This means that the timing of the equinoxes and solstices slowly drifts apart from the Gregorian calendar, and the solstice happens about 6 hours later each year. Eventually, the accumulated lag becomes so large that it falls on the following date.\nTo realign the calendar with the tropical year, a leap day is introduced (nearly) every four years. When this happens, the equinox and solstice dates shift back to the earlier date again.\nOther factors influencing the timing of the equinoxes and solstices include variations in the length of a tropical year and in the orbital and daily rotational motion of the Earth, such as the “wobble” in the Earth’s axis (precession)."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:d5ac10ec-1081-400e-941e-cd2a2fd63dbf>","<urn:uuid:5e6811cd-fb1b-4da5-8729-dc48e08b206b>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What molecular targets are involved in CML treatment resistance, and how do microRNAs influence drug response?","answer":"Key molecular targets in CML treatment resistance include the BCR-ABL1 protein, where mutations T334I and D381N confer drug resistance, and specific residues like Glu481, Ser453, Ala452, and others that contribute to inhibitor binding. Regarding microRNA influence, miR-181c has been identified as a critical factor in drug response, with its down-regulation associated with imatinib resistance. This microRNA affects drug response by targeting important genes including PBX3, HSP90B1, NMT2, and RAD21, which are associated with chemoresistance and poor prognosis.","context":["The constitutive BCR–ABL1 active protein fusion has been identified as the main cause of chronic myeloid leukemia. The emergence of T334I and D381N point mutations in BCR–ABL1 confer drug resistance. Recent experimental studies show a synergistic effect in suppressing this resistance when Nilotinib and Asciminib are co-administered to target both the catalytic and allosteric binding site of BCR–ABL1 oncoprotein, respectively. However, the structural mechanism by which this synergistic effect occurs has not been clearly elucidated. To obtain insight into the observed synergistic effect, molecular dynamics simulations have been employed to investigate the inhibitory mechanism as well as the structural dynamics that characterize this effect. Structural dynamic analyses indicate that the synergistic binding effect results in a more compact and stable protein conformation. In addition, binding free energy calculation suggests a dominant energy effect of nilotinib during co-administration. van der Waals energy interactions were observed to be the main energy component driving this synergistic effect. Furthermore, per-residue energy decomposition analysis identified Glu481, Ser453, Ala452, Tyr454, Phe401, Asp400, Met337, Phe336, Ile334, And Val275 as key residues that contribute largely to the synergistic effect.

To find miRNAs involved in imatinib response we performed miRNA microarray followed by RT-qPCR verification of 9 available diagnostic bone marrow core biopsies from 9 CML patients including 4 imatinib-resistant and 5 imatinib-responder patients. Only one differentially expressed miRNA, miR-181c, was found when the imatinib-resistant group was compared with imatinib-responders. Significant down-regulation of miR-181c in imatinib-resistant versus imatinib-responders was confirmed by qRT-PCR.

In most of the patients, the ABL tyrosine kinase of the fusion protein is effectively inhibited by the tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), but some patients are resistant to TKI therapy. Whereas the BCR-ABL fusion drives the initial chronic phase of the disease, the progression of CML involves additional genomic changes which make leukemia cells resistant to TKI therapy and independent of BCR-ABL. Recently, in a variety of cancers the role of microRNAs (miRNA) in disease progression has been addressed .

Similarly, AML patients with intermediate- or poor-risk subtypes have been reported to have lower miR-181 levels than do patients with favorable prognosis . The decreased expression of this miRNA has also been found in Fanconi anemia patients, and been involved in the impaired growth of their hematopoietic progenitors . However, in two recent studies involving CML patients, no association appeared between the miR-181c expression and imatinib therapy response [13, 14]. Furthermore, in CML patients with blast chrisis, the miR-181c was not differentially expressed, but miR-181a and miR-181b were upregulated .\nTo study which genes are targeted by miR-181c, we used Chipster software v.1.4. To reduce false positivity, target genes needed to be predicted by at least five of six algorithms, including TargetScan, miRanda, Sanger miRBase, mirTarget2, Tarbase, and PICTAR (Additional file 2: Table S1). Some of the miR-181c target genes are associated with prognosis and drug response, ones such as PBX3, HSP90B1, NMT2, and RAD21. For example, AML patients with intermediate- to poor-prognosis subtypes, who had lower expression of miR-181, conversely showed an increased level of PBX3. The up-regulation of NMT2 and RAD21 contributes to chemoresistance in osteosarcoma cell lines and also in breast cancers [17, 18]. Similarly, high expression of HSP90B1 is associated in breast cancer with distant metastasis and with decreased overall and disease-free survival . Moreover, high HSP90 expression predicts worse overall survival in patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia .\nIn conclusion, miR-181c associated with imatinib resistance. Larger sample sizes and further independent studies, however, are warranted to assess the role of candidate miRNA and target genes in the molecular mechanisms underlying resistance in CML.\ntyrosine kinase inhibitors.\nThe study was supported by grants from the Nordic Chronic Myeloid Leukemia Study Group, Juselius, Evo, Finnish Cancer Association.

{"question":"Why are Colorado's recent wildfire patterns unusual, and how do they relate to historical snowpack trends?","answer":"Colorado's wildfire patterns have become extraordinarily unusual, with the state experiencing its first fires over 100,000 acres only in the 21st century, including six such fires since 2000, with three occurring in 2020 alone. These unprecedented fire patterns coincide with almost unprecedented snowpack reductions across the northern Rocky Mountains in the late 20th century. The connection lies in climate change impacts - as snowpack has declined due to unparalleled springtime warming, it has led to longer summers, earlier snow melts, and extended drought conditions. This was evident in the East Troublesome Fire of 2020, which showed unusual behavior by burning at high elevations late in the season, spreading at rates of 6,000 acres per hour - the biggest blowup recorded in Colorado's modern fire history.","context":["The Unusual Nature of Recent Snowpack Declines in the North American\nCitation: Pederson, G. T., S. T. Gray, C. A. Woodhouse, J. L. Betancourt, D. B. Fagre, J. S. Littell, E. Watson, B. H. Luckman, and L. J. Graumlich, 2011. The Unusual Nature of Recent Snowpack Declines in the North American Cordillera. Science, 9 June 2011: 1201570Published online 9 June 2011 [DOI:10.1126/science.1201570]\nl Abstract l Reprint l\nSnow shapes the ecosystems and economies of the semi-arid landscapes of western North America by generating the streamflow that allows agriculture and cities to flourish. The patterns of snowfall across space and through time impact aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems by governing processes such as: 1) the onset of spring, 2) the amount, timing, and temperature of streamflow runoff, 3) probability forest fires, 4) size and distribution of glaciers, and 5) the elevation and position of alpine treeline and meadows. We're understandably concerned when scientists report that snowpack in the West has been steadily declining since the 1950s and obvious questions that come to mind include: 1) Is this normal and part of some long-term pattern of waxing and waning conditions?, or 2) Does this reflect recent anomalous trends towards declining snow the West? To answer these questions, we need records that encompass multiple centuries thereby allowing us to assess trends and cycles in snowpack.\nOur project seeks to address this gap using tree-rings to reconstruct snowpack over several centuries for three key high-mountain watersheds: the Upper Colorado River basin, the Upper Missouri River basin, and the headwaters of the Columbia River. Snowpack reconstructions were produced at multiple watershed scales (Click here for map), and the resulting high-resolution maps of past snowpack provide insights into natural controls on snowpack variability linked to changes in the Pacific Ocean basin (e.g., El Niño, Pacific Decadal Oscillation). Additionally, both data and mapping tools have been developed as planning and research resources for water managers and research scientists. This work is particularly relevant because the three target regions form the headwaters for the West's three most important watersheds.\nIn order to calibrate tree-ring data to snowpack data, we have assembled large spatial databases using recently collected and existing tree-ring chronologies and records of April 1st snow water equivalent (SWE) in the headwaters of our three target watersheds. The final reconstructions have been completed, and results indicate that the tree-ring based reconstructions skillfully capture decade-scale and longer-term variability in snowpack at multiple watershed scales.\nIn western North America snowpack has declined in recent decades, and further losses are projected through the 21st century. Here we evaluate the uniqueness of recent declines using snowpack reconstructions from 66 tree-ring chronologies in key runoff generating areas of the Colorado, Columbia and Missouri River drainages. Over the past millennium, late-20th century snowpack reductions are almost unprecedented in magnitude across the northern Rocky mountains, and in their north-south synchrony across the cordillera. Both the snowpack declines and their synchrony result from unparalleled springtime warming due to positive reinforcement of the anthropogenic warming by decadal variability. The increasing role of warming on large-scale snowpack variability and trends foreshadows fundamental impacts on streamflow and water supplies across the western USA.\n- Data Tables and Resources\n- Figures and Mapping\n- Data Animations:\n- Image Gallery\nDOI News Release\nProject co-authors and key data contributors:\nGreg Pederson, U.S. Geological Survey | NOROCK and University of Arizona\nStephen Gray, University of Wyoming\nConnie Woodhouse, Geography Department and Laboratory of Tree Ring Research, University of Arizona\nLisa Graumlich, School of Natural Resources, University of Arizona\nDaniel Fagre, U.S. Geological Survey, Glacier Field Station\nJulio Betancourt, U.S. Geological Survey, National Research Program\nJeremy Littell, Climate Impacts Group, University of Washington\nBrian Luckman, University of Western Ontario\nEmma Watson, Environment Canada\nDave Meko, University of Arizona, Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research\nTroy Knight, St. John’s University, Minnesota\nFunding Support from:\nNational Science Foundation (NSF) | Geography and Regional Science – Grant# 0620793\nNational Science Foundation (NSF) | Ecology – Grant# 0734277\nU.S. Geological Survey (USGS) | Western Mountain Initiative","One of the most destructive wildfires in Colorado history, the East Troublesome Fire began on October 14, 2020, in the central Rocky Mountains east of Troublesome Creek in Grand County. A week later, high winds whipped the fire into a 100,000-acre inferno racing northeast through Grand Lake and into Rocky Mountain National Park. By the time snows and colder temperatures halted the fire in late October, it had killed two people, destroyed more than 400 houses and other structures, and burned 193,812 acres, making it the second-largest fire in state history.\nThe fire is believed to be human-caused but remains under investigation. Parts of Rocky Mountain National Park remained closed through the week of Thanksgiving. The East Troublesome Fire was the third record-breaking fire of 2020, with all three blazes surpassing 130,000 acres.\nColorado’s 2020 fire season got off to a late start, but fires worsened as a hot, dry summer turned to a dry, warm fall with frequent Red Flag warnings. The Pine Gulch Fire began on July 31 north of Grand Junction and grew to 139,000 acres, while the smaller Grizzly Creek blaze near Glenwood Springs shut down Interstate 70 for weeks. Those fires were fully contained by September. In October the Cameron Peak Fire west of Fort Collins became the largest blaze in state history and Colorado’s first wildfire to surpass 200,000 acres.\nAs the aspen trees turned in Grand County that fall, the entire state was still in a moderate drought, and the drought in the central Rockies became extreme. The Williams Fork Fire still burned on some 12,000 acres in southern Grand County, its smoke plume visible from I-70. Even as night temperatures reached below freezing, higher daytime temperatures, strong winds, and low humidity meant that the threat of additional fires remained high.\nA Troublesome Fire\nIt is not yet known what started the fire east of Troublesome Creek on October 14, but one week later it went on one of the most extraordinary runs in Colorado fire history. The evening of October 21 brought high winds that sent the 25,000-acre fire racing northeast at a rate of 6,000 acres per hour. By the time dawn broke on October 22, it had grown to 125,000 acres, burning through the town of Grand Lake, into Rocky Mountain National Park, and leaving dozens of charred houses and other buildings in its wake. The entire communities of Grand Lake and Granby were evacuated, along with hundreds of other residents from the surrounding area.\nSome 300 firefighting personnel were battling the blaze, but they had managed only 5 percent containment. Crew leaders reported that “weather, terrain, and beetle-killed lodgepole pine contributed” to the East Troublesome Fire’s terrifying run on October 21–22. Even under those conditions, however, officials noted that they never expected runs of 6,000 acres per hour, which amounted to the biggest blowup recorded in the modern fire history of Colorado. It was late in the season and the fire in many places was above 9,000 feet in elevation, burning in areas that would typically have colder daytime temperatures and snow. On the afternoon of October 22, the fire crossed the Continental Divide in Rocky Mountain National Park and added another 50,000 acres, becoming the second-largest fire in state history. The fire's scaling of the Great Divide prompted mandatory evacuation orders for the entire town of Estes Park, displacing some 6,500 people.\nOn October 24, authorities found out that not everyone had evacuated the fire area when they recovered the bodies of Lyle and Marilyn Hileman, a couple in their eighties who had stayed in their home near Grand Lake. Meanwhile, near the popular Bear Lake Road in Rocky Mountain National Park, anxious firefighters fought the East Troublesome Fire under a Red Flag warning all day. Their main objective was to defend Estes Park from the fire, which was being pushed eastward by a cold front blowing in with gusts up to sixty miles per hour. Finally, the front brought snow in the evening, halting the fire's advance toward the city.\nContainment slowly progressed as snow continued to hit the burned area in November. By November 19, the East Troublesome Fire was 72 percent contained. Although it was still not extinguished by Thanksgiving, the fire no longer threatened communities.\nRole of Climate Change\nBefore the twenty-first century, Colorado had not seen a fire grow beyond 100,000 acres. Since 2000, however, there have been six, and three of them occurred in 2020. The accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere from human fossil fuel consumption over the last two centuries has resulted in higher average temperatures that are accelerating a range of natural cycles. Fires like the East Troublesome are products of this climate shift and reflect a new era of fire danger in Colorado. As summers and droughts last longer and winter snow melts off earlier, bigger, later fires at higher altitudes are more likely to occur."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"english_native_fluent"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:5cdb20b6-098d-4d7f-bc50-86c1f1ce2b16>","<urn:uuid:eb32e3e7-e542-4dcf-860d-d18505c7263f>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How to protect company intellectual property from insider theft?","answer":"To protect intellectual property from insider theft: 1) Identify critical IP assets, 2) Identify high-risk insiders who have worked on these assets, 3) Review access controls to remove unnecessary access privileges, 4) Create policies for periodic review of access privileges, 5) Implement procedures to automatically disable access when employee roles change, 6) Consider temporarily disabling access during employee travel, leaves of absence, or vacations.","context":["ptnphotof - Fotolia\nEditor's note: This is part three of a series on insider threat behavior. Part one examines patterns of insider...\nthreats and IT sabotage, while part two looks at the precursors and warning signs for such security incidents.\nThe CERT Coordination Center defines insider theft of intellectual property as \"an insider's use of information technology to steal proprietary information from the organization,\" while intellectual property is defined as \"intangible assets created and owned by an organization that are critical to achieving its mission.\"\nExamples of intellectual property that may be targeted include software code, business plans and product designs.\nIn the previous article on information technology sabotage, the point was made that understanding an insider threat requires an understanding of what motivates people to behave the way they do, either positively or negatively. With regard to the theft of intellectual property, the insider generally does not steal the data in order to sell it, but for business advantages, such as taking it to a new job or using it to set up a competing company.\nA special case of motivation is when the insider engages in intellectual property theft as part of an economic or industrial espionage program that is led by a foreign government or other organization. In order to avoid the cost and time of developing intellectual property, the insider sees stealing it from an organization that has already borne those costs as the more viable option.\nWhen this occurs, insiders usually have a stronger attachment to the foreign government or organization, which leads to a greater sense of loyalty to their foreign beneficiaries rather than to their employer or host country.\nRegardless of their motivation, insiders that commit intellectual property theft are generally employees that have access to intellectual property, such as engineer scientists, programmers or salespeople. Given that these insiders have authorized access to the intellectual property -- or perhaps are the creators of the intellectual property -- it can be very difficult to detect their malicious behavior.\nIn any discussion about behavior and behavioral characteristics, it is important to remind ourselves why we are looking to discover characteristics of insider theft of intellectual property. Detecting some of these characteristics does not mean that a malicious insider has been detected -- an understanding of these characteristics cannot be used to trap employees.\nIt can be used as input into a risk-based analysis of job positions at risk for intellectual property theft, to help understand the organizational elements that influence insiders to carry out theft and, most importantly, to develop and implement protection and mitigation strategies to protect an organization from malicious insider attacks.\nPatterns in insider intellectual property theft\nCERT/CC has worked on insider threats since 2002 and has since developed two models of IP theft: the entitled independent and the ambitious leader. Let's use the entitled independent as an example.\nThis is an insider who feels entitled to take intellectual property because they worked on it as an employee. The entitled independent insider has a personal predisposition that results in a sense of ownership and entitlement to information that they worked on and that they feel is their property -- they are unable to see that their work is a part of a team effort that belongs to their employer.\nThe sense of insider entitlement is intertwined with employee contribution, meaning that the greater the contribution, the greater the employee's feelings of entitlement. These entitlement feelings may also be amplified in the insider's mind if they perceive their contribution to be exceptionally important; for example, working on a flagship product.\nThe entitled independent may also experience job dissatisfaction that intensifies the feeling of entitlement. Job dissatisfaction and employee disgruntlement are similar to job satisfaction issues seen in insiders who perform IT sabotage. This behavior includes:\n- dissatisfaction with compensation, promotions, benefits, bonuses and relocation;\n- mergers and acquisitions;\n- conflicts with supervisors and co-workers;\n- layoffs; and\n- disagreement over who owns intellectual\nJob satisfaction issues frequently motivate insiders to look for new jobs, where one-third used the stolen intellectual property to get a new job and another third stole intellectual property just in case. For the entitled independent, issues of an inappropriate sense of entitlement mixed with job dissatisfaction and a desire to leave the organization may lead to an insider leaving with stolen intellectual property.\nWhat to do?\nUnderstanding that stolen intellectual property tends to be property that insiders have developed or contributed to is important when developing a strategy to protect it. A successful strategy should be able to:\n- Identify critical intellectual property assets.\n- Identify insiders who have worked on said assets -- either now or in the past -- as they are high-risk insiders.\n- Review access controls that protect intellectual property to identify insiders that no longer need access, such as people who have moved on to other projects or left the organization.\n- Create policies regarding access to critical intellectual property, including a periodic review of access privileges.\n- Create procedures that automatically disable access to intellectual property when employee roles change.\n- Consider temporarily disabling access to intellectual property when insiders travel outside of the country, take a leave of absence or go on vacation."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"english_native_fluent"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:c11fd271-6cb2-4b87-b6d2-ea3850f3f9df>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What similarities can be found between Hugo Chavez's approach to foreign relations and Iran's international stance under Ahmadinejad?","answer":"Both leaders pursued confrontational foreign policies and aimed to extend their regional influence. Ahmadinejad made himself popular in the Arab world through outspoken denunciations of the US and established Iranian influence in Lebanon and Palestine. Similarly, Chavez built up Venezuela as a regional powerhouse by providing cheap oil to neighboring countries and massive loans. Both leaders also pursued policies of nationalization - Chavez nationalized much of Venezuela's industry, while Iran maintained a strong state presence in its oil sector. Their approaches were characterized by provocative stances toward the United States and attempts to build regional alliances through economic means.","context":["A few years ago, during a visit to Tehran to give some lectures at the foreign ministry research and training institute, I was taken to lunch by a senior Iranian diplomat at a once fashionable Italian restaurant in the northern middle-class suburb of Tajrish. Educated as a scientist in the United States before the 1979 revolution, he had been an important figure in the post-revolutionary regime, and later a senior diplomat. I had met him at various conferences on European-Iranian relations and we had struck up something of a rapport. On this occasion, after the usual semi-official tour d'horizon, we began talking about the early history of the Iranian revolution and of its foreign policy.\n\"We made three big mistakes\", he said: first, in holding the American diplomats hostages for a year and a half and thereby deeply antagonising the US; second, by not accepting the very favourable peace which Saddam Hussein had offered in the summer of 1982, when Iran had the upper hand in the war, then already two years old; and third - to me the most surprising of his points - in not supporting the communist regime that came to power in Afghanistan in 1978, and instead backing the pro-American guerrillas that (with eventual success) opposed them.\nThe reflections of this diplomat are of considerable relevance to the situation in which Iran finds itself today. For sure, the pressure being put on Iran by the US is arrogant and in many ways illegal. For Washington to protest about Iranian \"interference\" in Iraq when it is the US which invaded the country in 2003, and when it is Iranian allies (if not clients) who staff much of the government and armed forces of Iraq, is also ridiculous. So too is the attempt to blame Iran for the spread of Sunni terrorism, including al-Qaida activities, in the region. No country has a greater interest in the stability of Iraq than Iran, a point Washington has stupidly failed to note these four years past.\nFred Halliday is professor of international relations at the LSE, and visiting professor at the Barcelona Institute of International Studies (IBEI). His books include Islam and the Myth of Confrontation (IB Tauris, 2003) and 100 Myths About the Middle East (Saqi, 2005)\nFred Halliday's \"global politics\" column on openDemocracy surveys the national histories, geopolitical currents, and dominant ideas across the world. The articles include:\n\"America and Arabia after Saddam\"\n\"Iran's revolutionary spasm\" (July 2005)\n\"Political killing in the cold war\" (August 2005)\n\"A transnational umma: myth or reality?\" (October 2005)\n\"Iran vs the United States – again\" (February 2006)\n\"A Lebanese fragment: two days with Hizbollah\" (July 2006)\n\"A 2007 warning: the twelve worst ideas in the world\"\n(8 January 2007)\n\"Sunni, Shi'a and the \"Trotskyists of Islam\"\n(9 February 2007)\nYet there is another side to the US-Iranian polarisation that could prove dangerous not only to Washington but also the Islamic Republic and which arises from the miscalculations of the Iranian leadership itself. Iran's President Ahmadinejad has made himself popular in much of the Arab world, and among Muslims more broadly, for his outspoken denunciations of the US. He has also heartened many by his calls for the destruction of Israel (something he did indeed call for, despite claims by some inside and outside Iran that he was mistranslated: the words mahv bayad bashad [must be wiped out] leave no room for doubt).\nYet Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has also thrown caution, and a due evaluation of the enmity and strength of his enemies, to the wind. (Ayatollah Khomeini once rebuked Ali Akbar Velayati for following him in a violent denunciation of Saudi Arabia, reminding the longstanding the foreign minister that it was his job to maintain relations with other states.) At the same time the president has indulged in a set of ill-conceived economic policies at home, squandering oil revenue to boost consumption, launching retrograde educational and cultural campaigns against secularism, while failing to meet the campaign promises to the poor that, in 2005, secured his surprise election. The failure of his candidates to prevail in the December 2006 elections to the Expediency Council, an important constitutional watchdog, and a growth of criticism even from conservatives and other clerics, augurs ill for his future.\nNo one can tell where the current confrontation between Tehran and Washington will lead to. Perhaps, as a result of impatience, miscalculation or innate risk-taking, Iran and the US will be at war in the near future. Or it may prove to be the case that both are playing for time: the Iranians want to spin out negotiations with the west over the nuclear issue until the US position in Iraq is even weaker, the US may want to stay its hand in the hope that domestic economic and social problems will further weaken the regime and allow them to precipitate political upheaval. Everything is possible.\nThe roots of turbulence\nIn this context it is worth looking more closely at the way in which Iran formulates its foreign policy, and the roots of its high-risk policy. Much is made of the fact that Iran is an ancient imperial power, one of the four countries in the world - along with China, Egypt and Yemen - which can claim continuity as a state over 3,000 years.\nIt may also be some satisfaction to Iranian leaders that with their influence in Lebanon and Palestine, Iran now has a military emplacement on the shores of the Mediterranean for the first time since the Achaemenid empire (c 550-350 BCE). Moreover, Iran's aspiration to nuclear capability, in whatever form, is as much due to the aspiration to be a major power as to military factors, just as is the retention of what are in practice useless and expensive weapons by Britain and France.\nCertainly, Iranian official, and popular, attitudes towards nearly all their neighbours (with the interesting exception of the Armenians) are replete with prejudice and a sense of superiority. \"You colonialists left your goat's droppings around the region, but sooner or later we will sweep them away\", one interlocutor in Tehran said to me. When I asked what these \"goat's droppings\" were, he replied: \"Pakistan, Iraq and Israel\".\nIt is in part this self-perception which explains one of the most constant features of Iranian foreign policy over the past century, and one to which my diplomat companion was drawing attention during our lunch in Tehran: namely, the recurrent tendency of Iranian leaders to overplay their hand. Even a brief list is striking:\n- in the second world war, Reza Shah, the first of the two Pahlavi monarchs, thought he could balance British and Russian pressure by maintaining relations with Germany, but in the end, and as soon as Russia entered the war in 1941, Iran was invaded and Reza Shah sent off to exile in Mauritius\n- in the early 1950s, the nationalist prime minister Mohammad Mossadeq thought he could nationalise Iranian oil (hitherto a monopoly of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, today's BP) on his own terms and avoid a compromise with western governments: in the end, he was overthrown in the CIA and MI6 coup of August 1953\n- during the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s, Ayatollah Khomeini failed to grasp the Iraqi near-surrender of 1982, a consequence of his belief that Iranian forces could topple the Iraqi regime and impose a Shi'a substitute; the result was six more years of war, the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Iranians, the entry of the US navy into the war on the side of the Iraqis, and (in August 1988) a far less favourable peace.\nMuch is made too of the fact that Iran is the most important Shi'a state and that the last great Persian dynasty, the Safavid (1502-1736) made Shi'ism a powerful political and military, as well as cultural, force in the region, a rival for centuries to the Sunni Ottoman empire to the west. This Shi'a identity, one that the mullahs have in any case overblown, has also proved to be a mixed blessing for the Islamic republic; for many outside Iran - and even for Shi'a in countries like Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait - Iran's projection of its Shi'ism has put them in a difficult situation, not least for the implied claim of the superior authority of clergy, and politicians, based inside Iran. Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, the leading Shi'a cleric in Iraq, and himself an Iranian, has long sought to limit such influence, as has, in a much rougher way, the rising Shi'a leader, Muqtada al-Sadr.\nIran's imperial and nationalist past and its Shi'a identity, are not, however, enough to explain the noisy and risky policy Iran is pursuing today. Here two other factors need to be brought into account. The first is that Iran is an oil-producing country, a fact that, especially at a time of high oil prices, gives to the state some leeway simultaneously to mollify the people and pursue expensive military programmes.\nThe problem is that these expenditures do little to alleviate the long-term problems of the economy and are usually, is the Iranian case, and also that of Venezuela, accompanied by much waste, corruption and factionalism. In this regard, Ahmadinejad and Hugo Chávez are two of a kind: intoxicated with their own rhetoric, insouciant about the longer term economic development of their oil industries and economy as a whole, and wilfully provocative, towards the United States and immediate neighbours alike, in foreign policy.\nThe second and indeed the most important (and neglected) factor explaining contemporary Iran, however, is a fact evident in its historical origin, policy and rhetoric: that the Islamic Republic of Iran is a country that has emerged from a revolution and that this revolution has far from lost its dynamic, at home or abroad.\nIt is not in the imperial dreams of ancient Persia, or the global vision of Shi'a clergy, but in the repetition by Iran of the same policies, aspirations and mistakes of previous revolutionary regimes, from France in the 1790s, to Cuba in the 1960s and 1970s that the underlying logic of its actions can be seen.\nAmong openDemocracy's recent articles on Iranian politics in a period of crisis:\n\"Nazenin Ansari, \"An ayatollah under siege … in Tehran\"\n(4 October 2006)\n\"Nasrin Alavi, \"Iran: cracks in the façade\" (11 December 2006)\n\"Nasrin Alavi, \"Iran's election backlash\"\n(19 December 2006)\n\"Dariush Zahedi & Omid Memarian, \"Ahmadinejad, Iran and America\"\n(15 January 2007)\n\"Ali Afshari & H Graham Underwood, \"Iran's post-election balance\" (22 January 2007)\n\"Sanam Vakil, \"Iran's nuclear gamble\"\n(1 February 2007)\n\"Nasrin Alavi, \"Iran's attack blowback\"\n(5 February 2007)\nThe trap of revolution\nThe Iranian revolution of 1978-79 was, as much as those of France, Russia, China or Cuba, one of the major social and political upheavals of modern history. Like its predecessors, it set out not only to transform its own internal system - for sure at a high cost in repression, wastage and illusion - but to export revolution. And this Iran did: to Afghanistan, Iraq, Lebanon in the 1980s and now to Palestine and, in much more favourable circumstances thanks to the US, to Iraq again. It can indeed be argued that it is the confrontation between internationalist revolutionary Iran on one side, and the US and its regional allies on the other, that has been the major axis of conflict in the middle east this past quarter of a century. By comparison, America's war with Sunni, al-Qaida-type, militancy is a secondary affair.\nHere, however, Iran has fallen into the traps and illusions of other revolutionaries. Like the French revolutionaries, the Iranians proclaim themselves to be at once the friend of all the oppressed and \"a great nation\" (a phrase Khomeini used that echoed, whether wittingly or not, the Jacobins of 1793). Like the early Bolsheviks, the Islamic revolutionaries began their revolution thinking diplomacy was an oppression and should be swept aside - hence the detention of the US diplomats as hostages. Like the Cubans and Chinese, they have combined unofficial supplies of arms, training and finance to their revolutionary allies with the, calculated, intervention of their armed forces.\nAll of this has its cost. The gradual moderation of Iran under the presidency of Mohammad Khatami (1997-2005) reflected a sense of exhaustion after the eight-year war with Iraq and a desire for more normal external relations with the outside world, like the period of the Girondins in the France of 1792-93, or the policies of Liu Shao-chi in China of the early 1960s: but as in those other cases, and as in the USSR of Stalin in the 1930s, there were those who wanted to go in a very different direction, and proceeded to tighten the screws of repression, and raise confrontational rhetoric once again. A comparison could indeed be made with the Russia of the early 1930s or the China of the 1960s, and say that Iran under Ahmadinejad is now going through its \"third period\" or a mild replica of the \"cultural revolution\".\nHow long this can continue is anyone's guess; but it is likely to be years, perhaps many, before the Islamic revolution has run its course. Even Cuba, weak and exposed by comparison, has sustained its defiance and its model for well over four decades now. Yet even without war with the US, the risks and the costs (as many people in Iran realise only too well) are high.\nHere, and again in a spirit of comparison, it is worth recalling the words of one of the wisest observers of modern revolutions, the now sadly deceased Polish writer Ryszard Kapuscinski. His book The Soccer War contains a passage observing the Algeria of the mid-1960s under Ahmad Ben Bella that apply to all revolutions, uncannily so in the case of Iran today:\n\"Algeria became the pivotal Third World state, but the cost of its status - above all the financial cost - was staggering. It ate up millions of dollars for which the country had a crying need ... Gradually, the gap between Ben Bella's domestic and foreign policies grew wider. The contrast deepened. Algeria had earned an international reputation as a revolution state ... it was an example for the non-European continents, a model, bright and entrancing; while at home, the country was stagnating; the unemployed filled the square of every city; there was no investment; illiteracy ruled, bureaucracy, reaction, fanaticism ran riot; intrigues absorbed the attention of the government ... The country cannot carry the burden of these polices. It cannot afford to and it has no interest in them.\"\nMahmoud Ahmadinejad and his advisers, and those of Hugo Chávez too, would do well to read and ponder these words.","Venezuela History Timeline – 20th Century\n- In 1908 Juan Vicente Gomez became dictator of Venezuela and would rule the country for almost 30 years.\n- Oil began being exported out of Venezuela in the early 20th The nation’s oil boom is reported to have begun in 1927. Two years later Venezuela was the largest oil exporter in the world. Gomez refused to allow refineries to be built on Venezuela soil. The oil rights belonged to the state and these were sold or leased to international oil companies.\n- The vast majority of Venezuelans did not benefit from the oil boom which enriched Venezuela’s elite and the foreign companies.\n- A series of coups after Gomez led eventually to the first civilian to civilian democratic elections of 1963. In this atmosphere a growing influence of political parties and unrest was taking root in Venezuela.\n- Carlos Andres Perez was elected president in 1974. His presidency coincided with the oil boom brought by the OPEC embargo of the 1970s. Perez nationalized the oil industry and initiated massive public spending programs in an effort to leverage the oil wealth to modernize Venezuela. The oil boom and massive spending brought with it a surge in government corruption and crime rates in Venezuelan cities. Public spending soon surpassed oil revenues and Perez began utilizing international loans to finance his state programs. Many see this period and the decades of the 70s and 80s as a shadow of what is occurring once again in Venezuela. This period saw a great widening of the gap between rich and poor in the country.\nVenezuela History Timeline: Missed Lessons from Prior Crisis\n- As the Venezuelan economy began tanking in the late 1980s corruption and poor fiscal policy of the last two decades began to come show their fruit in Venezuelan society.\n- Loans from the IMF (International Monetary Fund) were utilized to prop up the national economy and a series of unpopular reforms were implemented. Political unrest and popular resentment against the government were by this time running rampant in Venezuela. One failed coup attempt included a young officer named Hugo Chavez who ended up being imprisoned.\n- The economic crisis persisted throughout the 1990s in the face of many aggressive steps taken by the Venezuelan government.\n- Hugo Chavez was released from prison and ran for president in 1997.\nVenezuela History Timeline: The Chavez Era\n- Chavez won the presidency in 1998 calling for new relations between the socioeconomic classes of Venezuela and a new constitution. Chavez was ousted shortly be a coup in 2002 but returned to power after a few days. His supporters called his program of reforms and revolution in Venezuela the Bolivarian Revolution. He would die in office in 2013.\n- In the course of Chavez’s presidency he oversaw a new oil boom as prices rose throughout the world. Many of the same mistakes made by the Venezuelan government in the 1970s were repeated under Hugo Chavez – rampant public spending, corruption, and excessive international debt.\n- Chavez nationalized much of the country’s industry and isolated oil as the primary export of Venezuela. During the rule of Hugo Chavez oil made up 95% of the country’s exports.\n- Beginning in 2006 Hugo Chavez and Venezuela became a beneficiary of the drastic rise in oil prices. This rise in oil prices lifted Venezuela’s economy to unprecedented heights until oil prices fell in 2013.\n- Thank in large part to the oil wealth Chavez was able to reduce Venezuela’s poverty rate from 50% in 1998 to 30% at the time of his death. In the course of the current crisis it has skyrocketed to 80%.\n- Chavez built up Venezuela as a powerhouse in the region by providing cheap oil to their neighbors and massive loans.\n- Nicolas Maduro served as Hugo Chavez’s Minister of Foreign Affairs and succeeded him as president being officially elected in April 2013. His initial priorities included a clampdown on crime in the nation.\nThis timeline and fact sheet continues with the Venezuela Crisis Fact Sheet and Timeline."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"english_native_fluent"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:78e61682-4f42-4a26-9520-ef987b493018>","<urn:uuid:d8b609de-170a-4e3e-9f10-5d50cd16dbc8>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do designing places in virtual worlds and software architecture design differ in their focus on adaptability?","answer":"The design of adaptive virtual worlds focuses on creating places that respond to changing needs of users through design grammars and principles like layout, objects, navigation, and interaction. It emphasizes the formal understanding of place design rather than technology implementation. In contrast, software architecture's approach to adaptability centers on providing flexibility in changing markets, enabling interoperability, and reducing maintenance costs through structural design decisions. While virtual world design draws from architectural principles to create responsive environments, software architecture focuses on establishing abstract system views that support business strategy and organizational needs.","context":["Designing places in 3D virtual worlds has emerged as an important topic in digital and multimedia design, but very often it lacks theories or principles. Current books on designing virtual worlds focus on designing and implementing the technologies that enable virtual worlds in terms of graphics, networks, multi-user capabilities, and real time rendering. Designing Adaptive Virtual Worldsby Ning Gu and Mary Lou Maher published today fully open access by De Gruyter Open differs in its approach by making a case for the design of places in 3D virtual worlds, rather than designing the technologies that enable virtual places.\nIn this sense, the book is closer to architectural design of places in virtual worlds – emphasizing the formal understandings and principles for designing virtual worlds, and featuring the advantage of automating design on a computational platform of multi-user 3D virtual worlds with avatars, terrain, objects, and interactions. The authors focus on the design of place in the context of virtual worlds in order to distinguish the contents of this book from others that focus instead on the design of the 3D models or the technology to support a virtual world. With a focus on place, they are able to merge the design principles that have evolved over a long history of architecture with the principles of new technology that make virtual worlds possible.\nBoth authors have a long history of research on models of design and creativity and the development of social-computational models. They argue that the design and implementation of virtual worlds is separated in time from the use of the virtual world, and therefore is not directly related to an individual’s experience of the world.\nA common metaphor for the design of the worlds is the concept of place. Most worlds use the concept of place as the basis for terrain and objects in the world. Virtual worlds are designed for specific purposes and support a broad range of online activities. The design of places in virtual worlds draws on the users experience and knowledge of architectural design and living in physical environments. The metaphor of place and reference to concepts from architectural design provide a consistent and familiar base for designing virtual worlds, and facilitate the interaction of virtual world occupants with the designed environments and with one other.\nBased on 10 years’ research and practice of designing places in virtual worlds the book includes a characterization of 3D virtual worlds as place and illustrates different styles of design. The grammar formalism builds on four principles of design in virtual worlds: layout, objects, navigation, and interaction. An agent model that incorporates and executes design grammars is described as the basis for an adaptive virtual world that responds to the changing needs of people worldwide. The book thoroughly illustrates the range of designs that are the result of the generative design grammar.\nDesigning Adaptive Virtual Worlds takes the design of places for education, entertainment, online communities, business, and cultural activities to a new level. Says Gabriela Celani, Head of the Laboratory for Automation and Prototyping for Architecture and Construction at the University of Campinas, Brazil. “In Designing Adaptive Virtual Worlds, Ning Gu and Mary Lou Maher extend our understanding of the design of places in 3D virtual worlds. This book is one of the first to show how different styles for interactive virtual worlds can be captured in a design grammar, allowing unique places to be created that respond to the changing needs of avatars. Gu and Maher introduce techniques that can be applied to designing inhabitable places in existing platforms such as Second Life, OpenSim and Active Worlds. These techniques also are relevant to future worlds in which digital and physical boundaries will blur.”\nThe book is available to read, download and share fully open access here.","Software Architecture: Principles and Practices - eLearning\nAlthough the term software architecture is used frequently in today's software industry, its meaning is not universally understood.\n- What is software architecture?\n- How do you use software architectures in practice?\n- What does a software architect do for an organization?\n- What value does software architecture provide?\nThis course introduces the essential concepts of software architecture.

{"question":"How has the evolution of refrigeration technology improved performance, and what historical changes have occurred in refrigerant regulations?","answer":"Refrigeration technology has evolved from bulky, inefficient machines to advanced systems offering up to 15% improved energy efficiency. Modern units like the Copeland Scroll FFAP provide features such as electronic controls, multiple refrigerant compatibility, and operating ranges from -30°F to 45°F evaporator temperature. Regarding refrigerant regulations, there has been significant historical change. In 1987, the Montreal Protocol led to the phase-out of ozone-depleting CFCs and HCFCs. These were replaced by HFCs, which while not harmful to the ozone layer, are powerful greenhouse gases. This led to the 2016 Kigali Amendment, which established a timeline for phasing out HFCs, starting with high-income countries in 2019 and expanding to low-income countries in 2024 and 2028.","context":["Condensers, Evaporators that Enhance Energy Efficiencies\nIt used to be that condensers and evaporators were big, bulky and not even remotely energy efficient. Today, however, advanced technology has allowed “these big machines” to deliver an improved energy efficiency rating (EER) of up to 15%.\nRefrigerated & Frozen Foods spoke exclusively with Craig Raney, director of marketing, refrigeration for Emerson Climate Technologies, Sidney, Ohio, to find out how today’s condensers and evaporators enhance energy efficiencies.\nRefrigerated & Frozen Foods: What kinds of new condensers and evaporators have you developed over the last eight months? What are their applications?\nCraig Raney: Last August, we introduced the Copeland Scroll ZSKA compressor for restaurant and convenience store operators. The ZSKA models are intended for extended medium- to high temperature-type duty and are ideally suited for applications such as walk-in, reach-in, coolers, soft serve and frozen carbonated beverage.\nThis month, we introduced the Copeland Scroll FFAP condensing unit for end-users, contractors, wholesalers and OEMs. The FFAP condensing unit offers the latest technology and uses the efficient Copeland Scroll ZSKA refrigeration compressor and the Emerson Electric Unit Controller on all models. It is suited for applications ranging from floral shops to convenience stores to other retail establishments.\nR&FF: What kinds of unique and on-trend characteristics do they provide? Any energy-efficient features?\nRaney: The Copeland Scroll FFAP condensing unit comes equipped with the Emerson’s Electronic Unit Controller for built-in diagnostics, precise electronic controls and advanced system protection. It also has a wide operating range of -30˚F to 45˚F evaporator temperature and is designed to work with multiple refrigerants including R-404A, R-134a, R-407C and R-22. The Copeland Scroll FFAP condensing unit also delivers an improved energy efficiency rating of up to 15% compared to standard reciprocating condensing units. It is designed for up to 110˚F ambient temperature and is multi-refrigerant capable.\nR&FF: What are some essential attributes that today’s condensers and evaporators must contain in order to meet customer demands?\nRaney: The refrigeration market calls for higher efficiency and more reliable products. Aside from that, it is also necessary to meet the need for lower global warming potential refrigerants. Taking these needs into consideration, we introduced the FFAP condensing unit with up to 15% improved efficiency; comes with 70% fewer moving parts and superior liquid handling for unmatched reliability; and designed for multiple refrigerants.\nR&FF: What types of challenges does refrigerated and frozen food processors face when installing and using condensers and evaporators? How are you helping them to solve these problems?\nRaney: Improved performance and energy efficiency are paramount to our customers. One often ignored method to achieve these goals is through lowering the condensing (or head) pressure in refrigeration systems. The majority of refrigeration systems operate at fixed head pressures, which forces compressors to run at maximum output, regardless of the ambient temperature or demand. For decades, operators have been taught that maintaining fixed head pressures above 105°F was standard operating procedure.\nEmerson Climate now offers a low condensing operation that is a viable, energy-efficient and cost-effective alternative to the fixed head pressure method. Technological advances in electronic expansion (EX) valves are enabling existing systems to operate with floating head pressures. EX valves allow customers to lower the condensing points to drastically reduced minimum levels that are more closely aligned with the fluctuations in ambient temperatures throughout the day and across the seasons.\nSpecific advantages of low condensing include:\n• Lower energy consumption/costs.\n• Increase compressor capacity at lower condensing pressures.\n• Improve sustainability by reducing system charge (refrigerant reduction).\n• Maintenance cost reduction.\n• Electronic (EX) valve prevents compressor failure from flooding.\n• Utility incentives to upgrade system before it fails.","Energy costs of condensate and other waters\nThe following chart shows you the energy costs (from pumping, transport, cooling, and/or treatment) of various sources of water…\nNote the especially high end of the kWh/gallon range for on-site AC (air conditioning) condensate (an active condensate source). Active condensation occurs on mechanically cooled surfaces (surfaces cooler than the air temperature)—where a generated power source such as electricity is needed to cool the surface on which the atmospheric water (moisture in the air) condenses. Excerpted from Rainwater Harvesting for Drylands and Beyond, Volume 1, 3rd Edition.\nNote the typically free on-site waters highlighted above within the red borders — especially AC condensate—, and how their energy costs can range from 0 kWh per gallon/liter to 360 kWh per gallon (95 kWh per liter). A kWh is a kilowatt hour of energy.\nThe average household in\nArizona consumes 1,095 kWh/month\nU.S. consumes 920 kWh/month\nWorld 250 kWh/month\nThe zero energy costs for various water sources reflected in the chart above typically result from harvesting those waters with no energy-consuming pumps or water treatment. Energy costs are incurred once pumps or mechanical water treatment is used. Or, in the case of AC condensate, the high energy cost does not reflect the use of pumps, but rather the large amount of energy the air conditioning unit itself consumes when on.\nDue to the high-energy cost of the manufacture and use of air conditioning units (and their harmful chemical refrigerants – see next section), I don’t consider their condensate to be a truly sustainable on-site water source (even if renewable energy is the power source). But if air conditioners are already on site and used, you ought to at least harvest and use their condensate in beneficial ways, rather than just wastefully drain it away.\nSee appendix 9 of Rainwater Harvesting for Drylands and Beyond, Volume 1, 3rd Edition for charts and examples that show the water costs of different energy sources and the carbon costs of different energy sources in order to make more beneficial and informed choices in your life.\nThe refrigerant in air conditioners, refrigeration units, freezers, and ice machines is a major contributor to climate change\nAccording the book Drawdown, the number one cause of climate changing gases in our atmosphere is the chemical refrigerants used in refrigerators and air conditioners.1\nAs reported in the book, Losing Our Cool: Uncomfortable Truths About Our Air-Conditioned World (and Finding New Ways to Get Through the Summer) by Stan Cox, “The air-conditioning of buildings in America is responsible for a quantity of carbon dioxide equivalent to what would be produced if every household in the country bought an additional vehicle and drove it an average 7,000 miles (11,200 km) per year.”2\nThis is horrifying due to the massive use and ever-expanding growth of the use of such appliances. But the main problem is not the appliances, but the chemical refrigerants used within them. And as history shows there is a path that could remedy this.\nIn the past, the chemical refrigerants (specifically chlorofluorocarbons [CFCs] and hydrochlorofluorocarbons [HCFCs] used to absorb and release heat) in refrigerators and air conditioners used to deplete the ozone layer of our atmosphere, and created massive holes (over entire countries) in the ozone layer. That ozone layer is essential for healthy life on our planet because it absorbs, and protects us from, the sun’s ultraviolet radiation.\nThanks to countries around the world agreeing to, and signing, the 1987 Montreal Protocol on Substances That Deplete the Ozone Layer; CFCs, HCFCs, and other ozone-depleting chemicals such as those that used to be used in aerosol cans and dry cleaning; have been phased out of use. As stated in the book Drawdown, “It took two short years from the discovery of the gaping hole (in the ozone layer) over the Antarctic for the global community to adopt a legally mandated course of action. Now, three decades later, the ozone layer is beginning to heal.”3\nThe replacement chemical refrigerant to CFCs and HCFCs, is primarily hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), which does not destroy the ozone layer, but HFCs’ capacity to warm the atmosphere is one thousand to nine thousand times greater than that of carbon dioxide!4\nAs Drawdown states, “In October 2016, officials from more than 170 countries gathered in Kigali, Rwanda, to negotiate a deal to address the problem of HFCs. Despite challenging global politics, they reached a remarkable agreement. Through an amendment to the Montreal Protocol, the world will begin phasing HFCs out of use, starting with high-income countries in 2019 and then expanding to low-income countries — some in 2024, others in 2028. HFC substitutes are already on the market, including natural refrigerants such as propane and ammonium.”5\nThe Kigali Amendment took effect January 2019, and over 65 countries have ratified the agreement,6 but as of this writing the U.S. is not one of them.7 Though on January 27, 2021 President Biden took the first steps for U.S. ratification.8\nCommunicate to your politicians and policy makers the importance of ratifying the Kigali Amendment; and make changes in your own lives, by reducing or eliminating your reliance on, and use of, appliances using HFC refrigerant (Rainwater Harvesting for Drylands and Beyond, Volume 1, 3rd Edition gives you many strategies to do this), and dispose of the refrigerant in a way that will keep it out of the atmosphere (Construction and Demolition: How to Properly Dispose of Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Equipment, https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/documents/ConstrAndDemo_EquipDisposal.pdf, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, accessed 11-1-2019).\n1.

This is followed by a trip to the quay, where we will be feted to a boat excursion to the floating villages and rustic catfish farms where we will learn exciting facts about the breeding of Basa fish in the Mekong Delta. Then, it is back to the ship for a lunch.\nBy mid-afternoon, the cruise liner will make its way to the border for Phnom Penh, the capital city of Cambodia. It is an opportune time to relax on board, sharpen your culinary skills with our hands-on cooking classes or tour the ship with our impeccable Cruise Director. Or, better yet, do all three. “The Highway Blues” beckons as we float into a state of mild bliss caused by the hypnotic murmur of the ship’s engine. After hours of cruising, we will feel the rush of entering into a new country and to embrace new adventures.\nIncluding breakfast, lunch and dinner. Overnight midstream near Phnom Penh.\nNote: Due to high water in the Mekong Delta between July and December the following program applies: This morning, you will start your excursion on a local boat (sampan) and discover the border town of Tan Chau. Firstly, the journey takes you to the “evergreen” islands where you will be thrilled to learn the life of the locals.\nThe inhabitants of these islands live on houses poised on high stilts – a centuries-old tradition in this part of the Mekong Delta. We stop to visit a fish farm located in the Tan Chau canal – this farm consists of floating houses and the villagers make their living by cultivating fish. You continue by boat to Tan Chau pier, disembark here and stroll around this colorful local market with lots of regional products. You return to the cruise Ship after your market visit.\nOvernight on the Jahan Cruise.\nDAY 4: PHNOMPENH SIGHTSEEING (B/L/D)\nPhnom Penh was once the Paris of the East.

Overnight on the Jahan Cruise.\nDAY 5: PHNOMPENH - KAMPONG CHAM (B/L/D)\nWe will depart before the break of dawn from Phnom Penh with a stop at the little known Chong Koh silk weaving village. We will then return to the Ship and will cruise past the Mekong’s tranquil villages, exhilirating river life and sun-hardened fishermen on their shift boats.\nWe will tour the rural Angkor Ban village where time stood still. We are transported back a hundred years into an era unsullified by modernity. The houses here are truly rustic, made by hand and without any concrete. But most of all, we feel overwhelmed by the unbridled warmth of the villagers.\nTravelers can take part in the daily activities of the villagers to experience village life first hand. Then, we are back to the Ship to cruise towards Kampong Cham. Overnight on the Jahan Cruise.\nDAY 6: KAMPONG CHAM - WAT HANCHEY (B/L/D)\nWe will wake up in the small hours of the morning, truly energized to embark on a land journey to the pre-Angkorian temple of Wat Hanchey. Travelers either take a motor-taxi or climb 291 steps to the top. Located at the top of a hill overlooking the river, it offers one of the most breath-taking views in Cambodia. Built in the 8th century, this ancient structure, together with a bigger and newer addition underscores the superb architecture of the Chenla Empire which predates the mighty Angkor temple complex. We even get to engage in light banter with some of the monks in the area. We will return to the Ship to witness a blessing ceremony performed by orange-clad local monks.\nWhen the tide allows, we will enjoy a surprise sojourn in our zodiacs (inflatable boats) to the nearby bank to swim in the teacoloured Mekong River, an experience that will, no doubt, dominate dinner conversations in the weeks to come. We will then cruise towards Kampong Cham to visit Wat Nokor, a wat built within the ruins of an ancient temple which holds a timeless story. On the way back to the Ship, we will visit an orphanage. Along the way, we will have to maneuver a 2-kilometer rickety bamboo bridge. Our sense of balance lies in the balance! Overnight cruise to Kampong Chhnang.\nDAY 7: KAMPONG CHAM - KAMPONG CHHNANG - TONLE SAP (B/L/D)\nBefore the sun peeks over the horizon, the cruiser sets sail towards Kampong Chhnang on the Tonle River – an amazingly narrow river – which glides through leafy swaths of the Southeast Asian jungle. We are greeted by cacophonous children who waive enthusiastically early in the morning when they bring their livestock for a bath in the meandering Tonle River. Then we approach Kampong Chhnang, Cambodia’s “waterworld” where everything is on stilts balanced on water rich soil– it’s an awesome sight whilst practising Tai Chi on the deck.\nHere we take a motorboat excursion to the landing, followed by a short bus trip to see the Khmer-styled pottery at the Aundaung Russey village. Then, it is back to the river for an adventurous motorboat excursion to the wetlands, floating houses and fish farms in the region.\nWe then return to the Ship for lunch whilst cruising the narrow and meandering Tonle River. Your floating sanctuary will then cruise gently, in the afternoon, along the narrow and meandering Tonle River. In the evening, a sumptuous spread will be served. And for the big surprise – bring along your dance shoes and learn to jiggle the Cambodian way with our staff doubling up as dance instructors. (If you can’t dance, do not fret. Neither can our staff) Including breakfast, lunch and dinner. Overnight in Kampong Chhnang.\nDAY 8: TONLE SAP - SIEM REAP (B)\nThis great lake dominates Cambodia and is the largest freshwater lake in Asia with abundant birdlife. This lake is so wide that one can not see its shores from the middle of the lake.\nEnjoy the stillness of the water and the quiet tranquility on the way to Siem Reap. The water level varies a great deal according to the time of the year and the amount of rainfall recorded. Thus, minor changes to the itinerary may occur during different seasons.\nOur Heritage Line cruise liner comes to an end as we reach this city of the fabled Angkor temple complex. We bid farewell to the cruise as our journey comes to a close. But the memories and the friendships made on board linger on for a lot longer. We will cross the Tonle Lake at dawn and at 9.00h, we will disembark at the Siem Reap Port for onward coach transfer to the drop off point in town.\n(Per person in US$)\n(Per person in US$)\n|Superor State Room\n|Deluxe State Room\n|Signature Suites Room","Day 1 Arrive in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam\nWelcome to Ho Chi Minh City, still known as Saigon to many.

{"question":"What is the role of the renin-angiotensin mechanism in kidney regulation, and how can patients with kidney disease manage their blood pressure through medications related to this system?","answer":"The renin-angiotensin mechanism is activated when there's a fall in glomerular blood pressure. Juxtaglomerular cells release renin, which converts blood angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, which then becomes angiotensin II. As a vasoconstrictor, angiotensin II increases glomerular blood pressure and triggers aldosterone release from the adrenal cortex, promoting sodium and water reabsorption from distal tubules. For patients with chronic kidney disease, doctors often prescribe ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers to manage this system and protect kidney function. These medications must be taken daily as directed, and if patients experience side effects or cost concerns, they should discuss alternative solutions with their healthcare provider rather than discontinuing the medication.","context":["Table of contents\n- Excretory organs in variety of organisms\n- Human excretory system\n- Urine formation\n- Function of the tubules\n- Regulation of kidney function\nPlants and animals produce harmful substances formed due to metabolic reactions which must be removed from the body. It includes, urea, uric acid, ammonia, carbon-dioxide, water, ions etc. the 3 most important nitrogenous waste that should be removed from the body are urea, uric acid and ammonia. Out of these, ammonia is most toxic. Animals excreting ammonia as nitrogenous waste are known as Ammonotelic, such as most bony fishes, most aquatic amphibians etc. The excretion of ammonia occurs via diffusion. The organisms which excrete urea as nitrogenous waste, they are known as ureotelic. For Example, Mammals, Amphibians etc. are ureotelic. Those organisms which excrete uric acid as nitrogenous waste, they are known as Uricotelic. For Example, Birds, Reptiles, Snails etc.\n- Amoeba and Paramecium have contractile vacuole for excretion.\n- Sponges have canal system for excretion.\n- Hydra have coelenteron.\n- Platyhelminthes have flame cells for excretion.\n- Annelids have nephridia for excretion.\n- Prawns have green glands for excretion.\n- Insects have malpighian tubules for excretion.\n- Scorpions have Coxal glands for excretion.\nHuman excretory system consists of a pair of kidneys, a pair of ureter, urinary bladder, and urethra. Kidneys are bean shaped structure located in the abdominal cavity. Towards the center of the inner concave surface of the kidney is a notch called hilum. Ureter, blood vessels and nerves enter through hilum. Inner to the hilum is a funnel-shaped space known as Renal Pelvis with projections known as Calyces. Kidney is divided into two zones known as - Outer Cortex and Inner Medulla. The medulla is divided into conical masses known as Medullary Pyramids. Extension of renal cortex which separates the pyramids is known as column of Bertini.\nThe structural and functional unit of kidney are nephrons. Each nephron is made up of two parts- glomerulus and renal tubule.\nGlomerulus is the cluster of capillaries. The blood enters the glomerulus via afferent arteriole and leaves the glomerulus via efferent arteriole. Glomerulus is enclosed in a cup- shaped structure known as Bowman’s Capsule. Bowman’s capsule together with glomerulus is known as Malpighian body or renal corpuscles.\nFig. 2. Structure of the nephrons\nThe tubule continues to form a highly coiled structure known as Proximal Convoluted Tubule (PCT). The next part of the tubule is Henle’s loop which consists of ascending and descending limb. The ascending limb continues to form Distal Convoluted Tubule (DCT). The DCT opens into collecting duct.\nThere are two types of nephrons- cortical nephrons and medullary nephrons. When loop of Henle is short and extends only little to medulla are known as Cortical Nephrons. When loop of Henle is long and extends into the medulla are known as Medullary Nephrons.\nIt involves three main steps- glomerular filtration, tubular reabsorption, and secretion.\nGlomerular Filtration- During this process blood enter the glomerulus via afferent arteriole. Water and nitrogenous waste move into the glomerulus and blood cells, proteins exit the glomerulus through efferent arteriole. On an average, kidney filters about 1100 ml to 1200 ml of blood per minute. The glomerular capillary blood pressure causes filtration of blood through 3 layers- endothelium that surround the glomerular blood vessels, the epithelium of Bowman’s capsule and a basement membrane in between these two layers. The epithelial cells present in the Bowman’s capsule are known as Podocytes which are arranged in an intricate manner to leave some minute spaces called Filtration Slits or Slit Pores.\nThe amount of filtrate produced by the kidneys per minute is known as Glomerular Filtration Rate.\nFig. 3. Steps of urine formation\nTubular reabsorption- it involves the absorption of required molecules or ions such as sodium ions, glucose, amino acids etc. Some of the substances are absorbed actively and some are absorbed passively. Glucose, amino acids are absorbed actively whereas water is absorbed passively.\nThe last step of urine formation is secretion. Potassium ions, hydrogen ions, ammonia are secreted out to maintain the ionic and acid balance of the body fluids.\nProximal Convoluted Tubules (PCT) is lined by cuboidal brush border epithelium. 70-80% of electrolytes and water are reabsorbed in PCT. Secretion of hydrogen ions, potassium ions, ammonium ions also occurs into the filtrate.\nHenle’s loop, very less reabsorption occurs in ascending limb. It is impermeable to water, but permeable to electrolyte. Descending limb absorbs most of the water, making the filtrate concentrated. Descending limb is almost impermeable to electrolyte.\nFig. 4. Function of the tubules\nDistal convoluted tubule, reabsorption of water, bicarbonate ions and sodium ions occurs. Secretion of potassium ions and hydrogen ions to maintain the electrolyte balance of the fluid.\nCollecting duct, reabsorbs large amount of water to make the urine concentrated. Secretion of hydrogen ions and potassium ions also takes place in collecting duct. It maintains the ionic balance and pH of blood.\nKidney function is regulated by hypothalamus, Juxtaglomerular Apparatus (JGA) and heart. Changes in the blood volume, ionic balance activates the osmoreceptors in the body. This stimulates the hypothalamus to release Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH), also known as Vasopressin. This helps in the reabsorption of water from the tubules and prevents diuresis. This increase the blood volume and switch off the osmoreceptors for negative feedback mechanism.\nThe JGA is activated during fall in glomerular blood pressure. Juxtaglomerular cells release the renin which converts angiotensinogen in blood to angiotensin I which gets further converted to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II is a vasoconstrictor, so it increases the glomerular blood pressure. Angiotensin II also acts on adrenal cortex to release aldosterone to increase sodium ion and water reabsorption from the distal tubules. This mechanism is known as Renin-Angiotensin Mechanism.\nFig. 5. Regulation of kidney function by renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system\nHeart release Atrial Natriuretic Factor (ANF) which causes vasodilation to decrease the blood pressure. It acts as a negative feedback mechanism for renin-angiotensin mechanism.\nUrine formed in the nephrons is carried to the urinary bladder where it is stored until voluntary signal is given by the central nervous system. When urinary bladder is stretched, it gets filled with the urine. Stretch receptors present on the walls of the urinary bladder sends signal to the central nervous system. CNS initiates the contraction of the smooth muscles of the bladder allowing relaxation of urethral sphincter to release urine. This process of release of urine is known as Micturition. An adult human excretes, on an average, 1 to 1.5 liters of urine per day. The urine formed is a light yellow colored watery fluid which is slightly acidic (pH-6.0) and has a characteristic odor.\nWatch this Video for more reference","CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE\nWhat is chronic kidney disease?\nChronic kidney disease is when the kidneys stop working as well as they should. When they are working normally, the kidneys filter the blood and remove waste and excess salt and water.\nIn people with chronic kidney disease, the kidneys slowly lose the ability to filter the blood. In time, the kidneys can stop working completely. That is why it is so important to keep chronic kidney disease from getting worse.\nWhat are the symptoms of chronic kidney disease?\nAt first, chronic kidney disease causes no symptoms. As the disease gets worse, it can:\nMake your feet, ankles, or legs swell (doctors call this \"edema\")\nGive you high blood pressure\nMake you very tired\nDamage your bones\nIs there anything I can do to keep my kidneys from getting worse if I have chronic kidney disease?\nYes, you can protect your kidneys by:\nTaking blood pressure and other medicines every day, if your doctor or nurse prescribes them to you.\nKeeping your blood sugar in a healthy range, if you have diabetes.\nChanging your diet, if your doctor or nurse says you should.\nAvoiding medicines known as \"nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs,\" or NSAIDs. These medicines include ibuprofen (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin) and naproxen (sample brand name: Aleve). Check with your doctor, nurse, or kidney specialist before starting any new medicines—even over-the-counter ones.\nWhat are the treatments for chronic kidney disease?\nPeople in the early stages of chronic kidney disease can take medicines to keep the disease from getting worse. For example, many people with chronic kidney disease should take medicines known as \"ACE inhibitors\" or \"angiotensin receptor blockers.\" If your doctor or nurse prescribes these medicines, it is very important that you take them every day as directed. If they cause side effects or cost too much, speak to your doctor or nurse about it. He or she might have solutions to offer.\nWhat happens if my kidneys stop working completely?\nIf your kidneys stop working completely, you can choose between 3 different treatments to take over the job of your kidneys. Your choices are described below.\nYou can have kidney transplant surgery. That way, the new kidney can do the job of your own kidneys. If you have a kidney transplant, you will need to take medicines for the rest of your life to keep your body from reacting badly to the new kidney. (You only need 1 kidney to live.)\nYou can have your blood filtered by a machine. This treatment is called \"hemodialysis,\" but many people call it just \"dialysis.\" If you choose this approach, you will need to be hooked up to the machine at least 3 times a week for a few hours for the rest of your life. Before you start, you will also need to have surgery to prepare a blood vessel for attachment to the machine.\nYou can learn to use a special fluid that has to be piped in and out of your belly every day. This treatment is called \"peritoneal dialysis.\" If you choose this type of dialysis, you will need surgery to have a tube implanted in your belly. Then you will have to learn how to pipe the fluid in and out through that tube.\nHow do I choose between the different treatment options?\nYou and your doctor will need to work together to find a treatment that's right for you. Kidney transplant surgery is usually the best option for most people. But often there are no kidneys available for transplant.\nAsk your doctor to explain all of your options and how they might work for you. Then talk openly with him or her about how you feel about all of the options. You might even decide that you do not want any treatment. That is your choice.\nNEW PATIENT REGISTRATION\nThe American Heart Association recommends a diet based on DASH. Learn More //\nA healthy lifestyle is key to a long life.

{"question":"What's the key cognitive challenge shared between Bertrand's box paradox and Monty Hall problem?","answer":"Both problems demonstrate humans' difficulty in processing probability concepts correctly. In Bertrand's box paradox, a survey showed that only 3 out of 53 psychology students correctly identified the 2/3 probability, with most incorrectly answering 1/2. Similarly, the Monty Hall problem shows how people struggle to accept that switching doors gives a 2/3 probability of winning, incorrectly believing it should be 50/50. This reflects a fundamental human cognitive limitation in representing and processing probabilistic information.","context":["Bertrand's box paradox\nThere are three boxes:\n- a box containing two gold coins,\n- a box containing two silver coins,\n- a box containing one gold coin and a silver coin.\nThe 'paradox' is in the probability, after choosing a box at random and withdrawing one coin at random, if that happens to be a gold coin, of the next coin also being a gold coin.\nThese simple but counterintuitive puzzles are used as a standard example in teaching probability theory. Their solution illustrates some basic principles, including the Kolmogorov axioms.\nIt may seem that the probability that the remaining coin is gold is 1/, but in truth, the probability is actually 2/. If a gold coin was withdrawn in the first step, it is more likely that this happens because the chosen box is number 1 (the box with two gold coins) than box number 3 (the box with one coin of each type).\nThere are three boxes, each with one drawer on each of two sides. Each drawer contains a coin. One box has a gold coin on each side (GG), one a silver coin on each side (SS), and the other a gold coin on one side and a silver coin on the other (GS). A box is chosen at random, a random drawer is opened, and a gold coin is found inside it. What is the chance of the coin on the other side being gold?\nThe following reasoning appears to give a probability of 1/:\n- Originally, all three boxes were equally likely to be chosen.\n- The chosen box cannot be box SS.\n- So it must be box GG or GS.\n- The two remaining possibilities are equally likely. So the probability that the box is GG, and the other coin is also gold, is 1/.\nThe flaw is in the last step. While those two cases were originally equally likely, the fact that you are certain to find a gold coin if you had chosen the GG box, but are only 50% sure of finding a gold coin if you had chosen the GS box, means they are no longer equally likely given that you have found a gold coin. Specifically:\n- The probability that GG would produce a gold coin is 1.\n- The probability that SS would produce a gold coin is 0.\n- The probability that GS would produce a gold coin is 1/.\nInitially GG, SS and GS are equally likely. Therefore, by Bayes rule the conditional probability that the chosen box is GG, given we have observed a gold coin, is:\nThe correct answer of 2/ can also be obtained as follows:\n- Originally, all six coins were equally likely to be chosen.\n- The chosen coin cannot be from drawer S of box GS, or from either drawer of box SS.\n- So it must come from the G drawer of box GS, or either drawer of box GG.\n- The three remaining possibilities are equally likely, so the probability that the drawer is from box GG is 2/.\nAlternatively, one can simply note that the chosen box has two coins of the same type 2/ of the time. So, regardless of what kind of coin is in the chosen drawer, the box has two coins of that type 2/ of the time. In other words, the problem is equivalent to asking the question \"What is the probability that I will pick a box with two coins of the same color?\".\nBertrand's point in constructing this example was to show that merely counting cases is not always proper. Instead, one should sum the probabilities that the cases would produce the observed result; and the two methods are equivalent only if this probability is either 1 or 0 in every case. This condition is correctly applied in the second solution method, but not in the first.\nThe paradox as stated by Bertrand\nIt can be easier to understand the correct answer if you consider the paradox as Bertrand originally described it. After a box has been chosen, but before a box is opened to let you observe a coin, the probability is 2/ that the box has two of the same kind of coin. If the probability of \"observing a gold coin\" in combination with \"the box has two of the same kind of coin\" is 1/, then the probability of \"observing a silver coin\" in combination with \"the box has two of the same kind of coin\" must also be 1/. And if the probability that the box has two like coins changes to 1/ no matter what kind of coin is shown, the probability would have to be 1/ even if you hadn't observed a coin this way. Since we know his probability is 2/, not 1/, we have an apparent paradox. It can be resolved only by recognizing how the combination of \"observing a gold coin\" with each possible box can only affect the probability that the box was GS or SS, but not GG.\nSuppose there are three cards:\n- A black card that is black on both sides,\n- A white card that is white on both sides, and\n- A mixed card that is black on one side and white on the other.\nAll the cards are placed into a hat and one is pulled at random and placed on a table. The side facing up is black. What are the odds that the other side is also black?\nThe answer is that the other side is black with probability 2/. However, common intuition suggests a probability of 1/ either because there are two cards with black on them that this card could be, or because there are 3 white and 3 black sides and many people forget to eliminate the possibility of the \"white card\" in this situation (i.e. the card they flipped CANNOT be the \"white card\" because a black side was turned over).\nIn a survey of 53 Psychology freshmen taking an introductory probability course, 35 incorrectly responded 1/; only 3 students correctly responded 2/.\nAnother presentation of the problem is to say : pick a random card out of the three, what are the odds that it has the same color on the other side? Since only one card is mixed and two have the same color on their sides, it is easier to understand that the probability is 2/. Also note that saying that the color is black (or the coin is gold) instead of white doesn't matter since it is symmetric: the answer is the same for white. So is the answer for the generic question 'same color on both sides'.\nTo solve the problem, either formally or informally, one must assign probabilities to the events of drawing each of the six faces of the three cards. These probabilities could conceivably be very different; perhaps the white card is larger than the black card, or the black side of the mixed card is heavier than the white side. The statement of the question does not explicitly address these concerns. The only constraints implied by the Kolmogorov axioms are that the probabilities are all non-negative, and they sum to 1.\nThe custom in problems when one literally pulls objects from a hat is to assume that all the drawing probabilities are equal. This forces the probability of drawing each side to be 1/, and so the probability of drawing a given card is 1/. In particular, the probability of drawing the double-white card is 1/, and the probability of drawing a different card is 2/.\nIn question, however, one has already selected a card from the hat and it shows a black face. At first glance it appears that there is a 50/50 chance (i.e. probability 1/) that the other side of the card is black, since there are two cards it might be: the black and the mixed. However, this reasoning fails to exploit all of the information; one knows not only that the card on the table has at least one black face, but also that in the population it was selected from, only 1 of the 3 black faces was on the mixed card.\nAn easy explanation is that to name the black sides as x, y and z where x and y are on the same card while z is on the mixed card, then the probability is divided on the 3 black sides with 1/ each. thus the probability that we chose either x or y is the sum of their probabilities thus 2/.\nIntuition tells one that one is choosing a card at random. However, one is actually choosing a face at random. There are 6 faces, of which 3 faces are white and 3 faces are black. 2 of the 3 black faces belong to the same card. The chance of choosing one of those 2 faces is 2/. Therefore, the chance of flipping the card over and finding another black face is also 2/. Another way of thinking about it is that the problem is not about the chance that the other side is black, it's about the chance that you drew the all black card. If you drew a black face, then it's twice as likely that that face belongs to the black card than the mixed card.\nAlternately, it can be seen as a bet not on a particular color, but a bet that the sides match. Betting on a particular color regardless of the face shown, will always have a chance of 1/. However, betting that the sides match is 2/, because 2 cards match and 1 does not.\nOne solution method is to label the card faces, for example numbers 1 through 6. Label the faces of the black card 1 and 2; label the faces of the mixed card 3 (black) and 4 (white); and label the faces of the white card 5 and 6. The observed black face could be 1, 2, or 3, all equally likely; if it is 1 or 2, the other side is black, and if it is 3, the other side is white. The probability that the other side is black is 2/. This probability can be derived in the following manner: Let random variable B equal the a black face (i.e. the probability of a success since the black face is what we are looking for). Using Kolmogrov's Axiom of all probabilities having to equal 1, we can conclude that the probability of drawing a white face is 1 − P(B). Since P(B) = P(1) + P(2) therefore P(B) = 1/ + 1/ = 2/. Likewise we can do this P(white face)=1 − 2/ = 1/.\nGiven that the shown face is black, the other face is black if and only if the card is the black card. If the black card is drawn, a black face is shown with probability 1. The total probability of seeing a black face is 1/; the total probability of drawing the black card is 1/. By Bayes' theorem, the conditional probability of having drawn the black card, given that a black face is showing, is\nIt can be more intuitive to present this argument using Bayes' rule rather than Bayes' theorem. Having seen a black face we can rule out the white card. We are interested in the probability that the card is black given a black face is showing. Initially it is equally likely that the card is black and that it is mixed: the prior odds are 1:1. Given that it is black we are certain to see a black face, but given that it is mixed we are only 50% certain to see a black face. The ratio of these probabilities, called the likelihood ratio or Bayes factor, is 2:1. Bayes' rule says \"posterior odds equals prior odds times likelihood ratio\". Since the prior odds are 1:1 the posterior odds equals the likelihood ratio, 2:1. It is now twice as likely that the card is black than that it is mixed.\nEliminating the white card\nAlthough the incorrect solution reasons that the white card is eliminated, one can also use that information in a correct solution. Modifying the previous method, given that the white card is not drawn, the probability of seeing a black face is 3/, and the probability of drawing the black card is 1/. The conditional probability of having drawn the black card, given that a black face is showing, is\nThe probability (without considering the individual colors) that the hidden color is the same as the displayed color is clearly 2/, as this holds if and only if the chosen card is black or white, which chooses 2 of the 3 cards. Symmetry suggests that the probability is independent of the color chosen, so that the information about which color is shown does not affect the odds that both sides have the same color.\nThis argument is correct and can be formalized as follows. By the law of total probability, the probability that the hidden color is the same as the displayed color equals the weighted average of the probabilities that the hidden color is the same as the displayed color, given that the displayed color is black or white respectively (the weights are the probabilities of seeing black and white respectively). By symmetry, the two conditional probabilities that the colours are the same given we see black and given we see white are the same. Since they moreover average out to 2/ they must both be equal to 2/.\nUsing specially constructed cards, the choice can be tested a number of times. Let \"B\" denote the colour Black. By constructing a fraction with the denominator being the number of times \"B\" is on top, and the numerator being the number of times both sides are \"B\", the experimenter will probably find the ratio to be near 2/.\nNote the logical fact that the B/B card contributes significantly more (in fact twice) to the number of times \"B\" is on top. With the card B/W there is always a 50% chance W being on top, thus in 50% of the cases card B/W is drawn, the draw affects neither numerator nor denominator and effectively does not count (this is also true for all times W/W is drawn, so that card might as well be removed from the set altogether). Conclusively, the cards B/B and B/W are not of equal chances, because in the 50% of the cases B/W is drawn, this card is simply \"disqualified\".\nNotes and references\n- ^ Bar-Hillel and Falk (page 119)\n- ^ Nickerson (page 158) advocates this solution as \"less confusing\" than other methods.\n- ^ Bar-Hillel and Falk (page 120) advocate using Bayes' Rule.\n- Bar-Hillel, Maya; Falk, Ruma (1982). \"Some teasers concerning conditional probabilities\".

If you are familiar with it, but you’ve always struggled with an unsettled feeling of “this can’t be right”, read further and let me know if my explanation of the solution helps to alleviate the discomfort. If you are not familiar, I guarantee you will give your brain a workout by reading on.\nFirst posed to statisticians in 1975, “The Monty Hall Problem” is well-known among academics because it still sparks debate. Many seem to think that disagreements about its solution stem from issues in the clarity of the problem, but I contend that it really stems from human flaws in the way that we process information.\nI often discuss this problem in statistics and cognitive psychology courses for several reasons. It is a great exercise in probability calculation and it can be used to teach basic mathematical modeling (and its purpose). An added benefit, since almost all of my students were psychology majors, is that it also illustrates a flaw in human cognition as well as a pattern of problem solving. Even a knowledgeable statistician feels the need to run simulations to see the solution in action. Even then, fully grasping the mechanisms behind the answer often requires brute force cognition.\nIn general, human beings have a very difficult time wrapping their brains around concepts of probability. It is much like a visual illusion; we know that the lines are parallel/the circles are the same size/there is no motion, but we can’t make our brains process it in a way that represents that reality. It’s just not how our visual system works. I hypothesize that one of the reasons that probability is such a difficult field for most people is that it involves theory and models, which are distinct from observations and we must represent them differently in our minds to properly deal with them. Applications of probability often involve switching gears from the realm of models to data or vice versa and this is where I think most mathematicians get side-swiped in The Monty Hall Problem.\nIn essence, here’s the problem:\nYou are a contestant on Let’s Make a Deal! and Monty loves your creative costume (a teddy bear carrying a human doll), so he calls on you to make a deal. Monty says, “There are three doors – Door #1, Door #2, and Door #3. Pick one and you get to keep whatever is behind it.”\nYou’ve seen the show (you weren’t just walking down Ventura Boulevard in a teddy bear costume for fun), so you know that it is highly likely that there is a coveted BRAND NEW CAR! behind one of those three doors. If you choose wrong, however, you might end up with an ostrich…\nYou choose Door #3.\nMonty then says, “Let’s see what’s behind Door #1!” and the door opens to reveal one of the many consolation prizes (and product placements), a lifetime supply of Rice a la Roly.\nCool! You might get that car after all!\nWell, the show was successful because the shell-game-huckster-style of Monty Hall rarely stopped there. In this case, he does what he often does, offers to let you switch from your first choice (Door #3) to the only remaining option, Door #2.\nShould you? Does it matter?\nNot the Problem\nBefore I get into the solution, let me first deflect a common complaint from mathematicians. The most well-known version of the problem, from its Wikipedia entry:\nSuppose you’re on a game show, and you’re given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1 [but the door is not opened], and the host, who knows what’s behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, “Do you want to pick door No. 2?” Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?\nThis version does not specifically state the name of the show or indicate the way that game shows of its era worked. If you have never seen the television show (i.e., you are younger than 35), or any game show of its kind, let me explain. Monty is in control of almost everything that happens. The only thing “contestants” can do is make choices when Monty offers them. As you will see, they had more control over their odds of winning than once thought, but Monty manipulates some of the build-up by choosing which items to reveal at different steps in the game.\nUnfortunately, many probability theorists and mathematicians took issue with the lack of clarity in the problem (context is important sometimes). This provides a face-saving ‘other version’ for the geeks who get it wrong the first time. But whenever I hear comments like, “Okay, given this version, that Monty knows where the car is.” I usually think, “Of COURSE he knows where the car is! There is no other way to play the game!” and wish that people were more able to accept that they are just as human as everyone else.\nThe problem itself is written clearly, though: it specifically states that a door without a car behind it is revealed before you are given the option to switch. If the situation was a fully-randomized, double-blind game (like “Deal or No Deal”), then the option to switch would not even be on the table if the car is behind the revealed door. There would be no problem in that case. Therefore, the problem is a question of whether you should switch in a controlled setting – one in which the only participant who doesn’t know the location of the big prize is you.\nThe issue of knowledge is a factor in our processing of the problem, but it’s not what Monty knows that matters. It’s what you (the subject of the problem) know.\nSo, let’s put that complaint behind us and get back to the problem.\nThe Answer, and How to See it for Yourself\nHopefully, if the problem is new to you, you’ve spent some time trying to solve it instead of going with your first gut feeling, which was probably, “It doesn’t matter.”\nIt does. You should switch.\nIf you don’t believe me, try running some simulations. You’ll have to run a lot in order to get a large enough sample to be certain to see the trend, but here are a few ways to do it:\n- Use your favorite program (MATLAB, R, etc.). There is a good database of pre-written simulators for this here. I am partial to Excel myself, even though it’s a bit more cumbersome. I just don’t remember enough code to use another program.\n- Use a web-based simulator. Do it at least a hundred times, choosing to switch for half of the trials, and keep a tally your results.\n- Use a die to simulate the outcome, assigning 1-3 to “Door #2″ and 4-6 to “Door #3″ (e.g., if you roll a 5, Door #3 is the one with the car). Roll at least a hundred times, choosing to switch for half of the trials (before rolling!). Keep a tally of the results.\nWhat you will see is that switching will result in winning a car in approximately 2/3rds of the trials while staying will only provide a win in 1/3rd of them.\nI know what you’re thinking. “But, there are only two doors left, so it should be 50/50!”\nWhy it is so Difficult to Accept\nHuman cognitive development is an interesting process. We learn to interpret information from the environment very quickly so that we can respond to that environment, but learning to reason hypothetically takes more time. Even adults with scientific training have a difficult time separating the concept of variables (each has a set of possible values) and data (values which are known).\nIn practice, hypothetical situations are often conditional (e.g., “If A, then B”). We tend to use information about what is to reason about what could be. We do this because it often works, but it is one of the ways in which our brains can lead us astray. For example, given the premise, “If I study, I will get a good grade on the exam”, what is the most sound conclusion when presented with a good grade? The most common response is, “I must have studied”, but that is not sound. In this premise, studying provides a guarantee for a good grade, but there is no statement that studying is the only way to get a good grade. It does not, for example, read, “If and only if I study…”\nIn the case of the Monty Hall Problem, the probability of winning is set before you pick a door. No matter which door you choose, the probability is 1/3rd. This is because there is a 1/3rd probability that the car is behind the door you chose given the information you had when you chose it. In reality, the car is behind one of the doors, so the probability it is behind Door #2 is 100% if it is there and 0% if it is not there. Probability is not a useful way to discuss what is or what happened; it is a tool for predicting what is likely to be true/happen.\nThe new information provided by revealing a loser changes the circumstances and this where we get trapped in our representations of models and data, possibilities and facts.\nYou had a 1/3rd chance of winning because there were three, equally-likely locations to choose from. It seems as if cutting the choice down to two should change the odds of winning to 1/2. It seems that way because we are focused on the probability that a given piece of information is true (e.g., that the car is behind Door #1) and not the probability that an event will occur (e.g., that we will win the car). The probability that we will win the car relies on the number of possible states of reality. This, in turn, initially relies on the number of locations for the car. When the situation changes, we try to adjust probabilities based on possible locations (which has changed) rather than on the number of possible states of reality (which has not).\nBasically, when Monty makes the second offer, the offer is to switch from the door we have (#3) to the door we don’t have (#1 or #2). It does not matter that only one of those doors is left; there is still only a 1/3rd chance that our door has the car and a 2/3rd chance that the set of the other two contains the car.\nIf you change the way you represent the problem from the beginning, the solution might seem more reasonable. Specifically, instead of thinking in terms of assigning probabilities to doors, think in terms of assigning probabilities to outcomes: winning versus losing.\nLet’s go step by step…\nMonty asks you to pick a door from three choices. Behind one of those doors is a car. There are three possible locations and it must be in one of them, so there are three possible states of reality.\nYou choose to bet on Door #3; there is a 1/3rd chance that you will win the car.\nThere is a 2/3rd chance that you will not win the car.\nThis would be true no matter which door you chose.\nMonty reveals that one of the remaining doors is a loser. At least one will be a loser since there is only one winner and you can choose only one. The car, however, does not move. Even though there are only two locations left, so there are still three possible states of reality. What’s changed is that we now know more about each of those possible states (there are fewer locations for the car to be):\nSo, if we model the problem in terms of the probability of winning with Door #3, the model itself does not change after the losing door is revealed. What changes is that we would no longer want to choose that door, so it is no longer among our options. This leaves us with only two options: keep the door we have or switch to the remaining door. The odds of winning/losing with Door #3 have not changed, but eliminating an option allows us to make a better choice – switch.\nBarbara Drescher is a former educator and researcher, having taught research methods, statistics, and cognitive psychology at CSU Northridge for a decade.

{"question":"What were the contrasting approaches to documenting the Japanese-American internment experience between Mr. Hori at the Panama Hotel and photographer Dorothea Lange?","answer":"Mr. Hori and Dorothea Lange took different approaches to documenting the internment experience. Mr. Hori operated informally, not recording what people stored in his hotel's basement, though he remembered who left their possessions, managing everything based on trust under difficult circumstances. In contrast, Dorothea Lange formally documented the internment through photography, having been hired by the War Relocation Authority. She systematically captured about 800 photographs showing middle-class American citizens in poor conditions, including people living in horse stalls with open sewers, guard towers, and barbed wire fences. However, military officials censored her work, marking the prints as 'Impounded' and preventing public access to these images for many years.","context":["In early 1942, the US government plastered the telephone poles with posters stating that all Japanese living within a certain boundary were to report to the government office by certain date in March and the Japanese were to be evacuated from the city. The Japanese newspapers also cooperated with the government because many of the Issei, Japanese immigrants, couldn’t read English. No one knew what was going on and because of this sudden announcement, there was obviously much confusion. The government had an office downtown where people could come and ask questions. All they could do was comply, they felt like they had no choice. There was no option of returning to Japan and where could they run to? All they knew was that upon registering, you were told what could and could not take to “camp”. In reality they weren’t allowed much, only what they could carry, that’s all.\nWith so little time between when the posters went up to the time of their departure date, many Japanese started to worry about their possessions. No one knew if they would ever come back, which obviously caused a lot of anxiety. In 1942, very few Japanese owned their home because real estate property wasn’t available to the issei. Those that were able to purchase, did so under their children’s names, who were American citizens. So, for the majority, their largest assets were cars. While many sold their cars, some asked friends to look after them. It’s really difficult to imagine what was going through everyone’s minds. Here was a whole community who built their lives from nothing, who were living normal lives one day and then the next, they were told they had to give it all up in such unknown and unjust circumstances. With no idea of the future, many felt they were left with little choice, but to sell and go. There were those who ended up selling their business in a hurry, for next to nothing. For Mr. Hori and the Panama Hotel, he said the equity in his business was so low, that if he sold it, he would come out with next to nothing.\nFortunately, he had friends at a local real estate company who offered to help him. They hired a management company to run his hotel, while he was away. But after a while, they wrote saying that they couldn’t make ends meet because they weren’t able to make enough money when they hired a manager to run it. Instead, they suggested he lease it to someone who would run it like an owner operator. That way they could charge a fixed flat fee, while the operators were able to run a profit. This turned out to be a good decision.\nAs they were all trying to figure out what to do with their lives which were suddenly thrown into chaos, the owner of Ryokoken Café, Mr. Fujii, approached Mr. Hori to ask if he could store his things in the basement of the hotel. Mr. Fujii decided not to sell but instead close his restaurant during their time away. However, he had equipment, dishes, and inventory from the restaurant that needed to be stored. It never dawned on Mr. Hori that his basement could be used for the community. Once he agreed to let Mr. Fujii use the space, the employees from the Ryokoken Cafe came by asking if they could leave their possessions there too. Gradually, through word of mouth, many families started to store their belongings in the basement of the Panama Hotel, and soon it was packed to the ceiling. All the Japanese churches, such as the Nichiren Church and the Buddhist Church, also offered their space to their members. I asked Mr. Hori if he recorded what people brought. He said, he didn’t think about that at the time, but he did remember who left their possessions. It was all done based on trust as everyone was just doing their best under the circumstances. After the war, the owners often remembered exactly where in the basement they left their belongings.\nThese are some of the items that were left in Mr. Hori’s basement and is now on display in the coffee shop at the Panama Hotel. Some of the families never came back to pick up their items. This puzzled me. But, he said it was probably because they just wanted to move on with life and leave the past and those memories behind. In fact, after the war, the fire department was going to fine the hotel because of all the items left in the basement. However, Mrs. Hori was so kind hearted and said they couldn’t just throw everyone’s belongings out. She ended up paying for a sprinkler system so that they could leave everything in place until the owners were able to pick up their belongings.\nTo be continued….","Seventy-five years ago, on February 19th, 1942, Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order #9066 forcing all West Coast people of Japanese ancestry to leave their homes for confinement in inland detention camps. The families only had a few days to prepare and could only bring what they could carry. Successful businesses, farms ripe with crops, houses, cars, pets, Victory gardens, all had to be hastily sold, leased, given away, or abandoned. The majority of the “evacuees” were imprisoned from 1942 to 1946 without criminal charges or trial. By the end of the war, most had lost everything and had to start over from scratch.\nThis photograph by Dorothea Lange shows an art student at the Tanforan Assembly Center in San Bruno, California, June 16, 1942. The evacuation ordeal is only two months old. Already University of California art professor Chiura Obata has set up art classes for his fellow detainees. This woman is probably only a few miles from home at this point but she’ll end up living in some horrid dusty “camp” in Utah or Arizona for years. She doesn’t know any of this yet. Perhaps art will help her survive. As Delphine Hirasuna wrote, “Everything was lost, except the courage to create.”*\nAs with all of Dorothea Lange’s photographs, this one is beautifully composed and executed. There’s a compositional tension between the vertical streaks of sunlight coming through the doors behind the artist, and the soft light washing over the horizontal surfaces of the tables. The placement of the larger tables focuses our eye on the small table holding the still life. Beneath the fruit bowl is a folded newspaper. It’s the Pacific Citizen, a weekly journal published by the Japanese American Citizens League. The headline is about the Relocation Centers. The paper has just moved from San Francisco to Salt Lake City to avoid being shut down. It will become the communication lifeline for the imprisoned Japanese American community. The whole scene conveys a quiet strength and dignity.\nThis image, and about 800 more of Dorothea’s Internment Camp photographs, were censored. Even though the War Relocation Authority hired Lange to document the “evacuation,” military officials quietly made sure the public never saw the photographs. For many years after the war, Dorothea didn’t know what had become of her work. Eventually, the prints showed up in the National Archives with “Impounded” written across them.\nThose in power didn’t want the public to see photographs of well-dressed, middle-class American citizens, mostly women and children, living in horse stalls with open sewers flowing outside their doors. There could be no pictures of guard towers, barbed wire fences, armed soldiers, and especially resistance. No one was supposed to see the depression and despair on the people’s faces. They had been good neighbors, fellow students, church members, valued customers, and upstanding citizens but now, according to war-time propaganda, they looked like the enemy.\nDorothea didn’t see it that way. She had friends behind the barbed wire and quietly focused her camera on the injustice. Others would have to censor her vision.\n* from The Art of Gaman: Arts and Crafts from the Japanese American Internment Camps 1942-1946 by Delphine Hirasuna.\nFor more of Dorothea’s photographs see: Impounded: Dorothea Lange and the Censored Images of Japanese American Internment by Linda Gordon and Gary Y.

{"question":"How to safely plan a visit to the Masai Mara National Reserve during peak season, considering the climate and health precautions?","answer":"To safely plan your visit to Masai Mara during peak season (December-March or July-October), follow these steps: 1) Choose your transportation - either take a 5-hour road journey from Nairobi (4x4 vehicle recommended) or a 45-minute flight to one of the airstrips (Musiara, Keekorok, or Ol Kiombo). 2) Pack appropriate health supplies including malaria prophylactics, mosquito repellent, and treated nets. 3) Prepare for sun protection with high-factor sunscreen, lip balm, wide-brimmed hats, and good sunglasses. 4) Stay hydrated in the 30°C daytime temperatures. 5) Book accommodation in advance, choosing from options ranging from luxury lodges like Mara Intrepids Club to budget-friendly camping sites like Oloolaimutiek Campsite.","context":["The Masai Mara National Reserve is a large game reserve located within the Great Rift Valley in the southern part of Kenya. The Reserve, bordered by the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania to the south, the Siria Escarpment to the west, and Masai pastoral ranches to the north, east and west, covers an area of 1,510 km2. The name Masai is in honor of the Maasai people, the ancestral residents of the region whilst Mara means spotted in the local Maasai or Maa language, relating to how the people depict the area when viewed from afar, due to the many trees that spot the land.\nThe Masai Mara landscape is mainly open savannah with collections of Acacia trees along the south eastern part of the Reserve. The Mara, Sand and Talek Rivers and Mara River are the main rivers feeding the Reserve together with numerous seasonal rivers that emerge during the rainy season.\nThe Masai Mara Reserve gives the best view of the famous wildebeest migration as the animals cross the Mara River between July and August. The Zebra, Eland, Topi and Thomson’s Gazelle also migrate into and occupy the Reserve from the Serengeti plains from July to October. The Mara also plays host to the richest concentration of game including the Big Five, the Elephant, Buffalo, Rhino, Leopard and Lion as well as the Hartebeest, Warthog, Gnu, Oribi, Antelope, Hyena, Cheetah, Jackal, the Masai Giraffe, bat-eared Fox and the Black-maned Lion. The waters of the Talek and Mara rivers hold large groups of the Hippo and Crocodile.\nOver 470 bird species can be spotted in the Reserve, many of which are migrants. The ones that call Maasai Mara home for at least part of the year include the Crowned Crane, Vulture, Ostrich, Marabou Stock, Long-crested Eagle, Secretary Bird, African Pygmy Falcon, Hornbill and Lilac-breasted Roller. There is also the Pel`s Fishing Owl, Red-winged Schalow’s Turaco, Jackson Bustard, White-tipped Crest, wary Guinea Fowl, Orange Buff and the Ross Turaco.\nThe Masai Mara Reserve can be accessed by road from Nairobi and the journey takes about five hours. Though the roads are all weather roads, a four wheel drive vehicle is required during the wet season.\nThe Reserve can also be reached by air through the scheduled daily flights from Wilson Airport and Jomo Kenyatta International Airport in Nairobi. The flights take about 45 minutes and the planes land at any of the airstrips in the Reserve and these include Musiara, Keekorok and Ol Kiombo. There are also scheduled flights from Mombasa to the Reserve.\nThere is a wide variety of accommodation options in the Masai Mara ranging from the low coat budget to the high end one. One of the popular lodges is the Mara Intrepids Club, set at the very confluence of the Mara’s four game-viewing zones, looking out over the Talek River. The Club accommodation offers include the luxury single tent full-board option, the luxury double tent full-board option, the luxury twin tent full-board option and the luxury triple tent full-board with each luxury tent fitted with a queen size bed or two twin beds, a modern en-suite bathroom with a hot shower, flush toilets and all the essential facilities coming with wake up calls, daily housekeeping and more.\nThere is also the Keekorok Lodge located in the Reserve, offering conventional-style lodgings with spacious rooms that have ceiling fans, mosquito nets, hypoallergenic bedding and a balcony with views of the garden. The Lodge also offers an outdoor pool with a terrace, the Hippo Bar, overlooking the lake and serving traditional dishes and The Elephant Deck Restaurant, where one can enjoy a classic Savannah dinner.\nOther options include Mpata Safari Club, Kichwa Tembo Club, Siana Springs, Governor`s Camp and the Little Governor`s Camp, Mara Serena Safari Lodge, Mara River Camp and more. For visitors on a modest budget, accommodation options include the Acacia Camp, the David Livingstone Resort and the Mara Simba Lodge. For the low budget visitor, camping offers are available at the Oloolaimutiek Campsite, Mara Springs Camp, Olpert Elongo Camp, Simba Camp and the Riverside Camp which are situated all within the Reserve.\nBest Time to Visit\nThe Reserve is open all year round and therefore can be visited any month of the year. However, the best months to visit are December to March and July to October where the weather is pleasant. April to June are also ideal months but might be wet or cold.\nWeather and Climate\nThe Masai Mara Reserve enjoys a damp climate and more moderate temperature than most of Kenya due to its location at a high altitude. Daytime temperatures are usually around 30°C whilst night temperatures could drop to around 15°C. Temperatures are at their peak between December and January and drop really low in June and July. The Reserve is dry between July and October and wet between March and May as well as between November and December. The park may be difficult to navigate at these times.\nOther Safety Considerations\nIf one is traveling to an area like the Masai Mara where Malaria is prevalent, precautionary measures are necessary to stay safe. These include taking Malaria prophylactics, covering bare skin after dusk, sleeping under treated nets and using mosquito repellent creams. To avoid sun burn, visitors are reminded to carry with them a high factor sun screen, lip balm, wide brimmed hats and good sunglasses as well as to always stay hydrated under the African sun."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"english_native_fluent"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:f74635aa-2eb6-4baf-8968-02190c4ac020>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How does ancient Zoroastrian tradition explain the origin and lineage of humankind? What are the steps in their spiritual ancestry?","answer":"According to Zoroastrian tradition, human lineage begins with Gayömart, the primordial giant and first man from whom mankind descended. The spiritual ancestry follows a divine line: humans belong to the Mindful Lord of goodness and light, not to Ahriman (the deceiver). The lineage includes Speñtá Ármaiti (auspicious contemplation embodied in earth) as the mother, and the God of Inspiring Creativity (Mazdá) as the father. This origin story shares notable similarities with Norse/Scandinavian myths, with some scholars suggesting these Avestan themes were transmitted to Scandinavian tribes through the Caucasus and Ostrogoths.","context":["In the Elder Futhark symbolism of the ancient Vikings, Othala rune represented the o sound. Othala disappeared from the Scandinavian record around the 6th century, but it survived in the Anglo-Saxon Futhorc, and expressed the Old English œ.\nViking rune *ōþalą has become ēðel in Old English and uodal in Old High German.\nThe mystical and magical Rune alphabet starts with fehu, (Avestan fšü) “wealth, prosperity, cattle,” and concludes with *ōþalą “heritage; inheritance, legacy.”\nThe word ōþalą itself appears to be unique to ancient Germanic, and cannot be traced back to the ancient Aryan/Indo European speech.\nHowever, the concept of “heritage/good lineage,” and the continuation of a sacred legacy going back to the beginning, is strongly present in the poetic gathas of prophet Zarathustra, as well as in the prose and poetry of the sacred Avestan lore of the Zoroastrians.\nThe Gathic/Old Avestan word for “good genus” is hû-zéntuš, and it appears many times in the gáthás or “sacred songs” of the ancient seer/prophet.\nThe term for “heritage/inheritance” in the gathas is raæḵna from the root *rik. Vedic reknas is a cognate. The reconstructed Proto Indo European root is *leik. Avestan raæḵna recalls the Germanic noun lehan in the sense of “loan,” that is the “spiritual legacy/advantage” that is LOANED to us, and must be paid back with increase and betterment.\nOthala represents god-powers and sacred knowledge from past generations, as well as realization of paradise here on this earth.\nThe ultimate realization of Othala as the final rune of the cycle is the coming age of god-men. In that respect, there exist many parallels with the Zoroastrian saôšiiants “giants of the ages.” Saôšiiant literally means to “swell with power of the gods and good fortune,” and heralds in a new age of god men.\nSaôšiiánt stems from the verbal root √sü “to swell with power, divine strength,” Welsh cawr “Giant”, Lithuanian šaūnas “robust, strong,” and Old Norse hūnn “young, strong” are cognates.\nIn the poetic gathas (Lithuanian giedóti “sing hymns”) concerning heritage/legacy (raæḵna, Germanic lehan) we read in Yasna 34.7:\nkûθrá töi aredrá mazdá//ýöi vaηhéuš vaædená man.aηhö\nséñg.hüš raæḵe.náv aspen.čît sádrá.čît//caḵraiiö ûši.ûrü\nnaæ.čîm tém aniiém ýüš.mat vaædá//ašá aθá-náv θráž.düm\nWhere are Thy “fit, strong ones” Mindful lord//who acquiring the wisdom of the Good Mind’s\nEdicts and Legacy, can turn any inauspicious event, even sorrow, grief //into wide and beaming smile\nI know none other than you// through Excellence, Truth; shelter us.\nThe word for the “fit/strong ones” is aredrá in the original Avestan. Modern translators have mostly translated this word as “ardent.” Yet as Helmut Humbach suggests the term comes from areta “order, fitness, strength,” (Old Norse ein–arðr is a cognate.)\nThe term aredrá seems to refer to astvat ereta “embodiment in flesh of the cosmic order, fitness, and divine strength.” Astvat ereta is another name for the future saôšiiant who will rise from a sacred lake, and herald in a fresh, new, resplendent universe, the new age of god-men.\nOur true legacy is to inherit the “Good Mind of the Gods” vaηhéuš man.aηhö. Menes is the “energy of consciousness, passion of the spirit, mind power” that enables the warrior to achieve great deeds. Avestan vôhü, vaηhéuš represents “goodness, betterment and brilliance.”\nVaηhéuš, vásu, visi, eús “good, bright,” appears frequently in divine names among Indo European people e.g Gaul divine name Vesu-avus and Latin goddess Vesuna. The Germanic tribal name Visigoths “the good goths” comes from the same root.\nIn the Zoroastrian tradition, “Good Mind of the Gods” vaηhéuš man.aηhö is the protector of animals, “cattle, wealth” fšü (rune fehu is a cognate.)\nOur heritage is to acquire the wisdom (vaædená) of the Gods, the Brilliant Disposition of the Immortals, and through their creative edicts, rulings (Avestan séñg.hüš, Latin censeo,) turn every inauspicious event (Avestan a-spen) and sorrow (Avestan sádrá, Old Norse hadr,) into a wide, beaming smile or opportunity.\nZoroastrianism ONLY sees godhood in “goodness, overcoming of limitations, betterment, and triumph of the spirit.”\nConcerning our heritage/inheritance, we read in the Zoroastrian sacred literature: I have come from the unseen world, not from this world. I belong to the Mindful Lord who is all goodness and light, NOT to Ahriman who is a liar and a deceiver, all gloom, and full of death.\nI belong to the hallowed gods (Avestan yazatás, Greek hagios,) not to demons (daævás,) to the pure, and not to the vile. I am a man, not a demon, a creature of the God of Mind whose powers are undying, infinite and pure.\nMy stock and lineage is from *Gayömart (primordial man.) My mother is Speñtá Ármaiti, (“auspicious contemplation and meditation,” embodied in earth), my father is the God of Inspiring Creativity (Mazdá, Greek Muses.) I belong to the Mindful lord, the Creator, and his Auspicious Immortals, NOT to the broken spirit and his host of impure demons. There is only one path and that is of excellence/truth.\nI shall conclude, by stating that gayö-mart is the primordial giant, the first man from whom mankind is descended. His account is intertwined with the tale of the sole-created cow. The name gaiia-mareta means “mortal life.” In the Avesta, Gayömart is the primordial giant and beginning of this world, just as Saôšiiáns represents the end of this age, and beginning the new age of the god-men.\nThe Avestan account on the primordial man presents striking similarities to the Norse/Scandinavian origin myths. A. Christensen (1917, I, p. 37) preferred to reconstruct the transmission of Avestan themes to the Caucasus and from there, through the intermediation of the Ostrogoths, to the Scandinavian tribes.\nI shall thank My good Friend Didier Calin on his notes on Othala"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"english_native_fluent"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:da6acd3a-b563-4023-9226-d57360b71a5c>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do VMs and serverless computing compare in terms of management complexity and control - which one gives developers more flexibility?","answer":"VMs offer more flexibility but require more complex management, while serverless computing provides simpler management but less control. With VMs, you have full control over the containers and systems they run on, allowing for larger and more complex applications. However, they demand ongoing management of VM-hosted applications and higher operational costs. In contrast, serverless computing takes the burden of server management off developers' hands, with cloud providers handling all administration including maintenance, scaling, and monitoring. However, with serverless you have no say in how the system is run, making it potentially unsuitable for certain security and policy requirements.","context":["What is serverless computing? The idea is growing in popularity, but the term honestly sounds like an oxymoron. How does it work, and why should you consider it for your IT organization?\nWell, the name is a false promise–there are actually servers involved with serverless computing. They just aren’t managed by the organization. A serverless computing model means your cloud provider takes care of adding, removing, and/or adjusting your server resources based upon demand. You end up with a more accurate bill for your usage because it’s based literally on milliseconds, not hours. There are a couple of ideas behind this: One is to avoid prepaying for resources that might be unused, resulting in huge savings for your organization. The second is taking the burden of server management off of the developer’s hands, leaving them free to simply write code.\nThis sounds like something out of the future, but the truth is, the future is now. The big cloud providers (Amazon, Microsoft and Google) all offer serverless computing services, but Amazon’s Lambda is perhaps the most well-known. According to their website, “Lambda runs your code on high-availability compute infrastructure and performs all the administration of the compute resources, including server and operating system maintenance, capacity provisioning and automatic scaling, code and security patch deployment, and code monitoring and logging. All you need to do is supply the code.” This saves the developer time and effort in rewriting code to fit a specific infrastructure requirement, meaning applications can deploy faster and more accurately.\nServerless building blocks\nThe code that’s uploaded to AWS or Azure is known as a function. A function is an individual action or piece of logic. This tiny code unit is particularly useful for running jobs like these:\n- Scheduled, repeatable tasks\n- Web request processing\n- Processing queue messages\nThe entire function from beginning to end usually takes only milliseconds. It is these functions that form the building blocks of serverless architectures.\nWhere do containers fit in?\nContainers are the latest “hot thing,” but is it possible that serverless computing will render containers obselete? As Michael Churchman of Rancher explains, probably not. “Serverless computing of the type represented by AWS Lambda can be an extremely valuable resource, … but it is far from being an all-around substitute for deploying and managing your own containers. Serverless computing is really designed to work with containers, rather than replacing them.”\nWhat are some cases where containers might be a better fit? If your application is larger and more complex than AWS or Azure can handle, a container-based system can be as large and complex as you need. If you’re also looking for full control over the containers and the system on which they run, container-based deployment can do that. However, because serverless computing is run by a third party, you have no say in how it is run. For security and policy processes, serverless computing may not be a good fit. If you do decide to try your hand at serverless computing, a best practice is to start with new applications, rather than rewriting old ones to fit the model.\nServerless computing is a new developer-friendly offering that holds a lot of potential for cost savings and software deployment efficiency. It is not, however, a replacement for all infrastructure architectures, including containers or on-premise deployment. Again, as with all things IT, whether you use serverless computing or not depends on what your application and organizational needs are. If you want to work in a serverless environment, you will need to prepare for some changes.","Sergey Galushko - Fotolia\nThe VMs vs. containers debate becomes more one-sided with every containerization improvement: Containers have the capacity to displace both VMs and bare-metal hosting into obsolescence.\nContainers have always had a built-in efficiency advantage over VMs because containers share the host OS and VMs each require their own OS. Recent developments in container orchestration and operations have expanded that advantage considerably. There's no technical reason to run a container in a VM. Has the VMs vs. containers battle been won, and should we all plan for a VM-free future?\nServer virtualization's basic goal has always been to create a hosting platform wherein VMs behave as independent physical servers, such that they are equally as secure and as immune to one application affecting the performance of another. While modern VM implementations don't perfectly achieve that goal, they come very close.\nServers are flexible platforms that can host almost any workload in almost any possible network-connected configuration. VMs share those properties, and their flexibility works against them in a VMs vs. containers hosting decision. For many users, VM operational costs are of greater concern than server capital costs; the ongoing management of VM-hosted applications is a problem both in terms of cost and in the necessary staff skill levels.\nContainers are not designed to be VMs -- or even servers. Instead, they lie between a VM and a simple OS multiprogramming feature. Containers are more efficient than VMs in memory use and, perhaps even more importantly, simpler to deploy and maintain. In a user survey by CIMI Corporation, more respondents said they had adopted or were considering containers because of deployment and management simplicity than due to improved workload density per server versus VMs. VMs are more flexible, more secure -- and more complicated.\nAdvances to containers, both within Docker and through Kubernetes, create an ecosystem or distributed platform: Not only is there a simple OS-linked container, there is a presumptive model for distributed deployment and networking of those containers. The deployment models are more restrictive than for VMs or servers, but users appreciate the IT operational advantages. It is easier to manage applications if they are all built and deployed the same way.\nContainers and cloud deployment\nThe big challenge to container dominance is the cloud. Container hosting isn't as secure or insulated with respect to cross-user contamination as VMs, which means that cloud-hosted containers run on a layer of standard IaaS VMs. VMs are required, but subject to subduction as part of the cloud service; they are hidden from the user's view. This setup seems to guarantee a future filled with -- perhaps invisible -- VMs.\nThe cloud isn't the only source of VM subduction. The ecosystem features of Docker, Kubernetes, Apache Mesos as well as Mesosphere DC/OS and Marathon -- along with other container systems -- coalesce into an orchestration layer running above an abstract resource pool. AWS and Microsoft Azure are among the public cloud vendors that use this layered orchestration approach in their container hosting services. This makes the ecosystem-based vision of container systems, with networking features, application structuring and lifecycle management benefits, highly portable. Users and applications interact through this new layer, which makes what's underneath unimportant. Is a world of invisible VMs different from one with no VMs at all?\nThe pure no-VM outcome of VMs vs. containers is equally possible. An orchestration layer acts as an adapter, such that a variety of underlying hosting components look the same to users above. It's possible to build lower-layer hosting features to fit directly into that orchestration layer. VMs could evolve away from generalized server-like hosting platforms into something much more container-like. Rather than having a VM emulate a server, it would emulate the ideal abstract container host. Whether the result was called a VM or something else, it wouldn't resemble what we use today.\nA second possibility in workload hosting evolution is the convergence of an optimal container host with an optimal function or lambda host. Cloud providers have adopted the same notion of an orchestration layer to create their function or lambda services. This structure hides the actual hosting platform from cloud customers, and in turn the cloud provider can evolve this underlying platform without disrupting users. Function hosting and container hosting have many similar requirements, so it's possible that cloud providers will combine these missions and even the orchestration layers to create one seamless platform.\nNative enhancements to container ecosystem support are advancing in a unified way based on Kubernetes -- Docker added Kubernetes native integration alongside its own cluster support feature. The Cloud Native Computing Foundation's (CNCF) charter focuses on the kind of container-universalism that created the threat to VMs and includes better security and isolation. CNCF principles have established the character of the standardized manifest for Kubernetes applications that Docker recommends. Because of container universalism, cloud providers are under pressure to do more to differentiate their direct container hosting products.\nKubernetes supports deployment via VMs in the cloud, so doesn't that factor limit the damage of containers' rise to VMs? In the end, everything comes back to the ecosystem. A VM's value lies in its generality: You can do anything with it. Container value lies in the ecosystem that standardizes and limits how applications are deployed and connected. There are dozens of Kubernetes-related container tools that expand the scope of the ecosystem, and that expansion further limits the value of the generalized deployment options VMs offer.\nOrganizations can support an ecosystem -- even a container-like ecosystem -- with VMs. However, that approach makes most of the differentiating features of containers vs. VMs irrelevant. The only remaining features where VMs excel over containers, namely security and isolation, are targets for bodies such as the CNCF and companies such as AWS, Google and Microsoft.\nSecurity options for containers\nSecurity and isolation concerns have been a top priority for container industry vendors, and while strides have been made, the work is not yet done. For example, Kubernetes integrated Istio service mesh in early 2018, and many container security-focused startups still lead the pack of container vendors -- although the skepticism on startup longevity still leaves many users in limbo while major vendors catch up.\nServerless and functional computing require secure and isolated hosting and cannot exist economically without a new hosting model. That model will be more akin to containerization than server virtualization.\nEnterprise architects and IT directors should begin the process to migrate applications to the container ecosystem model and plan to shift the organization's hosting focus to containers. Meanwhile, keep tabs on the evolution of serverless and functional computing."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:8e8c4e5f-acef-4f2c-9a91-218de5e81c98>","<urn:uuid:5cd50a56-f0ee-455c-be00-8f029e88e48b>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How did Greek ideas influence both musical notation and mathematical proofs?","answer":"Greek ideas significantly influenced both domains. In music, the Greeks named musical notes after letters of the alphabet, a system that was later built upon by Guido Monaco around 1030 when he created a notation system using letters A through G. In mathematics, the Greeks, particularly the Pythagoreans, introduced important proof techniques like reductio ad absurdum (proof by contradiction), which they used to prove that √2 is irrational. Their approach to both music and mathematics emphasized the use of systematic, letter-based notation and rigorous logical methods.","context":["Articles about music might seem out of place on a blog about writing, but words and music have always gone together. In pre-literate societies, if people needed to remember words, they tended to put them together in rhyming or rhythmic patterns, making them easier to recall. It was only a short step to using different pitches of the voice, and sound made by external means to further enhance those verbal patterns.\nWhen written language came along, the link with music continued. Western music derives its basic shape from the Greeks, particularly from fifth century BC thinker Pythagoras. Greek musicians decided on the distances between musical steps, which generally speaking are still in use today. They also confirmed the relationship between words and music by naming musical notes after letters of the alphabet.\nWith the collapse of the Greek civilisation, the alphabetical system of musical notation was lost for centuries. Music survived largely in Gregorian chant, a combination of words and music designed to help illiterate Medieval congregations remember passages from the Bible. The time came, however, when musicians once again required notation to represent music. After both Pope Gregory the Great, and Emperor Charlemagne demanded a standardisation of chants, it became politically vital for church choristers to reproduce chants in an accepted way. This demanded notation. From the 7th Century, marks called neumes, began to appear, indicating where the voice should go up or down. But these marks did not indicate where a singer was starting from on the ladder of musical sounds.\nThe breakthrough came when a teacher of choristers at Areazzo, named Guido Monaco, came up with a notation system to help orientate his pupils as they struggled to learn hundreds of chants. Described in his books Aliae Regulae and Micologus, both published around 1030, Monaco’s system took its lead from the Greek idea of turning to the written word, naming notes after letters of the alphabet – A,B,C,D,E,F,G. He drew a red line above a line of words to be sung, a line which Monaco declared represented middle F, a note right in the centre of a singer’s normal singing range. Then a second yellow line was added to represent middle C. Other notes could then be written above or below these two lines at graduated heights. It was now possible for a singer or musician to know exactly which note they had to sing or play. It was also possible to read and write music. Until this point music had been an oral tradition with no specific composers, but with Monaco’s system it was possible for people to start writing down musical ideas. The first named composer is generally held to be a Frenchman named Perokin, who lived roughly between 1170 and 1236. He wrote his music as you might write a story, using Monaco’s system based on the letters of the alphabet.\nToday the link between words and music is if anything stronger than ever, in the various forms of song writing which have dominated global culture since the 1950s.\nHans Christian Anderson said that where words fail, music speaks. You could also say that where words and music come from is actually the same place.","Pythagoras of Samos (570 – 500 B.C.)\nPythagoras himself: The biography of Pythagoras is shrouded in legend where the stories about him and his followers seem better than the actual truth — which is unfortunately lost to history. Like Thales, he in known to us through the writings of others. Here are some basic, if not vague facts, about Pythagoras. He was born the son of a merchant about 572 B.C. in Samos. Pythagoras may have studied under Thales and may have even travel to Egypt to study their geometry. He returned to Samos, which at that time was under the direction of tyrannical governments, and ultimately decided to settle in the Italian town of Croton where he founded his famous Pythagorean school. The Pythagoreans were a brotherhood of thinkers and often religious zealots complete with secret rites and mysterious rituals. As such, they wound up making enemies, were persecuted, and their school buildings were destroyed. They were eventually dispersed, with Pythagoras possibly going to Metapontum, where he died (or was possibly murdered), but the movement lasted for many years afterward and their influence was felt throughout Western thought. Read more about Pythagoras and his followers.\nHis followers: The Pythagoreans believed that the seemingly chaotic world could be understood through numbers – namely ratios of whole numbers. For example, through experimentation, they discovered that musical harmony can be understood through ratios of whole numbers. When a string is plucked and then plucked again but with the players finger half way up the string, the result is an octave. Another important contribution of the Pythagoreans was their belief that one can do mathematics purely for its own sake. It does not have to have a practical application. In fact, abstract thinking was a link to the eternal.\nThe Pythagorean theorem: Mathematics was a vital part of this group and they are known to generations of school students for the “Pythagorean theorem”. Before getting started on the various proofs, let us make it clear that other cultures (Egypt, Mesopotamia, India) way before the Greeks knew of versions of the Pythagorean theorem (a^2 + b^2 = c^2). Did Pythagoras discover this theorem himself? Perhaps his followers discovered it and attributed it to him. Maybe Pythagoras only provided a proof of something observed for quite some time. Did the other cultures know a proof? The debate continues.\nTheorem (The Pythagoreans): If a right triangle has legs which measure A and B and hypotenuse which measures C, then A^2 + B^2 = C^2.\nAmazingly there are several hundred proofs of this theorem. Let us demonstrate a few of them.\nProof 1 (using a dissection method possibly used by the Pythagoreans)\nStart with the following right triangle:\nMake four exact copies of this triangle and arrange them as in the picture below:\nConvince yourself that on either sides of the red line you have two squares (Why?). The square on the left of the red line has area A^2 and the square in the right has area B^2. So the total area is A^2 + B^2. However, we just computed the area above as C^2. Thus A^2 + B^2 = C^2. QED.\nProof 2 (another dissection method)\nStart with a right triangle.\nNow consider the following square.\nTake the four triangles in the above picture and arrange them in a new drawing as follows:\nIn the above drawing, the area excluding the four triangles is C^2. In the one just before it, the area excluding the four triangles is A^2 + B^2. Since these two areas are the same, it must be the case that A^2 + B^2 = C^2. QED.\nProof 3 (Proof in Euclid’s elements – also known as the “Bride’s chair proof”)\nThis proof is the most complicated of the proofs we will do. To start we need a two elementary facts:\nFact 1: If two triangles have two sides of the one equal to two sides of the other, each to each, and the angles included by those sides equal, then the triangles are congruent\nFact 2: The area of a triangle is half the area of any parallelogram on the same base and having the same altitude.\nConsider the right triangle ABC with a right angle at vertex A. The following diagram is known as “The famous figure of Pythagoras”.\nLet ACB be a right-angled triangle with right angle CAB.\nOn each of the sides BC, AB, and CA, squares are drawn, CBDE, BAGF, and ACIH, in that order.\nFrom A, draw a line parallel to BD and CE. It will perpendicularly intersect BC and DE at K and L, respectively.\nJoin CF and AD, to form the triangles BCF and BDA.\nAngles CAB and BAG are both right angles; therefore C, A, and G are colinear. Similarly for B, A, and H.\nAngles CBD and FBA are both right angles; therefore angle ABD equals angle FBC, since both are the sum of a right angle and angle ABC.\nSince AB and BD are equal to FB and BC, respectively, triangle ABD must be congruent to triangle FBC (Fact 1)\nSince A is colinear with K and L, rectangle BDLK must be twice in area to triangle ABD (Fact 2)\nSince C is colinear with A and G, square BAGF must be twice in area to triangle FBC (Fact 2)\nTherefore rectangle BDLK must have the same area as square BAGF = AB2.\nSimilarly, it can be shown that rectangle CKLE must have the same area as square ACIH = AC2.\nAdding these two results, AB2 + AC2 = BD × BK + KL × KC\nSince BD = KL, BD* BK + KL × KC = BD(BK + KC) = BD × BC\nTherefore AB2 + AC2 = BC2, since CBDE is a square. QED.\nProof 4: (by President James Garfield)\nGarfield’s proof starts with the following drawing:\nThe area of a trapezoid is Area = 1/2 (base) (height_1 + height_2)\nIn the above diagram, base=a+b, height_1 =a, and height_2 =b.\nThus the area is A = (1/2)(a^2+2ab+b^2).\nLet’s find the area of the trapezoid by summing the area of the three right triangles.\nThe area of the yellow triangle is A_yellow =1/2(ba).\nThe area of the red triangle is A_red =1/2(c^2).\nThe area of the blue triangle is A_blue= 1/2(ab).\nThe sum of the area of the triangles is\n1/2(ba) + 1/2(c^2) + 1/2(ab) = 1/2(ba + c^2 + ab) = 1/2(2ab + c^2).\nSince, this area is equal to the area of the trapezoid we have the following relation:\n(1/2)(a^2 + 2ab + b^2) = (1/2)(2ab + c^2).\nMultiplying both sides by 2 and subtracting 2ab from both sides we get a^2 + b^2 = c^2 QED.\nPythagorean triples: These are triples of whole numbers a, b, c so that a^2 + b^2 = c^2. For example, a = 2, b = 3, c = 5 is a Pythagorean triple. Another is a = 36, b = 77, c = 85.\nAre there an infinite number of Pythagorean triples?\nTheorem (Euclid): There are an infinite number of Pythagorean triples.\nProof: For each integer m greater than 1, notice that a = m^2 – 1, b = 2 m, c = m^2 + 1 satisfies a^2 + b^2 = c^2. This yields an infinite number of Pythagorean triples — one for each m. QED.\nNote: Euclid goes further an characterizes all of the Pythagorean triples. I’ll let you investigate this on your own.\n√2 is irrational! There was some trouble amongst the Pythagorean faithful, who earnestly believed that one could understand the universe through ratios of integers, when it was discovered that √2 could not. Real numbers which can be written as the quotient of integers are called rational – e.g., (1/2, 2/3, 98, 115, etc.). Real numbers which are not the ratio of integers are called irrational.\nTheorem (The Pythagoreans): √2 is irrational\nProof: Here is a new proof technique for us. It is called “proof by contradiction” or reductio ad absurdum (reduce to absurdity). First note that if m is odd then m^2 is also odd. Indeed if m = 2 k + 1, then m^2 = (2 k + 1)^2 = 4 k^2 + 4 k + 1 which is odd. Using the fact that P implies Q means that not Q implies not P (this is called contraposition) we see that n^2 is even implies that n is even.\nNow onto the proof. Suppose that √2 were indeed rational.Then √2 = m/n for two integers m and n which we assume have no common factor. If they have a common factor – divide it out. Then, squaring both sides of the equality √2 = m/n, we get 2 = m^2/n^2 and so m^2 = 2 n^2. This last statement says that m^2 is even. By the remark at the beginning of the proof, we see that m is even. But if m if even then m = 2 k and thus, going back to the identity m^2 = 2 n^2, we get (2 k)^2 = 2 n^2 or, after working the algebra, 2 k^2 = n^2. Thus n^2 is even. Again appealing to the discussion at the beginning of the proof, we get that n is even. This means that both m and n are even, which means they have a common factor of 2. Now we have a contradiction to the fact that m and n have no common factors. QED.\nNote: To the uninitiated, this seems like a strange way to prove something — assume what you are trying to prove is false and then following the logic until you get something ridiculous. However, in natural arguments, you do this all the time! Think about it. A friend, in an argument you are having, says something you know is not true. You tell your friend “OK. If you believe what you just said is true then you must believe this is true. But then you must believe this is true, etc…”. At the end you deduce that what your friend said at the beginning of your argument implies, through the steps of deduction, something everybody — including your friend – knows is false. Reductio ad absurdum is a very effective proof technique in mathematics and was used by the Greeks on numerous occasions and is still used today.\nNote: Irrational numbers exist in abundance. For example, Theodorus of Cyrene showed that √3, √5, √6, √7, √8, √10, √11, √12, √13, √14, √15, √17 are all irrational. In fact there is a famous spiral names after him and gives a way of constructing the square roots of all of the integers (with a ruler with a length of 1 and a compass).\nTheodorous stopped at 17 (nobody know why). E. Teuffe proved in 1958 that no two hypotenuses will ever coincide, regardless of how far the spiral is continued.\nThe number π is also irrational. We will discuss this later on.\n- The Pythagoreans were quite disturbed to find out that √2 was irrational and tried to keep is a secret since it went opposite their world view that everything could be understood as ratios of integers. One legend claims that one of the Pythagoreans named Hippasus was executed by the brotherhood for telling others outside the brotherhood of this scandal. Another legend claims he was banished from the group and an empty tomb was erected to let him know that he was considered dead to them.\n- Pythagoras is rumored to have sacrificed an ox (perhaps several) after his discovery of the Pythagorean theorem.\n- The Greek writer Iamblichus of Chalcis wrote a biography of Pythagoras called Pythagorean Life which has many elaborate and fantastic (i.e., probably not true!) stories of Pythagoras and his followers.\n- The Pythagoreans believed in reincarnation and that one was doomed to an endless existence of moving from one living creature to another unless one could gain the understanding of nature and the divine. This much is true. What is probably not true is the claim that Pythagoras could recall all of his past lives.\n- There are also stories about Pythagoras and his refusal to eat beans — don’t ask!\n- Pythagoras is rumored to have invented the Pythagorean cup which prevents someone from drinking too much.\nWe will end our discussion of Pythagoras with a famous statue of him built in the harbor of his Greek island home of Samos. Does this statue capture Pythagoras and the Pythagorean spirit?\nHere is the same statue from a different view\nHere is one more view."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:84dd6cf9-fbd9-4d62-bf11-d86eaf655430>","<urn:uuid:587ac99f-9d0d-44fa-ab24-8d1d90b3dbf7>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How does machine learning training compare between RBC Capital Markets' AI implementation and the Army's Deep TAMER approach?","answer":"RBC Capital Markets and the Army's Deep TAMER represent contrasting approaches to machine learning training. RBC requires very large teams - over 100 AI scientists in their research team and 300 data scientists on the bank side, with 60 additional people including traders and technologists for specific projects. In contrast, the Army's Deep TAMER approach is more streamlined, requiring just a human trainer providing simple feedback like 'good job' and 'bad job' in real-time. Deep TAMER can achieve results quickly - for example, teaching an AI to beat expert players at Atari bowling in just 15 minutes of human feedback, without requiring expert programmers.","context":["Credit: Google News\nCapital markets firms that are looking to implement machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) systems within their trading processes must be prepared to undertake a multi-year project that requires significant patience before seeing results.\nSpeakers taking part in a keynote address at this year’s TradeTech conference outlined how their firms had approached machine learning projects and warned that those expecting immediate results from such endeavours would most likely be disappointed.\nAntish Manna, head of execution research at MAN GLG, said that the firm went live with a machine learning-based framework for order flow and broker allocation last year.\n“This framework effectively takes away the need for human to set an arbitrary target for ‘my first three brokers are going to get this amount of flow’ and continuously updating that target to having a machine that automatically does that”, Manna explained.\n“The beauty of it is that it becomes a very clean conversation with our brokers; they know how we are doing things and that they will get more flow, and this machinery also adapts to changing market conditions.”\nManna explained that although the hype around machine learning has grown to a point where expectations are now becoming unrealistic as to what the technology can achieve, starting with a relatively simple element such as broker allocation means the firm can build out the framework take on more expansive and intuitive projects in future.\nRepresenting the sell-side was Shary Mudassir, co-head of global equities execution at RBC Capital Markets, who agreed that industry perceptions around machine learning were often false, particularly around how long such developments take to complete and the amount of time it can take to build the required expertise.\n“There is a perception that you can hire people and have meaningful, AI-based outcomes…it doesn’t work that way. Real success with AI requires very large teams,” he said.\n“At RBC, we’ve got in our AI research team over 100 AI scientists. Within the applied AI space we have over 300 data scientists on the bank side. On the equities execution team now for the most recent product we will be rolling out at some point over the year, we have a team of over 60 people, and these 60 people are not all AI scientists – these are sales traders, traders, quants, execution consultants, technologists…they have all come together over that period of time to deliver on one big outcome.”\nAddressing those unrealistic expectations, Manna said that the majority of time spent on machine learning projects is used to clean data before research and development can take place, and that those firms that are only now starting their journey with machine learning should be not expect to see results in the short-term.\n“The truth is, it is a fallacy and it takes a huge amount of time to build a framework where you can deliver things at scale that work,” he said. “On the machine learning and AI side of things, problems are best solved by teams of people, because you need the challenge, rigour and time to learn and fail, learn and try again; that process takes a lot of time.”\nCredit: Google News","Show a child a pencil and a crayon and they’ll instantly see the difference and will forever remember which is which. You won’t have to go over it a second time. Show the same two writing instruments to an artificial intelligence machine, and the machine will eventually get it, but it might take tens of thousands of “lessons” before the poor thing can reliably tell apart the two.\nThat’s one of the current challenges AI researchers face. Machine learning systems acquire knowledge so quickly because their processors and software are fast, but the method of learning involves a lot of repetition, computing power, input from human programmers and trainers, and often (once you get past pencils and crayons) large data sets to work from.\nThe Defense Department’s Project Maven, for instance, last year released its first AI tool to analysts, a data-tagging technology that autonomously recognizes features (a type of truck, a person with a weapon) in still images. It works, but training the machines is still a time-consuming process that requires tagging each object 100,000 times before the process is put into practice.\nFinding ways for machines to learn more efficiently would cut down on the computing power and the size of the data sets required, while possibly opening the door to more fluid and brain-like ways to learn.\nWatch and Learn\nThe Army Research Laboratory and the University of Texas at Austin have developed techniques to improve machine learning using a very human tactic — providing feedback to a robot in real time. Using a deep-learning algorithm called Deep TAMER (Training an Agent Manually via Evaluative Reinforcement), a robot learns a task with a human trainer, watching video streams or observing a person perform the task, and then practicing it with the help of some simple feedback like “good job” and “bad job,” according to an Army report.\nIn one example, it took 15 minutes of human feedback with Deep TAMER to teach an AI program to beat even expert human players at Atari bowling — a game proved difficult for state-of-the-art AI programs to master. Adding a feedback loop enhances the learning progress for robots of computer programs that work by seeing images, researchers said. The process also doesn’t require an expert programmer to provide the feedback, but just someone who understands what the robot is trying to do.\nIn the Army’s case, it could help support DOD’s plans for human-machine teams that will work together on surveillance, search and rescue, and other tasks in which a robot will work in an environment for extended periods of time.\n\"If we want these teams to be successful, we need new ways for humans to be able to quickly teach their autonomous teammates how to behave in new environments,\" said Dr. Garrett Warnell, an ARL researcher. \"We want this instruction to be as easy and natural as possible. Deep TAMER, which requires only critique feedback from the human, shows that this type of real-time instruction can be successful in certain, more-realistic scenarios.\"\nTaking a Shot\nARL and UT researchers aren’t alone in devising faster ways for AI systems to learn.\nCompanies such as Qualcomm and Nvidia are hoping to develop “one-shot learning” for neural networks that would allow systems to learn from small data sets, which would take a lot of the pressure off of the processors required now. That would “upend the whole paradigm,” Charles Bergan, vice president of engineering at Qualcomm, told MIT Technology Review’s EmTech China conference earlier this year.\nNvidia is working on creating smaller, more efficient algorithms and what it calls network pruning to make neural networks with fewer simulated neurons, leaving only those that contribute directly to the result.\n“There are ways of training that can reduce the complexity of training by huge amounts,” Nvidia chief scientist Bill Dally told the conference.\nIBM, meanwhile, is working the other side of the problem, “training” large data sets so the most important information is given to an algorithm first — as opposed to a variable, nonuniform feed — which speeds up the learning process for a machine. The company said it has produced a tenfold speed increase over existing training methods.\nAI systems can’t learn like a 2-year-old yet, but new approaches to simplifying the training process are getting the machines closer to learning more like humans do, and as a result could make human-machine teaming more viable."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"english_native_fluent"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:deb8490f-16fa-4734-8251-6dd54f5d9d41>","<urn:uuid:439db40f-a8f6-47b1-bd6b-e20ab7f94836>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the key differences between the greywater management approaches recommended for individual homes versus apartment buildings, and how do they compare in terms of implementation complexity and cost?","answer":"For individual homes, greywater management can be implemented through DIY solutions like collection barrels or recycling units, with costs ranging from $200 for a single source to $3,300 for a comprehensive system. Apartment buildings without existing systems can utilize the reed bed system for botanical wastewater management. Both approaches aim to reduce water consumption, but vary in scale and complexity. Individual homes have more flexibility in implementation methods, from simple bucket collection to sophisticated treatment systems costing up to $10,000. The systems can be connected to gardens via sub-surface irrigation, particularly beneficial since gardens can consume up to 44% of household water during summer months. Both types of buildings need to consider factors like using eco-friendly products to prevent soil toxicity and implementing proper segregation of greywater from blackwater.","context":["Building an eco-friendly home is one of the most effective ways in which one can make a personal contribution to keeping carbon footprint low. A well-planned green home cuts down on electricity and water bills, boosts green spaces in and around the house, relies on renewable energy and keep waste to a minimum. Now imagine if every household practiced such green measures.\nWith enough green homes, issues like power cuts, waste management, rising temperatures and waste water can be managed to a great extent, if not entirely solved.\nImage source: Knut-Erik Helle\nHow does one build a green home? Many aspiring homeowners are stumped by this simple question—what are the factors to consider, what to include and how to go about making these changes. From water management to sustainable interiors, here’s an eight-step guide to turning your dream home into a green, self-contained living space.\nSet up a waste water management system\nA DIY greywater recycling unit set up by Ashwin Subramanian and Preethy Iyer\nManaging greywater recycling at home can take some amount of planning but it can make a tremendous difference to the amount of water used in a household. It is feasible to consider setting up proper water management systems at the very start of your building process.\nTake for instance, Bengaluru-resident Vinodkumar Saxena who planned his house to ensure that greywater seeps out through one source into a collection and recycling unit. Apartment buildings that don’t have greywater management systems can also try the the reed bed system of botanical wastewater management.\nYou can also build you own recycling unit too. Take your cues from this DIY greywater recycling unit set up Bengaluru couple, Ashwin Subramanian and Preethy Iyer.\nRainwater harvesting will boost your water conservation plans\nIn times of grave water crises, it’s more important than ever to conserve this precious resource. Rainwater harvesting is an efficient way to recharge ground water and can be implemented in various ways, from DIY rain collection barrels to underground storage units.\nRainwater harvesting also helps to set up provisions for collecting and transmitting the water, right when you are building your home. Click here to know more about setting up a DIY harvesting unit in your home and ideas on how to make such units yourself.\nDon’t fell trees. Build your homes around them.\nImage source: Pinterest\nBengaluru-based architect Ganesh Kumar who has led many a green building project says, “If I see a tree in the building site, I try to work around it instead of cutting it down.” We keep hearing stories of countless trees being axed to make way for infrastructural development, but trees are also felled for household needs.\nIn a heartening change, many apartment buildings now come nestled amongst trees. Independent homeowners can speak to their architect/builder about retaining and building around big trees in your plot. Not only will you save a tree or two, but also find yourself in a uniquely designed home.\nTake the solar plunge\nImage source: Magda Wojtyra/Flickr\nPowering homes with solar energy does the dual trick of utilizing power resources sustainably while bringing down your electricity bills. Installing solar panels has proven successful for homeowners as well as bigger enterprises; it’s hardly surprising than that Indians are increasingly making the solar switch.\nAs the prices of solar fixtures fall and their takers rise, a number of organisations are enabling people to install solar panels efficiently in their homes.\nConscious lighting choices & electrical fixtures\nWhile the benefit of solar power on electricity bills is evident, managing electric fixtures and making conscious choices in lighting and electronic devices can further the positive impact. LED lighting, or even solar-powered lighting, is more energy efficient. Look for cost-effective fans and electronic appliances and maintain them with care.\nIt is also important to ensure that your building plan takes adequate natural lighting into account. A lot of electrical power is wasted away in keeping inadequately-lit rooms illuminated through daytime.\nYou might also like: Learn the Art of Composting in Your Home & Watch Your Kitchen Waste Turn to Wealth\nKeep a tab on waste management\nIn a world of increasing landfills and mounting trash, waste management, like charity, begins at home. Make provisions to segregate your wet waste from dry waste and sanitary waste, disposing each section carefully. Separate your bins and instruct your household staff to segregate waste. Also check where your waste is going—it takes one conversation with your local waste management worker to find out.\nSwitching to sustainable sanitary products can eliminate this segment of waste entirely, but otherwise careful segregation makes sure that the waste management workers are not jeopardised due to contact with sanitary waste.\nMake room for a spot of greenery\nGreenery can make a world of difference in a home, particularly during the months of summer. From terrace gardens to indoor plants and vertical gardens, there are many ways to transform limited spaces into lush patches of green. For urban homes that don’t have the luxury of a terrace, vertical gardens, window sill greenery and indoor plants are great alternatives.\nA number of initiatives have now emerged, offering gardening kits and services to urban dwellers. Ugaoo is one such online platform, which stocks a range of seeds, planters and gardening accessories. Keeping in account constraints of time and space, you will also find options like grow bags and self-watering planters here.\nWhile you are putting together your garden, also collect the dry leaves and floral waste for mulching. Composting is a great way to use up the wet waste from your kitchen will yield organic manure for the garden too.\nConsider sustainable materials for your interiors\nEschew conventional flooring for sustainable materials—cork (yes, cork) makes for excellent, eco-friendly floors. A renewable source, it is cost-effective too and also inherently built to ward off insects and pests. You can also opt for materials like bamboo, lineoleum, red oxide and even reclaimed wood to use on your floors.\nInvest in toxin-free paints and take your pick of decorative and utilitarian items from eco-friendly materials and local artisans (it will also support their business). Think recycled upholstery and furnishings, woven baskets as storage units, reclaimed wooden or bamboo furniture and handicrafts decorative.","- Advertisement -\nThink about all the times you turn on a tap at home each day: from splashing water on your face first thing in the morning to brushing your teeth before you go to sleep. It’s estimated each person in the average Australian household produces 120 L of so-called wastewater a day. And yet, of that, 84 L is greywater that could be reused to water the garden or flush the toilet. Tap into this resource to conserve drinking water, reduce the amount of pollution going into our waterways and save money on your water bills.\nWhat is greywater?\nOn the most basic level, greywater is any water that leaves the house through a plughole. The name makes more sense in context; ‘whitewater’ comes from the tap, and ‘blackwater’ is what leaves the toilet.\nUsually, greywater and blackwater leave the house through the same pipes en route to sewage treatment plants. The treated wastewater is discharged into oceans and rivers. The alternative is to reuse your greywater, radically reducing household water use as well as the total amount of effluent.\nSome municipal councils use treated greywater and, in some cases, treated blackwater (also known as recycled water) to keep sports ovals and nature strips green and to flush public toilets.\nIt’s surprisingly cheap and easy to set up a simple greywater system in your home and garden.\nWhat precautions should I take when using greywater?\nOften greywater is warm when it’s collected; a perfect temperature for bacteria to breed in, so it should be assumed that all greywater contains bacteria. Greywater may also contain parasites or infectious viruses. For these reasons, never drink greywater or use it for cooking, even if it has been treated. In the garden, it’s best if greywater is applied below the surface of the garden bed (via a dripline on top of the soil, under mulch or in mulch-filled trenches) rather than sprayed. It’s also not advisable to use greywater on fruit or vegetables that you plan to eat raw.\nGreywater from the kitchen can contain food particles that provide nutrients to help your plants grow, however, kitchen water isn’t usually recommended as it has lots of fats and food residue that can block plumbing or get smelly.\nBathroom greywater can contain soap and salts that are toxic to plants and tiny animals in the soil, so make sure you use only eco-friendly shampoos, soaps and body washes.\nYou’ll need to be careful with laundry detergents, as most powders and some liquids are sodium-based, and high sodium levels can inhibit seed growth. Choose laundry products that are low in phosphates and free from bleaches, bath salts, artificial dyes, cleansers, or boron (lots is toxic to plants).\nIt’s best to rotate where you use the greywater, as it’s thought that the long-term effects on soil can affect productivity.\nGreywater reuse is becoming more and more common in households here and overseas and, if you follow these precautions, the associated risks are very low. Given that Australia is the driest inhabited continent on Earth, it makes sense to save drinking water for drinking, and to bring the mantra of reduce, reuse, recycle to our water consumption habits.\nWhat ways are there to capture greywater?\nThere are two ways to capture greywater; collecting it before it goes down the plughole, or fixing new pipes\nfrom the plugholes to a greywater storage tank.\nIf you’re renting or not sure you want to install a greywater system, go with a humble bucket in the shower and kitchen. Because clothes washing machines have a pump and the outlet is easy to access, everyone can consider a pipe extension from their laundry to the garden. Or, you could install a dual-purpose loo, which fills the cistern for the next flush with the water you use to wash your hands.\nInstalling a greywater system is the less labour-intensive option to carting buckets around the house. A simple greywater system from a single source costs as little as $200. Connecting greywater to your garden from multiple sources can be done for around $700 to $1,400, and if you want to install a comprehensive system for the whole house, expect to pay between $2,100 to $3,300. Some states in Australia require that greywater is delivered underground, so you’ll need to factor in the cost of an irrigation system.\nYou’ll also need to decide if you’re going to reuse the water with or without purifying or decontaminating it of all the soaps, salts and detergents. Water can be purified in a number of ways – using biological systems such as constructed wetlands, microbial digestion, or using UV radiation – but the easiest option for the urban home is filtration, mostly through sub-surface sand or by machine. A treatment system isn’t cheap, costing as much as $10,000 to buy and install.\nWhat can greywater be used for around the home?\nThe average Australian home uses up to 44 per cent of household water on the garden over the hot summer months. Greywater is most commonly used untreated to water gardens via a sub-surface system directly to the roots of plants – that way there’s no human contact and it requires little maintenance.\nA clearly marked, treated greywater tap in your backyard can be useful for occasional tasks such as washing the car, when you really don’t need to use fresh drinking water. Just remember to wash your hands with clean water afterwards, as there are higher levels of bacteria in greywater.\nWhile some countries have banned the use of greywater indoors for purposes such as flushing the toilet and washing clothes, it is allowed in Australia, provided you have an appropriate treatment system.\nHow do I get started?\nIf you’re only installing from one or two sources, consider which ones will be the most beneficial. An estimated 58 per cent of household wastewater comes from the shower and handbasin, so if there’s easy access to the bathroom it makes sense to divert water from here first.\nYou also need to think about where you’ll be diverting your water. Do you want to divert greywater from the bathroom to a treatment system and then onto the laundry, or just from the laundry and shower into the garden? Bathrooms can be difficult places to set up a diversion because they’re often set on a concrete slab. Water sources from a second storey can work well because you can use gravity to help drain greywater into a tank, but be prepared to rip out parts of the ceiling to get access.\nDon’t forget to check out any special requirements within your state or territory regarding the installation and use of greywater here. There’s also a range of state, territory and local government rebates available, however federal rebates were ditched earlier this year, so greywater systems installed after 10 May 2011 are no longer eligible.\nFor G's in-depth look into greywater systems, click here."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:2650001a-2992-4c9e-aaa4-1b5fc8c75eef>","<urn:uuid:24cc075e-e445-4c80-96fb-f475404209bd>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How does a polar bear's metabolic rate compare to the baseline human BMR calculations described in standard formulas?","answer":"Polar bears have a significantly higher metabolic rate compared to standard human BMR calculations. According to the research, polar bears' base metabolic rate was 60% higher than scientists expected, making them extremely efficient at burning fat - they can lose up to 4 pounds of pure fat per day. In contrast, human BMR is calculated using standard formulas that account for weight, height, age, and gender, with typical rates much lower than polar bears, as evidenced by the fact that a human would need to run a marathon without eating extra food just to burn one pound of fat in a day.","context":["You wouldn’t necessarily know it by looking at a polar bear’s ample figure, but the world’s only marine bear is a fat-burning machine.\nPolar bears can lose as much as four pounds of pure fat per day, according to Anthony Pagano, a wildlife research biologist with the United States Geological Survey. While dieters around the world would love to know the bears’ secret — to shave off a single pound in a day a human would have to run a marathon without eating any more than usual — their high metabolism is not necessarily a good thing, as Mr. Pagano details in a study published Thursday in the journal Science.\nTo maintain those stores of fat, the bears have to venture out onto Arctic sea ice to catch seals. But as global warming makes the sea ice more scarce, the bears have to search farther and wider for food, and the more they search, the more fat they burn — putting them at risk for starvation.\n“Some of these bears moved up to 250 kilometers over the course of an eight- to 11-day period, so they could really cover quite a distance over a short period of time,” Mr. Pagano said, describing the study.\nDespite their popular appeal, not much is known about how polar bears behave in the wild. And their wide-ranging expeditions out on the sea ice have historically made them hard to track.\n“Most of their lives, if they have a choice, polar bears are out on the sea ice,” said Thea Bechshoft, a researcher at Aarhus University in Denmark who was not involved in the study.\nPolar bears are mostly solitary creatures, outside of mating season, denning season — when females raise their cubs — and the town of Churchill, Manitoba, where bears congregate toward the end of summer as they await the return of winter sea ice.\n“They’re spread out, so for us to go out and find them, be discreet enough for them not to notice us and for them to do their natural behaviors, is not feasible,” Dr. Bechshoft said.\nA lot of what scientists do know comes from the Canadian biologist Ian Stirling, who in the 1970s and ’80s spent long stretches of time on the sea ice in the Western Hudson Bay observing bears. Dr. Stirling observed the bears from a distance to avoid being mauled.\nIn this study, Mr. Pagano and his colleagues affixed video cameras to GPS-equipped collars on nine female bears off Alaska on the Beaufort Sea. The researchers took helicopters to find the bears, tranquilized them to put on the collars, and took weight and blood samples. Eight to 11 days later they repeated the task to reclaim the video cameras and take more measurements.\nWhile summer is a feasting period for other bear species, for polar bears it is a time of hunger. The sea ice has always retreated during summer, even before climate change exacerbated the trend. Spring, just before the sea ice begins its seasonal breakup, is a critical time for polar bears to gain the weight they need to carry them through until the sea ice re-forms, so the researchers tracked the bears in April of 2014, 2015 and 2016.\n“Spring is the pupping season for the seals,” said Dr. Bechshoft. “They don’t move a whole lot so they’re basically laid out as one big buffet for the bear to go around.”\nOf course this presumes that the bears can find the seals in the first place. Less sea ice means the bears have to work harder to find them.\nClimate Change Is Complex. We’ve Got Answers to Your Questions.\nWe know. Global warming is daunting. So here’s a place to start: 17 often-asked questions with some straightforward answers.\nThe researchers hypothesize that the bears’ lazy hunting style — when it works — allows them to conserve energy, helping them survive through the summer months when food is scarce. But it’s not working, and the problem is exacerbated by their high metabolism — their base metabolic rate was 60 percent more than scientists expected.\nUsing the GPS and video collars and the metabolic information, the researchers determined that the more a bear had to search for food the more energy it used. But less sea ice means they have to walk or swim more in search of food. And every additional mile that a polar bear has to traverse under its own power is that much more food the bear has to eat. The only way for the bears to restore that lost energy was to catch more seals.\n“We found that they were really dependent on their ability to catch seals,” Mr. Pagano said. “If they were successful they did quite well.”\nFour of the bears, mostly the older ones, did gain as much as 10 percent of their body mass over the study period. Because of the video footage, the researchers know that these bears gained weight because they caught seals. But because of the small study size, it was not possible to tell if this was a trend in which age brought wisdom, or if it was just a lucky week for the older bears. One bear that managed to catch some seals lost a negligible amount of weight.\nFour other bears lost up to 10 percent of their body mass over the same period, the result of not catching seals.\n“The other bears either scavenged or they fasted, and they all lost mass,” as much as 10 percent of their body mass, Mr. Pagano said.\nAlthough the study results seemingly reflect the roughly 40 percent decline in polar bear populations seen in this part of the Arctic, the study was not broad enough to draw large conclusions. But the new information on how dwindling sea ice affects the health of female polar bears could be important for conservation efforts.\n“No sea ice, no polar bears, it’s really simple,” said Dr. Bechshoft.","Basal metabolic rate (BMR) is the amount of energy your body expends at rest just to keep your vital organ systems and metabolic processes functioning. When you are active, your metabolic rate increases to provide the extra energy you need. Use our online calculator to determine your BMR.\nHow to Use the Widget\nInstead of working with a BMR formula, use our online calculator to make it easier to compute your number. To use the calculator above:\n- Select whether you'd like to use US Customary units or metric units.\n- Select whether you identify as male or female.\n- Choose your activity level, from sedentary to extremely active.\n- Enter your age, weight and height in the appropriate boxes.\n- Click \"Calculate.\"\n- The widget will then display your BMR, as well as the number of daily calories you need to consume to maintain your current weight at your current activity level.\n- Click \"Clear Results\" to perform a new calculation.\nThe Basal Metabolic Rate\nYour basal metabolic rate is the baseline rate at which your body burns your sources of fuel to provide sufficient energy to maintain your vital functions at rest, including:\n- Pumping of your heart\n- Brain and peripheral nerves activities\n- Maintaining your muscles, digestive system, liver, urinary system, skin and other endocrine systems\n- Physiological functions, such as processing carbohydrates, protein and fat\nYour BMR is the minimum energy your body utilizes to keep you alive in a warm, resting state. When you start moving, your metabolism increases to match your new caloric (energy) needs.\nCalculating the BMR\nThe BMR calculation takes into account your height, weight, age and gender. Men tend to have a higher BMR than women and BMR decreases with age because you use less energy for basal functions.\nThe formulae for calculating BMR multiplies each of the parameters by various factors based on your gender. The multiplication factors for weight and height are different depending on the system of measurements you use, but the factor for age remains the same.\nImperial System of Measurement\n- Women: BMR = 655 + (4.35 x weight in pounds) + (4.7 x height in inches) - (4.7 x age in years)\n- Men: BMR = 66 + (6.23 x weight in pounds) + (12.7 x height in inches) - (6.8 x age in years)\nUsing the Metric System\n- Women: BMR = 655 + (9.6 x weight in kilos) + (1.8 x height in cm) - (4.7 x age in years)\n- Men: BMR = 66 + (13.7 x weight in kilos) + (5 x height in cm) - (6.8 x age in years)\nConverting BMR to Your Calorie Needs\nThe Harris Benedict Equation allows you to convert your BMR to the number of calories you need to consume daily based on your level of activity. You multiply your BMR with a conversion factor for one of five levels of activity, from little or none to vigorous exercise and sports.\nUsing Your BMR Results\nYour BMR and conversion using the Harris Benedict Equation gives you the number of calories you typically use each day at your given activity level. To maintain your weight, eat only that many calories. Eat fewer calories if you want to lose weight and more if you want to gain.\nNote that the BMR calculations do not factor for lean body mass. The more muscular you are, the higher your BMR and the more calories you expend, because lean muscle burns more energy than fat. If you are muscular, you use more energy than your obese friend of equal weight, even at rest.\nSimplify Your Calculation\nInstead of using complicated formulae, simplify your BMR calculation by using our digital calculator.

{"question":"What role does stochastic resonance play in sensory perception enhancement, and how do veterinary specialists leverage this understanding in their diagnostic approach to neurological disorders?","answer":"Stochastic resonance in sensory perception is a phenomenon where adding noise to a system improves its performance up to a certain point before deteriorating. Research demonstrated this when increasing auditory signals enhanced tactile sensation in the leg initially, but eventually decreased sensitivity as the signal got louder. This principle is important for understanding multisensory integration. Veterinary neurologists apply knowledge of such sensory processing mechanisms through comprehensive diagnostic approaches, including specialized imaging like CT and MRI scans, along with specific tests such as electrophysiology testing and cerebrospinal fluid analysis. These tools allow them to evaluate how the nervous system processes and integrates various sensory inputs, helping them diagnose and treat neurological conditions affecting sensory processing in animals.","context":["How senses combine to help us better perceive our environmentNovember 13th, 2008 - 2:04 pm ICT by ANI\nWashington, Nov 13 (ANI): In a new study, scientists have delved into one of the biggest questions plaguing brain research- how different human senses combine to give us a better view of the world.\nRecent studies have claimed that there is actually a lot of overlap and blending of the senses occurring in the brain to help us better perceive our environment.\nThe study by researchers J.E. Lugo and colleagues at the University of Montreal, along with Walter Wittich from McGill University, was aimed at finding how different senses work simultaneously.\nThey wanted to know if a feeling from an electrical stimulation of a body part (such as the leg) which normally would not be perceived, would be felt if it was simultaneously accompanied by a visual or auditory signal.\nFor the study, the researchers applied slight electrical stimulation to the right calf of volunteers-the stimulation was so slight that the participants did not detect it.\nThen, they paired that electrical stimulation simultaneously with a visual signal, a distinct noise or a progressively louder white noise signal. The volunteers reported when they felt anything in their leg and the electrical response of the calf muscle activation was measured.\nIt was found that if an electrical stimulation of the leg is not initially detected, the sensation may be perceived by the addition of a visual or auditory signal with a corresponding electrical activation increase.\nThe scientists observed that the brain not only constantly processes information received from the senses, but also acts on that information to change what is happening in the peripheral system, and thus changing what we actually detect.\nThe results of the last experiment are characteristic of stochastic resonance, which is an interesting phenomenon where as noise is added to a system, the system’’s performance improves until, at a certain point, the performance begins to deteriorate.\nThat’’s what was found in the study-as the researchers increased the signal, participants reported more feeling in their leg, which eventually decreased, even as the signal continued to get louder.\nThe scientists observed the resonance signature even if the stimulus they used in the experiment was not noise but a pulse.\nThe results indicate that a tactile stimulus combined with a specific level of auditory stimulation results in optimal detection of that sensation. However, too much signal energy will limit the response. It also shows that these dynamics represent a fundamental principle of multisensory integration.\nThe study provides insight into multisensory integration, which according to the authors, will result in increased knowledge of how the brain normally interacts with the peripheral system.\nAlso, learning more about multisensory integration may pave the way for a better understanding of disorders such as autism, in which altered sensory processing often occurs.\nThe study was reported in Psychological Science, a journal of the Association for Psychological Science.

Otherwise, please arrive to your appointment approximately 10 minutes early to complete this form in our office. If you are transferring for continued care from your primary veterinarian, please come to CVRC at your earliest convenience.\nNeurology consultation usually begins with your family veterinarian diagnosing a disease or condition that requires advanced expertise, diagnostics, therapeutics, and patient monitoring. A full history, medical record review, and complete physical examination are performed. After examination and discussion, an initial treatment plan will be presented for the diagnostic workup and/or treatment.\nOur neurologist will communicate with you during the work-up or treatment process to keep you informed on your pet's progress. We will also communicate with your primary veterinarian during this process to ensure a collaborative treatment plan for the care of your pet. Upon discharge, you will be given a printed visit summary with the diagnosis, treatment recommendations, and follow up care. A full report will be sent to your family veterinarian the same day. We welcome your progress reports, questions and concerns any time and will maintain an ongoing relationship with your primary care doctor to ensure the best experience for you and the best care for your pet.\nWhat should I bring to my visit?\nFirst and most importantly, bring your pet to all visits. You may be instructed to withhold food and water from midnight the night before your appointment to allow for certain diagnostic testing. If your pet is on any medications, please let us know and we will advise you whether or not to administer them on the morning of your appointment. Also, please bring a list of all medications, strengths and dosages, or the pill vials. Records, including recent laboratory work, can be faxed or emailed to us from your primary care veterinarian prior to the appointment. If your pet has had any x-rays taken recently, please bring those with you as well. We can request records and digital x-rays on your behalf from your family veterinarian once you have scheduled a visit with us.\nHow much does it cost for a consultation with the neurologist?\nOur specialist consultation fee is $150. After an assessment by our specialist, you will be provided with a detailed medical treatment plan, including all costs recommended and anticipated. You and the specialist will review this and determine the best course of action for you and your pet.\nDo I need a referral?\nWhile referrals are recommended to see one of our specialists, they are not required. It is always better to speak to your veterinarian about a referral so we can collaborate with your veterinarian to ensure the best care for your pet.\nWill you keep my family veterinarian informed of the care my pet receives at CVRC?\nWe work closely with your primary veterinarian and ensure they receive copies of all medical records. We also communicate via phone and they have the ability to access a portal into our medical record system.\nDoes my pet need an MRI or CT scan?\nConsultation with our neurologist, review of history, full physical examination, and discussion with you will dictate the necessity of either MRI or CT Scan. Please be aware that CT and MRI overlap in their use, and the decision of one modality over another is based on desired tissue resolution, availability, cost, anticipated findings and patient stability.\nCan my pet have an MRI or CT Scan the day of my appointment?\nDepending on the nature of your pet's neurological issue, time of your appointment, and schedule for the day, we can often offer imaging after your appointment. Please let us know when scheduling your appointment if you know at that time that you would like this option.\nWhat is a CT Scan?\nCT scan is a non-invasive imaging modality that performs 360◦, cross-sectional imaging of our patients. CT scan uses x-ray technology to acquire these images, but does so with vastly increased detail and sensitivity, allowing us to visualize structures as small as 1-2mm in size.\nOur helical, 4-slice CT scanner is able to perform imaging studies much faster than older, conventional scanners that are often found in veterinary medicine. Using newer equipment and software, we are able to perform most studies in less than a minute (actual scanning time). This reduction in time also comes with increased quality and sensitivity: advantages that translate to shorter anesthetic times for our patients, even the ability to perform some studies under a light plane of sedation.\nHow is CT performed?\nAfter being thoroughly examined by one of our doctors, your pet is sedated or anesthetized and placed on the CT imaging table. The CT technician positions the patient and programs the CT computer for the desired type of study. The patient table then advances through the CT gantry (which is a large, donut shaped opening) while an x-ray tube and sensors rotate at high speed around the patient. Usually, the scan is performed twice, the second time with administration of an intravenous contrast agent that highlights blood vessels and other structures. These images are reconstructed on a computer console attached to the CT machine, then reviewed by our specialists.\nWhat is CT used for?\nCT can be used for imaging a wide variety of body tissues. For neurological purposes, it is generally used to visualize and diagnose diseases or disorders of the brain, spinal cord, or peripheral nervous system.\nDoes my pet need to be sedated or anesthetized for a CT Scan?\nAnesthesia or sedation is required to perform a CT Scan. We use the most up to date and safest anesthetic agents, preanesthetic laboratory screening, tailored anesthetic protocols, and state of the art monitoring equipment to ensure safety for your pet before, during, and after anesthesia.\nWhat is MRI?\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is an advanced, non-invasive, non-radiating imaging modality that has become commonplace in human medicine, and has rapidly expanded into the veterinary field.\nMRI uses a strong magnetic field that aligns protons of the body tissues within the field. A radio frequency signal (RF) is then applied to the field which disrupts the alignment of these protons, after which they return to their original state. The RF signals are collected by a receiver (called a coil) and then transmitted back to a computer, which creates visual images from this information.\nThese images are easily constructed in axial, dorsal, sagittal and oblique planes for review by the clinician or radiologist. MRI is often performed using an intravenous contrast agent that enables us to better visualize certain structures and abnormalities. MRI yields the highest level of soft tissue detail compared to other imaging modalities. This sensitivity allows for highlighting desired structures or tissues by adjusting settings on the MRI machine.\nHow is MRI performed?\nAfter being thoroughly examined by one of our doctors, your pet is anesthetized and placed in the MRI. The MRI technician positions the patient and programs the MRI computer for the desired type of study. An MRI study typically takes 30 minutes to one hour to complete, and requires general anesthesia, as the animal must be perfectly still for the duration of the study. The images are reconstructed on a computer console attached to the MRI, then reviewed by our specialists.\nMRIs are performed by technicians who have received advanced education and training in magnetic resonance imaging.\nWhat is MRI used for?\nWhile MRI can be used for imaging a wide variety of body tissues, for neurological purposes, it is used to image diseases or disorders of the brain, spinal cord, or peripheral nervous system.\nDoes my pet need to be sedated or anesthetized for an MRI?\nAnesthesia or sedation is required to perform an MRI. We use the most up to date and safest anesthetic agents, preanesthetic laboratory screening, tailored anesthetic protocols, and state of the art monitoring equipment to ensure safety for your pet before, during, and after anesthesia.\nWill my pet need to stay overnight?\nDepending on the nature of your pet's neurological issue, the diagnostics or treatments performed, and their timing, your pet may or may not need to stay overnight. When only imaging (MRI or CT) is performed, your pet can usually return home the same day of the imaging procedure. Our doctor or veterinary nurse will discuss the expected hospital stay during your visit or admission to the hospital.\nIs someone going to be caring for my pet 24 hours a day?\nAll patients have round-the-clock care. We always have doctors and veterinary nurses on premises to monitor and care for your pet. No pet is ever left unattended.\nCan I visit my pet while they are hospitalized?\nWe always allow owners to visit with their pets. Please call and speak with your doctor or nurse so we can coordinate a time that is best for your pet and you. We try to limit visits to twice a day for 15 minutes as to not interfere with your pet's treatment. It is generally discouraged to visit on a day when your pet underwent general anesthesia as sometimes this can be disruptive to their recovery.\nIf you feel there is an extenuating circumstance, please discuss this with your doctor.\nWhen is it best to call to check on my hospitalized pet?\nIt is best to call after 10 am to receive an update. The doctors are in rounds from 8 am - 9 am every morning. After rounds, every patient is examined by their doctor. If the situation warrants, we will call you before this time.\nCan I bring special items from home (blankets, tee shirts, toys, etc.) to keep with my pet during their hospital stay?\nYes, you are welcome to bring things from home to make your pet feel more comfortable. Please note, however, we cannot always guarantee the return of these items as they may get soiled, lost or damaged.\nShould I bring my pet's prescription medications and/or prescription food when my pet is being admitted to the hospital?\nIn an emergency situation, the priority is for you and your pet to get to CVRC. Once it is determined that your pet is going to be hospitalized, you may bring all prescription medications your pet is currently receiving. We carry most common medications if this is not feasible. Our doctor will determine if these should be continued during your pet's stay.\nWe have a full range of diets to feed our hospitalized patients. However, if your pet is on a prescription or special diet we will gladly feed that if you provide it for us.\nIs it normal that my pet has not had a bowel movement after being hospitalized?\nIt is common for pets to not have a bowel movement for the first 24-72 hours after returning home. However, this is not the case with all conditions so please refer to your discharge instructions.\nThe changes in their defecation pattern are often due to a different eating schedule in the hospital and some medications can contribute to this. If you are concerned, your pet seems uncomfortable, or is trying to defecate but is unable (straining) please call us.\nIs it normal that my pet has been urinating more frequently after being hospitalized?\nIt is common for pets that were on IV fluids to have increased urine production. Therefore, they may need to urinate more frequently. This may last for 24-48 hours. If they are straining or not producing urine, please call us immediately.\nIs it normal that my pet has not urinated, or is having trouble urinating, after being hospitalized?\nThis is not normal as most animals will urinate within 24 hours of returning home. If your pet is not urinating, or having difficulty while urinating, please call us immediately.\nIs it normal that my pet has slept all day after being hospitalized?\nPets' sleep cycles in the hospital environment are altered so it is not uncommon for them to be tired when returning home. This may last for 24 hours. If your pet appears listless, unable to ambulate, or you are concerned please call us.\nWill my pet need to wear an e-collar (lamp shade type) after returning home from the hospital?\nAn e-collar prevents a pet from licking an area we want to protect until it is healed. This may be a wound, irritation or an incision. Please refer to your discharge instructions for specifics.\nWhen do my pet's sutures/stitches need to be removed?\nGenerally we remove sutures 10-14 days post placement. Please refer to your discharges instructions for specifics.\nDo I need to pay to have my pet's sutures removed after having surgery at CVRC?\nSuture removal is done complimentary for all patients that had a surgical procedure. If further procedures (x-rays, bandage changes, additional diagnostic tests, etc.) or additional medications are indicated there will be applicable fees.\nShould my pet have physical rehabilitation after spinal cord injury or surgery?\nConsultation with our neurologist, review of history, full physical examination, and discussion with you will dictate the necessity of physical rehabilitation. Many patients respond very well and have a faster return to function after injury or surgery. We have several certified rehabilitation specialists who collaborate with our neurology team to ensure the best outcome for your pet.\nMy pet feels warm to the touch. Does that mean he/she has a fever?\nNot necessarily. Dogs and cats have a higher body temperature than people so they often feel warm. You can purchase a rectal digital thermometer (doesn’t need to be animal specific) and obtain your pet's rectal temperature. This is the most accurate assessment. Normal temperature for dogs and cats is 99.5—102.5 degrees Fahrenheit."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"english_native_fluent"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:685a4d67-7107-4172-9a99-3f566cbc46b3>","<urn:uuid:cd8535ad-ff93-432a-a95d-498c50d29fe2>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the certification requirements for implementing OHSAS 18001, and how does this compare to forklift operator certification requirements and their impact on workplace safety?","answer":"OHSAS 18001 certification requires organizations to undergo a structured certification process where competent auditors evaluate the organization against standard requirements. This includes filing an application, potentially conducting a gap analysis, and undergoing routine surveillance audits to evaluate continual improvement. The certification covers multiple areas including policy statements, hazard identification, legal requirements, and emergency preparedness. In contrast, forklift operator certification requirements, while also mandatory, focus specifically on operator training. OSHA allows companies to certify their own employees through OSHA-compliant programs, requiring training on basic operation, safe speeds, proper loading, and maintenance procedures. The impact of these certifications is significant - studies show forklift training reduces operator errors by 70%, while companies with safety and health training programs experience 52% lower rates of injuries with days away from work.","context":["Managing health and safety (OH&S) issues in the workplace represents an enormous challenge due to varying human nature, skills set, process complexity & local culture and have implications for everyone at the workplace. Effectively managing these issues means taking account not only of legal requirements, but also the well-being of your personnel in the organization.\nPurpose of OHSAS 18001\nManagement of health & safety issues for an organization considering all interested parties concern is the main challenge of the business while working with significant hazardous process & risk. Achieving OHS performance with improved well being is the need to assure the regulatory bodies, customers and other stack holders due to high premium cost for any incident.\nCertification to OHSAS 18001 show the commitment to the health and safety of employees, demonstrates your ability to manage risk & hazards associated with the activities and provide assurance to all concerned including customers and management that legal compliance is effectively managed.\nImplementation of OHSAS 18001 policies gives systematic approach to minimizing health and safety risks and provide a framework for an organization to manage its legal compliance and improve occupational health and safety performance, including risk and opportunity identification, analysis, target setting, and measurement.\nOrganizations are improving the health & safety status by implementing the universally valid international standard along with best practices beside their own country specific health & safety legislations. OHSAS 18001 is basic and globally recognized standard for occupational health and safety management systems and is applicable to any organization in any business sector.\nBenefits of OHSAS 18001\nImplementing an effective occupational health and safety management system reduces the risk of harm to your employees and other personnel and reduces overall liability. Effective Management of Health and Safety risks will help:\n- Demonstrate your commitment to the protection of employee, property and plant.\n- Minimize the number of accidents and production time loss due to better control over hazards at the workplace\n- Focus on employee safety results in a satisfied, motivated and highly productive work team.\n- Increase control and reduction of hazards through the setting of objectives, targets and evolved responsibility.\n- Maximize the well-being and productivity of all people working for the organization.\n- Encourage better relationships with contractors and more effective contracted activities.\n- Reduction in insurance premiums & workers compensation\n- Demonstrates an innovative and forward thinking approach\n- Ensuring legal compliance\n- Improve safety culture & your reputation in the eyes of customers, competitors, suppliers, other stakeholders and the wider community.\nMore about OHSAS 18001\nA certificate issued by third party registrar to demonstrates that your business system has been certified against requirements of OHSAS 18001 requirements.

Routine surveillance audits are carried out to evaluate continual improvement in the validity period. A re-certification audit is performed after every three years to maintain continuity of the certification.","Forklifts, also known as Powered Industrial Trucks (PIT), are used in numerous work settings, primarily to move materials. Each year in the United States, nearly 100 workers are killed and another 20,000 are seriously injured in forklift-related incidents. Forklift overturns are the leading cause of these fatalities representing about 25% of all forklift-related deaths.\nIn order to reduce the potential for a forklift related accident OSHA requires employers to certify employees in the proper operation of forklifts, properly maintain the lifts and train those who may come into contact with lifts on hazards and best practices.\nIn terms of certification many believe this is something that has to be completed through private contractors. However, OSHA regulations allow you to certify your own employees through the creation of an OSHA-complaint program.\nIndependent studies have confirmed forklift training reduces operator errors by 70%. \nEach year in the U.S. more than 20,000 workers are injured and 100 killed in forklift related accidents.  As a further illustration of the risk associated with forklift operation OSHA estimates that of the 1 million forklifts in the United States two-thirds are involved in an accident in their normal eight-year life span. \nThese incidents are attributed to three causes according to OSHA:\n- Insufficient or inadequate forklift training - On April 25, 1995, a 37-year-old shop foreman was fatally injured after the sit-down type forklift he was operating overturned. The victim was turning while backing down an incline with a 4% grade. The forklift was transporting a 3-foot-high, 150-pound stack of cardboard with the forks raised approximately 60 inches off the ground. No one witnessed the incident. The victim was found with his head pinned under the overhead guard. With proper training, the operator would have known to keep the forks low and to avoid turning on an incline. \n- Failure to follow safe forklift operating procedures - On October 19, 1995, a 39-year-old female punch press operator was fatally injured by a forklift traveling in reverse at high speed toward the victims' workstation. A witness observed the forklift strike a metal scrap bin (about 3 by 5 by 3½ feet), propelling it toward the punch press station. The bin hit the press and rebounded toward the forklift. There it was hit once again and shoved back against the corner of the press, striking and crushing the victim against the press. If the driver had followed proper speed requirements, the accident could have been avoided. \n- Lack of safety rule enforcement - On September 6, 1995, a 47-year-old warehouse manager was fatally injured while working with a forklift operator to pull tires from a storage rack. The two workers had placed a wooden pallet on the forks of the forklift, and the victim then stood on the pallet. The operator raised the forks and victim 16 feet above a concrete floor to the top of the storage rack. While retrieving merchandise the victim fell and fatally struck his head on the floor. The act was a violation of one of OSHA's most basic forklift safety regulations and completely avoidable. \nMost Common Causes of Forklift Fatalities\n- Forklift overturns (22%)\n- Worker on foot struck by forklift (20%)\n- Victim crushed by forklift (16%)\n- Fall from forklift (9%)\nDeath and Injury Can Cripple Your Company\nWorkplace deaths and injuries are heartbreaking to families and financially crippling to employers. The U.S. Department of Labor estimates these injuries and deaths cost employers $1 billion a week in worker's compensation costs. And when lost productivity, increased insurance premiums and other costs are added in, the total economic impact of occupational accidents is more than $4 billion a week or $668 for every citizen in the United States. \nAn annual study conducted by the Liberty Mutual Research Institute for Safety in 2010, revealed that the direct cost to employers from injuries in 2008 was $53.42 billion.  Furthermore, the study concluded that accidents at the workplace were estimated to cost employers an additional $80 to $200 billion annually. A second report by the U.S. Department of Labor cemented the finding of the insurance groups report. This report stated the average workplace injury cost an employer $43,000. The same study estimated the cost from wage replacement due to injury to be roughly $50 billion a year.\n\"An accident at the workplace can often be the difference between operating in the black and falling into the red,\" said Safety Services Company CEO Devon Dickinson. In addition to the financial ramifications due to health related issues, OSHA can fine employers for not having a policy in place. These fines start at $7,000.\nOSHA Requirements Intervention\nTo protect employers and employees from the danger of operating forklifts OSHA crafted regulation 29 CFR 1910.178, which outlays a strict series of training, operating and maintenance requirements for all companies utilizing PITs.\nThis next chapter is a survey of some of the requirements in forklift operation that a novice may not know.\nYour employees need training on the basics of forklift operation. These topics must include:\n- The proper distance forks are to be raised when transporting a load and the operating of the forks while the lift is moving in a forward or reverse direction. [29 CFR 1910.178 (n)(7)(iii)].\n- The safe speeds at which the forklift is to operate to facilitate proper stopping. [29 CFR 1910.178 (n)(8)].\n- The operator is required to look forward and keep a clear view of the travel path [29 CFR 1910.178(n)(6)].\n- The riding on a lift by a person other than the primary operator. [29 CFR 1910.178 (m)(3)].\n- The driving of forklifts into fixed objects that other objects may be resting on. These objects include benches, tables and more.[29 1910.178 (m)(1)]\nA number of factors including size, weight, shape, and position of the load affect the stability of a loaded truck. Also affecting the stability is the height at which the load is elevated, the amount of forward or backward tilt, tire pressure, and the dynamic forces created when the truck is moving. Your employees must be trained in controlling these variables to maintain proper stability.\nOSHA requires you to properly maintain your forklifts. Through this maintenance program your employees are required to examine their truck each day before placing the vehicle in service or, if the trucks are operated around the clock, they need to be inspected prior to the start of each shift. If the truck shows any condition adversely affecting the safety of the vehicle, that vehicle shall immediately be taken out of service and repaired. [29 CFR 1910.178(q)(7)].\nA few examples of these conditions can include:\n- Defective/unadjusted brakes\n- Damaged mast chain\n- Play in steering\n- Sparks from exhaust/truck\n- Inoperable horn\n- Defective controls\n- Damaged chain anchor pin\n- Worn tires/damaged rims\n- Inoperable gauges\n- Not running well/missing\n- Dislodged/defective counterweight\n- Damaged overhead guard/LBR\n- Wear/defects in the forks/carriage\n- Cracks/defects in mast/structure\n- Missing/non legible data plate\n- Evidence of leaks (i.e. hydraulics, fuel)\nModifications and replacement parts\nOSHA regulations strictly forbid the alteration of your forklift without manufacturer's approval and require you to use exact replacement parts. Common cited modifications include the installation of a taller or heavier mast and adding ballast to the back of the truck to increase its lifting capacity.\nAnother modification that many operators unknowingly perform with an electric forklift is using a cheaper replacement battery. Stock electric batteries often weigh several thousand pounds and cost thousands of dollars. By installing a smaller battery, you can save hundreds of dollars. However, these cheaper batteries are lighter and modify the lifting capacity and stability of the lift. This significantly increases the potential for an accident.\nA horn is one of the warning devices you are required to have on all your lifts. Your drivers also must be trained on when to use this horn. The most common usage is when the driver is navigating the lift through areas that may have blind spots. A blind spot is by definition any place in the direction of travel the driver cannot see without special effort. In addition to the horn, the lift is required to have functioning back up buzzers, bell or other audible device. [29 CFR 1910.178 (n)(4)].\nRefresher training must be provided at least every 3 years. In addition to the retraining, OSHA requires your employees to receive regular evaluations. If improper techniques are observed during evaluation then re-training is required.\nHere is a list of some things to look for when evaluating:\n- ALL traveling\n- using attachments\n- parking/shutting down\n- floor surfaces\n- driving in reverse\n- accessing/egressing truck\nSafety for non-operators and your workplace\nMany of the accidents involving forklifts each year are at no fault of the driver. In these cases, workplace conditions or actions of employees not utilizing the lift were at fault for the accidents. In cases such as these, the conditions of the workplace or actions of employees not utilizing the lift were at fault for the accidents.\nIt is because of these extenuating circumstances that OSHA not only requires training for your direct users of lifts, but also requires you to maintain the workplace and train all those who have the potential to come in contact with lifts.\nIn terms of maintaining the workplace, you must check for cracks in surfaces, pooling of water or any other potential hazard. Some topics of training for non-lift operators may include:\n- Limit some aisles to workers on foot only or forklifts only\n- Restrict the use of forklifts near time clocks, break rooms, cafeterias, and main exits, particularly when the flow of workers on foot is at a peak (such as at the end of a shift or during breaks)\n- Install physical barriers where practical to ensure that workstations are isolated from aisles traveled by forklifts\n- Evaluate intersections and other blind corners to determine whether overhead dome mirrors could improve the visibility of forklift operators or workers on foot\n- Make every effort to alert workers when a forklift is nearby. Use horns, audible backup alarms, and flashing lights to warn workers and other forklift operators in the area\n- Flashing lights are especially important in areas where the ambient noise level is high\nImpact of Training\nTraining is an important part of eliminating job place injuries. Studies of forklift specific training show a 70% reduction in operator errors.  Through independent studies, OSHA has confirmed employers who have in place a safety and health training program experience a 52 percent lower rate of \"injury with days away\" than employers without a program. \nA second study of private industry employers by OSHA found even more benefits to a safety training program. Here are a few highlights of those programs:\nCompany Benefits: \n- Average Sales rose 7.5 percent\n- Manufacturing defects and waste dropped from $2.7 million in 2001 to $435,000 in 2005\n- Improved decision-making\n- Emergency Modification Rate dropped by 45%\nSafety and health also make big reductions in indirect costs, due to: \n- Increased productivity\n- Higher quality products\n- Increased morale\n- Better labor/management relations\n- Reduced turnover\n- Better use of human resources\nThe value of training is further emphasized by a study of 41 workers hospitalized for hand injuries. Through the survey of these employees conducted by members of National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) it was discovered more than half had no on-the-job training for the equipment that caused their injury.\nWorkplaces that establish safety and health management systems can reduce their injury and illness costs by 20 to 40 percent, according to OSHA. Studies not only show the impact safety training has in increasing productivity and preventing injury. It shows the value training has to prevent casualties.  A NIOSH study of 55 confined workplace fatalities found that only three of those losing their lives ever received training on the proper workplace safety procedures.\nA study of the California insurance industry also revealed that every dollar invested in safety training resulted in $3 or more dollars in savings,\" Safety training is not a cost, it is an investment.\nA Simpler Forklift Safety Solution\nBy requesting and reading this report, you are no doubt aware of the hazards associated with forklifts and the long list of regulations your company must abide by.

{"question":"Are both the Brett Whiteley forgery trial and William Sommer's artwork cases examples of successful sales in their respective markets?","answer":"No. While William Sommer's artwork 'Pigs' was successfully sold at auction for $17,220, exceeding expectations, the Brett Whiteley forgery case resulted in controversy and market uncertainty, with paintings that can never easily re-enter the market due to authenticity concerns.","context":["\"No-one was expecting a forgery as brazen as this.\" New book on Whiteley forgery scandal\nThe release this week of Gabriella Coslovich’s new book, Whiteley on Trial, has once again ignited Art World chatter, shining a light on the murkier side of the Australian art scene and finding that it exists still as a safe place for unsavoury characters.\nDespite as the title of Coslovich’s investigative work suggests, the true culprit was not Brett Whiteley. Neither was it solely the pair of art conservator Mohamed Aman Siddique and art dealer Peter Gant who were on trial throughout 2016 in the Victorian Supreme Court for perpetuating Australia’s largest art fraud. Coslovich points the finger squarely at the Court itself, in its determination it seems to lay fault squarely at the feet of the Art World.\nIn its summation the Court gobsmackingly dismissed expert analysis and the irrefutable observations of Whiteley’s widow and protector, Wendy, as in effect mere opinion.\nI agree with Coslovich’s central thesis that the courts were impatient, reticent and less than rigorous in dealing with this case. In my view, it is however not just the courts that have to answer for the surprise outcome in this extraordinary case - that reverberates still - but the legal system itself. Frustratingly, the law it seems was simply inadequate to deal with things of this nature.\nIt was not the first time the multiple bankrupted Gant had been before the courts charged with attempting to sell forgeries.\nAt the risk of paraphrasing Oscar Wilde's Lady Bracknell, ‘Once may be regarded as a misfortune; but twice looks like carelessness'.\nCollectors duped by fake Blackmans and Dickerson\nIn 2010, a judge found three art works sold by Gant and said to be by prominent Australian artists Charles Blackman and Robert Dickerson were fakes. Blackman and Dickerson took their case against Gant to the Victorian Supreme Court. They alleged the two Blackman works he supplied, Three Schoolgirls and Street Scene with Schoolgirl, and Dickerson’s Pensive Woman, were not genuine. The three works were sold to a Melbourne businessman between 1999 and 2005 for more than $24,000.\n“They were fakes masquerading as the genuine article\", the judge said.\n‘‘What is more, they were deliberately contrived to deceive unsuspecting members of the public. The false signatures drawn on each of the works could have had no other purpose.’’ Remarkably Justice Vickery made no finding against Gant that he knew the works were not authentic. Despite this, he said these breaches of the Fair Trading Act were serious, leading to reduced confidence in the works of the artists. The public could also be duped by unwittingly buying forged artwork, he said. The artists who launched the civil action settled their claim with gallery owner Helen Stewart and the forgeries were later ceremoniously destroyed. (Businessmen duped in art forgery, Sydney Morning Herald, 1 June 2010)\nThe Whiteley Case\nIn 2016, Gant and Siddique were found guilty in Australia's biggest art fraud case – involving purportedly fake Brett Whiteley paintings entitled, Big Blue Lavender Bay and Orange Lavender Bay which sold for $3.6 million. The two men were initially jailed being found guilty of two counts of obtaining a financial advantage by deception and one of attempting to obtain a financial advantage by deception involving the three artworks. But a Supreme Court judge granted the pair a stay on their sentences after admitting he was troubled by the jury's verdict based on the evidence of some expert witnesses.\nDespite their evidence, he said it was possible the paintings actually were Whiteley originals dating back to the late 1980's. The decision on this basis was overturned as unsound soon after on appeal.\nArt dealer Peter Gant arrives at Court to face allegations of engaging in a criminal enterprise\nAustralian art dealer Stuart Purves was at the time indignant, “the works concerned in this case are forgeries. I worked with Brett Whiteley as a major gallery representative for his professional career as a painter, sculpture, printmaker and more for over quarter of a century. We were busy, we were close and I learnt his style. Over such a period of time you learn to understand and recognise the hand of the artist, like a mother recognises her child. It’s both factual and instinctive.\nIn this case the sad part is that the law has not been able to clarify what is generally understood in the art world, or assign blame to those who may be at fault. In my view this case was not handled with the intensity that it actually required; imagine if it was counterfeit money instead of oil paintings.” (Coslovich 2017, p313)\nWriting in The Australian last week, Patricia Anderson critiquing Coslovich’s book writes,\nIn the Whiteley case the jury found the men guilty. The art world celebrated. But earlier this year the court of appeal reversed the guilty verdict and the art dealer and the restorer walked free. Whether the paintings are real or fakes remains an open question.\nThe ongoing dilemma for the art market is that fakes are proliferating. While those purchased by state galleries such as the National Gallery of Victoria’s ‘‘Van Gogh self-portrait” are demoted in the full glare of public scrutiny, individual buyers are often obliged to lick their wounds in private, and perhaps seek to reintroduce the work back into the marketplace through a sympathetic dealer or auction house, a classic example of pass the parcel.\nThe law demanded proof ‘beyond reasonable doubt’ that a crime had been committed,’’ Coslovich writes. “The art market demanded the opposite, reasonable proof that an artwork was genuine.’’\n\"Notions of authenticity\", she argues, seem “beyond the scope of the law. The question is do we, as culture, care?”\nUltimately both buyers were left with paintings that will never easily re-enter the market. Coslovich’s intricately researched story is a cautionary tale.\n(Patricia Anderson, 'Whiteley on Trial by Gabrielle Coslovich: an art world whodunit', The Australian, 30 September 2017 (edited))\nIn my view, the Court in this criminal case was negligent in its failure to uncover the truth. But the administration of justice here was constrained by the law itself. Some legal experts have recommended strengthening existing intellectual property laws to address the growing problem of art forgeries proliferating in the mass market. They argue that the existing legal regime, in this case the criminal code - with its strict rules of evidence and higher evidentiary burden of proof - is ineffective in combating this growing trend. In this, one can only agree.\nWhilst the characters in this sordid legal drama may well disappear from view, the damage to the reputation of and public confidence in the often secretive Art World it seems is unlikely to fade any time soon.\nGabriella Coslovich Photo: Kate Ballis, Sydney Morning Herald\nGabriella Coslovich, Whiteley on Trial, Melbourne University Press, 2017 (RRP $29.95)\nMain Photo: Brett Whiteley in his Surrey Hill's studio, Sydney Morning Herald\nAndrew McIlroy is a visual artist, living and working in Melbourne, Australia","Auction Action In Cleveland, Ohio\nCLEVELAND, OHIO – Competition on a portrait of Berniece Singer by her husband, Clyde Singer (Ohio, 1908-1999) was stiff. Two online bidders battled against two phone bidders and several people in the auction room, one from Medina, Ohio, who owned a portrait of the artist he hoped to reunite with the portrait. In the end, a phone bidding collector and friend of the artist from Detroit, Mich., outspent everyone else and paid $30,750, more than tripling its high estimate. It was the top lot in the Rachel Davis Fine Art October 23 sale.\n“I was hoping it would sell somewhere in the estimate,” Rachel Davis said after the sale. “I never expected it to hit the price it did. While Clyde Singer’s works have been steadily climbing over the past years, the ones that have always commanded the most money were the New York Street scenes, this was a portrait of his wife.” She noted that Singer had given the work to his dentist, Richard Robinson, who often accepted paintings in lieu of payment. The portrait of Singer’s wife had descended in Robinson’s family and was sold by his daughter.\nEight more works by Singer were in the sale: another three were consigned by Robinson’s daughter and four by the family of Sara Schneider, who had been involved with getting the Canton Institute of Art (later the Canton Museum of Art) off the ground.\nAnother of the Robinson family’s collection of works by Singer included “McSorley’s Group,” a 1965 oil on canvas board that measured 20 by 24 inches and depicted the interior of one of New York City’s venerable taverns, McSorley’s Old Ale House. The bar was a popular subject for American painter John Sloan, who Singer knew and emulated during his time spent at the Art Students League in New York. It brought $8,610, nearly three times its high estimate, and sold to a private collector in Ohio. “Pedestrian Corner,” which had been consigned by the Schneider family, was done in 1975 and walked out the door for $6,150, also to a buyer from Ohio.\nDavis noted that all of Singer’s works would be staying in Ohio. “He’s always been very popular here. He was born in Malvern, which is a small town, and studied at the Art Students League with (Reginald) Marsh and (Thomas Hart) Benton. He hated New York City and returned to Ohio, where he lived in Youngstown. He never went modern, and always painted local small scenes. His works have been slowly coming on the market and growing; the larger ones have always sold privately. The Butler Institute of American Art and the Canton Museum have given him retrospectives. There are a lot of great paintings in private Ohio collections. People in central Ohio actively pursue his paintings. He was a hometown boy done good!”\nAnother local artist in the sale was William Sommer (1867-1949), who was represented by nine lots. His oil on board titled “Pigs” brought the highest price, $17,220, which was a pleasant surprise to Davis, who said she “wasn’t sure how much the subject matter of pigs would affect (the price).” It was bought by a collector from Medina, who had been the underbidder on Singer’s portrait of his wife. Done in 1923, it was an early work for an artist who was born in Detroit but studied in Germany and worked as a lithographer in New York before he moved to Cleveland. He befriended William Zorach, whose portrait of Sommer was included in the sale and brought $4,613. Sommer was particularly prolific in watercolors; six were in the sale and realized prices from $984 to $1,968.\nDavis has been selling ceramic works by Cleveland potter Claude Conover (Ohio, 1907-1994) since the early 1980s, when his vessels, or “bottles” as he called them, brought $100 at auction. She noted that his market has been climbing recently, with many works now going to buyers in New York City and Italy. She offered three of his pieces in her sale, all of which were bought by a trade buyer on the East Coast, for prices ranging from $8,610 down to $5,535. All prices surpassed their presale expectations.\nViktor Schreckengost, who was born in 1906 in Sebring, Ohio, was both a ceramicist and watercolorist; the sale had three of his plates and two of his watercolors. Leading the offerings was a “Danse Moderne” ceramic plate from his “Jazz” series, which had a flaw in its glaze that kept the price modest; it sold to a Cleveland collector for $4,613.\n“He did very well, his castings are incredible. We’ve had him from time to time and his things occasionally come up in wildlife auctions,” Davis said, referring to Cleveland raised Walter Matia (b 1953), who grew up birdwatching and duck hunting and spent summers working in the exhibits department at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History. Four works were offered in the sale, led by a bronze sculpture of a blue heron, done in 1999 from an edition of 36, which stood 18 inches tall and had provenance to the Vixseboxse Gallery in Cleveland. A buyer in Florida bagged it for $6,150. A pair of bronze curlews, done in 1988 and handled by the Vixseboxse Gallery, sold within estimate, for $2,829.\nThe sale witnessed a new artist record for Massilon, Ohio, born Charles Coe (b 1902), when “December” sold to a collector in Chicago, for $4,613, now the highest price on record for the artist. The oil on canvas depicted a snowy landscape and had been painted in 1932; it was exhibited a year after it was painted in the “15th Exhibition of Work by Cleveland Artists and Craftsmen Cleveland Museum of Art” and in 1939 at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts’ “134th Annual Exhibition of Painting and Sculpture.” Davis had been aware of Coe, who exhibited regularly at the Cleveland Museum, but with only one previous auction record, she had few comparable examples to base an estimate on. She priced it at $1/2,000 and said she was “surprised at the interest. I liked the painting; it was one of my favorites. We had interest from all over; it sold to a collector in Chicago bidding online.”\nThe 382-lot sale was more than 88 percent sold and achieved $380,000.\n“I was very happy with it overall,” Davis said. “I had been a little concerned with traditional works from the Nineteenth and early Twentieth Century, but they held their own.”\nThe next sale at Rachel Davis Fine Art is tentatively scheduled for December 3-4.\nPrices quoted include the buyer’s premium as reported by the auction house.

Done in oil on canvas measuring 42 by 36 inches, it sold for $30,750 to a collector in Detroit, Mich., who outbid a Medina, Ohio, collector who owned a portrait of the artist ($6/9,000).\nTwo international phone bidders competed for “Self Portrait with Curly Hair and White Collar” by Rembrandt Van Rijn (Dutch, 1606-1669). The bidder from London outbid the one from Holland to take the 1630 etching for $27,060. It was a big price for a tiny work — it measured just 2- by 1- inches — and was the second highest price realized in the sale ($18/24,000).\nEdward Potthast’s “Grand Canyon” will be included in a forthcoming catalog raisonné by Mary Leonhard Ran. The 16-by-20-inch oil on canvas, which had sold at auction in Cleveland in 1991, sold to a trade buyer bidding online, for $22,140 ($12/18,000).\n“Pigs” by William Sommer (American, 1867-1949) was done in 1923 and is a rare example in oil. It had provenance to the Joseph Erdelac collection in Cleveland and had been included in the Fifth Exhibition of Work by Cleveland Artists and Craftsmen, Cleveland Museum of Art in 1923. A Medina, Ohio, collector paid $17,220 for it ($3/6,000).\nThere were two works by Marcl Dyf (French, 1899-1985) in the sale, both of which came from a Cleveland estate. “Roses and Marguerites,” an oil on canvas that measured 21½ by 18 inches, brought the higher price of the two, $8,610. The other painting, a landscape titled “Poplar in Dordogne,” brought $3,198. Both sold to the same trade buyer in London ($2/4,000).\n“McSorley’s Group,” done by Clyde Singer in 1965, had been in the collection of Richard Robinson. It sold to a buyer in Ohio for $8,750 ($ ,000).\n“Tzin” by Claude Conover measured 19 inches high and 16 inches diameter. At $8,610, it was the highest price realized for three vessels in the sale, all of which were bought by a trade dealer in New York ($5/7,000).\n“Pedestrian Corner” by Clyde Singer had been acquired from the artist by Sara Schneider, who championed the arts in Canton, Ohio. The 1975 acrylic on panel work measured 41 by 20½ inches and sold to a buyer in Ohio, for $6,150 ($ ,000).\n“Blue Heron” by Walter Matia (Ohio, b 1953) soared to $6,150. The 18-inch-tall bronze will migrate from a private collection in Cleveland to its new home in Florida ($1,5/2,500).\nIllinois-based artist Art Frahm (1907-1981) is known for his pin-up illustration. “Oh What a Beautiful Morning,” done in 1951 in oil on canvas, measured 30 by 23 inches and sold for $4,920 ($3/5,000).\nA New York buyer paid $4,920 for Salvador Dali’s (Spanish, 1904-1989) “Ivanhoe” suite of four lithographs ($1,5/2,500).\n“I liked the painting; it was one of my favorites,” Davis said of “December” by Charles Coe (Ohio, 1902-1964). It attracted interest from several bidders, selling to a collector in Chicago for $4,613. That price sets a new record for the artist ($ ,000).\nA Cleveland collector paid $4,613 for Viktor Shreckengost’s “Danse Moderne” cast slip plate with black slip on white body that had been made in 1931 for Cowan Pottery. It measured 11 inches in diameter and had a glaze flaw that kept the result within estimate ($3/5,000).\nPolish born Julian Stanczak (1928-2017) moved to Ohio and was known for Op art and colorist painting. “Blue Cut-Out Fold,” a serigraph in two colors, was from an edition of 165 and brought $3,321 ($1,2/1,800).\n“Study for Standing Woman – One Leg” by David Hostetler came from a Columbus collection and was acquired by a Cleveland collector, for $3,321 ($ ,000).\n“Mount Hood, Sunset” by Eliza Barchus (American, 1857-1959) typifies the work of the mountain landscape painter. It exceeded expectations, bringing $3,075 ($1,5/2,500)."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"english_native_fluent"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:7d66d64b-4124-4686-9099-449cbc843f4b>","<urn:uuid:4ad56241-2692-47d3-a8a1-27c00860b755>"],"error":null}

PAD is most typically caused by an accumulation of fatty material in the arteries (atherosclerosis). PAD can restrict blood flow to the legs and feet where symptoms are often present, including: cold feet, a loss of hair on the legs and feet, skin that has a shiny appearance, toenails that are brittle or grow slowly, sores on the feet or legs that don’t heal, weakness in the legs, difficulty finding a pulse in the foot or leg, and more. It is important to be properly diagnosed and treated early to avoid more dangerous conditions from developing and to reduce the risk of stroke and heart attack. If you are exhibiting any of the symptoms described, it is suggested that you make an appointment with a podiatrist as soon as possible.\nPeripheral artery disease can pose a serious risk to your health. It can increase the risk of stroke and heart attack. If you have symptoms of peripheral artery disease, consult with Richard P. Jacoby, DPM from Extremity Health Centers. Our doctor will assess your condition and provide you with quality foot and ankle treatment.\nPeripheral artery disease (PAD) is when arteries are constricted due to plaque (fatty deposits) build-up. This results in less blood flow to the legs and other extremities. The main cause of PAD is atherosclerosis, in which plaque builds up in the arteries.\nSymptoms of PAD include:\n- Claudication (leg pain from walking)\n- Numbness in legs\n- Decrease in growth of leg hair and toenails\n- Paleness of the skin\n- Erectile dysfunction\n- Sores and wounds on legs and feet that won’t heal\n- Coldness in one leg\nIt is important to note that a majority of individuals never show any symptoms of PAD.\nWhile PAD occurs in the legs and arteries, Podiatrists can diagnose PAD. Podiatrists utilize a test called an ankle-brachial index (ABI). An ABI test compares blood pressure in your arm to you ankle to see if any abnormality occurs. Ultrasound and imaging devices may also be used.\nFortunately, lifestyle changes such as maintaining a healthy diet, exercising, managing cholesterol and blood sugar levels, and quitting smoking, can all treat PAD. Medications that prevent clots from occurring can be prescribed. Finally, in some cases, surgery may be recommended.\nIf you have any questions, please feel free to contact one of our offices located in Scottsdale, Peoria, and Buckeye, AZ .

Start with a pair of comfortable hiking boots or shoes that provide plenty of room in the toe box and ensure that the feet don’t slip out of the shoes at the heel or arch area. It is also important to gradually break the boots in before going on a long hike. Choose moisture-wicking socks, or even toe-socks that separate the toes—preventing them from rubbing together and possibly even helping to distribute your weight more evenly. Bring an extra pair of socks to switch out if your feet get too sweaty or wet during the hike. Before you hit the trail, do some gentle stretching in your bare feet such as rolling your arches on a tennis ball, stretching out your toes, circling your ankles slowly, and stretching your calves. If you have spots on your feet that are prone to blistering, apply some tape, moleskin, or a bandage to the area, and pack extra supplies to apply to any hotspots you start feeling on the trail. For advice on choosing shoes or getting custom orthotics that are best for your specific feet on or off the trail, please consult with a podiatrist today.\nExercising your feet regularly with the proper foot wear is a great way to prevent injuries and build strength. If you have any concerns about your feet, contact Richard P. Jacoby, DPM from Extremity Health Centers. Our doctor can provide the care you need to keep you pain-free and on your feet.\nExercise for Your Feet\nExercise for your feet can help you gain strength, mobility and flexibility in your feet. They say that strengthening your feet can be just as rewarding as strengthening another part of the body. Your feet are very important, and we often forget about them in our daily tasks. But it is because of our feet that are we able to get going and do what we need to. For those of us fortunate enough to not have any foot problems, it is an important gesture to take care of them to ensure good health in the long run.\nSome foot health exercises can include ankle pumps, tip-toeing, toe rises, lifting off the floor doing reps and sets, and flexing the toes. It is best to speak with Our doctor to determine an appropriate regimen for your needs. Everyone’s needs and bodies are different, and the activities required to maintain strength in the feet vary from individual to individual.\nOnce you get into a routine of doing regular exercise, you may notice a difference in your feet and how strong they may become.\nIf you have any questions please feel free to contact one of our offices located in Scottsdale, Peoria, and Buckeye, AZ .

Plantar fasciitis is the most common cause of heel pain, and this occurs when the plantar fascia, which connects the heel to the toes along the bottom of the foot, becomes inflamed or torn. Children who are experiencing heel pain may be suffering from Sever’s disease. Sever’s disease occurs in active teenagers when the growth plate in the heel becomes inflamed. Patients who are struggling with heel pain should consult with a podiatrist for diagnosis. Upon diagnosis, a proper treatment method will be provided by your podiatrist.\nMany people suffer from bouts of heel pain. For more information, contact Richard P. Jacoby, DPM of Extremity Health Centers. Our doctor can provide the care you need to keep you pain-free and on your feet.\nCauses of Heel Pain\nHeel pain is often associated with plantar fasciitis. The plantar fascia is a band of tissues that extends along the bottom of the foot. A rip or tear in this ligament can cause inflammation of the tissue.\nAchilles tendonitis is another cause of heel pain. Inflammation of the Achilles tendon will cause pain from fractures and muscle tearing. Lack of flexibility is also another symptom.\nHeel spurs are another cause of pain. When the tissues of the plantar fascia undergo a great deal of stress, it can lead to ligament separation from the heel bone, causing heel spurs.\nWhy Might Heel Pain Occur?\n- Wearing ill-fitting shoes\n- Wearing non-supportive shoes\n- Weight change\n- Excessive running\nHeel pain should be treated as soon as possible for immediate results. Keeping your feet in a stress-free environment will help. If you suffer from Achilles tendonitis or plantar fasciitis, applying ice will reduce the swelling. Stretching before an exercise like running will help the muscles. Using all these tips will help make heel pain a condition of the past.\nIf you have any questions please contact one of our offices located in Scottsdale, Peoria, and Buckeye, AZ .

Shoulder tendonitis is a condition that affects the shoulder joint. The shoulder joint is a ball and socket joint, which means that it has a lot of range of motion. This also makes it prone to injury. The most common type of shoulder tendonitis is rotator cuff tendonitis. This condition affects the tendons that attach the rotator cuff muscles to the bone. In this post, we’ll discuss the causes of shoulder tendonitis, symptoms, and treatment options.\nWhat is Shoulder Tendonitis?\nShoulder tendonitis also called rotator cuff tendonitis, it is a condition that results when one or more of the tendons that attach muscle to bone in the shoulder become inflamed. The condition is also referred to as bursitis or tendinitis of the shoulder.\nShoulder tendonitis most often affects the rotator cuff tendons. The rotator cuff is formed up of four muscles and associated tendons that attach the shoulder blade to the upper arm bone. The rotator cuff muscles and tendons maintain the joint stable and help lift the arm.\nThe rotator cuff muscles and tendons are subject to wear and tear. They can become inflamed or irritated from overuse or severe injuries. The condition is more common in people who participate in sports that involve repetitive overhead motions, such as throwing or swimming. As well, it might occur in people who do not engage in particular activities.\nCauses of Rotator cuff Tendonitis\nThere are several causes of shoulder tendonitis, some of which are more common than others. One of the most common causes is overuse of the shoulder muscles.\nThis can happen from repetitive activities such as pitching in baseball or serving in tennis or using the shoulder muscles in an unfamiliar way, such as when starting to lift weights. Other causes of shoulder tendonitis include\n● Injury or damage to the shoulder, such as a fall or collision\n● Stress on the joints from arthritis\n● A tumor or cyst near the rotator cuff tendon\n● Swelling in the rotator cuff, the group of muscles and tendons that surround the joint\n● Poor posture or outstretched arm\n● The improper technique of handling equipment\n● Weight gain\nSymptoms of Shoulder Tendonitis\nThe common symptoms of shoulder tendonitis can vary depending on the cause, but they typically include rotator cuff pain and tenderness and decreased range of motion. The pain may worsen when reaching overhead or behind the back and worse at night. Other symptoms may include\n● A creaking or grinding feeling when moving the shoulder\n● Dull ache pain\n● Stiffness in the biceps tendon\n● Numbness or tingling in the affected arm or hand\n● Severe inflammation in the injured arm\nWho can develop Shoulder Tendonitis?\nVarious risk factors can increase the likelihood of developing shoulder tendonitis, including\nThe risk of developing shoulder tendinitis increases with age. The tendons and muscles weaken with age, making them more susceptible to injury.\nShoulder tendonitis is more common in women than men. It may be because women have narrower shoulders, which stress the muscles and tendons more.\nEmployees with jobs that require repetitive overhead motions are at an increased risk of developing shoulder tendonitis. It includes occupations such as painting, carpentry, and baseball pitching.\nParticipation in certain sports can also increase the risk of developing shoulder tendonitis. These sports include tennis, swimming, and weightlifting.\nSeveral medical conditions can lead to shoulder tendonitis, including arthritis, diabetes, musculoskeletal and skin diseases, and thyroid problems.\nHow is Shoulder Tendonitis diagnosed?\nShoulder tendonitis can be diagnosed with a physical examination and a medical history. The doctor will ask about the symptoms and what activities or sports you participate in that may have led to the injury.\nHe or she will also examine the shoulder, which may include pressing on the shoulder muscles to check if there is any pain or tenderness. The doctor may order imaging tests such as an X-ray, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, or high-frequency sound waves to help diagnose the cause of tendonitis.\nHow is Rotator cuff Tendinitis treated?\nThe treatment for tendinitis will depend on the severity of the condition. In some cases, rest and ice may be all that is needed to reduce the pain and inflammation. The doctor may also recommend over-the-counter or prescription medications to help relieve the pain. If these conservative measures do not improve the symptoms, the doctor may recommend surgery. It may involve repairing or replacing the completely torn tendon or removing the inflamed tissue.\nWhich therapies can help with Rotator Cuff Tendonitis?\nSeveral therapies can help with rotator cuff tendonitis, including\nIt is essential to rest the shoulder to allow the tendons and muscles to heal. This may mean avoiding activities that stress the shoulder, such as lifting weights or playing tennis.\nApplying ice to the shoulder for twenty minutes several times a day can help reduce inflammation and swelling.\nApplying heat to the shoulder can also help relieve pain. Do this with a heating pad, warm towel, or warm compress.\nDoing gentle stretches of the shoulder muscles can help keep them loose and reduce pain.\nOnce the pain and inflammation have subsided, exercises that strengthen the shoulder muscles can help prevent recurrent injury.\nA physical therapist can help teaching you exercises to stretch and strengthen the shoulder muscles. They may also use ultrasound or electrical stimulation modalities to help reduce swelling and pain.\nPrevention of Shoulder Tendonitis\nIt is not always possible to avoid the condition, but there are some things that you can do to reduce your risk. These include\n● Resting the shoulder muscles after activity\n● Performing stretching exercises to maintain range of motion\n● Wearing a brace or sling to support the shoulder joint\n● Participating in low-impact activities, such as swimming or cycling\n● Maintaining a healthy weight\n● Correcting poor posture\n● Avoiding repetitive motion exercises and awkward positions\nHow long does it take for tendonitis to heal in the shoulder?\nIt is difficult to answer because the treatment plan and period for tendonitis can vary depending on the cause of the inflammation and the person’s overall health. In some cases, tendonitis may clear up within a few weeks, while it could take months or even years in others.\nYou can do many things to promote healing, such as resting the affected area, applying ice, and taking over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medication. If you are still experiencing pain after several weeks of home treatment, it is best to consult with a doctor to rule out any other potential causes of your pain.\nShoulder tendonitis is a condition that can be caused by repetitive motions or overuse. If you are experiencing shoulder pain, it’s essential to seek medical attention to determine the cause of your pain and to receive treatment.\nMany treatments are available, including rest, ice, physical therapy, and corticosteroid injections. Surgery may also be an option in some cases. With proper treatment, most people with shoulder tendonitis can return to normal activities."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:813013c0-cb2b-4b61-a780-14f6b46b254a>","<urn:uuid:a68281d9-a80f-4cd5-a6b9-29b0ca7b39d1>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the key differences between fiberglass and organic asphalt shingles in terms of their composition and performance characteristics?","answer":"Fiberglass and organic asphalt shingles differ in their base materials and performance characteristics. Fiberglass shingles use a fiberglass base mat coated with asphalt and ceramic granules, making them more fire-resistant and moisture-resistant. In contrast, organic shingles use an organic material like felt paper that is soaked in asphalt and then coated with an additional layer of asphalt with ceramic granules embedded. While organic shingles offer good wind resistance, high tear strength, and can be installed in colder temperatures, they are heavier and can become deformed over time. Both types must meet specific ASTM standards - fiberglass shingles should comply with ASTM D 3462, while organic shingles should meet ASTM D 225.","context":["What is the best asphalt shingle to use on my roof?\nThere are two kinds of asphalt shingles (based on the type of reinforcement mat used): fiberglass and organic. Fiberglass shingles are more fire- and moisture-resistant than organic shingles. Organic shingles have good wind resistance, high tear strength and can be installed in colder temperatures.\nAsphalt shingles should be in compliance with American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) standards and applicable building codes. Fiberglass shingles should meet ASTM D 3462, “Standard Specification for Asphalt Shingles Made from Glass Felt and Surfaced with Mineral Granules,” and organic shingles should meet ASTM D 225, “Standard Specification for Asphalt Shingles (Organic Felt) and Surfaced with Mineral Granules.”\nOne contractor’s bid includes 15# underlayment and another contractor says he only uses 30# because it’s the best. Who is right?\nFor asphalt shingles, NRCA recommends a single layer of 15# asphalt-saturated underlayment be used with roofs having slopes of 4:12 (18 degrees) or greater. For roof slopes between 3:12 (14 degrees) to 4:12 (18 degrees), NRCA recommends a minimum of two layers of 15# underlayment. If you are installing a heavier-weight shingle with a projected long service life, using 30# underlayment instead of 15# would be appropriate.\nAre two layers of 15# underlayment the same as one layer of 30# underlayment?\nNo. Two layers of underlayment are referred to as a “double-layer of underlayment” and there is a 19-inch overlap between layers. One layer of underlayment is called a “single-layer of underlayment” and there is 2 inches of overlap between layers. NRCA recommends a double-layer of underlayment for roof decks having slopes of 3:12 (14 degrees) up to 4:12 (18 degrees).\nMy contractor wants to use staples instead of nails to install my asphalt shingles. Is that okay?\nNRCA recommends galvanized steel or the equivalent corrosion-resistant roofing nails for asphalt shingle installation. Also, verify the governing building code requirements and what the shingle manufacturer recommends.\nMy contractor suggested installing a ridge vent on my roof and I already have two single static vents. Do I really need a ridge vent?\nNRCA suggests the amount of attic ventilation be balanced between the eaves and ridge. The intent of a balanced ventilation system is to provide nearly equivalent amounts of ventilation area at the eave/soffit and at or near the ridge. For a balanced ventilation system to function properly, approximately one-half of the ventilation area must be at or near the ridge.\nProper attic ventilation is one of the least understood concepts in residential roofing. To learn more, read “Principles of Attic Ventilation” an article by Mark Graham, NRCA Associate Executive Director of Technical Services, that appeared in NRCA’s magazine, Professional Roofing or see Technical Bulletin 98-2.\nMy house has a roof with a 2 1/2:12 (11 degrees) slope. The manufacturer says it’s okay to use asphalt shingles, but my contractor says it isn’t. Who’s right?\nThere are some manufacturers (and even model building codes) that will allow the application of asphalt shingle roof having that slope; however, NRCA does not recommend shingles on slopes less than 4:12 (18 degrees). Asphalt shingle roof systems are watershedding and rely on gravity and roof slope to effectively drain water off the roof.\nMy house has a flat roof. What is the best roof system for a flat roof?\nThere is no one roof system that is best for all applications. Keep in mind that even if you are using the best materials, your roof system still can be installed improperly and you could end up with a leaky roof. Good workmanship and proper attention to detail (e.g., flashing and drainage issues) are just as important as material selection. Also, maintenance plays an important role in roof system integrity and service life.\nTo assist you in your decision-making, homeowners should be informed of what is available. Please refer to the Roof System Types page to learn about the different low-slope roof systems.","Trying to figure out the different roofing types, roof designs and styles, and which roofing materials work best for your home can be overwhelming. There are many varieties to pick from depending on your roof type, the look you want, and your budget. Below, we take a look at the different types of roofing materials, designs and styles.\nRoofs may seem like a basic part of home construction, but there is a lot to know about them! There are a number of different types of roof shingles you can have on your home, and they range in cost, durability, lifespan, and the potential effect on your insurance premium.\nWhat are Asphalt Shingles Made out of?\nThere are two basic ways that asphalt shingles are manufactured.\nFiberglass. Fiberglass base mat coated with the asphalt and then ceramic granules. Architectural shingles are typically made in this fashion, making them more fire resistant and incredibly durable for the cost.\nOrganic base-mat. Rather than using a fiberglass base-mat, this method uses an organic material, such as felt paper, which is soaked in asphalt. They are then coated in an additional layer of asphalt, which the ceramic granules are then embedded into. While they are considered to be more malleable than their fiberglass counterparts, they are heavier and can become deformed over the years.\nArchitectural Shingles vs. Three-Tab Shingles\nAsphalt shingles are made up of fiberglass layered between asphalt & ceramic covered granules. The result is a water-resistant coating that can deflect UV light. While this is the basic composition of asphalt shingles, there are some variations to consider.\nTwo of the most common varieties are architectural & three-tab shingles. If you’re a new homeowner or renovating your home roof on a budget, these are the two options that may be worth your while. Here is a breakdown of the pros & cons of each shingle style.\nThree-tab shingles are relatively thin as they’re built of a single layer of materials. Architectural shingles, on the other side, have two asphalt shingles stripes laminated together. This layering creates a shingle that is better suited to hold up against the elements.\nOn average, the three-tab shingle comes with a warranty of almost 20, 25, or 30 years. Architectural shingles have minimum warranties of about 30 years. In general, three-tab shingles have the life expectancy & can only handle winds up to 60 mph as opposed to its counterpart’s tolerance for 130 mph gusts.\nDurability Winner: Architectural Shingles\nWhile a house roof serves a practical purpose, it can also be a great opportunity to add a personal touch on your property. That is why homeowners want to explore a wide range of aesthetic options when it comes to roofing materials. The three-tab shingle doesn’t provide much flexibility in this regard. It comes in one shape & size and has a flat complexion.\nHowever, the layered effect of the architectural shingle leaves room for diverse shapes & sizes. Homeowners can choose from different dimensional looks as well as colors & textures. The versatility of architectural shingles is an attractive feature of this option.\nVersatility Winner: Architectural Shingles\nThe architectural shingles are the all-around superior product, which is why more homeowners are picking it over the three-tab option. When it comes to cost, architectural shingles typically runs $35-$45 per bundle. Three-tab shingles cost an average of $25 -$30 per bundle.\nOn the surface, the architectural shingles are 40-50 percent more expensive. Still, it is a better investment, because the life expectancy of the three-tab shingles is, at best, half that of architectural shingles. Homeowners who spend less initially end up shelling out much more to install and replace three-tab options.\nPrice Winner: Architectural Shingles\nPopular Roofing Exhaust Vents\nOff Ridge Vents\nOff ridge vents are advantageous when the actual ridge line of the roof is small. This can happen with complex roofs and homes that do not have one long, continuous ridge line for a traditional ridge vent to run across. Adding an off-ridge vent or two to these types of roofs can provide an added punch of ventilation to areas that don’t have enough.\nThough they sound similar in name, an off-ridge vent is only similar to a ridge vent because they both sit close to the crest of your roof. In fact, “off ridge vents” are much more similar to box vents than they are to ridge vents!\nOverall, off ridge vents are not a very popular style of vent and not one we recommend when compared to other, more effective exhaust roofing vents. Off ridge vents are not as effective as full ridge vents because they are much smaller and do not sit as high on the roof. Their size prohibits them from expelling a large amount of hot air and their location restricts their ability to vent the absolute hottest air, like a ridge vent.\nBox vents are similar to off-ridge vents but are a much more popular venting solution.\nOne of the main similarities to an off-ridge vent is that the first step for installation is cutting a hole in the roof for the vent to sit over. Another similarity is that box vents are generally installed in bunches across the roof in order to add extra ventilation. Just one or two box vents is not nearly enough to vent your entire roof!\nThe design of a box vent is more square than it’s off-ridge counterpart, hence the name; box vent. There are a wide range of sizes available to match what’s needed for your space. The most common sized box vent on the market today is 18 inches by 18 inches.\nBenefits of Hiring Professional Roofing Contractors\nProfessional roofers have been in the industry for many years and have worked on different types of roofing projects for different clients. This means that they can deliver excellent results without any mistakes. They will ensure that your roof remains safe and undamaged for a long time. They will carry out new installations or repairs with perfection using the right products and techniques.\nHiring a roofing contractor to install a new roof or repair a damaged roof is quite cost-effective. These professionals will get roofing materials at a much lower cost than you because they have built long-term relationships with suppliers. In addition, they have the right tools needed to complete the work depending on the roof situation. If you calculate the expenses of purchasing the needed tools and materials, you will find that the cost will be much higher.\nThe main benefit of hiring roofing expects is the fact that they provide quality materials. This will ensure that the roofing services or repairs last for a very long time. Roofing specialists know the materials that are of premium quality and those that suit your specific roof. In addition, they have access to quality materials at wholesale costs.\nExpert roofers will offer a warranty on both materials and labor that they have used. This will give the homeowner peace of mind because the repair or new installation is protected irrespective of what happens after the project is complete. If there are any issues with the roof within the given time frame, it will be inspected and the problem will be resolved without extra charges.\nHiring a professional roof replacement expert is more beneficial than doing it on your own. Roofing contractors will have access to the right supplies, materials, and equipment to carry out the job successfully.\nIn addition, they are able to overcome any issue or challenges that they can detect after carrying out a detailed roof inspection. Therefore, if you want the best services in the industry, you should hire an experienced and licensed roofing contractor."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"english_native_fluent"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:9900bb00-3562-49fb-9260-8283ede5f4b6>","<urn:uuid:3384120d-ff96-4e07-8fe3-271261af6a01>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What's the difference in how Ancient Greek and English handle double consonants in relation to accent rules?","answer":"In Ancient Greek, double consonants affected accent placement through syllable length rules, particularly in cases where the ultima's length determined whether an accent could appear on certain syllables. In modern English, when there are two like consonant letters within a word, they serve as a marker indicating that the syllable before the double consonants usually receives the accent, as in words like 'beginner' and 'letter'.","context":["ACCENT: GENERAL PRINCIPLES 149\nThere are three accents in Greek. No Greek accent can stand farther back than the antepenult.\n1. Acute (/): over short or long vowels and diphthongs. It may stand on ultima, penult, or antepenult: καλός, δαίμων, ἄνθρωπος.\n2. Circumflex (=): over vowels long by nature and diphthongs. It may stand on ultima or penult: γῆ, θεοῦ, δῶρον, τοῦτο.\n3. Grave (\\): over short or long vowels and diphthongs. It stands on the ultima only: τὸν ἄνδρα, τὴν τύχην, οἱ θεοὶ τῆς Ελλάδος.150\nThe acute marks syllables pronounced in a raised tone. The grave is a low-pitched tone as contrasted with the acute. The circumflex combines acute and grave.151\nAccented syllables in Ancient Greek had a higher pitch (τόνος) than unaccented syllables, and it was the rising and falling of the pitch that made Ancient Greek a musical language. The Greek word for accent is προσῳδία_ (Lat. accentus: from\nN.—The accent heard in Modern Greek and English is a stress-accent. Stress is produced by strong and weak expiration, and takes account of accented syllables to the neglect of the quantity of unaccented syllables. Thus, shortly after Christ, ἄνθρωπος was often pronounced like a dactyl, φίλος like a trochee; and πρόσωπον, ἐννέα, were even written πρόσοπον, έννήα.152\nThe marks of accent are placed over the vowel of the accented syllable. A diphthong has the accent over its second vowel (τοῦτο), except in the case of capital ᾳ, ῃ, ῳ (as Αιδης, 5), where the accent stands before the first vowel.153\nA breathing is written before the acute and grave (οἵ, ἤ), but under the circumflex (ὦ, οὗτος). Accents and breathings are placed before capitals: Ομηρος, Ωραι. The accent stands over a mark of diaeresis (8): κληῗδι.154\nThe grave is written in place of a final acute on a word that is followed immediately by another word in the sentence. Thus, μετὰ τὴν μάχην\na. An oxytone ( cross157) changes its acute to the grave when followed by another word, except: (1) when the oxytone is followed by an enclitic ( cross183 a); (2) in τίς, τί interrogative, as τίς οὗτος; who's this? (3) when an elided syllable follows the accented syllable: νύχθ' ὅλην ( cross124), not νὺχθ' ὅλην ( cross174 a); (4) when a colon or period follows. (Usage varies before a comma.)\nThe ancients regarded the grave originally as belonging to every syllable not accented with the acute or circumflex; and some Mss. show this in practice, e.g. πὰγκρὰτής. Later it was restricted to its use as a substitute for a final acute.156\nThe circumflex is formed from the union of the acute and the grave ( = ^), never from . Thus, παῖς πάὶς, εὖ ἔὺ. Similarly, since every long vowel may be resolved into two short units (\na. The whole vowel receives the acute when the second short unit of a vowel long by nature is accented: Δί_ Δὶί.157\nWords are named according to their accent as follows:\nOxytone (acute on the ultima): θήρ, καλός, λελυκώς.\nParoxytone (acute on the penult): λύ_ω, λείπω, λελυκότος.\nProparoxytone (acute on the antepenult): ἄνθρωπος, παιδεύομεν.\nPerispomenon (circumflex on the ultima): γῆ, θεοῦ.\nProperispomenon (circumflex on the penult): πρᾶξις, μοῦσα.\nBarytone (when the ultima is unaccented, cross158): μοῦσα, μήτηρ, πόλεμος.158\nA word is called\nAn accent is called\nThe invention of the marks of accent is attributed to Aristophanes of Byzantium, librarian at Alexandria about 200 B.C. The use of signs served to fix the correct accentuation, which was becoming uncertain in the third century B.C.; marked the variation of dialect usage; and rendered the acquisition of Greek easier for foreigners. The signs for the accents (and the breathings) were not regularly employed in Mss. till after 600 A.D.162\nThe position of the accent has to be learned by observation. But the kind of accent is determined by the following rules.162D\n1. Aeolic has recessive ( cross159) accent in all words except prepositions and conjunctions. Thus, σόφος, Ζεῦς, i.e. Ζέὺς, αὖτος, λίπειν (= λιπεῖν), λίποντος (= λιπόντος), ἄμμες (= ἡμεῖς).\n2. Doric regarded final -οι ( cross169) as long (ἀνθρώποι), and probably -αι in nouns (χώραι); made paroxytones the 3 pl. act. of the past tenses (ἐφέρον, ἐλύ_σαν) and such words as παίδες, γυναίκες, πτώκας; made perispomena the gen. masc. pl. of pronouns (τουτῶν, ἀλλῶν) and the gen. fem. pl. of adj. in -ος (ἀμφοτερᾶν). The substitution, in the accus. pl., of -ας and -ος for -α_ς and -ους, caused no change in the accent (πά_σας, ἀμπέλος).\nThe antepenult, if accented, can have the acute only (ἄνθρωπος, βασίλεια\na. Some nouns in -εως and -εων admit the acute on the antepenult. Thus, the genitive of nouns in -ις and -υς (πόλεως, πόλεων, ἄστεως), the forms of the Attic declension, as ἵ_λεως ( cross289). So the Ionic genitive in -εω (πολί_τεω); also some compound adjectives in -ως, as δύσερως\nThe penult, if accented and long, takes the circumflex when the ultima is short by nature (νῆσος, ταῦτα). In all other cases it has the acute (φόβος, λελυκότος, τούτου).\na. Apparent exceptions are ὥστε, οὔτις, ἥδε (properly ἧδε). See cross186.\nb. A final syllable containing a vowel short by nature followed by ξ or ψ does not permit the acute to stand on the antepenult (οἰκοφύλαξ); but the circumflex may stand on the penult (κῆρυξ).165\nThe ultima, if accented and short, has the acute (ποταμός); if accented and long, has either the acute (λελυκώς), or the circumflex (Περικλῆς).166\nWhen the ultima is long, the acute cannot stand on the antepenult, nor the circumflex on the penult. Thus, ἄνθρωπου and δῶρου are impossible.167\nWhen the ultima is short, a word, if accented\na. on the ultima, has the acute: σοφός.\nb. on a short penult, has the acute: νόμος.\nc. on a long penult, has the circumflex: δῶρον.\nd. on the antepenult, has the acute: ἄνθρωπος.168\nWhen the ultima is long, a word, if accented\na. on the ultima, has the acute or the circumflex: ἐγώ, σοφῶς.\nb. on the penult, has the acute: λέων, δαίμων.169\nFinal -αι and -οι are regarded as short: μοῦσαι, βούλομαι, πρόπαλαι, ἄνθρωποι. But in the optative -αι and -οι are long (λύ_σαι, βουλεύοι), as in contracted syllables. So also in the locative οἴκοι\na. The difference in the quantitative treatment of -αι and -οι depends on an original difference of accentuation that may have vanished in Greek. -αι and -οι, when short, were pronounced with a clipped, or simple, tone; when long, with a drawled, or compound, tone.\nThe quantity of α, ι, υ ( cross147) may often be learned from the accent. Thus, in θάλαττα, ἥμισυς, πῆχυς, δύναμις, μῆνις, the vowel of the last syllable must be short; in φίλος the ι must be short (otherwise φῖλος).

To find the number of syllables: Page 1 of 3 ---count the vowels in the word,http://english.glendale.cc.ca.us/phonics.rules.html Phonics Rules 8/18/08 11:27 AM---subtract any silent vowels, (like the silent \\\"e\\\" at the end of a word or the second vowel when two vowels a togetherin a syllable)---subtract one vowel from every diphthong, (diphthongs only count as one vowel sound.)---the number of vowels sounds left is the same as the number of syllables.The number of syllables that you hear when you pronounce a word is the same as the number of vowels sounds heard.For example:The word \\\"came\\\" has 2 vowels, but the \\\"e\\\" is silent, leaving one vowel sound andone syllable.The word \\\"outside\\\" has 4 vowels, but the \\\"e\\\" is silent and the \\\"ou\\\" is a diphthong which counts as only one sound, sothis word has only two vowels sounds and therefore, two syllables.2. Divide between two middle consonants.Split up words that have two middle consonants. For example:hap/pen, bas/ket, let/ter, sup/per, din/ner, and Den/nis. The only exceptions are the consonant digraphs. Never splitup consonant digraphs as they really represent only one sound. The exceptions are \\\"th\\\", \\\"sh\\\", \\\"ph\\\", \\\"th\\\", \\\"ch\\\", and\\\"wh\\\".3. Usually divide before a single middle consonant.When there is only one syllable, you usually divide in front of it, as in:\\\"o/pen\\\", \\\"i/tem\\\", \\\"e/vil\\\", and \\\"re/port\\\". The only exceptions are those times when the first syllable has an obviousshort sound, as in \\\"cab/in\\\".4. Divide before the consonant before an \\\"-le\\\" syllable.When you have a word that has the old-style spelling in which the \\\"-le\\\" sounds like \\\"-el\\\", divide before the consonantbefore the \\\"-le\\\". For example: \\\"a/ble\\\", \\\"fum/ble\\\", \\\"rub/ble\\\" \\\"mum/ble\\\" and \\\"this/tle\\\". The only exception to thisare \\\"ckle\\\" words like \\\"tick/le\\\".5. Divide off any compound words, prefixes, suffixes and roots which have vowel sounds.Split off the parts of compound words like \\\"sports/car\\\" and \\\"house/boat\\\". Divide off prefixes such at \\\"un/happy\\\",\\\"pre/paid\\\", or \\\"re/write\\\". Also divide off suffixes as in the words \\\"farm/er\\\", \\\"teach/er\\\", \\\"hope/less\\\" and \\\"care/ful\\\". In theword \\\"stop/ping\\\", the suffix is actually \\\"-ping\\\" because this word follows the rule that when you add \\\"-ing\\\" to a wordwith one syllable, you double the last consonant and add the \\\"-ing\\\".Accent RulesWhen a word has more than one syllable, one of the syllables is always a little louder than the others. The syllable withthe louder stress is the accented syllable. It may seem that the placement of accents in words is often random oraccidental, but these are some rules that usually work.1. Accents are often on the first syllable. Examples: ba'/sic, pro'/gram.2. In words that have suffixes or prefixes, the accent is usually on the main root word. Examples: box'/es, un/tie'.3. If de-, re-, ex-, in-,po-, pro-, or a- is the first syllable in a word, it is usually not accented. Examples: de/lay',ex/plore'.4. Two vowel letters together in the last syllable of a word often indicates an accented last syllable. Examples:com/plain', con/ceal'.5. When there are two like consonant letters within a word, the syllable before the double consonants is usuallyaccented. Examples: be/gin'/ner, let'/ter.6. The accent is usually on the syllable before the suffixes -ion, ity, -ic, -ical, -ian, -ial, or -ious, and on the secondsyllable before the suffix -ate. Examples: af/fec/ta'/tion, dif/fer/en'/ti/ate.http://english.glendale.cc.ca.us/phonics.rules.html Page 2 of 3\nPhonics, Syllable and Accent Rules - 5PRockinWikiWorld - home\nDescription: Phonics Rules 8/18/08 11:27 AM http://english.glendale.cc.ca.us/phonics.rules.html Page 2 of 3---subtract any silent vowels, (like the silent \"e\" at the end of a word ...\nRead the Text Version\nNo Text Content!"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"english_native_fluent"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:c330eec7-4fc3-4d4c-923a-83d8057306e4>","<urn:uuid:b8a4056f-7aae-45b9-97e2-9a6b5f542e7b>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How are delivery companies adapting to both cybersecurity challenges and environmental concerns, and what infrastructure limitations are they facing in both domains?","answer":"Delivery companies are facing dual challenges in cybersecurity and environmental adaptation. On the cybersecurity front, there's been a surge in phishing attacks, with telecommunications data being traded on Dark Web sites, potentially compromising payment methods and sensitive information. To address environmental concerns, major companies like Amazon and UPS are making significant moves toward electric vehicles, with Amazon ordering 100,000 electric delivery trucks and UPS ordering 10,000 electric trucks. However, both areas face infrastructure limitations - while cybersecurity requires enhanced protection measures like multifactor authentication, EV adoption is hindered by weak charging infrastructure in the US, particularly in rural areas where delivery companies regularly operate.","context":["Internet users are exposed to many types of attacks. The different attacks with which our computers can be infected are the different types of malware, viruses, Trojans and computer worms. Another one that is on the rise as well, and whose objective is to steal the credentials of our accounts, are phishing attacks. In this regard, many of the attacks of this type that occur today are aimed at social networks. In this article we are going to see how attackers increase phishing attacks on social networks thanks to a study by PhishLabs.\nTrend of threats such as Phishing\nIn PhishLabs’ quarterly report, throughout 2021 it has detected and mitigated a large number of phishing, social media, email, and dark web threats targeting a wide range of businesses and brands. It should be noted that the Phishing remains the dominant attack vector for the cyber criminals. If we make one comparison with the year 2020 we can see that has increased by 31.5%.\nAccording to John LaCour, founder and CTO of PhishLabs, in early summer 2021 we saw a drop in phishing volume. However, it also adds that this was punctual since these types of attacks increased again in the months of July and September. Many IT security teams will have been dealing with an onslaught of threats over the holidays. In this regard, it can be very important to know why phishing messages succeed and how to protect ourselves.\nAnother factor to keep in mind is that operators’ telecommunications data is also still being traded on Dark Web sites. Cybercriminals who gain access to account data after obtaining login credentials may gain access to payment method data and sensitive information. Currently, as we will see below, phishing in social networks as a way for bad actors to profit is the order of the day\nThe rise of phishing on social networks\nThe cyber criminals when making their attacks seek profitable targets that allow them to obtain benefits of some kind. In that regard, right now social networkss are now your preferred attack target, moreover, the attacks per target are constantly increasing and this year takes a 82% increase. The payment services industry also continues to be the most targeted, but staffing and hiring saw the sharpest increase in attacks compared to the second quarter.\nAnother thing talked about in this report is that Vishing incidents have also doubled and even tripled in number, for the second quarter in a row. In case you do not know, it is a type of social engineering scam in which, through a phone call, the identity of a trusted company, organization or person is impersonated, in order to obtain personal and sensitive information. of the victim.\nOne thing is clear, phishing attacks on social networks are on the rise. John LaCour believes that with the continuous increase in threats on social networks, it is necessary for companies to prioritize their visibility on platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and more. In addition, he adds that as seasonal hiring for the holidays increases, the staffing industry in particular must be prepared to deal with online problems of phishing and other scams. Here you can consult the report on the PhishLabs website.\nHow to be more protected from these attacks\nTo be more protected from phishing in social networks we should think about activate multifactor authentication in our accounts. Thus, even in the hypothetical case that they get our password, they would lack a second factor that could be, for example, putting a code that we obtain from Google Authenticator. Today the vast majority of major social networks have a two-step security verification. At RedesZone we recommend activating it for greater security.\nFinally, you may be interested in knowing the most common Phishing strategies in social networks such as Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn and Twitter.","Electric vehicles (EVs) hold a lot of promise for the private sector — especially as consumers, who are increasingly aware of the relationship between emissions and climate change, are starting to demand eco-friendly delivery options. EV adoption, however, has been slowed down by a few different challenges — the US’s poor EV charging infrastructure in particular.\nNow, however, we’re beginning to see signs that major businesses are willing to buy into EVs, despite potential road bumps.\nHere are the businesses that are leading the way when it comes to EV adoption.\nAmazon and UPS Lead Way on EV Adoption\nTwo delivery giants — Amazon and UPS — have begun to aggressively add EVs to their delivery fleets.\nEarlier this year in January, Amazon ordered 100,000 electric delivery trucks from EV manufacturer Rivian, as well as 10,000 electric delivery rickshaws for their operations in India. Then, around the end of the month, UPS announced that it had ordered 10,000 electric trucks from the UK-based manufacturer Arrival Ltd., and would soon be teaming up with self-driving car manufacturer Waymo for a pilot test of self-driving delivery vehicles.\nThe moves are part of broader pushes towards carbon neutrality and self-driving delivery by the two companies. Last year, Amazon announced the company’s plan to be 100 percent carbon-neutral by the year 2040. UPS already offers carbon-neutral and carbon-offset delivery options.\nThe moves also come as more cities around the U.S., including New York and Philadelphia., have begun to adopt anti-idling laws that allow the city to fine companies over idling delivery vehicles.\nSome cities have even developed apps that allow citizens to report idling vehicles based on that vehicle’s DOT number — making these policies even more costly for delivery companies. Because electric vehicles produce no emissions, they’re typically free from being fined — meaning savings for businesses that adopt EVs for city deliveries.\nThe announcements are both historic. While other companies have announced EV purchases — like Lyft, which plans to deploy 200 EVs in Denver as part of its rental vehicle program there — there’s been nothing near scale of these announced by Amazon and UPS.\nWhile neither UPS nor Amazon has plans to go fully electric any time soon, the purchases are a welcome sign for the EV industry. Coupled with similar positive signals from the individual consumer side of the industry, they likely demonstrate that despite early growing pains, EVs may be on track for widespread adoption in the near future.\nChallenges Facing Further EV Adoption\nHowever, there still remain significant barriers that may slow or prevent full EV adoption, primarily the weak EV charging infrastructure in the US and limited number of charging stations — although this, too, seems like it’s starting to change.\nChargePoint, in coalition with the National Association of Truck Stop Operators (NATSO) has formed the National Highway Charging Collaborative, which plans to install new charging stations at more than 4,000 highway-side locations in the U.S., in order to increase the availability of EV charging stations in rural areas.\nAt the same time, legislative support for stronger EV infrastructure is beginning to build. In February, Democratic lawmakers in the House of Representatives announced a new bill that would create a nationwide EV charging network within the next five years.\nUpgrades to existing infrastructure would likely encourage further adoption. They may also be especially beneficial for businesses like Amazon and UPS, as both companies regularly make deliveries to rural parts of the country — areas that don’t always have the charging infrastructure needed to support EVs.\nThe Future for EVs in Business\nEV adoption in the private sector, which has lagged in the past, seems to be accelerating. Two major delivery companies have now announced that they will be adding significant numbers of EVs to their delivery fleets, with more likely to come in the near future as both pursue low-carbon delivery options.\nWhile challenges remain that may slow down EV adoption — primarily the nation’s weak EV charging infrastructure — the purchases are likely a good sign for the industry and the future of EVs in the private sector."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"english_native_fluent"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:b42869f2-2503-474d-b612-f222dae45682>","<urn:uuid:a3b2914f-bfcd-4107-a76d-db9ca5d880cd>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How has Shakespeare casting evolved for minority actors, and what role has Jewish involvement played in shaping theatrical productions overall?","answer":"The casting of minority actors in Shakespeare has shown gradual progress since the 1980s, though opportunities remain limited. For instance, Paapa Essiedu became the first black actor to play Hamlet at the Royal Shakespeare Company in 2016, and that same year saw black actors playing King Lear and Macbeth in major venues. However, statistics show limited opportunities - only seven ethnic minority actors played Hamlet in the UK since 1930. There's also evidence of a 'black canon' where minority actors are often typecast in roles like servants, best friends, or 'exotic' characters. Meanwhile, Jewish influence has been substantial in theater, particularly on Broadway, with many renowned composers like Oscar Hammerstein, Richard Rodgers, and Stephen Sondheim being Jewish. Jewish producers like Emanuel Azenberg, Bernard Gersten, and Jeffrey Seller have been responsible for numerous successful productions, with their involvement often traced to their Jewish roots and cultural traditions of storytelling.","context":["In the musical “Spamalot,” King Arthur wants to bring his troupe to Broadway, but is advised (in song) against it:\nIn any great adventure\nThat you don’t want to lose,Victory depends upon the people that you choose.\nSo, listen, Arthur darling, closely to this news:\nWe won’t succeed on Broadway,\nIf you don’t have any Jews.\nIt’s obviously an exaggeration, but an exaggeration rooted in truth. Jews have been active on Broadway far out of proportion to their numbers, onstage as well as behind the scenes. Many of the great Broadway composers, such as Oscar Hammerstein, Richard Rodgers, Stephen Sondheim and the Gershwin brothers, were Jewish, as were Arthur Miller and Neil Simon, two of the 20th century’s greatest playwrights.\n“Part of the reason is that there was no prejudice in the theater,” said longtime producer Emanuel “Manny” Azenberg, who has produced most of Simon’s works, along with many other plays. “There were no limitations because you were Jewish. That, and it was part of the Jewish tradition. Theater was not foreign.”\nNames like Azenberg, Bernard Gersten and Jeffrey Seller are responsible for some of the great moments in theater history. And while these men came to theater in different ways, they all trace their interest to their Jewish roots.\nGersten, executive producer of Lincoln Center Theater, is responsible for the critically praised recent revival of “South Pacific,” among many other successful shows. He attributes his involvement in theater — at least in part — to getting caught up in the drama of the High Holy Day services at his father and grandfather’s respective Orthodox synagogues, in Newark, N.J.\n“The first curtain I encountered was the velvet curtain to the ark,” he said. “I always knew what I was going to find behind when the curtain was pulled back, but there was also an aspect of the mysterious and the wondrous. Then I found the counterpart of that in the legitimate theater. It’s still the revelations of theater that I find a primal mystery.”\nThere were other influences, as well. Gersten first appeared in a play in third grade, and had a one-performance run in “The Mad Hatter’s Tea Party” in sixth grade. “I came into my own, because I got laughs,” he remembered.\nIn the military during the World War II, Gersten was assigned to special services, where he met actors Maurice Evans and Judith Anderson. “I was 20 years old. I didn’t know anything about New York theater. They were a big deal,” he recalled.\nAfter the war’s conclusion, he served as assistant stage manager for a series of plays with the pair (produced by Mike Todd). Eventually, Gersten became a producer. If “you hang around long enough, you become a producer,” he explained.\nThroughout his career, Gersten has worked almost exclusively in not-for-profit theater, for 18 years with the Public Theater and for the past 26 at Lincoln Center. He has rebelled against his Orthodox upbringing, and now considers himself an atheist. Still, he traces his love affair with theater to those two Newark synagogues.\nThe first play Manny Azenberg produced was “The Lion in Winter” by James Goldman in 1966. Since then, he’s produced most of Simon’s works, including the autobiographical trilogy “Brighton Beach Memoirs,” “Biloxi Blues” and “Broadway Bound,” as well as the playwright’s Pulitzer Prize-winning “Lost in Yonkers.” He has also worked on “Ain’t Supposed To Die a Natural Death,” “Sunday in the Park With George,” and “The Wiz.” It is a list of which he’s proud. “You were judged by what you produced, and I am happy to be judged that way,” he said.\nAzenberg’s father was a leader in the Zionist labor movement and worked with Chaim Weizmann; one of Azenberg’s fondest memories was meeting Weizmann when he came to the United States to meet with President Truman. Azenberg was first exposed to theater through his uncle Wolfe Barzell, an actor in the Yiddish theater, whom he saw perform both on Second Avenue, the Yiddish Broadway of the time, and on Broadway itself.\nAzenberg himself got into theater after serving as an infantry lieutenant in the 1950s. “That was the real world. If you could get a job in theater, that wasn’t work — it was something else,” he said. “If you could make a living doing it, that was a thrill. It had some adventure; it was glamorous. And for me it was a way of expressing something. Going into real estate didn’t have that Jewish identity.”\nJewish identity is important to Azenberg, who runs an annual trip to Israel for show people after the Tony Awards.\nTheater has changed substantially over the years, Azenberg noted: “The theater was very much New York. Now it’s more of a theme park. Plays by Arthur Miller and Neil Simon had the rhythm of New York and New York Jews.”\nWhat’s changed? Prices, for one thing. Theater is “less accessible to the poor kid in the Bronx,” he said. The economics also make it harder to attract good actors. “You can make more in a week doing a commercial than you would in a play — if the play runs,” Azenberg said.\nJeffrey Seller is more optimistic. “The theater has always been in peril, but it always finds a way to emerge,” he said.\nSeller was raised in a suburb of Detroit and was first exposed to theater at the annual Purim play of Temple Israel, a local Reform congregation.\n“In the fourth grade… I was plopped into the chorus,” he recalled. “What made the plays in our temple so unique and inspiring is that the director would juxtapose the story with a Broadway musical. So when Queen Esther was singing about the king, she would be singing, ‘I’m gonna wash that man right out of my hair.’ I got both the experience of Purim and every composer from Rodgers and Hammerstein to Gilbert and Sullivan.”\nSeller continued acting in plays and musicals throughout his school years. When he started college, he began to wonder, “Who picks the plays?”\n“I became more interested in being in charge of the endeavor. I was interested in how do we sell tickets, how do we get out publicity,” he said.\nAfter college, Sellers came to New York and worked for producers Barry and Fran Weissler. He also took a part-time job as artistic director of Rodeph Sholom, a synagogue on Manhattan’s Upper West Side. But his life changed when he attended a workshop of a play by Jonathan Larson that was based on the opera “La Bohème.” “I wrote him the next day, saying. ‘I want to produce your musical,’” Sellers said. That musical was “Rent,” and the rest — including a Pulitzer Prize and a Tony award — is history.\nAs for the Jewish connection to theater, Sellers thinks it might have to do with an affinity for storytelling. “This is a culture that has embraced art, embraced storytelling. So it is no surprise it would embrace this form,” he said.\nAll of which proves that “Spamalot” might be right: King Arthur would have had a better shot at the Great White Way if only the Round Table had been kosher.\nCurt Schleier is the editor of tvsoundoff.com and filmsoundoff.com and teaches business writing for corporate staff.","Is the door really open for black actors to star in Shakespeare?\nFor black, Asian and minority ethnic performers, landing a leading role in a classical production is still often considered newsworthy. As Black History Month begins, Jami Rogers investigates how diverse our two leading Shakespeare venues really are…\nWhen the Royal Shakespeare Company announced late last year it had cast Paapa Essiedu to play Hamlet for its 2016 production, attention was immediately paid; that he became the first black actor to play Hamlet in the company’s history has been much discussed.\nThe larger picture, however, is that 2016 has been a comparatively exceptional year for black actors playing Shakespeare’s tragic heroes in high-profile venues. As well as Hamlet, this year has seen black actors playing King Lear (Don Warrington, Talawa Theatre Company/Manchester Royal Exchange) and Macbeth (Ray Fearon, Shakespeare’s Globe). What the presence of black male leads highlights is the growing participation in classical theatre for ethnic minority artists (the lack of similar opportunities for women and other minority groups at this level is also glaringly obvious).\nThe British Black and Asian Shakespeare Performance Database shows that, although progress in casting ethnic minority performers has not always been steady, it is a trend that has been visible since the early 1980s.\nAs with so many pockets of the entertainment industry, concentration on purely the growth in numbers of diverse talent obscures some major flaws in the ways in which members of ethnic minorities are included within our arts. It is a telling statistic that Essiedu was only the seventh ethnic-minority actor to have played Hamlet in the UK since 1930 (an eighth, Raphael Sowole, is currently touring in Jeffery Kissoon’s production for Black Theatre Live).\nThe paucity of black or Asian performers playing the role associated with the pinnacle of a classical actor’s career raises questions of how often do the major Shakespeare companies cast black, Asian and minority ethnic performers in leading roles?\nLooking at the historical data, advances in inclusion at this level have often stalled. One well-publicised breakout moment in integrated casting came in 1987 with Josette Simon’s Isabella in Measure for Measure (she had previously played Rosaline in Love’s Labour’s Lost in 1984). It is telling that no ethnic minority actor has since played Isabella in a major production. Granted, leading female roles in Shakespeare are not as prevalent as male, but it must be noted that Simon will have had an 18-year gap between her last Shakespeare role for the RSC in 1999 (Titania) and when she takes to the Stratford stage as Cleopatra in 2017.\nIt is no longer enough that performers of colour are included in Shakespeare’s plays; they must be nurtured up the casting tree\nAt Shakespeare’s Globe, Danny Sapani played Brutus in Julius Caesar in 1999 during its third season, but the theatre company has been slow to provide equal opportunity in casting for BAME performers as leads subsequently. Before Ray Fearon and Ira Mandela Siobhan (as Posthumus in Imogen, aka Cymbeline) this summer, the Globe had hired four ethnic minority actors to play leads between 2000 and 2015, one of which was for its only production of Othello to date.\nWhen you define leading roles as the largest part and/or title role in the plays (as I do here) and exclude touring and educational productions, the answer to ‘how often are actors from minority groups playing leading classical roles in our major theatres?’ is ‘not as often as may be expected in multicultural Britain’. This is particularly true given the levels of inclusion in terms of numbers of actors appearing in integrated productions since the early 1980s.\nBAME leads at the royal shakespeare theatre, 2000-2016\nViola, Twelfth Night\nAntipholus of Syracuse, The Comedy of Errors\nBottom, A Midsummer Night’s Dream\nPaulina, The Winter’s Tale\nBenedick, Much Ado About Nothing\nBeatrice, Much Ado About Nothing\nBrutus, Julius Caesar\nBAME leads at the Globe Theatre, 2000-2016\nJuliet, Romeo and Juliet\nKing of Navarre, Love’s Labour’s Lost\nRomeo, Romeo and Juliet\nTamora, Titus Andronicus\nIra Mandela Siobhan\nThere are a number of ways to look at the data stored in the British Black and Asian Shakespeare Performance Database, but if you pare it down to the main houses at the RSC and the Globe (staging roughly the same number of Shakespeare plays per year in those two theatres) and exclude their touring and educational productions (which are generally more diverse, but lack the national press and audience attention of the companies’ main stage seasons) the number is small.\nOver the past 16 years, there have been a total of 17 leading roles (as defined above) at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre and on the Globe’s main stage played by a black or Asian performer: 11 at the RSC and six at the Globe (see top infographic, below).\nNarrowing the data to what are arguably two of the elite stages in the country excludes some productions that have also provided actors such as Joseph Marcell and David Oyelowo with opportunities to play Shakespearean leads with the major companies, but the hierarchy of venues is important.\nThis can be seen in the attention that Essiedu’s casting as Hamlet received in contrast with that of Dharmesh Patel for the same company. Patel’s 2010 Hamlet for the RSC was little noticed, although he was also that rarity in casting, an ethnic minority actor playing Shakespeare’s iconic role. The reason for this is simple: Patel performed the Dane for the RSC’s young person’s Shakespeare, an educational touring version of the play and not on the main stage of the RSC.\nOn a positive note, broken down by date, the evidence is that the gains have been made since 2012. The bottom infographic (below) – using the same RSC and Globe productions as the first – represents the difference between the number of BAME leads cast in the two companies’ main houses between 2000 and 2011 and those since 2012, with seven leads cast in the first 11 years, but 10 in the following four.\nThere is clearly enough BAME classical acting talent to warrant rising through the ranks as their white counterparts have done, as recent productions have proven. But the lack of black or Asian leads in significant venues is indicative of a casting bottleneck that finds few performers of colour able to rise to leading-actor status on the country’s elite stages.\nWith the vast increase in participation in the arts we have seen since the early 1980s, the formation of an unofficial ‘black canon’ has occurred, which keeps the vast majority of black and Asian talent from playing Hamlet or Henry V. Instead, ethnic minority actors are more frequently cast in roles that uphold the stereotypes BAME performers have been decrying in television casting practices:\n1. Servants (Maria, Twelfth Night; Nurse, Romeo and Juliet)\n2. Best friends of the lead white actor, ‘blackta’ (Claudio in Much Ado About Nothing, Horatio in Hamlet)\n3. ‘Exotic’ or ‘colonial’ types (Oberon and Titania in A Midsummer Night’s Dream, Caliban in The Tempest)\nIt is true that BAME actors are also frequently cast in medium-sized, meaty roles (Ophelia, Macduff, Banquo, Horatio, Edmund) that often allow an actor to graduate to the next step. Yet instead of moving from Horatio to Hamlet, most BAME classical actors have found themselves shut out of playing leading roles. Apart from Hamlet, Essiedu’s career to date has been a catalogue of parts that form this unofficial ‘black canon’: Romeo (the one tragedic lead that, along with Othello, actors of colour do perform with regularity), the Duke of Burgundy, Demetrius and – after Hamlet – Edmund.\nRecognising patterns in casting classical theatre is the key to progress – it is no longer enough that performers of colour are included in performances of Shakespeare’s plays; they must be nurtured up the casting tree. A logical step would be to cast a black or Asian classical actor as Coriolanus, Richard II or Titus Andronicus: no ethnic minority performer has yet played these three tragic heroes in the Shakespearean canon.\nWe need your help…\nWhen you subscribe to The Stage, you’re investing in our journalism.

GPS locking and stabilization mode are fantastic features, but should any equipment fail to send or receive commands, a responsible operator knows how to take over manual flight of their aircraft. There’s no substitute for building your own level of content knowledge, experience, and practice time “on the sticks.”\nKey Flight Safety Rules\nSafe and responsible flight should always be your No. 1 concern when preparing to take to the air. Become familiar with the following items, and you will be well on your way to sharing the skies with those around you:\n- Always fly below 400 feet. Full-scale aircraft fly above 500 feet. This creates a 100-foot buffer zone in the airspace between manned and unmanned aircraft.\n- Fly your aircraft within line of sight (LOS). This means you are constantly able to see your aircraft while operating it. From our experience, looking at your aircraft in the same direction as the sun can make visibility difficult. Think about the time of day and desired direction where you will be stationed. Colored landing gear or LED lights help identify the front and back of the multirotor, which assists in maintaining your orientation. See the note below this section on safely flying using FPV goggles.\n- Join a local club for UAV or model aircraft enthusiasts. If that is not possible in your area, create your own MeetUp group to discuss safe and responsible developments on best practices of UAV flight.\n- Never fly within five miles of any airport, within three miles of large stadiums between an hour before and after events, and not at all in national parks or military bases. Check out this interactive map that identifies the no-fly zones.\n- Take a flight lesson. This will help to reinforce the principles of flight, and it will let you experience navigating the airspace from a full-scale pilot’s point of view. You may also be able to find a local course on operating small unmanned aircraft.\n- Always inspect your equipment to make sure every component is in proper working order prior to every flight.\n- Do it for fun! Don’t fly for commercial purposes without authorization from the FAA. You should have years of experience before this should be a concern, anyway. Insurance on your aircraft is not required for recreational use, but having it is a great idea. If you join the AMA flying club, limited insurance coverage is included in the membership. Insurance is a requirement for commercial use.\n- Never fly recklessly. Not only is it dangerous, and disrespectful to the people and property in the area, but you may be issued a citation and a hefty fine. Fly safely.\nMany multirotor enthusiasts love to fly first-person view (FPV) using video goggles that give the pilot the sense of sitting in the cockpit. A small camera mounted to the front of the UAV allows for a real-time view from the perspective of the drone. FPV flight is growing fast in popularity thanks to organized, competitive minidrone racing. Here are some tips:\n- Bring a friend with you to act as a spotter. You need someone to be your second set of eyes to keep the copter within line of sight and alert you to anything that may interfere with your flight path.\n- Clearly communicate what video channel/frequency you are using with any other FPV flyers nearby to avoid interference in your reception and visibility.\n- Go to a wide-open, secluded location away from people, property, roads, and power lines.\n- Avoid bringing children or pets out to the FPV flying field area because they may unknowingly enter your flight path.\n- Follow all of the other safety guidelines outlined in the previous section.\nWhere and When to Fly\nPlanning is a critical step in safe, successful flight. There is a saying: Fail to Plan, Plan to Fail. There are many things to consider before your maiden flight and every takeoff thereafter. We use a preflight checklist to be certain that we have gone over all functions necessary for our planned mission. You can use your favorite productivity app to generate your own preflight checklist. Many are available in the online app stores. The to-do list app we have enjoyed using is Wunderlist. It syncs easily across multiple platforms. It’s also free, which is nice. See the next section for specific points of information you may want to include in your preflight checklist.\nWe also like to use the 3D feature in Apple Maps to plan our missions. You can view a perspective very close to what you are trying to achieve while in flight. Time of day and lighting features may also be important to you, if for no other reason than to ensure you’re not looking directly into the sun while visually tracking your UAV.\nThe best way to identify potential risks is in person. We like to visit a location in advance to see if there is enough space, and if the location presents any possible hazards. Develop a plan to best mitigate risks to such a degree that is tolerable to all involved with the flight area. You likely need to get a permit or at least permission to fly in an area, even if it appears to be an empty field. If you own your own very large yard, you have the ideal setup for stress-free, regular practice space, as long as it is five or more nautical miles from any major airport. Finally, U.S. national parks are (at the time of this writing) considered no-fly zones. We hope this changes at some point in the future. At the very least, we would hope to see procedures put in place for aerial photographers to obtain a permit to access national parks under the rules of the National Park Service.\nPreflight Checklist and Flight Log Information\nJust as in full-size aircraft, preflight checklists and flight logs are essential to maintaining a safe aircraft and flying environment. Be certain to note:\n- Date and time.\n- Location and safe takeoff/landing area established.\n- Operator and any flight team members such as spotters or camera operators.\n- All wiring and hardware connections are secure.\n- Aircraft, radio and channel, flight modes/settings.\n- Propellers and batteries used. We like to label and track each battery’s usage.\n- GPS: Number of satellites locked in.\n- Weather, sun direction, wind direction, and speed. Maximum safe wind speeds depend on the weight and design of your aircraft. For example, the Little Dipper is very light at two pounds, so it is best to fly it below 10 miles per hour. Heavier multirotors can handle stronger wind. Also, avoid precipitation. Water and electronics do not mix well.\n- Purpose/subject, mission, and contact person.\n- Potential dangers and plan for handling each.\n- Elevation/speed reached.\n- Payload secure — best to start off payload-free.\n- Camera settings and memory card with available space.\n- Flight length and observations — did anything irregular occur regarding the equipment or experience?\nTry your absolute best to fly away from anyone, but avoiding every person can sometimes be difficult. If any spectators are present during a flight, establish a safe takeoff and landing zone. We keep a minimum of 30 feet between our UAV and any person or thing. We like to use safety cones to mark our safe zone perimeter. You could also use an extra large tarp with cones weighing down the corners. A tarp can keep dirt out of your UAV’s sensitive electronics too. Creating a physical line of safety using rope, poles, paint, or field-lining powder is a great way to keep spectators at bay.\nIf you have a spotter with you, have her talk to anyone nearby to let them know what you are doing, to direct spectators to stay away from the flight zone, and to always be aware of where the UAV is. Remember, flying near large stadiums with crowds in the stands is prohibited by the FAA an hour before and an hour after an event is scheduled (as well as during the event itself, of course).\nActively look out for any cables in the flight area. Power lines in the air, and even loose cables on the ground, can be very dangerous while flying. Outstretched tree branches, light poles, and architectural features can also pose a threat. Keeping your distance and avoiding them entirely is the only way to completely avoid the risk associated with these types of things.\nMaking assumptions can lead to making a big mistake. Never assume that everything on your multirotor is working great simply because you saw it fly flawlessly yesterday. Always do a systems check before each flight. Testing is certainly a constant in this hobby. A more thorough inspection with regular routine maintenance, along with the accompanying documentation, is a good idea as well.\nTest the motors and settings without the propellers. Lastly, add the propellers, stand back, and do a prop-directional test. If you notice anything wrong, or had to repair/alter anything, document it on the spot.\nReview your battery procedures, including their age, how they are handled and stored, and whether they are intact or have unused charge, which can all have an effect on LiPo batteries. Take it upon yourself to know how to use, store, and dispose of them responsibly. Locate your local drop-off center able to accept used LiPo batteries. Understand that LiPo battery usage can be dangerous and requires your disciplined attention. You should have a fire extinguisher on hand just in case.\nFlight and Maintenance Logs\nMuch of the same information from the preflight checklist can be used to generate your flight log. It is important to document each of your flights. This helps you improve your UAV build and flight performance, by recognizing patterns in data you collect. An added benefit of keeping a flight log is that if you are able to show consistent proactive effort on your part to always fly with safety as a priority, you are much better off should your motives while flying ever be questioned.\nBesides a flight log, we also recommend keeping a separate maintenance log for your UAV build(s). This may be as simple as using paper and a binder or as sophisticated as a detailed file kept digitally in whatever mobile electronic device you prefer. Record each repair or improvement you make, and when you did it. Answer the questions, “What caused the problem?” and “Why was the repair or replacement necessary?” Complete any relevant testing following the completion of the work, and record the observations. Of course, using quality components helps cut down on head-scratching as well as repair and documentation time. For example, metal versus plastic mechanisms will naturally be more durable and hold up longer.\nRecord your decision-making process throughout your drone build, especially if it is your first aerial robotics experience. Describe what factors led you to make each component selection throughout your build. Compare parts or brands you considered and what the result of each decision turned out to be. It may seem like an excessive exercise, but later on you will be glad to have even half of such information on hand.\nIt is your responsibility to build and fly UAVs safely and responsibly, but you are not alone. If you are uncertain about any part of the design, build, or flight of your craft, it is okay to ask for help. There are many resources and online forums available to small UAV developers, where you can get advice and information on the best practices for UAV safety and technology.\nThree such groups worked closely with the United States Federal Aviation Agency (FAA) to agree on policy statements and best practices for safely flying small UAVs. These groups — the Association for Unmanned Vehicles International (AUVSI), the Academy of Model Aeronautics (AMA), and the Small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Coalition (SUAVC) — compiled a concise list of the dos and don’ts of piloting small UAVs that they call “The Rules of the Air.”\nTheir suggested safety guidelines are a fine place to start, but we recommend that you actively and regularly look into the rules for yourself as they continue to evolve. We have summarized their list in the safety section above, and have elaborated on them with some additional ideas for knowledgeable, responsible small UAV flight.\nLaws and Regulations\nIn many countries, hobbyists have enjoyed model flight for nearly 100 years. Throughout the 20th century, the rules of common sense guided the model aircraft community as it typically policed itself with little to no incident.\nRecently, the capabilities of these aircraft have increased tremendously, and this has attracted the interest of lawmakers, especially in the United States. We strongly advise anyone just getting into the hobby of model aircraft to check for local and national laws regarding the technology. If you live in the United States, the FAA or AMA websites are the best places to start. You’ll need to register yourself with the FAA and display your associated registration number on everything you’d like to fly that weighs .55 pounds or more.\nImportant links for the main SUAS resource groups include:\nIn addition, check out our list of comprehensive safety procedures.\nThe AMA has a one-page PDF of best practices for flying R/C aircraft as well. This list of sites from a few of the countries that have enacted comprehensive policies for small UAVs can help you get started in finding the laws that apply to your area (the distinction between commercial and noncommercial applications is the main common factor around the world to determine which set of rules you should follow):\nCivil Aviation Authority (CAA)\nLuftfahrt-Bundesamt (LBA), or Federal Aviation Office","Paddle boarding is a fun watersport, but knowing the laws surrounding paddle boarding are important if you want to stay on the right side of the Coast Guard. The U.S. Coast Guard has designated paddle boards as full vessels, which means that they are treated just like a kayak or canoe.\nHere are some of the must-know paddle-boarding laws:\n- Paddle boards are considered vessels or boats, and as such are subject to the same boating laws of registration and safety regulations. Depending on which state you live in, you may need to have a boating license in order to use a paddle board.\n- While on a paddle board, you must have a life jacket or personal floatation device (PFD) on board with you; if you are 12 years or younger, you must be wearing it at all times.\n- You must have proper boating safety paraphernalia such as a whistle, a navigational light, and distress signals such as aerial flares.\n- You must not use a paddle board while intoxicated.\nThe reason you must know these paddle boarding laws isn’t just so you avoid fines or potential jail time—these regulations are in place for a reason and abiding by them is vital to maintaining your safety while paddle boarding. Read on for a more detailed explanation of these paddle boarding laws.\nDo You Need A License to Paddle Board?\nWhile the U.S. Coast Guard does designate paddle boards as vessels and regulates them as such, not all states require users to have a boating license.\nTo figure out whether you need an actual boating license or boater’s education card to use your paddle board legally, refer to your local DNR or license bureau for your location-specific laws.\nEven if it is not technically necessary to have a boating license to use a paddle board, it is recommended to procure one anyway. The boater’s education course teaches people using watercraft important signage and signaling procedures that make everyone safer on the water.\nThis is especially important when using a paddle board in areas where there is a high volume of motorized boat traffic, as paddle boarders are extremely vulnerable on the water against them.\nEven Without A Boating License, You May Need Registration to Paddle Board\nDepending on which state you live in, your branch of state government that regulates water safety may require you to register your paddle board as a vessel. We cover a few states and the processes required in this post. The following states require registration of paddle craft (kayaks, canoes, and paddle boards):\nWhy Paddle Boarding Laws Are Important\nEvery year, dozens of people are tragically killed in boating accidents or drownings, and many of them are people operating paddle craft.\nThis is because paddle crafts are easily the most vulnerable vessels in the water at any given time—a paddle boarder being run down by a careless motorboat driver cannot get out of the way fast enough even if they tried. In a battle between a paddle board and a speedboat, the boat will win every time.\nBecause a paddle boarder has no real protection in the event of a collision with another vessel, they can often be severely injured or knocked unconscious. This means having the appropriate safety gear on board is important not just to remain within the confines of the law, but also for your personal safety.\nYou Must Have A Life Jacket While Paddle Boarding – It’s the Law\nEven though paddle boarders are typically secured to their paddle boards with a leash and paddle boards are in and of themselves flotation devices, it is still the law that paddle boarders must carry a Coast Guard-approved life jacket with them (Type I, II, or III).\nThese are the types of life jackets and their recommended uses:\n- Type I: Best for open, rough, or remote water where rescue may be slow to arrive\n- Type II: Best for protected, inland water where the chance of immediate rescue is good\n- Type III: Best for protected, inland water near shore where the chance of immediate rescue is good\nWhich type of life jacket you decide to wear is largely dependent on where you intend to take your paddle board. If you are paddle boarding on a calm lake, you will require a lower type of life jacket than if you are intending to paddle board on the ocean.\nLife jackets are the single most important piece of safety gear to have on the water. In 2016, 701 people in the United States were killed in boating accidents. Of those killed, 80% drowned, and 83% of those who drowned were not wearing life jackets. The statistics speak for themselves.\nLife Jackets and Paddle Boarder Age\nIf the paddle boarder is 12 years of age or younger, the Coast Guard has dictated that they are always required to wear their life jacket while on the paddle board.\nAdult and teenage paddle boarders can get away with having a life jacket strapped to their paddle boat as long as they do have one in their possession, but it is strongly recommended that anyone—no matter what age—wear their life jacket while pursuing watersports like paddle boarding.\nAfter all, if you are struck by a passing motorized boat and knocked unconscious, your life jacket isn’t going to do you much good if it’s strapped to your paddle board and not to you. Since the majority of boating fatalities are the direct result of not wearing a life jacket, there’s no point in taking the risk.\nInflatable Personal Floatation Devices and Paddle Boards\nOne popular option other than a traditional life jacket for paddle boarders are inflatable personal flotation devices (PFDs) that act as a Type III life jacket. These can be worn around the waist like a fanny pack until manually deployed and are less bulky and uncomfortable to wear than life jackets.\nThe disadvantage to inflatable personal flotation devices is that they cannot activate themselves in the case of a boating accident and must be triggered via a pull string.\nThis means if you are wearing one and you are knocked unconscious in a boating accident or by falling from your paddle board, you may as well not be wearing a flotation device at all. Inflatable PFDs are a convenient choice for paddle boarders looking to maintain their agility on the water, but they are a risk.\nYou Must Have Boating Safety Gear While Paddle Boarding\nBecause paddle boards are considered by the coast guard to be vessels like a boat, they are subject to boating safety regulations. This means that other than a life jacket, there are certain pieces of safety and navigational gear you are always required by law to have with you on your paddle board:\n- Safety whistle: Safety whistles are important because paddle boarders are some of the most vulnerable people in the water to boat strikes other than swimmers. Because a paddle board is small, it is difficult to see on the water. A whistle will help you alert boaters to your presence.\n- Navigational light: Paddle boarders are required by law to have a navigational light such as a handheld waterproof flashlight with them between the hours of sunset and sunrise so that they can signal boaters after dark to avoid being struck.\n- Distress signals: Like boaters, paddle boarders are required to have distress signals of some kind on their paddle board to signal for help in case of an emergency. Even if they were not required by law, it is still prudent to have signals, as rough waters can capsize a paddle boarder quickly.\nWhen choosing your safety gear, it is important to consider the situations in which you might be called to use it. Pick the loudest waterproof survival whistle you can find, one that will be clearly heard over the roar of wind or waves or motorboats.\nFor navigational lighting, bright LED headlamps are a good choice for paddle boarders, as they leave your hands free and often come with options for flashing and other signaling.\nFor distress signals, be sure to choose signals that can be see both during the day and after dark if you ever intend to use your paddle board near or past sunset. Make sure you have a minimum of three devices, regardless of whether you choose pyrotechnic signals or some other kind.\nManual Distress Signals for Paddle Boarding\nYou can use manual distress signals in conjunction with flares, a whistle, and other safety gear. The universal sign for an emergency while paddle boarding is to wave one arm back and forth overhead or wave a paddle back and forth.\nTo signal to someone that you are okay and not in an emergency, you can hold your arm out to your side and then place your fingertips on the top of your head to make an “O” with your arm. This signal can also be used to ask another paddler if they are okay.\nDon’t Drink and Paddle Board\nIt almost goes without saying, but because paddle boards are regarded as a water vessel, this means they are regulated in the same way with regards to alcohol and recreational substances. Do not drink alcohol or do recreational drugs and go paddle boarding.\nEven if you are prescribed sedative medication or any kind of medication that impairs your balance or judgment, do not go paddle boarding. Side effects of medications often include things such as seizures and drowsiness, which can lead to dangerous situations out on the water.\nWhile you aren’t necessarily a threat to others in an intoxicated state while paddle boarding, you are putting yourself in serious danger and may suffer a lapse in judgment (such as paddle boarding in the middle of a busy boating lane) that could quickly end in tragedy for both you and an unsuspecting party.\nSafety aside, a paddle board is a vessel\nand operating a vessel under the influence is against the law. Paddle boarding\nwhile intoxicated can earn you a ticket or jail time or even get you killed.\nOptional Paddle Boarding Gear to Protect from The Elements\nPaddle boarding is sometimes performed in very cold waters, or in tropical areas that are very warm. While not a requirement by law, you might want to consider investing in some cold weather and hot weather gear on your paddle board in order to maximize comfort and avoid temperature-related illness.\nFor paddle boarding in colder climates to avoid hypothermia and general discomfort, the following optional gear is suggested:\n- Neoprene top, shorts, or a wetsuit\n- Paddle gloves\n- Cap (wool or synthetic)\nHypothermia is medically defined as the point when the human body drops below 95F and can occur even in summer weather if paddle boarding is being undertaken in cold or northern waters. Left untreated, hypothermia can lead to disorientation, extreme fatigue, and eventual drowning. Strongly consider getting a wetsuit for colder climates or seasons.\nSome of the symptoms of hypothermia are as follows:\n- Mild hypothermia: Numbness and uncontrollable shivering, loss of coordination\n- Moderate hypothermia: Loss of mental coherence, slurred speech\n- Severe hypothermia: Blue or grayish tinged skin, slow or faltering breath, loss of consciousness\nFor paddle boarding in hot climates to avoid hyperthermia, heat stroke, and dangerous sunburns, the following optional gear is suggested:\n- Hat with a bill to shade the face\n- Quick dry, loose clothing\n- Canteen of water\n- High SPF sunscreen\nHyperthermia (also known as heatstroke) is medically defined as the point when the human body rises above 101.7F and is the result of failed thermoregulation. Paddle boarders paddling in hot still weather are especially susceptible to heatstroke.\nSome of the symptoms of hyperthermia are as follows:\nAs you can imagine, many of these symptoms can be deadly for a paddle boarder, especially one who is out paddling alone and not within easy reach of help. Therefore, preventing hypothermia or heatstroke before they occur by wearing appropriate gear while paddle boarding is the safest route to take.\nOther Safety Considerations While Paddle Boarding\nThese may not necessarily be hard and fast paddle boarding laws, but nevertheless keeping the following things in mind will help keep you safe while you paddle board:\n- Always wear a leg leash to avoid losing your paddle board if you fall off. You don’t want to be stranded on the open water without it, as it makes you less visible and leaves you vulnerable to exhaustion and exposure to the elements.\n- Be aware of weather conditions and any other elemental issues that could potentially affect your paddle boarding such as riptides, rough water, lightning storms, and other hazards. If there is a chance the weather may become inclement while you’re out, it’s safer not to go.\n- It best to know the area where you are planning to paddle board, and to let someone else know where you’ll be and when you should be expected back. It is also the safest practice to not go paddle boarding alone, but extra precautions should be taken if you do go solo.\n- Be defensive on the water. Always keep an eye out for other vessels, and don’t hesitate to use a flashlight or whistle to alert boaters—around high-speed vessels, every second counts to avoid a collision. Be sure to also wear brightly coloured clothing for maximum visibility.\n- Use your core muscles for paddling to avoid exhaustion and dangerous conditions. This is accomplished by rotating your hips and shoulders rather than paddling with your arms alone. Not only is this the most effective and efficient way to paddle, but it also helps maintain your balance.\n- Avoid areas with high boat traffic. Rather than depending on boaters to see you (which they may or may not—why take the risk?) it’s better to choose paddle boarding areas with minimum motorized boat traffic, protection from rough winds, and easy areas to launch/land from.\nStay Smart While Paddle Boarding to Stay Alive\nAlthough paddle boarding fatalities have remained a minority in the number of boating fatalities reported each year in the US, the percentage of people killed while paddle boarding has remained largely stable throughout the years, while the number of deaths related to powerboats has declined.\nIt remains a sad fact that many of the deaths involved in paddle boarding involve collisions with motorised boats, so vigilance is crucial for safety in this sport.\nMost paddle boarding fatalities (and indeed, most boating fatalities in general) can be prevented through the consistent use of life jackets, and by avoiding alcohol and drugs while on the water. For this reason, the laws surrounding the use of life jackets and intoxicants in watersports are very strict.\nOther deaths could have been avoided if inexperienced paddlers without proper gear or training stayed away from cold water, whitewater, and extreme weather conditions. By following the laws and guidelines laid out in this article, you can rest assured that you will always be prepared in the water.\nBefore You Go in The Water, Check These Laws One More Time\nIf you’re new to paddle boarding, you’re probably raring to go. But before you hit the waves, be sure to keep these must-know laws in mind to stay safe and out of trouble:\n- Check your local area for regulations regarding registration of paddle boards and whether you need a boating license to operate one.\n- Have the proper (and required) gear for safety—whistle, distress signals, navigational light.\n- Always wear a life jacket.\n- Never paddle board drunk or on drugs. A paddle board is considered a vessel and you can get a DUI charge.\nAlways check for variations in local laws before you visit an area new to you. Many places have different regulations for different seasons, days of the week and specific bodies of water. It’s best to know before you go.\nOnce you know, get out there and go by staying safe and having fun!\nArticles contain affiliate links to Amazon.

{"question":"How do the formation conditions of R 136a1 in the Tarantula Nebula compare to typical stellar nebulas where most stars are born?","answer":"While typical stars form in stellar nebulas from collapsing clouds of interstellar gas and dust under their own gravity, R 136a1's formation in the Tarantula Nebula appears to be more exceptional. R 136a1 formed in a cluster of young, massive stars called R136, and its extreme mass (320 solar masses at birth) was previously thought impossible. Scientists suggest it either formed independently in the relatively dense gas and dust of the R136 cluster, or through the merger of multiple smaller stars early in its life. In contrast, typical stellar nebulas form stars up to about 1.5 times the mass of the Sun through the standard process of gravitational collapse and nuclear fusion.","context":["Presentation on theme: \"A star is born… A star is made up of a large amount of gas, in a relatively small volume.

Eventually, the outer parts grow bigger still and drift out into space.\n7 Main Sequence Stars... The blue, white, hot core is left behind causing a white dwarf.When there is no more energy, it becomes a black dwarf. It is the remaining burnt-out cinder left, as the star goes out.\n8 Supernova…A dying supergiant star, can suddenly explode. Within hours, the star blazes millions of times brighter.The explosion is called a supernova.\n9 Neutron Stars… After a star explodes, some material from the star is left behind. Thismaterial may become part of aplanetary nebula.The core will compressand form a neutron star.Neutron stars are evensmaller and more densethan white dwarfs.\n10 Pulsar StarsA pulsar is a neutron star that emits beams of radiation that can be seen from earth.\n11 Black Holes…The most massive stars may have more than 40 times the mass of the Sun. One might have more than 5 times the mass of the Sun left, after it becomes a supernova.The gravity of this mass is so strong that the gas is pulled inward, packing it into a smaller and smaller space. These massive stars become black holes when they die.\n12 Quasars… A quasar is a distant galaxy with a black hole at its center. As enormous amounts of gas revolve around a black hole, the gas heats up and shines brightly.\n19 Generally speaking, there are two main life cycles for stars. The factor which determines the life cycle of the star is its mass.Any star less than about three solar masses will spend almost all of its existence in what is called the “Main Sequence”.One solar mass is the mass of our Sun. About 90% of all stars are like this.If a star is more than three solar masses when it is “born” or formed, it will spend much less time on the Main Sequence, have a much shorter life span, and “die” or end violently.Once a star is born, it is set in a specific life cycle, and the outcome will not vary.Main Sequence Stars\n20 Stellar Nebula (a star nursery) Within the vacuum of space are thinly spread gases, mostly hydrogen and dust, that are a result of past exploded stars.The dust is mostly microscopic grains of carbon and silicon. In some places, this material is collected into a big cloud of dust and gas, known as a nebula.Stars form from collapsing clouds of gas and dust. All stars begin in a nebula.The dust and gas that makes a nebula comes from past exploded stars. This material is called interstellar medium.Stars begin to form in high density areas of the nebula. Huge amounts of gas and dust condense and contract under its own gravity.Stellar Nebula (a star nursery)\n21 Temperature rises, and nuclear fusion begins Temperature rises, and nuclear fusion begins. This is the “birth” of the star. Nuclear fusion is the atomic reaction that fuels stars. Fusion in stars is mostly converting hydrogen into helium.Stars that are up to 1.5 times the mass of the Sun are called “Main Sequence” stars and will burn for a long time.Some gas and dust is pulled by gravity to the core. As the region of condensing matter heats up, it begins to glow. This is called a protostar.If there is enough matter in the core, and the temperature reaches 15 million °C, fusion begins. Think of stars as giant nuclear reactors. Nuclear fusion is the atomic reaction that fuels stars.In fusion, atom nuclei combine together to make a larger nuclei which forms a different element.The change of elements by fusion releases large amounts of energy. This energy makes the stars hot and bright.Fusion in stars is mostly converting hydrogen into helium. Stars smaller than our Sun can convert only hydrogen into helium during fusion. Medium-sized stars, like our Sun, can convert helium into oxygen and carbon, when all the hydrogen is used up.If a protostar does not reach a temperature hot enough to begin fusion, it will stay cool and dim. It is called a brown dwarf. Brown dwarfs are objects which are too large to be called planets and too small to be stars. They were first discovered in It is now thought that there might be as many brown dwarfs as there are stars.\n23 A red giant is a large star that is reddish or orange in color. It represents the phase in a star's life, when its supply of hydrogen has been exhausted and helium is being fused into carbon. This causes the star to collapse, raising the temperature in the core. The outer surface of the star expands and cools, giving it a reddish color.Red giants are very large, reaching sizes of over 100 times the star's original size.A star may remain in the main sequence until all the hydrogen has been fused to form helium. This can take 10 billion years.The core begins to contract and heat up. This extra heat allows helium to fuse into carbon. The outer layers of the star expand and cool. Since it is cooler, it will shine less brightly.The expanded star is now called a red giant. Remember, that something that is “white hot” is much hotter than something that is “red hot”. A red giant can exist for about 100 million years. After this time, the red giant is mostly carbon.The Sun is predicted to become a red giant in approximately 5–7.5 billion years. When our Sun expands to a red giant, its radius will be about 200 times larger than it is now. This means that it will expand through the orbits of Mercury and Venus. Earth will not be able to support life when it is located that close to the Sun.Red Giant\n24 Planetary nebulae form when a main sequence star grows into a red giant and throws off its outer layers and the core collapses.The term \"planetary\" comes from the 19th century, when astronomers saw what looked like a new planet in their primitive telescopes.This was a time before people knew that there were different types of galaxies. The name has stuck ever since.The next fusion process would be to fuse the carbon into iron. The problem in this star is that there is not enough pressure in the core to do this.Because the outward pressure of energy is no longer maintained, the core collapses and sends a shockwave outwards. This causes the star's outer layers to be cast off and form a planetary nebula.These nebulas get their mostly circular shape because the material is thrown off the star in a roughly symmetrical pattern.Planetary Nebula\n25 The collapsed core left when a red giant loses its outer layers is called a white dwarf. It is made of pure carbon that glows white hot with leftover heat from the spent fuel. It will drift in space while it slowly cools.It is the size of Earth, but very dense. A teaspoon of the material would weigh as much as an elephant.The remaining core, 80% of the original star, is now in its final life stages. The core is called a White Dwarf. The core has much less mass because it has lost its outer layers.Any planets that the star would have had revolving around it, would have done one of the following:moved to much farther orbitsbeen completely ejected from the systembeen engulfed by the star in the expanded red giant phaseThe star eventually cools and dims.White Dwarf\n26 A black dwarf is a white dwarf star that has cooled completely and does not glow. It will drift in space as a frozen lump of carbon. The star is considered “dead”.Black DwarfWhen the star stops shining, as a result of using up all of its fuel, it is considered a dead star.\n28 Stellar Nebula (a star nursery) All stars form from collapsing clouds of gas and dust found in a nebula.Stellar Nebula (a star nursery)All stars begin the same way. They form in a Stellar Nebula from interstellar dust and gas,\n29 Massive stars are stars that are between 1 Massive stars are stars that are between 1.5 to 3 times the mass of the Sun.A star with a much greater mass will form, live, and die more quickly than a main sequence star.Massive stars follow a similar life cycle as small and medium stars do, until they reach their main sequence stage.This occurs because the gravity squeezes the star's core and creates greater pressures, resulting in a faster fusion rate.The stars shine steadily until the hydrogen has fused to form helium. This takes billions of years in a small/medium star, but only millions of years in a massive star.Massive stars use their fuel much faster than smaller stars do.Massive Stars\n30 A red supergiant glows red because its outer layers have expanded, producing the same amount of energy over a larger space. The star becomes cooler.Red stars are cooler than blue or white stars. A supergiant has the pressure needed to fuse carbon into iron.This fusion process takes energy, rather than giving it off. As energy is lost, the star no longer has an outward pressure equal to gravity pushing in. Gravity wins, and the core collapses in a violent explosion.When massive stars deplete their hydrogen, the remaining helium atoms are converted into carbon and oxygen. In the next million years, a series of nuclear reactions occur, forming different elements in shells around the core. Carbon and oxygen change into neon, sodium, magnesium, sulfur, and silicon. Later, reactions transform these elements into calcium, iron, nickel, chromium, copper, and others. The core eventually becomes iron.Red Supergiant\n31 A supernova is an explosion of a massive star at the end of its life; the star may briefly equal an entire galaxy in brightness.At this point, the mass of the star will determine which way it continues in the life cycle.The core collapses in less than a second, causing an explosion called a Supernova, in which a shock wave blows off the outer layers of the star.When these old, large stars with depleted cores explode in a supernova, they create heavy elements. Heavy elements are considered all of the natural elements heavier than iron. These elements are spewed into space by the explosion.Supernovas can be exceptionally bright. A supernova explosion on July 4, 1054 was so bright that it could be seen in broad daylight for 23 days.Supernova\n32 Neutron Star or Black Hole? If the star is at least 1.5 but less than 9 times larger than the Sun, the core left after the supernova will collapse into a neutron star. This is a star composed only of neutrons.Black HoleIf the star is at least 9 or more times larger than the Sun, the core will continue to collapse into a black hole, an extremely dense area with a strong gravitational pull that light can not escape.Neutron Star: At the time of supernova, the central region of the star collapses under gravity. It collapses so much that protons and electrons combine to form neutrons.A neutron star is about 20 km in diameter and has the mass of about 1.4 times that of the Sun. A neutron star is so dense that one teaspoonful would weigh a billion tons. Because of its small size and high density, a neutron star possesses a surface gravity about 2 x 1011 times that of Earth and a magnetic field a million times stronger. Neutron stars can spin 100 times in a second.Pulsars are spinning neutron stars that have jets of particles moving almost at the speed of light, streaming out above their magnetic poles. These jets produce very powerful beams of light. They were discovered in 1967.Black Holes:If the surviving core is greater than 3 solar masses, it contracts to become a black hole.If a black hole passes through a cloud of interstellar matter, or is close to another “normal” star, the black hole can pull matter onto itself.As the matter is pulled towards the black hole, it gains kinetic energy, heats up, and is squeezed by forces. As it gets hotter, this matter gives off radiation that can be measured. This allows astronomers to find black holes.Neutron Star or Black Hole?","Often, writing about astronomy tends to mirror the job of those writing for the Guinness Book of World Records – just when you think a record is practically unbeatable, somebody else appears to show up the previous record-holder. This is surely the case with the stellar heavyweight (er, “heavymass”) R 136a1, which has been shown by data taken using the European Southern Observatory’s Very Large Telescope and the Hubble Space Telescope to tip the stellar scales at 265 times the mass of our Sun. What’s even more impressive is that R 136a1 has lost mass over the course of its lifetime, and likely was about 320 solar masses at birth. That deserves a “Yikes!”\nR 136a1 lies in a cluster of young, massive stars with hot surface temperatures that is located inside the Tarantula Nebula. The Tarantula Nebula is nested inside the Large Magellanic Cloud, one of the Milky Way’s closest galactic neighbors, 165,000 light-years away. The cluster is called RMC 136a (or more commonly referred to as R136), and in addition to the whopper that is R 136a1, there are three other stars with masses at birth in the 150 solar mass range.\nExtremely massive stars like R 136a1 were previously thought to be unable to form, posing a challenge to stellar physicists as to just how this behemoth came about. It’s possible that it formed by itself in the relatively dense gas and dust of the R136 cluster, or that multiple smaller stars merged to create the larger star at some point early on in its lifetime.\nIf breaking the mass record weren’t enough, R136a1 also happens to be the most luminous star ever discovered, with an output of energy that is over 10 million times that of the Sun. If you want to learn more about how astronomers determine the mass and luminosity of stars, here is an excellent and thorough introduction to the subject.\nTo validate the models used in determining the mass and luminosity of the stars in R136, the team of astronomers led by Paul Crowther, Professor of Astrophysics at the University of Sheffield, used the VLT to examine NGC 3603, a closer stellar nursery. NGC 3603 is only 22,000 light years away, and two of the stars in that cluster are in a binary system, which allowed the team to measure their masses.\nWe are lucky to have observed this extremely massive star, as the rule for the most massive stars is, “Live fast, die young.” The more massive a star is, the faster it churns through the fuel that powers its increased luminosity. Our Sun, which has a medium amount of mass in relation to the two extremes, will last for around for about 10 billion years. Smaller, red dwarf stars can last trillions of years, while large stars on the scale of R 136a1 only glimmer in all of their brilliance for millions of years.\nWhat will happen to R 136a1 at the end of its life? Stars with a mass of over 150 Suns ultimately explode in a light show of staggering proportions generated by what’s called a pair-instability supernova.

{"question":"Why is Tisha B'Av observed, and how are traditional mourning practices reflected in synagogue customs?","answer":"Tisha B'Av is observed to commemorate multiple Jewish tragedies, primarily the destruction of both Temples - the First Temple by Babylonians in 586 BCE and the Second Temple by Romans in 70 CE. On this day, which is considered the saddest in the Jewish calendar, several mourning practices are observed in synagogues: the decorative curtain (parochet) is removed from the ark, tallit and tefillin are not worn during morning prayers (though they are worn at Minchah), and some communities use a simple wooden pointer instead of a decorative yad for Torah reading. Additionally, worshippers remove their leather shoes when reading Eichah (Book of Lamentations).","context":["PARASHAT DEVARIM - SHABBAT HAZON\nAugust 6, 2011- 6 Av 5771\nAnnual: Deuteronomy 1:1 - 3:22 (Etz Hayim, p. 981; Hertz p. 736)\nTriennial: Deuteronomy 1:1 – 2:1 (Etz Hayim, p. 981; Hertz p. 736)\nHaftarah: Isaiah 1:1 – 27 (Etz Hayim, p. 1000; Hertz p. 750)\nPrepared by Rabbi Joseph Prouser\nBaldwin, New York\nBoth its Greek name – Deuteronomy – and its classical Hebrew designation – Mishneh Torah\n(a repetition of the Torah) – aptly describe both the fifth book of the Pentateuch and this, its\nopening parashah.

The two dissenting optimists among the spies – Joshua and Caleb – are duly\nrewarded. They, alone of their generation, are to be permitted entry to the Land, where Caleb\nwill receive an allotment and Joshua will assume national leadership. Moses, too, is denied\nentry to Canaan. This divine decree requires the Israelites to follow a tortuous, circuitous route\nthrough the wilderness, involving confrontations with Edom, Ammon, and Moab.\nThe crushing Amorite defeat of the Israelites at Hormah is recalled. Other encounters with\nhostile, foreign powers include those with Sichon and Og. Sichon refuses Israel permission to\ntraverse his territory, despite Israel’s friendly, diplomatic request.

On\nShabbat Chazon 5771, we also recall that it was on August 6, 1945, that the atomic bomb\ndestroyed Hiroshima. 2011’s widespread destruction in Japan, in the wake of an earthquake,\ntsunami, and damaged nuclear reactors – with the resultant release of radiation – makes this\nhistoric anniversary particularly painful and evocative.\nOn Tisha B’Av, both worshipers and the Torah itself – as it were – dress in mourning. It is\ncustomary to remove our shoes when Eichah (the Book of Lamentations) is read, and, indeed,\nto refrain from wearing leather shoes (as on Yom Kippur) throughout the day. At Shacharit,\nfollowing the custom of the 13th-century Rabbi Meir of Rothenburg, we wear neither tallit nor\ntefillin – this is the only weekday of the year on which this occurs – they both are considered\n“adornments” inappropriate to the day’s solemn spirit. Both, however, are worn at Minchah.\nBeginning with Arvit on the eve of Tisha B’Av, the decorative curtain (parochet) – also an\nadornment – is removed from the ark in the synagogue. Some similarly have the custom of not\nusing a silver or decorative yad (pointer) for the Torah reading on Tishah B’Av, substituting (if\nanything) a simple wooden pointer or reed.

It is a day of mourning and misery, a day to grieve what was lost and the suffering that was caused and contemplate what must be learned from the mistakes of the past. On this day, religious Jews fast and observe other prohibitions to emphasize the sadness of the day. When Tisha B’Av falls on Shabbat the fast is observed beginning from the end of Shabbat.\nAccording to Jewish tradition, five calamities occurred on Tisha B’Av that warrant fasting:\n- The lack of faith of the Jews who upon return of the 12 Spies from scouting out the Land of Canaan, chose to believe the 10 spies who reported that the land promised by G-d would be impossible to settle.\n- The destruction of the First Temple (586 B.C.E.)\n- The destruction of the Second Temple (70 C.E.)\n- The Roman crushing of the Bar Kochba revolt and subsequent destruction of the city of Betar where over over 500,000 Jews were killed.\n- The plowing under of of the site of the Temple and the surrounding area following the Bar Kokhba revolt (135 CE)\nOver time, Tisha B’Av has been expanded to encompass mourning for all the tragedies of Jewish history including the Spanish inquisition, repeated expulsion of Jews from European countries, the Holocaust and more.\nWhile Shabbat is a joyous time, set aside for rest and separation from the difficulties of life, it is also an opportunity to increase our spiritual awareness through contemplation of the challenges and tragedies of Jewish history and where we are now in relation to them.\nAs you settle around the Shabbat table this week, we invite you to reflect on the importance of the holy day of Tisha B’Av.\n- The ancient Jewish Temple in the heart of Jerusalem was destroyed almost 2000 years ago. What relevance do you think Tisha B’Av has to Jews today?\n- Why is Tisha B’Av a fast day? What other fast days are there in Judaism? What is the difference between fasting on Tisha B’Av and fasting on Yom Kippur?\n- Do you think expanding Tisha B’Av to encompass other tragedies in Jewish history was a good idea? If so, why? If not, why not? What do you is the benefit of reflecting on past Jewish tragedies?\n- Tisha B’Av also commemorates the report of the spies on the land of Israel in which Moses sent 12 spies to survey the land and 10 of them advised not to settle the land given to them by G-d. Do you believe that part of the tragedies that Jews experience is born out of a lack of faith?\n- Our sages teach us that the Temple was destroyed due to “sinat chinam,” baseless hatred. In other words, the Temple was not destroyed because our ancestors were attacked by external enemies but rather the attack of our enemies was successful because of baseless hatred from within, the hate of brother against brother, Jew against Jew. What do you think of the concept of baseless hatred vs hatred that has a base? What does the explanation of our sages tell us about the importance of Jewish unity?\n- Can you find the concept of “sinat chinam” in modern interactions between Jews? Is it the hatred of our enemies or hatred from within that is our biggest obstacle today?

{"question":"How do aggregate extraction and fracking compare in terms of their impact on local wildlife and biodiversity?","answer":"Both activities severely impact wildlife and biodiversity, but in different ways. Aggregate extraction requires removing all natural vegetation, top soil and subsoil, leading to immediate loss of animal wildlife and biodiversity through destruction of plants and aquatic habitats. Similarly, fracking impacts biodiversity through forest fragmentation, affecting species like the Northern Flying Squirrel and potentially reducing populations of birds like the Scarlet Tanager by 23%. In Pennsylvania's Marcellus drilling regions, 40% of the 329 species are globally rare and critically endangered. Both activities create noise pollution, with fracking operations lasting 800-2,500 days, and both disturb natural habitats through constant equipment operation and transportation.","context":["3. The Environmental Impacts of Aggregate Extraction\nWith the exception of those who work in the building trades, the closest most of us ever come to “virgin” aggregate (that is, aggregate that comes straight from an aggregate mine and has not been reclaimed from rubble or other debris) is at home building stores. While a bag of stones or gravel may look fairly benign, the process of getting it to us is anything but benign. Aggregate is mined from the earth, either dug out of pits or blasted out of quarries. This process has many significant environmental impacts.\nCreating the pits or quarries requires the removal of virtually all natural vegetation, top soil and subsoil to reach the aggregate underneath. Not only does this lead to a loss of existing animal wildlife, it also leads to a huge loss of biodiversity as plants and aquatic habitats are destroyed. Moreover, adjacent eco-systems are affected by noise, dust, pollution and contaminated water.\nPits and quarries disrupt the existing movement of surface water and groundwater; they interrupt natural water recharge and can lead to reduced quantity and quality of drinking water for residents and wildlife near or downstream from a quarry site.\nMost old pits and quarries are not being properly rehabilitated. As noted in one study “less than half of the land disturbed for aggregate production between 1992 and 2001 has actually been rehabilitated.” The province classifies pits and quarries as “interim uses of the land” and requires 100% rehabilitation of pits and quarries. Clearly this requirement is not being met. Destroyed ecosystems and source water aquifers are irreplaceable. This is not an interim land use. The landscape is blotted with destructive pits and quarries, and species of all kinds endure permanent negative impacts.\nA more detailed picture of the environmental impact of aggregate mining is outlined in a 2005 legal challenge to the expansion of an existing quarry in the Niagara Escarpment. The report focuses on the following potential environmental impacts:\n- Potential impairment of water quality on the site, including harm to the aquifer\n- The water quality of residential wells close by could be harmed\n- The water level of on-site lakes could be reduced, detrimentally affecting provincially specific wetlands\n- Heightened summer water temperature in an on-site lake could have a detrimental impact on the\nviability of cold water fish in an adjacent stream\nPotential harm to on-site and off-site wetlands\n- Loss of habitat for the Jefferson Salamander, which is designated as threatened under the federal Species at Risk Act\n- Potential loss and fragmentation of continuous natural environment\nOf course, each pit or quarry has unique characteristics and impacts, but every pit or quarry will degrade the natural environment. For pits or quarries situated on lands designated as ecologically significant, this degradation has an even greater adverse impact.\nFor communities, the displacement of water resources is one of the biggest concerns pits and quarries pose. However, there are many other concerns. Beyond the physical changes to the landscape, the daily barrage of noise, dust and exhaust produced by hundreds of dump trucks hauling aggregate can have serious effects on the health of people living nearby.\nWinfield, M and A.

From air pollution to land degradation, these impacts must be looked at and considered to better understand what fracking is. Environmental impacts are important to the fracking situation at hand because when any unnatural extraction of a natural material occurs, it will inherently impact the environment. When the process is as intense as hydraulic fracturing, the potential of a serious threat increases, and the integrity of the environment must be looked after and protected.\nAdditionally, the environmental impacts of fracking are important to the controversy of fracking because if industries wish to explore the benefits of fracking and use this process for several decades, all negative aspects must be considered as well. The environmental impacts fracking could have would potentially be catastrophic, and understanding of these must exist to make informed decisions. While many argue that the extraction of natural gas will give the United States energy independence and economic benefits, the uncertainty of these impacts and potential loss of environmental services are far too important to ignore.\nThe controversy of fracking, including the environmental issues associated with it, is part of a larger energy issue that affects all communities and people. Understanding how fracking will impact the environment, and therefore all aspects of life in these natural areas, will allow people to form opinions on fracking. These opinions can be part of a greater decision on which direction our energy use and industries should head – in a sustainable or unsustainable direction.\nThere are a great many environmental concerns raised by the process of hydraulic fracturing including the creation or air, noise, and visual pollution, the potential for chemical spills, radioactivity associated with fracking processes, impacts on and disturbance of natural lands, and impacts on biodiversity. Studies of these impacts are relatively limited, due to the newness of this type of intense hydraulic fracturing, and there is some level of uncertainty in these issues. The impacts that have been investigated, however, do show a strong correlation with the presence of fracking in the area.\nAir pollution created by fracking activities is the greatest threat to the environment. Air pollution leads to decreased air quality for all life in the area and can even contribute to climate change. The most threatening component of air pollution that fracking creates is methane, a major component of greenhouse gas pollution (Marcellus Shale Advisory Commission, 2011). Methane is released into the atmosphere as a fugitive emission, or an emission of a gas from pressurized equipment due to leaks or irregular releases of gases. This can occur through leaks in processing equipment and pneumatic devices. A pneumatic device is one that is operated by air or by the pressure or exhaustion of air.\nMethane presents a serious problem to the environment because as methane is vented into the atmosphere, global warming is amplified, which contributes to an already concerning problem. While some may argue that burning natural gas for energy is a cleaner solution to burning other materials, the amount of methane gas leaking during production negates the cleaner-burning advantages and can be 20% more harmful to the environment than coal (Lovejoy, 2012). In a 100-year period, methane is 21 times more harmful to the atmosphere than carbon dioxide. Recent studies have shown a strong correlation between natural gas industry- produced methane and atmospheric methane levels; as shale gas production has increased tenfold since 2005, the atmospheric methane levels have also been rising since 2006 (Lavelle, 2012).\nTo address this problem, the Environmental Protection Agency has established a new regulation that states all gas companies must begin capturing air emissions, including methane, by 2015 (Eilperin and Mufson, 2012). In the meantime, companies will be required to flare their emissions. While the EPA believes this is a wasteful action, as methane could have other useful applications, it will eliminate 90% of volatile organic compounds and break down the methane into water and carbon dioxide.\nOther air pollutants created by fracking that are of concern include nitrogen oxides; volatile organic compounds (VOCs); benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene, and xylenes (BTEX); carbon monoxide; sulfur dioxide; particulate matter (PM); ground level ozone, created by the combination of VOCs and nitrous oxides; and hydrogen sulfide (League of Women Voters, 2009). Many of these compounds are created during transportation and production of shale gas, but can occur during any phase of production, and can be highly toxic and harmful. Overall, air emissions contribute to 2.4% of the overall environmental impact of fracking (Elcock, 2007).\nNoise pollution, while not the greatest pollution threat, does create problems in the environment. The noise created by the all phases, from construction to deconstruction, can last between 800 and 2,500 days (Broomfield, 2012). This can disturb the natural habitats of many animals by deterring them from being in these areas. Many animals may use these sites as their everyday habitats, areas to migrate through, and even areas to find mates in.\nVisual impacts poses many of the same threats and are especially damaging during the four-week construction period (Broomfield, 2012). The visual impact can be in the form of light pollution or the visible presence of fracking machinery. Light pollution occurs in these areas because fracking activities persist though all hours of the night. Since there is no relief from the strong lights at the well pads, animals that are nocturnal are faced with disruptions in their daily life activities. Even animals that are not nocturnal can have disturbed sleeping patterns from these intense lights. Additionally, the presence of these large machines can affect migratory patterns and scare away organisms from their niche. A niche is the area that a specific organism does especially well in and is specialized to live in.\nAll of these impacts were documented in a study on the environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing in Europe (Broomfield, 2012). Air pollution presented high cumulative risks during four of the six different stages of fracking and overall was presented as a high risk (Table 1). Noise and visual impacts varied across different stages of fracking, and cumulatively noise impacts were a high risk and visual impacts were a moderate risk (Table 1).\nChemical spills are of great concern to the public and the environment due to the great, unknown risks associated with these events. When chemical spills occur, the chemicals can leach into the soils and persist there for an extended period of time. This can lead to the death of plants and even agricultural crops in the area. Once the chemicals are incorporated into the topsoil, it is extremely difficult to remove them. In Bradford County, Pa., on July 4, 2012, 4,700 gallons of hydrochloric acid spilled at a well pad operated by Chief Oil and Gas. (Detrow, 2012). The Department of Environmental Protection conducted an investigation and blamed valve failure for the accident. While 4,000 gallons were successfully captured in a containment pond, 700 gallons still moved past the well pad site and made their way into the soil as well as a nearby creek. In this creek, a small fish kill occurred shortly after the contaminants reached the waterway, making it obvious the potential harm these chemicals could cause in the environment if released.\nWhile radioactive materials occur naturally within soils in the ground, the type and amount of radiation that fracking of the Marcellus shale is contributing is of great concern. Fracking brings to the surface radioactive materials that could contaminate nearby lands for thousands of years (Grassroots Environmental Education, 2012). Radium-226, a radioactive material, is the main radioactive element found in the Marcellus shale, and it has a half-life of 1,600 years. This means that in 1,600 years, only half of the material that exists will have decayed and no longer be harmful. When these materials enter the soil, they can cause the death of plants in the area as well as agricultural lands and crops.\nThe disturbance of natural lands is another environmental impact highly correlated to fracking activities. This disturbance can come in the form of forest fragmentation, the creation of roads and increase in traffic, and even edge effect.\nForest fragmentation occurs when forested areas are split by the presence of machines and vehicles, changing contiguous forests into smaller, more isolated areas. Fracking often creates forest fragmentation, which can lead to the loss of soil integrity, the death of native species of plants and animals, the creation of the edge effect, and disturbance to all organisms in the area. Some estimates have said that Pennsylvania could lose between 38,000 and 90,000 acres of forest cover by 2030 from fracking (Marcellus Shale Advisory Commission, 2011), which would severely fragment the forests of these areas. On average, companies clear between three and four acres of land per well pad.\nThere are both direct and indirect impacts that affect the land around a well pad. Direct impacts include the direct clearing of land for the pad site, as well as land cleared for infrastructures such as the roads (Johnson, 2011). This can account for approximately 8.8 acres of land lost (Table 2). Indirect impacts include land lost adjacent to the site, which can extend about 300 feet, and this is due to forest fragmentation, the creation of new forest edges, and changes in habitat conditions. These total to about 21.2 acres lost, giving a total of about 30 acres of land being lost to one site (Johnson, N., 2011) (Table 2).\nState parks face a particularly unique challenge with fracking. In Pennsylvania, the state does not own rights to the minerals that underlie nearly 80% of all parks (Lavelle, 2010). The private owners can sell the rights to the minerals, which means that fracking companies can easily buy these rights and exploit the lands. Many fear what would happen in such a situation, and there is reason to have these fears. In 2008, the U.S. Forest Service conducted a study in the Fernow Experimental Forest in the Monongahela Nation Forest in West Virginia after fracking fluids from a nearby well pad were sprayed on trees, killing them (Kusnetz, 2011). This application of fracking fluids was intentional and a method of disposal called land-application. Immediately after application, there was an apparent impact, as massive foliage losses occurred and trees began to shed their barks (Figure 1). Initially, the project killed approximately 1,000 trees and caused damage to the ground cover as well. A year later, in 2009, the number of trees affected had increased, and dead foliage was still prevalent (Figure 2).\nMuch of the land disturbance is caused by the presence of trucks and traffic that normally does not exist in these areas. Since the companies cut into the forests, fragmenting the area, the roads are not always well constructed or planned. Some sites will see trucks moving between 7,000 and 11,000 times for a single ten-well pad and on average 250 truck trips are made daily to an individual site (Broomfield, 2012), all of which create significant road damage. In addition to this, these massive trucks and heavy equipment can lead to soil compaction. Soil compaction can occur as topsoil compaction, which is caused by tire pressure and can severely reduce plant productivity in the short term, and subsoil compaction, which is caused by axel loads and reduces productivity for decades (League of Women Voters, 2009). Cumulatively, the impact is decreased soil percolation and increased runoff of water, leading ultimately to less growth of vegetation and more soil erosion.\nLoss of biodiversity is a great threat to Pennsylvania, because out of the 329 species in the Marcellus drilling regions, 132 species, or 40%, are globally rare and critically endangered in Pennsylvania. These species include the green salamander and the snow trillium. In addition to these rare species, Pennsylvania may see a decrease in populations of the Northern Flying Squirrel, the Northern Goshawk, the Scarlet Tanager, and the Black-Throated Blue Warbler. Scarlet Tanager populations could decrease by 23% and the Black-Throated Blue Warbler could see decreases between 10% and 40% (Johnson, 2011).\nDecreases in these populations would be seen mainly due to the increase in edge effect. The edge effect occurs when an area is fragmented, creating more edges in an area. Some edges can increase as much as 1,500 feet, leading to a significant change in the landscape. This can push out species native to these areas and make way for new, invasive species. Many predators thrive along edges and forage for resources and other animals, creating an uninhabitable area for many species (Blankenship, 2011). Additionally, construction can create ditches, making it harder for amphibians to move around, and can create changes in canopy cover, increasing the amount of light in a forest and changing growth rates of plants (League of Women Voters, 2009).\nThe impacts of hydraulic fracturing on the environment raise concern as to whether this is a process that should be continued in the future. With the economic gains and the claims by some that natural gas is a cleaner alternative to other fuels, it is easy to support fracking activities. However, when the whole picture is considered, fracking tells a much different story, one that could destroy our air, our lands, and the life that exists there.\nAs citizens, I believe it is most important to focus on the most threatening aspect of environmental impacts: air pollution. The best way to address this problem is to first talk to local agencies and industries and find out who is polluting, who is not within regulations, and what is being done about it. If the proper actions are not being taken to control pollution by fracking industries, then actions should be taken and citizens can make recommendations for these actions. Some recommendations could include: using lower toxicity of fracking chemicals to minimize the quantities of the chemicals needed; burn the emitted gases to capture any other air pollutants that may be escaping during production; use low bleed pneumatic devices to reduce methane emissions up to 90%; and use electric motors instead of combustion engines. Citizen involvement and action is the most efficient way to begin to protect our environment and reduce the harmful effects of fracking."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"english_native_fluent"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:cdd0c8bf-8ef4-41f9-9a75-d63a0c6f855c>","<urn:uuid:fb777320-40c2-4d3c-a68a-5ef26515e33f>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What role did religious upbringing play in shaping both Borges's and Kant's early education?","answer":"Their religious upbringings were quite different. Kant received a strict Lutheran upbringing that emphasized intense religious devotion, personal humility, and literal Bible interpretation, with his education favoring religious instruction over mathematics and science. In contrast, Borges's early education was shaped primarily by his father's wide-ranging intellect and library, where he was exposed to diverse secular works like The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, H.G. Wells's novels, The Thousand and One Nights, and Don Quixote, all in English.","context":["Jorge Luis BorgesArticle Free Pass\nJorge Luis Borges, (born August 24, 1899, Buenos Aires, Argentina—died June 14, 1986, Geneva, Switzerland), Argentine poet, essayist, and short-story writer whose works have become classics of 20th-century world literature.\nBorges was reared in the then-shabby Palermo district of Buenos Aires, the setting of some of his works. His family, which had been notable in Argentine history, included British ancestry, and he learned English before Spanish. The first books that he read—from the library of his father, a man of wide-ranging intellect who taught at an English school—included The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, the novels of H.G. Wells, The Thousand and One Nights, and Don Quixote, all in English. Under the constant stimulus and example of his father, the young Borges from his earliest years recognized that he was destined for a literary career.\nIn 1914, on the eve of World War I, Borges was taken by his family to Geneva, where he learned French and German and received his B.A. from the Collège de Genève. Leaving there in 1919, the family spent a year on Majorca and a year in mainland Spain, where Borges joined the young writers of the Ultraist movement, a group that rebelled against what it considered the decadence of the established writers of the Generation of 1898.\nReturning to Buenos Aires in 1921, Borges rediscovered his native city and began to sing of its beauty in poems that imaginatively reconstructed its past and present. His first published book was a volume of poems, Fervor de Buenos Aires, poemas (1923; “Fervour of Buenos Aires, Poems”). He is also credited with establishing the Ultraist movement in South America, though he later repudiated it. This period of his career, which included the authorship of several volumes of essays and poems and the founding of three literary journals, ended with a biography, Evaristo Carriego (1930).\nDuring his next phase, Borges gradually overcame his shyness in creating pure fiction. At first he preferred to retell the lives of more or less infamous men, as in the sketches of his Historia universal de la infamia (1935; A Universal History of Infamy). To earn his living, he took a major post in 1938 at a Buenos Aires library named for one of his ancestors. He remained there for nine unhappy years.\nIn 1938, the year his father died, Borges suffered a severe head wound and subsequent blood poisoning, which left him near death, bereft of speech, and fearing for his sanity. This experience appears to have freed in him the deepest forces of creation. In the next eight years he produced his best fantastic stories, those later collected in Ficciones (“Fictions”) and the volume of English translations titled The Aleph and Other Stories, 1933–69. During this time, he and another writer, Adolfo Bioy Casares, jointly wrote detective stories under the pseudonym H. Bustos Domecq (combining ancestral names of the two writers’ families), which were published in 1942 as Seis problemas para Don Isidro Parodi (Six Problems for Don Isidro Parodi). The works of this period revealed for the first time Borges’s entire dreamworld, an ironical or paradoxical version of the real one, with its own language and systems of symbols.\nWhen the dictatorship of Juan Perón came to power in 1946, Borges was dismissed from his library position for having expressed support of the Allies in World War II. With the help of friends, he earned his way by lecturing, editing, and writing. A 1952 collection of essays, Otras inquisiciones (1937–1952) (Other Inquisitions, 1937–1952), revealed him at his analytic best. When Perón was deposed in 1955, Borges became director of the national library, an honorific position, and also professor of English and American literature at the University of Buenos Aires. By this time, Borges suffered from total blindness, a hereditary affliction that had also attacked his father and had progressively diminished his own eyesight from the 1920s onward. It had forced him to abandon the writing of long texts and to begin dictating to his mother or to secretaries or friends.\nThe works that date from this late period, such as El hacedor (1960; “The Doer,” Eng. trans. Dreamtigers) and El libro de los seres imaginarios (1967; The Book of Imaginary Beings), almost erase the distinctions between the genres of prose and poetry. His later collections of stories include El informe de Brodie (1970; Dr. Brodie’s Report), which deals with revenge, murder, and horror, and El libro de arena (1975; The Book of Sand), both of which are allegories combining the simplicity of a folk storyteller with the complex vision of a man who has explored the labyrinths of his own being to its core.\nAfter 1961, when he and Samuel Beckett shared the Formentor Prize, an international award given for unpublished manuscripts, Borges’s tales and poems were increasingly acclaimed as classics of 20th-century world literature. Prior to that time, Borges was little known, even in his native Buenos Aires, except to other writers, many of whom regarded him merely as a craftsman of ingenious techniques and tricks. By the time of his death, the nightmare world of his “fictions” had come to be compared to the world of Franz Kafka and to be praised for concentrating common language into its most enduring form. Through his work, Latin American literature emerged from the academic realm into the realm of generally educated readers.\nWhat made you want to look up \"Jorge Luis Borges\"? Please share what surprised you most...","Posted on 29 June 2020\nImmanuel Kant (1724 – 1804) was a German philosopher who sought to break the impasse between Rationalism and Empiricism.\nKant was born in East Prussia (modern-day parts of Poland, Lithuania and Russia) and had a strict Lutheran upbringing that stressed intense religious devotion, personal humility and a literal interpretation of the Bible).\nAccordingly the young Kant received a strict, punitive and disciplinary education that favored Latin and religious instruction over mathematics and science.\nAfter excelling at school, Kant went University of Königsberg in 1740, at the age of 16. Here, he worked as a private tutor and subsequently became a professor in 1770 – along the way developing his own philosophical research.\n“Two things fill my mind with ever increasing wonder and awe., the more often and the more intensly the reflection dwells on the: the starry heavens above me and the moral law within me.”\nRationalism Versus Empiricism\n“All our knowledge begins with the senses, proceeds then to the understanding, and ends with reason. There is nothing higher than reason.”\nAs a professor of philosophy Kant was familiar with both the Rationalism of Descartes and Spinoza and the Empiricism of Locke and Hume. The Rationalists believed that the basis for human knowledge came from the mind and the Empiricists believed this knowledge came from the experience of the senses. Kant believed both schools of thought were partly right and also partly wrong.\nFor Kant, the Rationalists had forgotton the importance of experience and the Empiricists had shut their eyes to the way your mind influences the way you perceive the world.\nHe argued that knowledge comes from a synthesis of experience (Empiricism) and concepts (Rationalism) – without your senses, you would not become aware of any object, but without understanding and reason you would not be able to form any conception of it.\nKant agreed with Hume that you cannot know what the world is like with certainty, you can only know the world as you know it. Kant makes this distinction as the ‘the thing in itself’ and ‘the thing as it appears to you’.\nHe began bridging the two schools of thought by philosophizing about time and space.\nTime and Space\n“Space and time are the framework within which the mind is constrained to construct its experience of reality.”\nFor Kant time and space belong inside you and are perceptions that come from within. They are not attributes of the physical world. Its these perceptions of time and space that leave an imprint on your mind.\nHe reasoned that your mind is not just ‘passive wax’ that simply receives sensations from the outside world, rather your mind adapts through time and space to gain knowledge.\nKant argued that whatever you experience, first and foremost is perceived as phenomena in time and space. He called time and space the two ‘forms’ of intuition.\nThese two ‘forms’ precede every experience. In other words you know before you experience something that we you will perceive it as a phenomena in time and space.\nA Chain Reaction of Cause and Effect In The Mind\nKant reasoned that the two ‘forms’ of intuition create a chain reaction of cause and effect that takes place in the mind.\nFor example, before you go out in the morning, you cannot know what you will see or experience during the day. But you can know that what you see and and experience will will be perceived in happening in time and space. You can moreover be confident that the law of cause and effect will apply, simply because you carry it with you as part of your consciousness.\nImagine a dog in a room. A ball is thrown across the room. What happens? Straight away, the dog chases the ball. Now imagine you in a room. A ball is thrown. What happens? Do you straight away chase the ball? No. You look around to see where the ball has come from. The law of causality is is built into your human makeup. Looking for the cause of the event is hardwired into your thinking.\nFor Kant, there are two elements that contribute to your knowledge of the world. The first is the external conditions that we cannot know of before we have perceived them through the senses – called the Material of Knowledge.\nThe second is is the internal condition in you yourself, such as the perception of events as happening in time and space and as a process of conforming to an unbreakable law of causality.\nThe Universe And The Soul\nWhen it came to the big philosophical questions such as is the universe infinite or do you have an immortal soul, Kant believed there are limits to which they can be answered. As you cannot step outside the universe or take out your soul to look at, there is no adequate sensory information and without this your reasoning becomes blunted.\nKant thought that something lay beyond reason and experience. This was where faith belonged. Whether God existed could never be proved or disproved, but there is something beyond what you can comprehend.\nWe have certain predispositions as to what exists, and only those things that fit into these predispositions can be said to exist for us.\nTowards the end of his life, Kant became increasingly anti-social and bitter over the growing loss of his memory and capacity for work. He became totally blind and finally died 1804."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"english_native_fluent"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:d952cd5e-4d56-46b1-b2ad-a3dc262fcb5c>","<urn:uuid:2b258a1b-6aba-4670-8e24-749c827b3a62>"],"error":null}

Nomads dont have a permanent home. Using their animals for transportation, they trek from one place to another in order to find fresh grassland for their cattle. In Mongolia, there are large variations in temperature. In the summertime it can get very hot (up to nearly 30C). In the wintertime however, the temperature eventually drops down to a frosty -30C! Nomads in Mongolia live in transportable homes, so-called yurts.\nFrom the outside, yurts are similar to big tents. But inside they are as cosy as a house! A typical yurt consists of a scaffold (5 pieces) and other parts to build the roof. In order to give the yurt a wall and protect the people inside from bad weather, several layers of sheep wool and felt are attached to the scaffold. Inside the yurt, you can find some furniture and even a stove. There is no running water though.

The 10 driest ranked\nDid you know that roughly one-third of the land on Earth is arid or semi-arid? These areas, known as deserts, can reach incredibly high or low temperatures, receive little to no precipitation, and have sparse vegetation. Because of this, there isn't much life there because plants and animals find the environment hostile. You might not be aware that some deserts are drier than others. So what is the driest desert in the world?\nThe arid climate subtype, also called the desert climate, has a significant excess of evaporation over precipitation. These climates typically have bare, rocky, or sandy surfaces that are dry and don't hold much moisture, so any rainfall they do get quickly evaporates. Even though deserts don't get much rain, sporadic downpours can result in flash floods.\nWhat is the driest desert in the world?\nFrom the Atacama in Chile to the Pelican Point in Namibia, the world has its fair share of barren areas. Discover the ten driest deserts in the world, ranking from the driest.\n1. Atacama – Average rainfall: 15 mm (0.6 in) per year\nThe Atacama is the world's driest non-polar desert. It is also the world's largest fog and true hot desert that receives less precipitation than the polar ones.\nSo, why is the Atacama desert so dry? According to the Global Weather & Climate Center, Atacama's astonishingly low precipitation can be attributed to several factors. They include the subtropical high, a double rain shadow, and the cold ocean current running up South America's west coast.\nThe Atacama desert temperatures are comparatively mild throughout the year, with the average temperature being about 63 degrees F (18 degrees C). But is the Atacama drier than Sahara? Yes, it is. The Atacama is the world's driest place, second only to the polar deserts.\n2. Namib – Average rainfall: 10 mm (0.39 in) per year\nThe Namib is the driest desert in Africa and is found in Namibia and southwestern Angola. It stretches 1,200 miles (1,900 km) along Namibia's Atlantic coast, named after this place.\nEgypt's New Administrative Capital has a 93,440-capacity stadium and plans to host the 2030 World Cup And 2032 Olympics\nBut what causes the Namib desert to be so arid? According to the New World Encyclopedia, aridity is caused by the descent of dry, warm air from the east, cooled by the cold Benguela current along the coast. The warm, dry upper layer keeps the cool, humid air from rising and forming clouds.\n3. The Sahara – Average rainfall: 76 mm (3 in) per year\nThe Sahara is the world's largest hot desert, encompassing nearly all of northern Africa and covering an area of approximately 3.3 million square miles (8.6 million sq km).\nWhy doesn't it rain in the Sahara Desert? According to Live Science, the descending air prevents clouds from forming, resulting in very little rain falling on the land below.\n4. The Taklamakan – Average rainfall: 40 mm (1.57 in) per year\nThe Taklamakan desert is China's hottest, driest, and one of the world's most arid and desolate landscapes. According to NASA, parts of the Tarim Basin, surrounded on three sides by mountain ranges and dried by the resulting rain shadow, receive no more than 10 millimetres (0.4 inches) of rain annually.\n5. The Mojave – Average rainfall: 51 to 152 mm (2 to 6 in) per year\nThe Mojave is North America's driest desert. Its dry summers, which create a harsh environment during the hottest months, are a defining feature. The famous landscape, primarily found in southern Nevada and southeastern California, is home to nearly 2,000 unique plants, including the favourite Joshua trees only found in the Mohave.\nWhy is Mojave so dry? According to Blue Planet Biomes, while some rain falls on the mountains, most of it is evaporated by the hot air before reaching the ground. The rain shadow effect causes the Mojave to be one of the world's driest landscapes.\n6. Death Valley Desert – Average rainfall: 55 mm (2.2 in) per year\nDeath Valley is an arid valley in eastern California, bordering the Great Basin Desert in the northern Mojave. During the summer, it is the hottest place on the planet. According to the National Park Service, Death Valley is North America's hottest and driest place.\nOn 10 July 1913, the world's highest air temperature of 134°F (57°C) was recorded at Furnace Creek.\n7. The Arabian Desert – Average rainfall: 100 mm (3.9 in) per year\nThe Arabian is one of the hottest and largest, with sand covering most of its surface. According to Bayut, the Arabian is hot and dry, reaching 133°F (56.1°C). Among the reasons for this hot and dry climate is the Indian summer monsoon season, which affects the regional weather patterns.\n8. Dasht-e Lut (The Lut Desert) – Average rainfall: 100 mm (3.9 in) per year\nDasht-e Lut is a large salt desert in the Iranian provinces of Kerman, Sistan and Baluchestan. Scientists have measured the surface of its sand at temperatures as high as 70.7 °C (159.3 °F), making it one of the world's driest and hottest locations.\nAccording to NASA, seven years of satellite temperature data show that the Lut is the most desirable place on the planet.\n9. The Thar (Great Indian Desert) – Average rainfall: 100 to 500 mm (4 to 20 in) per year\nThe Thar, also known as the Great Indian Desert, is an arid region in the northwestern Indian subcontinent that spans 200,000 square kilometres in India and Pakistan. According to Britannica, the Thar can reach temperatures of up to 123 °F (51 °C) at its hottest, which is hot most of May and June.\nThe arid subtropical climate is caused by its latitude's persistent high pressure and subsidence. The summer monsoon winds that bring rain to be much of the subcontinent tend to bypass the Thar to the east.\n10. The Chalbi – Average rainfall: 150 mm to 350 mm (6 to 13.8 in) per year\nThe Chalbi desert is Kenya's hottest and driest region. It is a rain-shadow landscape with an annual rainfall of between 150 mm to 350 mm. The part has two dry and two rainy seasons, but rain is erratic, and some years the area barely receives any rainfall.\nAccording to Time and Date, average daytime temperatures in the Chalbi range from 109 F (43 C) to 115 F (46 C), while nighttime temperatures drop to around 57-59 F (14 -15 C).\nWhat is the driest place on Earth?\nAccording to Universe Today, the McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica are the driest place on Earth. For nearly 2 million years, there has been no precipitation in the valley. The lack of rain in this area is due to katabatic winds. Gravity pulls these winds down and away from the valleys because they are so heavy with moisture from the mountains.\nFrequently asked questions\n- What are the 2 driest deserts in the world? According to Pedal Chile, The McMurdo Dry Valleys and the Atacama is the world's driest.\n- Where is the driest desert in the world located? It is located in Antarctica (The McMurdo Dry Valleys).\n- What is the name of the driest desert in the world?

{"question":"How does InfraNodus use betweenness centrality to identify influential words in text network analysis, and what specific insights does this metric reveal about the discourse structure?","answer":"In text network analysis, InfraNodus identifies influential words through betweenness centrality, which is visualized as bigger nodes in the network graph. These words have both high frequency and connect different topics within the text. For example, in a text network analysis visualization, words like 'text', 'network', 'analysis', and 'method' appear as the most influential nodes, indicating they connect different topical clusters and have high influence in the overall narrative.","context":["Network analysis can be used to generate insight for any relational data. In this tutorial we will demonstrate how insight can be produced for a certain domain of knowledge using InfraNodus text network visualization tool.\nWhile the exact definition of “insight” may vary depending on the context, it is generally associated with “aha” moments, problem-solving, new discoveries, and the ability to get an overview over a situation.\nVideo Tutorial (4 minutes):\nIn this particular example we will show how you can use InfraNodus to get insight about a particular topic of interest: “text network visualization”.\nClick the top left menu button, then choose the + add new graph menu option, name your graph, and click save.\nYou will be forwarded to the new empty graph window\nIn order to generate insight you need to start with something.

You can learn more in our tutorial on How to interpret network graphs.\nThe bigger nodes have a higher betweenness centrality. Those are the words with the highest influence in the narrative: they connect the different topics present within the text and have a high frequency.\nIn our example: text, network, analysis, method\nThe nodes that are closer to each other on the graph and have the same color comprise topical clusters. These are the words that tend to co-occur more often in the same context in your data.\nIn our example:\n1. network, analysis, text\n2. analyze, study, paper\n3. identify, graph, topic\n4. tool, word, post\nThis visualization and topic modeling feature of InfraNodus already gives us a good idea of the kind of discourse that happens online about text network analysis.\nWe can see people talk about methods, there are studies and papers on the subjects (so we can assume that this discourse occurs in the scientiic context).\nWe can also see that most of it is happening around the subjects of identifying topic graphs and also the tools used for TNA.\nSo the current discourse around TNA focuses on the methods, studies, and tools for topic modeling and most of it is happening in the scientific realm.\nIf you look a the list of topics identified by InfraNodus, you can see the topic #4: tool, word, post.\nWe don’t really know what it means, but using InfraNodus we can get exactly to the part of the data that mentions all of these terms to see what context they appear in.\nIn order to do that:\n- Select the words / nodes:\n- either by clicking the nodes on the graph, or\n- clicking them on the essence or analytics tab, or\n- entering them into the search pane below\nYou will then see the filtered version of the graph\nClick the Data tab in the top menu and you will see exactly the part of the text that contains all or most of the terms you selected:\nFrom the results above you can see that these clusters refer to the tools that allow one to build word clouds from user posts — a practical application of text network analysis.\nUsing the graph we can discover the gaps in the existing discourse, which will lead us to new ideas.\nIn order to do that, we click the Insight tab at the top menu. The InfraNodus algorithm analyzes the structure of the graph and detects:\n- which topical clusters are underdeveloped, and\n- not well connected together\nIt then proposes to bridge the structural gap between them by asking a question that would link these two clusters together.\nYou can try this on your data. To give an example, in our case:\nWe can see that there may be an interesting relation between\n- tool, word, post (the TNA apps and tools that create word cloud from posts)\n- identify, graph, topic (topic modeling using graphs)\nFor instance, we could ask a question: “is there any way to implement topic modeling into word cloud tools”? — this may lead us to a new idea or a new research direction.\nAnother powerful feature of InfraNodus is that it allows you to remove the nodes from the graph in order to see what’s hiding behind them. The algorithm will automatically recalculate the topical clusters and the most influential words, showing you the new results and highlighting the new structural gaps.\nFor example, you can click on the most influential words (and also very obvious) words, such as text, network, analysis:\nThe new topical clusters are automatically calculated:\n- analysis, study, research\n- identify, graph, topic\n- discourse, generate, bias\n- method, visual, propose\nNow we can discover the more specific parts of the discourse, which relate to discourse analysis and visual methods for data science.\nIf you click on the Insight tab in the top menu, you will see the new topical clusters and the proposed relation between them:\nIn our example, it’s a link between a scientific paper on the visual method for text network analysis that we wrote (it appeared in the search results) and a post on using discourse structure analysis to estimate bias we made in Towards Data Science journal. Therefore proposing that it could be interesting to link the two approaches or, as they are already linked (both were written by the same person), it could be interesting to publish a scientific paper on the discourse structure analysis method as an update to the earlier approach.\nI encourage you to try the methodology above on your own data and please, send me your feedback or questions — I would be curious to know how it works for you!\nHope you enjoy this tutorial!"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"english_native_fluent"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:6fed30d9-5869-4301-bde3-c06b64c356dd>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do the speeds of material ejection compare between asteroid P/2010 A2's collision aftermath and Comet Lovejoy's plasma tail clumps, and what causes these differences in velocity?","answer":"In P/2010 A2's case, the asteroid collision occurred at about 11,000 mph and ejected material violently. In contrast, the clumps in Comet Lovejoy's plasma tail moved much more slowly at about 20-25 kilometers per second, which was notably slower than other comets like P/Halley (58 km/s). The difference in speeds is due to different mechanisms: P/2010 A2's material was ejected by the explosive impact of two colliding asteroids, while Comet Lovejoy's tail movement was driven by interaction with the solar wind, which eventually accelerates the plasma tail material to speeds of 300-700 kilometers per second.","context":["Hubble Observes Aftermath of Possible Asteroid Collision\n|Join Mailing List|\nOct. 13, 2010: Astronomers using NASA's Hubble Space Telescope have captured rare images of a suspected asteroid collision. The snapshots show a bizarre X-shaped object at the head of a comet-like trail of material. Their findings will be published in the Oct. 14th issue of Nature.\nIn January 2010, astronomers began using Hubble to track the object, named \"P/2010 A2,\" for five months. At first they thought they had witnessed a fresh asteroid collision, but were surprised to learn the collision occurred in early 2009.\n\"We expected the debris field to expand dramatically, like shrapnel flying from a hand grenade,\" says astronomer David Jewitt of the University of California in Los Angeles, who is a leader of the Hubble observations. \"But what happened was quite the opposite. We found that the object is expanding very, very slowly.\" This suggested an older collision than the team had anticipated.\nP/2010 A2 is located in the asteroid belt, a reservoir of millions of rocky bodies between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Astronomers estimate that modest-sized asteroids in the main belt smash into each other about once a year. Catching asteroids in the act of colliding, however, is difficult because large impacts are rare while small ones, such as the one that produced P/2010 A2, are exceedingly faint. The Lincoln Near-Earth Research (LINEAR) Program Sky Survey first spotted the object’s comet-like tail in January 2010, and indeed some astronomers thought it might be a comet. But only Hubble discerned the X pattern, offering unequivocal evidence that something stranger than a comet outgassing had occurred.\nThe Hubble images, taken from January to May 2010 with the telescope's Wide Field Camera 3, reveal a point-like object about 400 feet wide, with a long, flowing dust tail behind a never-before-seen X pattern. The tail contains enough dust to make a ball 65 feet wide, most of it blown out of the bigger body by the impact-caused explosion. The 400-foot-wide object in the Hubble image is the remnant of a slightly larger precursor body.\nAstronomers think a smaller rock, perhaps 10 to 15 feet wide, slammed into the larger one. The pair probably collided at high speed, about 11,000 mph, which smashed and vaporized the small asteroid and stripped material from the larger one. Jewitt estimates that the violent encounter happened in February or March 2009 and was as powerful as the detonation of a small atomic bomb.\nAstronomers still do not have a good explanation for the X shape. The crisscrossed filaments at the head of the tail suggest that the colliding asteroids were not perfectly symmetrical. Material ejected from the impact, therefore, did not make a symmetrical pattern, a bit like the ragged splash made by throwing a rock into a lake. Particle sizes in the tail are estimated to vary from about 1/25th of an inch to an inch in diameter. Larger particles in the X disperse very slowly and give this structure its longevity.\nAstronomers plan to use Hubble again next year to view the object. Jewitt and his colleagues hope to see how far the dust has been swept back by the sun's radiation and how the mysterious X-shaped structure has evolved.\nEditor: Dr. Tony Phillips | Credit: Science@NASA\nFor images, movies, and more information about asteroid encounter P/2010 A2, visit: http://hubblesite.org/news/2010/34\nAlthough the Hubble images give compelling evidence for an asteroid collision, Jewitt says he still does not have enough information to rule out other explanations for the peculiar object. In one such scenario, a small asteroid's rotation increases from solar radiation and loses mass, forming the comet-like tail.\n\"These observations are important because we need to know where the dust in the solar system comes from, and how much of it comes from colliding asteroids as opposed to 'outgassing' comets,\" Jewitt said. \"We also can apply this knowledge to the dusty debris disks around other stars, because these are thought to be produced by collisions between unseen bodies in the disks. Knowing how the dust was produced will yield clues about those invisible bodies.\"","Images from a December 2013 observation of the comet C/2013 R1 (Lovejoy) reveal clear details about rapidly changing activity in that comet's plasma tail. To get this image, astronomers used Subaru Telescope's wide-field prime-focus Suprime-Cam to zero in on within 0.8 million kilometers of the comet's plasma tail, resulted in gaining precious knowledge regarding the extreme activity in that tail as the comet neared the Sun. Their results are reported this week in a paper in the March 2015 edition of the Astronomical Journal.\nTeam of researchers from National Astronomical Observatory of Japan, Stony Brook University (The State University of New York) and Tsuru University, reported highly resolved find details of this comet captured in B-band in 2013 (Subaru Telescope's Image Captures the Intricacy of Comet Lovejoy's Tail). They used I-band filter which includes H2O+ line emissions and V-band filter which includes CO+ and H2O+ line emissions. During the observations, the comet exhibited very rapid changes in its tail in the course of only 20 minutes. Such extreme short-term changes are the result of the comet's interactions with the solar wind where charged particles constantly sweeping out from the Sun. The reason for the rapidity of these changes is not well understood.\nDr. Jin Koda, the principal investigator of these nights, says \"My research is on galaxies and cosmology, so I rarely observe comets. But Lovejoy was up in the sky after my targets are gone on our observing nights, and we started taking images for educational and outreach purposes. The single image from the previous night revealed such delicate details along the tail, it inspired us further to take a series of images on the following night. As we analyzed the images, we realized that the tail was displaying rapid motion in a matter of only a few minutes! It was just incredible!\"\nThe plasma tail of a comet forms when gas molecules and atoms coming out from the comet encounter the solar wind. Changes and disturbances in the solar wind can affect the behavior and appearance of this plasma tail, causing it to form clumps of ionized material. The material in the plasma tail departed from the comet's coma and floats away on the solar wind. At these times, the plasma tail can take on a \"kinked\" or twisted look.\nA good candidate for the detailed study must be a bright comet with an orbit that takes it close enough to the Sun to form a plasma tail. In addition, the best viewing angles for astronomers to capture views of plasma tail changes occur when the comet also approaches close to Earth. As a result, comets that allow good viewing of the plasma tail are relatively rare -- about one or two per year. During its passage, the Comet Lovejoy's plasma tail was almost perpendicular (83.5 degrees) to the line of sight from Earth. That made it a prime candidate for close-up observations of its plasma tail structure using Suprime-Cam.\nAnother discovery is that clumps located in the plasma tail at about 300 thousand kilometers from the nucleus moved fairly slow speed at about 20-25 kilometers per second. That is much slower than reported in other comets, such as P/Halley, which gave off clumps that moved as fast as 58 kilometers per second or the value 44 +/- 11 kilometers per second as derived from several bright comets in the past.\nThe speed of the solar wind ranges from 300 to 700 kilometers per second and the intensity and velocity that the comet encounters depends on where it is located with respect to the Sun. The solar wind helps to accelerate the clumps in the tail out away from the Sun. Eventually the clumps in the comet's tail reach this high speed. The observation team thinks they witnessed the beginning of the acceleration of the clumps by the solar wind.\nIt is still under study how these ion clumps form and what parameters determine the initial speed of them. Dr. Masafumi Yagi, the first author of the paper noted \"Comets are often observable only during the twilight as they come near the Sun. On the other hand, it becomes difficult to observe faint objects like galaxies during the twilight hours because of the brighter sky background. Well designed telescope scheduling like this case makes an effective use of the Subaru Telescope's time and will enable us to collect more data of comets when the opportunity arises in the future.\"\nTheir research paper titled \"Initial Speed of Knots in the plasma Tail of C/2013 R1 (Lovejoy)\" will be published in Astronomical Journal in its March 2015 issue.\nCite This Page:"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"english_native_fluent"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:6bd2656d-3517-4178-ba1f-e5f71c234e77>","<urn:uuid:c2f4fd60-d5d1-4877-a98b-392790b9a289>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Looking ahead at future insurance claims, how do the reporting requirements and long-term record implications compare between standard accidents and those involving uninsured motorists?","answer":"For standard accidents, immediate reporting is required to ensure quick claims processing and avoid future liability issues. These incidents typically remain on driving records for three years, though alcohol-related accidents can stay for up to 10 years. When dealing with uninsured motorists, additional protection is available through specific uninsured motorist coverage, which typically mirrors liability limits and is often bundled with underinsured motorist coverage. This becomes particularly important given Illinois's strict penalties for uninsured drivers, including fines up to $1,000 for first offenses and $2,500 for repeat offenders causing bodily harm.","context":["Illinois laws impose strict penalties on drivers who operate a motor vehicle without insurance: they face a minimum of a $500 fine if they are caught. Any motorist who breaks these Illinois traffic laws -- not just Illinois residents -- is subject to the same monetary fines, but non-residents may face different non-monetary penalties.\nRequired Insurance Coverage\nIllinois has a mandatory requirement for drivers to carry auto insurance. The minimum requirements for residents include $20,000 for the injury or death of one person in an accident, $40,000 for the injury or death of multiple people in an accident and $15,000 for the property damage that the other driver sustains. Illinois laws require that a person carry an insurance card in his vehicle at all times while driving. A nonresident must show proof of insurance and his insurance must conform to the minimum requirements of his state. A questionnaire may also be sent to random registered drivers in Illinois to ensure compliance with Illinois mandatory insurance laws.\nFines for the First Offense\nA first offense for driving without insurance results in a minimum fine of $500. The maximum fine for a first offense of driving without insurance is $1,000. If you are convicted of driving without insurance and you are an Illinois resident, your license plates will be suspended until you show proof of insurance and pay a $100 reinstatement fee.\nFines for Multiple Offenses\nA person who is convicted of three or more offenses is required to pay a $1,000 fine if the infraction did not result in injury. If you cause bodily harm to another person in an automotive accident and you have been convicted twice or more for driving without insurance, you will be required to pay a $2,500 fine. Repeat offenses also result in a four-month suspension of your license plates and a $100 reinstatement fee.\nNon-monetary Penalties for Residents\nIf you are charged with operating a motor vehicle without insurance, you are required to appear in court. Your driver's license will be suspended for three months and you will have to pay $100 to reinstate your license if it is your first offense. If you violate your driving suspension, your license will be suspended for six additional months. If you acquire insurance in the future, your rates may be especially high if you receive a single or multiple violations for driving without insurance. If the accident caused bodily injury to another person, you can be sentenced up to one year in jail.\nPenalties for Non-residents\nAll states except for Alaska, California, Michigan, Montana, Oregon and Wisconsin have entered into an agreement called the Non-Resident Violator Compact. This agreement provides a way for states to uniformly process traffic violations that non-resident drivers incur. A person who is a resident of a state that is a member of the Non-Resident Violator Compact can stay in Illinois and argue the case in court or he can sign a promise to pay the traffic ticket. If the ticketed driver fails to comply with his promise to appear in court or pay the fine, his state's motor vehicle department will suspend his license until he pays the fine.

When shopping for auto insurance, you can always opt to purchase coverage limits above your state's minimum requirements to further protect your assets. Visit our insurance guidelines by state page to learn more.\nNot sure about how much liability insurance you need? Our insurance specialists can guide you through selecting the right amount of protection for you and your family.\nComprehensive and collision insurance covers damage to the policyholder's vehicle after a covered incident. However, it's important to understand the critical difference between the two types of insurance.\nCollision coverage will cover any damage sustained to your vehicle after a traffic accident (regardless of fault) up to your policy's limits. This includes accidents with another vehicle, rollovers, or collisions with a stationary object.\nOn the flip side, comprehensive coverage covers damage to your vehicle after it's been involved in a non-collision event. Examples of covered events may include vandalism, damage from failing debris, or natural disasters.\nIn most cases, purchasing collision and comprehensive insurance is entirely optional. However, if you're financing or leasing your vehicle, your lender or titleholder may require you to purchase these add-on coverage types.\nUninsured motorist insurance will protect you when involved in an accident with an at-fault driver who doesn't have liability insurance.\nYou'll often see this type of coverage included or bundled alongside underinsured motorist coverage, which offers similar protection if involved in an accident with an at-fault driver whose liability limits are too low to cover all expenses. Coverage limits for uninsured motorist insurance typically mirror your liability limits.\nGenerally speaking, if someone borrows your vehicle with your permission, your auto insurance policy should still provide coverage if they were to get into an accident. This is referred to as \"permissive use\" in most policies. Coverage may vary depending on your location and insurance provider, so always double-check with your insurance agent.\nIf someone borrows your car on a regular basis, however, that individual should be added as a listed driver to your policy to avoid any potential issues.\nIf you are currently insured and are upgrading to a new car, you typically have a short grace period (between 2 to 30 days) to update your policy information. Grace periods may vary depending on your location and insurance provider. If you are not insured, you'll need to obtain a policy before driving the car off the lot.\nYes and no. All of your vehicles are required to carry your state’s minimum insurance requirements. However, coverage limits can vary when it comes to add-on coverage types such as comprehensive, collision, or rental reimbursement. Furthermore, it is possible to carry collision and comprehensive insurance on one vehicle and not the other.\nMost US auto insurance policies will continue to provide coverage when driving in Canada. However, your auto insurance policy will likely provide no coverage when driving in Mexico.\nWhat is \"Full Coverage?\"\nWhen shopping for auto insurance, you may come across a general term: full coverage. While some may use the term to describe a combination of coverage types that protect a vehicle, the truth is that there's no universal definition of full coverage.\nDepending on where you live, some insurance coverages are required by law, such as liability insurance. However, optional types such as rental car reimbursement are purely optional in most situations.\nFull coverage may often be used to describe a policy that includes state-required liability insurance plus collision and comprehensive coverage. However, what constitutes as full coverage will ultimately depend on your specific situation and needs.\nOur auto insurance specialists will know the questions to ask to find a policy that works best for you.\nAccidents & Claims\nGetting into an accident can be stressful, but it's important to understand the steps to take after.\nAfter an accident, your priority should be safety. First, ensure that you, your passengers, and others are uninjured. If there are any injuries, call 911 immediately. Second, it's standard procedure in most states to notify the police after a damage-causing accident. Next, gather all relevant information from other drivers and witnesses at the scene. This includes exchanging contact, vehicle, and insurance information. Be sure to take photos and videos of the damage and scene. Finally, contact your insurance company as soon as possible.\nYes. Reporting an accident as soon as possible ensures that claims are handled quickly and will help avoid potential problems should you be held liable in the future. Please visit our claims center to find out how to contact your carrier.\nTraffic convictions and accidents can remain on your driving record for three years. In some states, alcohol-related accidents and other major violations can remain on your record for up to 10 years.\nInsurance Premiums and Rates\nAuto insurance carriers rely on multiple factors to determine your insurance premium.\nCommon factors that affect your policy's price include coverage options, deductibles, and discounts. However, your driving history, credit score (where permitted by law), and additional factors may also be used to determine your insurance rates.\nTo get a personalized car insurance quote with AIS, you'll need a valid driver's license, your vehicle identification number (VIN), and the physical address where your vehicle is stored. You'll also need to know your car's make, model, mileage, and year.\nWhen you contact AIS for a quote, we shop from our network of insurance partners to find the type of coverage that best fits your needs at the best possible price. Some of our insurance partners specialize in good drivers, while others focus on high-risk drivers. So no matter what kind of driver you are, AIS can find the best possible auto insurance policy for you at a competitive price.\nAuto insurance policies vary significantly for numerous reasons, and the same applies to premiums. In these cases, you may have higher limits or additional coverage types than your neighbor. In addition, several factors, such as your driving record, discounts, and usage, can affect the cost of your auto insurance premium.\nYou can submit your request to lower your deductibles under \"Change vehicle coverage\" within your account. Please note some insurance companies may require photos of your vehicle to complete this request. AIS will contact you with details if needed.\nMy Account & Policy Information\nHave questions regarding your account?

After being raped at a party, Melinda is ostracized by her peers because she will not say why she called the police. Unable to verbalize what happened, Melinda nearly stops speaking altogether, expressing her voice through the art she produces for Mr. Freeman's class. This expression slowly helps Melinda acknowledge that she was raped, face her attacker, and recreate her identity. Speak is considered a problem novel, or trauma novel. Melinda's story is written in a diary format, consisting of a nonlinear plot and jumpy narrative that mimics the trauma she experienced. Additionally, Anderson employs intertextual symbolism in the narrative, incorporating fairy tale imagery, Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter, and Maya Angelou, to further represent Melinda's trauma. Since it was published, the novel has won several awards and has been translated into sixteen languages. The book has faced censorship for the sexual content of Melinda's rape. In 2004, Jessica Sharzer directed the film adaptation, starring Kristen Stewart as Melinda.\nBritish National Corpus\nSpoken Corpus Frequency\nRank popularity for the word 'SPEAK' in Spoken Corpus Frequency: #1186\nWritten Corpus Frequency\nRank popularity for the word 'SPEAK' in Written Corpus Frequency: #658\nRank popularity for the word 'SPEAK' in Verbs Frequency: #85\nSample Sentences & Example Usage\nImages & Illustrations of SPEAK\nTranslations for SPEAK\nFrom our Multilingual Translation Dictionary\n- تحدث, تكلمArabic\n- һөйләшеү, гәпләшеүBashkir\n- гавары́ць, размо́віць, сказа́ць, размаўля́цьBelarusian\n- སྐད་ཆ་བཤདTibetan Standard\n- parlarCatalan, Valencian\n- hovořit, mluvitCzech\n- siarad, llefaruWelsh\n- reden, sprechenGerman\n- λέω, μιλώGreek\n- hablar, mediar palabra, decirSpanish\n- حرف زدنPersian\n- ilmaista, keskustella, jutella, puhua, kertoa, sanoa, viestiä, pitää puheFinnish\n- parler, jargonFrench\n- sprekkeWestern Frisian\n- bruidhinnScottish Gaelic\n- falar, xergaGalician\n- parlare, conversare, comunicare, gergoItalian\n- 語る, 言う, 話す, しゃべるJapanese\n- сөйлеу, айту, сөйлесуKazakh\n- ಎನ್, ಮಾತಾಡು, ಮಾತನಾಡು, ಎನುKannada\n- айтуу, сүйлөөKyrgyz\n- loquor, for, dīcō, fābulor, efforLatin\n- schwätzenLuxembourgish, Letzeburgesch\n- မြွက်, ပြောBurmese\n- yáłtiʼNavajo, Navaho\n- ਬੋਲਣਾPanjabi, Punjabi\n- mówić, rozmawiaćPolish\n- falar, jargão, gíriaPortuguese\n- pledar, tschantscharRomansh\n- vorbi, discuta, comunicaRomanian\n- говорить, говори́ть, разгова́риватьRussian\n- hoallat, hállat, hupmatNorthern Sami\n- govoriti, говоритиSerbo-Croatian\n- කථා කරනවාSinhala, Sinhalese\n- rozprávať, hovoriťSlovak\n- buaSouthern Sotho\n- tala, prata, snacka, kommunicera, konversera, tala samman, samtalaSwedish\n- ҳарф заданTajik\n- gürlemek, geplemek, sözlemekTurkmen\n- әйтергә, сөйләшергә, сөйләргәTatar\n- ئېيتماق, سۆزلىمەكUyghur, Uighur\n- говори́ти, сказа́ти, розмовля́тиUkrainian\n- nói chuyện, nói, nói đượcVietnamese\nGet even more translations for SPEAK »\nFind a translation for the SPEAK definition in other languages:\nSelect another language:"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:7e0704c6-9fd1-423e-b74c-4de79d0d0fc2>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How can cell wall digestibility be improved in maize plants to optimize dairy cow nutrition?","answer":"To improve cell wall digestibility in maize plants, breeding efforts should focus on reducing cross-linking cell wall components. Current research shows that sheath tissue contains two to three times more cross-linking compared to other tissues, which increases tissue strength but reduces digestibility. By targeting and reducing these cross-links through breeding programs, cell wall digestibility could be improved. A 10% increase in forage cell wall digestibility would result in increased milk and meat production worth $350 million in the U.S., 2.8 million tons less manure solids, and 2 million tons reduction in grain supplements.","context":["Submitted to: American Journal of Plant Sciences\nPublication Type: Peer Reviewed Journal\nPublication Acceptance Date: 3/28/2017\nPublication Date: 5/22/2017\nCitation: Hatfield, R.D., Marita, J.M. 2017. Maize development: Cell wall changes in leaves and sheaths. American Journal of Plant Sciences. 8:1248-1263. Interpretive Summary: Maize is a prominent grain and forage crop in the United States and other countries throughout the world. It is an important nutritional forage for animal production being preserved primarily as corn silage. In order for ruminants such as dairy cows to take advantage of the energy stored in the fiber fraction of forages, the plant cell walls must be broken down and digested by the animal. This study was undertaken to determine if there are developmental changes that occur in different parts of the corn plant as it matures. Studies like this provide background information for plant breeders or molecular geneticists who select for specific cell wall traits to improve digestibility. We found that structural carbohydrates (fibers) are similar among the different plant part tissues; lignin is highest in the sheath and leaf midrib tissues and lowest in the leaf blades. There was little difference in total lignin within a given tissue when comparing lower nodes to upper nodes, except for the midrib tissues. We also found that the sheath tissue contains two to three times the amount of cross-linking compared to other tissues; cross-linking increases the strength of this tissue and results in less digestible cell walls. Our findings would suggest that cross-linking cell wall components could be a target for plant breeders in order to improve the digestibility of corn plants. It is estimated that increasing the digestibility of forage cell walls by 10% would mean increased milk and meat production worth $350 million in the U.S., 2.8 million tons less manure solids, and 2 million tons less in grain supplements.\nTechnical Abstract: Developmental changes occur in maize (Zea mays L.) as it transitions from juvenile stages to the mature plant. Changes also occur as newly formed cells mature into adult cells. Maize leaf blades, including the midribs and sheaths, undergo cell wall changes as cells transition to fully mature cell types. As is common in grasses during cell wall maturation, the lignin in the plant tissue is acylated with p-coumarates (pCA). This work characterizes cell walls in maize that make up leaf blade, leaf midrib, and sheath tissues corresponding to tissue development. Maize plants grown in the greenhouse were harvested; leaf, leaf midrib, and sheath tissues from nodes 9 through 14 tissues were analyzed for cell wall composition. Cell wall carbohydrates varied with the type of maize tissue, but there was little change within a tissue type among the different nodes. Lignin concentrations were lowest in the leaf blade (70-88 g/Kg cell wall [CW]), followed by the sheath (123-140 g/Kg CW), and highest in the midrib (140-168 g/Kg CW). Incorporation of pCA into cell walls paralleled the lignification. Ferulates (FA) remained relatively constant as a proportion of the cell wall (3.1-6.4 g/Kg CW) across nodes and across all tissue types. The amount of FA was highest in the sheath and midrib tissues compared to leaf blade (3.8 vs 5.7 g/Kg CW averaged over all nodes). Lignin composition did not change significantly with cell wall maturation within a given tissue type. The aerial portions of maize plants, excluding the stem, showed little difference in cell wall composition along the different nodes. Higher levels of ferulates were found in the sheath and leaf midrib compared to the leaf blade tissues. Leaf midribs from the upper nodes of the plant contained the highest levels of lignin. Perhaps this is a reflection of the function to keep leaves extended and in an upword angle to help maximize the photosynthetic capacity."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"english_native_fluent"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:d27b16d1-156b-4417-879a-de4b3eb33075>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do the New Year celebrations in Chinese and Persian cultures compare in terms of their timing and relationship to spring?","answer":"Both celebrations are tied to spring but occur at different times. Nowruz (Persian New Year) falls exactly on the Spring Equinox (March 20), while Chinese New Year occurs between January 21 and February 21, typically around the new Moon closest to the beginning of spring (lichun). The Chinese New Year date shifts each year due to the lunar calendar, moving 11 days earlier annually unless a leap month is added, which makes it jump 19 days later. In contrast, the Persian Nowruz maintains a fixed date aligned with the solar calendar.","context":["Ironically, the most widely celebrated holiday in the Islamic Republic of Iran long predates the official religion. Nowruz, literally “New Day” in Farsi, marks the first day of spring and the Persian New Year. The holiday, which falls on March 20 this year, is widely celebrated across the Middle East and Central Asia.\nNowruz is a national holiday celebrated by Iranians of virtually all ethnicities and religions. Celebrations may date back to Cyrus the Great’s reign in the sixth century B.C. Many of the season’s traditions have roots in Zoroastrianism, an ancient monotheistic faith still practiced by some 25,000\nShortly after the 1979 Islamic Revolution, some hardliners unsuccessfully tried to suppress\nthe holiday due to its pre-Islamic origins. But Iran has never severed connections to its pre-Islamic past. “Iran’s advancements after Islam are incomparable to its past. However, pre-Islamic history of Iran is also part of our history,” Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said\nin 2008. Most Iranians still look to the ancient Persian Empire as a source of pride.\nThe following is an overview of traditions associated with Nowruz.\nA Persian Santa Claus and Troubadour\nAmoo, or “Uncle,” Nowruz, and his sidekick Haji Piruz are folk characters who herald the spring. Uncle Nowruz, like Santa Claus, hands out presents to children and is an older man with a white beard. Haji Piruz\n, his clownish assistant, sings joyous songs and plays a tambourine or drum in city streets and squares. Men and boys blacken their faces with soot, and wear bright red clothing and a conical hat to portray the character in hopes of earning some coins for providing entertainment. The following is a translation of one common song associated with Haji Piruz:\nWind and rain have gone.\nLord Nowurz has come.\nFriends, convey this message.\nThe New Year has come again\nThis spring be your good luck\nThe tulip fields be your joy.\nNowruz is celebrated on the Spring Equinox, but the holiday includes many stages and weeks of preparation.\nIranians begin preparing their homes for Nowrouz weeks in advance. The annual spring cleaning is known in Farsi as khoneh takooni, or “shaking the house.” Families meticulously wash rugs, windows, curtains and repair furniture. They throw out or donate old household goods and purchase new clothing to greet the coming spring.\nHaft Seen Table\nOne of the most important Nowruz traditions\nis setting the haft seen table, which includes seven symbolic items all starting the with an “s” sound:\n• Sabzeh (sprouted wheat grass): For rebirth and renewal\n• Samanu (sweet pudding): For affluence and fertility\n• Senjed (sweet, dried lotus tree fruit): For love\n• Serkeh (vinegar): For patience and wisdom gained through aging\n• Sir (garlic): For medicine and maintaining good health\n• Sib (apples): For health and beauty\n• Sumac (crushed spice made from reddish berries): For recalling the sunrise\nAdditional items on the table include:\n• Mirror: To reflect on the past year\n• Live goldfish in a bowl: To represent new life\n• Orange in a bowl of water: To symbolize the Earth\n• Decorated eggs: For fertility\n• Coins: For future prosperity\n• Books of classical poetry and/or the Koran: For spirituality\nOn the last Wednesday of the year, Iranians set up bonfires in public places and leap over the flames in a ritual, Chahar Shanbeh Soori, thought to ensure good health for the year. People sing the following song addressing the fire while jumping:\nGive me your beautiful red color\nAnd take back my sickly pallor!\nSince the 1979 revolution, hardliner clerics and public officials have warned against observing the ritual, citing safety hazards and roots in pre-Islamic traditions. In recent years, youth have begun using firecrackers and other fireworks.\nOn March 1, 2015, the head of Tehran’s police prevention unit said\nauthorities would take legal action against people blocking the main streets or bothering others with bonfires. On March 13, Tehran’s interim Friday prayer leader and Assembly of Experts member Ayatollah Ahmad Khatami said\nthe ritual is haram\n(forbidden) from a religious perspective and reminded the public that many festivals have turned into days of mourning because of unfortunate accidents.\nOn March 18, 2015, nearly 400 people were reportedly injured\nand three died in accidents related to the ritual. In 2017, 10 people died and more than 2,000 people were injured\n, according to the head of Iran’s Center for Emergency Medical Services.\nFor Chahar Shanbeh Soori\n, some Iranians make wishes and distribute a special soup consisting of roasted garbanzo beans, almonds, pistachios, hazelnuts and dried figs, apricots and raisins.\n(left), is traditionally served around Nowrouz. The hearty mixture is filled with noodles and multiple types of beans. The noodle knots represent the many possibilities for the coming year, and untangling them is thought to bring good fortune.\nSabzi pollo mahi, is a common fish and rice dish served during Nowrouz. The rice is mixed with green herbs to symbolize the coming spring.\nSeveral types of sweets are also ubiquitous at this time of year.\n• Baqlava: flaky pastry sweetened with rosewater\n• Naan bereng: cookies made from rice flour\n• Noghl: sugar-coated almonds\n• Samanu: a sweet pudding made from sprouted wheat\nMany Iranians have found these foods and other items increasingly expensive since 2012. Tightened international sanctions imposed over Tehran’s controversial nuclear program have dramatically raised prices. “I didn’t buy nuts last year, because prices were very high and I won’t buy them this year either,” a 37-year-old mother of two told The National\nThe Count Down\nAfter Chahar Shanbeh Soori\n, Iranians wait with their families and friends for the exact moment when the vernal equinox occurs, Tahvil\nin Farsi. Elders distribute sweets and children receive coins. People begin making short visits to the homes of friends and family throughout the day and night. At each house visit, hosts provide nuts, sweets, dried fruits and tea to their guests.\nOn the 13th day of the new year, Iranians try to get rid of the bad luck associated with the number 13 by spending the day outside having fun with family and friends. Many people pack picnic lunches and head to parks or the countryside. The tradition is known as sizdah bedar, or “getting rid of the 13th.”\nIranians also discard the sabzeh grass from the Haft Seen table, which collected all the potential bad fortune of a family during Nowruz. Some unmarried girls knot grass blades symbolizing the union of a man and woman in hopes of finding a husband before the next Nowruz.\nThe United Nations includes Nowruz on its List of Intangible Cultural Heritage.

Dr. Aslaksen, apparently tired of the same types of comebacks\nfrom his Chinese wife, settled the score by writing an award-winning scholarly\npaper entitled “The Mathematics of the Chinese Calendar,” now\navailable in PDF format.\nThe main focus on my paper is the study of leap months\nin the Chinese calendar. In the early 1990s, Chinese astronomers\ndiscovered that there was an error in the Chinese calendar\nfor 2033. The traditional calendar claimed that the leap\nmonth would follow the 7th month, while in fact it comes\nafter the 11th month. It is very unusual that the 11th month\nhas a leap month, in fact it hasn’t happened since\nthe calendar reform in 1645 (before 1645, all months had\nthe same probability for having a leap month). But many\nChinese astronomers still claim that there will never be\na leap month after the 12th and 1st month. I have found\nthat there will be a leap month after the 1st month in 2262\n(in fact, it should have happened in 1651, but they got\nthe calculations wrong) and there will be a leap month after\nthe 12th month in 3358….\nFascinating, but that won’t won’t make for a snappy comeback to the Mrs. I’ll try this instead:\nOne rule of thumb is that Chinese New Year should be\nthe new Moon closest to (??, lýchun), the beginning of spring.\nThis rule is correct most of the time, but it can fail if\nlýchun falls close to halfway between two new Moons. It\nfailed in 1985 and will fail again in 2015. Since lýchun\nfalls around February 4, this helps explain why Chinese\nNew Year will always fall between January 21 and February\n21. It also helps explain why Chinese New Year is called\nthe spring festival. If you have a Western calendar that\nindicates the phases of the Moon, this will give you an\napproximation of the date of Chinese New Year. But notice\nthat the Chinese calendar uses the time of new Moon in China.\nAs explained above, Chinese New Year will always fall\nbetween January 21 and February 21. The tropical (or solar)\nyear is about 365.25 days, while a synodic (or lunar) month\nis about 29.5 days. Hence a lunar year consisting of 12\nmonths will be about 12 x 29.5 = 354 days. So a lunar year\nis about 11 days shorter than a solar year.\nThe second rule of thumb is therefore that most of\nthe time Chinese New Year will fall 11 (or sometimes 10\nor 12) days earlier than the previous year, but if that\nwould take us outside of the Chinese New Year range of January\n21 to February 21, we must add a leap month, so Chinese\nNew Year jumps 19 (or sometimes 18) days later. If this\nrule takes you close to January 21, you can end up being\none month wrong, otherwise you will be at most one day off.\nNeed some more snappy comebacks in your own “When is Chinese New Year?”\nconversations?

{"question":"Between Snoqualmie Falls Hydroelectric Plant's turbine system and parabolic trough CSP technology, which generation method uses water as the primary working fluid?","answer":"The Snoqualmie Falls Hydroelectric Plant uses water directly as its working fluid, with water from the Snoqualmie River flowing through turbines to generate electricity. In contrast, parabolic trough CSP technology uses a separate heat transfer fluid in receiver tubes, which is heated by concentrated sunlight to produce steam for electricity generation. While both ultimately use turbines, only Snoqualmie uses water as its primary working fluid.","context":["Located on the Snoqualmie River in King County, Washington, the Snoqualmie Falls Hydroelectric Power Plant is a marvel of modern engineering that harnesses the power of nature to generate electricity. Built in the early 1900s, the plant has been supplying clean and renewable energy to the region for over a century, and remains a shining example of sustainable energy production.\nHistory: The idea for the power plant was first conceived in the late 1800s, when a group of entrepreneurs recognized the potential of the Snoqualmie River as a source of hydroelectric power. After securing funding, construction began on the plant in 1898, and it was completed in 1905. At the time, it was the world's largest hydroelectric plant, capable of producing 30,000 kilowatts of power.\nOver the years, the plant has undergone numerous upgrades and expansions to keep up with the growing demand for electricity. In 1957, the original generators were replaced with new, more efficient ones, and in 1999, a fourth generator was added to increase capacity. Today, the plant is capable of producing up to 54,000 kilowatts of power, enough to supply electricity to over 15,000 homes.\nHow It Works: The Snoqualmie Falls Hydroelectric Power Plant works by harnessing the power of falling water to turn turbines, which in turn generate electricity. Water from the Snoqualmie River is diverted into a canal, which carries it to the power plant. The water is then directed into penstocks, which are large pipes that carry the water to the turbines. As the water flows through the turbines, it turns the blades, which in turn spin the generator to produce electricity.\nOne of the unique features of the plant is its ability to adjust the amount of water flowing through the turbines based on the demand for electricity. When demand is high, more water is released into the turbines to generate more power. When demand is low, less water is released, allowing the plant to conserve water and operate more efficiently.\nConstruction: The construction of the Snoqualmie Falls Hydroelectric Project was a massive undertaking that required extensive planning, engineering, and construction expertise. Here is an overview of the construction process:\n1. Site Selection and Planning\nThe first step in the construction process was selecting a suitable site for the power plant. The site needed to be near a source of water that could provide a reliable and consistent supply of water to turn the turbines. Snoqualmie Falls was chosen because of its height and the large volume of water flowing over it, which made it an ideal location for a hydroelectric power plant.\nOnce the site was selected, engineers and planners began designing the power plant, including the layout of the dam, the canal, the penstocks, and the turbines.\n2. Construction of the Dam and Canal\nThe construction of the dam was the first major undertaking of the project. The dam was built to divert water from the river into a canal, which carried the water to the power plant. The dam was constructed using concrete and stone, and was designed to withstand the force of the river and the weight of the water.\nOnce the dam was complete, construction of the canal began. The canal was dug using heavy machinery and hand labor, and was lined with concrete to prevent water from seeping into the ground. The canal was designed to carry a large volume of water to the power plant, and had to be carefully engineered to ensure that the water flowed smoothly and efficiently.\n3. Construction of the Penstocks and Turbines\nThe penstocks and turbines were the heart of the power plant, and were responsible for generating electricity from the water flowing through the plant. The penstocks were large pipes that carried water from the canal to the turbines, and were constructed using steel and concrete.\nThe turbines were massive machines that weighed thousands of pounds, and were carefully designed to turn the force of the water into mechanical energy that could be used to generate electricity. The turbines were installed in a specially designed chamber, and were connected to generators that produced electricity.\n4. Construction of the Powerhouse\nThe final stage of construction was the building of the powerhouse, which housed the generators and other electrical equipment. The powerhouse was constructed using reinforced concrete, and was designed to withstand the force of the water and the weight of the machinery inside.\nOnce the powerhouse was complete, the generators were installed and tested to ensure that they were working properly. With the generators in place, the power plant was ready to begin generating electricity.\nThe construction of the Snoqualmie Falls Hydroelectric Project was a massive undertaking that required extensive planning, engineering, and construction expertise. By harnessing the power of falling water, the power plant is able to generate clean and sustainable electricity, while also providing economic benefits to the local community. The project stands as a testament to human ingenuity and the potential of renewable energy, and serves as a model for future projects around the world.\nBenefits: One of the primary benefits of the Snoqualmie Falls Hydroelectric Power Plant is that it generates clean and renewable energy. Unlike fossil fuels, which release harmful pollutants into the environment, hydroelectric power is completely emissions-free. This makes it a more sustainable and environmentally friendly source of energy.\nIn addition, the plant provides a reliable source of electricity to the region, reducing the need for imported energy from other states or countries. This helps to ensure energy security and stability, while also providing economic benefits to the local community.\nIn a nutshell, The Snoqualmie Falls Hydroelectric Power Plant is a testament to the power of human ingenuity and the potential of renewable energy. By harnessing the power of falling water, the plant is able to generate clean and sustainable electricity, while also providing economic benefits to the local community. As we continue to explore new ways of generating energy, the Snoqualmie Falls Hydroelectric Power Plant serves as a shining example of what is possible when we work in harmony with nature.","Largest solar thermal power stations (CSP) list\nLargest operational solar thermal power stations list.

The thermal energy is either harnessed for industrial process heating or for creating steam, which turns a turbogenerator, producing electricity.\nA CSP station can be supplemented with a storage system, which allows generating electrical power even at night or in dull weather.\nThere are four key groups of solar thermal systems, each of them having different variations and configurations. There is no single opinion as to which technology is optimal, all of them have their own pros and cons.\n- Parabolic trough is the oldest and best-developed CSP tech. The solar field consists of parallel rows of parabolically curved solar collectors comprised of reflectors, which concentrate sunlight onto a receiver tube filled with working fluid. The latter is heated to considerable temperatures and produces steam, the heat of which is utilized for electricity making. The reflectors are installed on single-axis trackers, going after the sun to keep its radiation always concentrated on a receiver pipe, which runs right above the trough-shaped mirror.\n- Power tower tech is not so developed as a parabolic trough, but it is a fast-developing and promising system. The heat-transfer fluids in such systems reach temps much higher than in parabolic troughs, and consequently they provide higher conversion efficiency. The technology is comprised of a tall tower with a receiver above, surrounded with heliostats – reflectors that track the sun’s position along 2 axes and focus solar irradiance onto a receiver. The working fluid gets heated, which results in formation of steam running a power generator. Energy storage systems are often integrated into power towers to provide uninterrupted electricity generation.\n- Linear Fresnel technology is much similar to a parabolic trough. The difference is in the form of mirrors used. Instead of curved reflectors, Fresnel system contains parallel rows of strip-shaped flat mirrors. They also follow the sun’s rays to concentrate them onto a system of receiver pipes filled with heat transfer fluid. The concentrating surface of flat reflectors is larger compared to parabolically curved mirrors and they are less expensive. Like parabolic troughs and solar power towers, Fresnel projects can also be integrated with energy storage.\n- Parabolic dish systems are made of a dish-shaped concentrator that focuses solar energy onto a receiver installed at a focal point. The reflector is installed on a double-axis tracking system. Unlike other CSP technologies where heat energy is converted into electrical power by a turbogenerator, in most dish systems steam is used to drive an engine (commonly Stirling engine). Today, dish-engine solutions are rarely used for commercial power production. A parabolic dish may be heated to extremely high temperature, which is a promising option for making a solar fuel."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"non_native_learner"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:06082d6b-f096-4ccb-8412-53fe1b421dfc>","<urn:uuid:01473e93-25ba-483c-a1e2-ebe967fef781>"],"error":null}
{"question":"When comparing knowledge types, what's the key distinction between a priori and a posteriori knowledge, and could you give me some examples to understand each one better?","answer":"A priori knowledge is knowledge that doesn't require sense experience to know, while a posteriori knowledge can only be established through sense experience. For example, 'all bachelors are unmarried' is an a priori truth since you don't need to observe bachelors to know this - it's true by definition. In contrast, 'snow is white' is an a posteriori truth since you can only know this through sensory experience. A priori knowledge delivers certainty - propositions like '2+2=4' are necessarily true and can be known through reason alone. A posteriori knowledge, while giving us useful information about the world, is less certain since it relies on potentially fallible sense experience.","context":["Knowledge and Belief • People can believe things that aren’t true. • For you to know something, it must be true and you must believe it. • Beliefs can be true or false. • Beliefs can accidentally be true, but it isn’t knowledge. Types of Knowledge • Analytic – true by definition – “Squares have 4 sides”. • Synthetic – not analytic, true or false in the way the word is – “Ripe tomatoes are red”. • A priori – doesn’t require sense experience to know – “all bachelors are unmarried”. • A posteriori – can be established through sense experience – “Snow is white”. All Analytic propositions are known a priori.\nThis doesn’t mean that all a priori propositions are analytic. The main question is “Are all synthetic propositions a posteriori? ” i. e; do we have some knowledge that doesn’t come from sense experience? It is this question that forms the debate between rationalism and empiricism. Rationalism vs. Empiricism • Main dividing questions are: “What are the sources of knowledge? ”, “How do we acquire it? ”, “How do we get concepts? ”. • Rationalism gives an important role to reason. • Empiricism gives an important role to the senses. • Why can’t we use both in acquiring knowledge? Rationalism.\n• Rationalism claims that we can have synthetic a priori knowledge of the external world. Empiricism denies this. • Rationalists argue that it’s possible for us to know some synthetic propositions about the world outside our own minds, e. g. Maths and morality. Empiricists argue that it is not. • Both rationalists and empiricists accept that we naturally have certain thoughts and feelings inside our minds. Empiricism • An advantage of empiricism is that it allows us to quickly see how we ascertain our knowledge – through our senses by perceiving how the world is, which is a causal process – it requires no mental reasoning.\n• Empiricists also claim that this is how we acquire our concepts – through our senses. • Once we understand the acquired concepts, we gain analytic knowledge. If we have knowledge that doesn’t come from sense experience – how do we get this knowledge? Rationalists argue that we either gain this knowledge from ‘rational intuition’ or ‘insight’, which allows us to gain this knowledge intellectually, or we just know these truths innately as part of our rational nature. Rationalists may also argue that some, or even all of our concepts are innate of come from rational insight. Do All Ideas Derive From Sense Experience?\nJohn Locke – Mind as a ‘Tabula Rasa’ • Locke argues that all ideas derive from sense experience. • He says that the mind at birth is a ‘tabula rasa’ – a blank slate that gets filled up with ideas from the senses. • He refutes the claim of ‘innate ideas’. • Ideas can either be part of a proposition: “He had the idea that it would be fun to take the day off”; or they can be concepts: “the idea of yellow”. • Locke says that all our concepts derive from sense experience, and that we have no knowledge prior to sense experience. From Locke’s definition of ‘innate idea’, it follows that everyone with a mind should have the same ideas.\nHowever, there is no truth that every person (including people lacking reasoning skills) can assent and agree to. So perhaps, with Locke’s definition, innate ideas are ones that we known as soon as we gain the use of reason. Locke refutes this, saying that we aren’t lacking reason but the knowledge of ideas. For example, a child can’t know that “4 + 5 = 9” until the child can count up to 9 and has the idea of equality. It is the same thing as knowing that an apple is not a stick – it’s not a development of reason, just the gaining of knowledge of ideas.\nSo therefore, if we must first acquire the concepts involved (through sense experience), the proposition cannot be innate, as no proposition is innate unless the concepts used are innate. Locke argues that the mind has no concepts from birth, and so no truths or concepts can be innate. A Different definition of ‘innate idea’ • Locke’s definition and argument against innate ideas hasn’t been criticized • People who believe in innate ideas don’t accept Locke’s definition • Nativists maintain the view that innate ideas are those which cannot be gained from experience\n• Nativists tend to argue on how concepts or knowledge can’t be acquired from sense experience • Because we don’t know all concepts from birth, there is some point when we become aware of our concepts • Rationalists argue that experience triggers our awareness of our innate concepts. Experience as a ‘Trigger’ • Children begin to use certain ideas at certain time, and their capacities develop, so why can’t their concepts and knowledge also develop? • Children begin to use certain ideas at certain times • Experience still plays a role – a child must be exposed to the relevant stimuli for the knowledge to emerge, e. g.language.\n• An idea is innate if it cannot be derived or justified by sense experience. Empiricists on Arguing Concepts John Locke 1. The senses let in ideas 2. These ideas furnish an ‘empty cabinet’ 3. The mind grows familiar with these ideas and they’re lodged in one’s memory 4. The mind then abstracts them, and learns general names for them 5. The mind then has ideas and the language by which it can describe them • However, what does it mean to ‘let in ideas’? • We contrast ideas with sensations, e. g. the sensation of yellow isn’t the same as the concept of yellow • Locke fails to make this distinction David Hume\n• Hume believes that we are directly aware of ‘perceptions’ • Perceptions are then divided into ‘impressions’ and ‘ideas’ • Both Locke and Hume divide impressions into ‘impressions of sensation’ and ‘impressions of reflection’ • Impressions of sensation come from our sense data and that which we directly perceive • Impressions of reflection derive from the experience of our mind, such as feeling emotions. • Hume says that ideas are ‘faint copies’ of impressions • Therefore, there are ideas of sensation (e. g. the idea of red) and ideas of reflection (e. g. the feeling of sadness, happiness) • Concepts are a type of idea.\n• Hume’s theory of how we acquire ideas (from copying them from impressions) is a theory of how we acquire concepts) • Locke and Hume both have slightly different versions of how we acquire ideas with which we can think • We start with experiences of the physical world which we get from sense data and experiences of our mind • For Locke, this gives us ideas once we employ our memory to reflect on these experiences • According to Locke, this makes it sound that the remembered experiences are the ideas with which we think • Hume corrects this, and says that we remember and think with the copies of the sensory impressions.\nSimple and complex concepts • A complex idea is just an idea made up of several different ideas, e. g. a complex idea (a dog) is made up of simple ideas like shape, colour and smell. • This complex idea has a complex impression • We can therefore form complex ideas by abstraction. • As an objection, rationalism raises the question of where do non-empirical ideas come from? • Empiricism is appealing, as we seem to intuitively trust our senses and it easily answers such questions. • However, there are complex ideas that correspond to nothing from our sense experience, e. g. unicorns or God. • So do all ideas derive from sense experience?\n• Empiricists argue that these complex ideas are made up from simple ideas, which are copies of impressions (e. g. a unicorn is the simple concepts of a horse, a horn, and the colour white, and combined together they give us a unicorn) • Hume and Locke argue that when creating complex ideas, one can only work with the materials that our impressions provide – simple ideas • Complex ideas are no more than altering or abstracting these simple ideas • Therefore, empiricists answer this rationalist objection So Are There Innate Concepts?\n• What would an empiricists’ analysis of complex concepts like self, causality, substance, etc.be? • These concepts must either be innate, or reached using a priori reasoning • Hume accepts that these complex concepts cannot be derived from experience • However, he states that each of these concepts has no application • These concepts are confused, and we should always use concepts that can be derived from experience • For example, we don’t experience our ‘self’, we experience a changing array of thoughts and feelings. • To come up with the idea of ‘self’, we’ve confused similarity with identity • We do the same with the idea of a physical object • A physical object exists independently of experience, existing in 3d space.\n• But can experience show us something that exists independently of experience? • If I look at a desk, look away, and then look back again, the desk must have existed when I wasn’t looking at it. • I can’t know that my experience was of the same desk, only that the experiences are similar • When coming up with the concept of a physical object that exists independently of experience, I confuse similarity with identity. • Hume concludes that these concepts are incoherent confusions • This can be objected though • This makes most of our common-sense understand and analysis of the world incorrect – we know that our concepts are coherent.\n• Empiricism now seems to challenging to accept, as it makes our concepts ‘illusory’. • The fact that we cannot derive the aforementioned from experience shows that they are innate • Empiricists therefore have a flawed argument – explaining our most abstract concepts is an argument that these concepts are not derived from experience. • Does this therefore mean that they’re innate or arrived at through rational intuition? • One reason to think they’re innate is that children use these concepts before they develop rational intuition.\n• Rationalists therefore argue that experience is the trigger for the concept Does all knowledge about what exists rest on sense experience? Hume’s Fork • We can have knowledge of two sorts of things: ‘Relations between ideas’, and ‘matters of fact’ • Relations of ideas are propositions like ‘all sons have fathers’ • Hume argue that all a priori knowledge must be analytic, and all knowledge of synthetic propositions must be a posteriori • Anything that is not true by definition (‘matters of fact’) must be learned through the senses • Hume’s ‘matters of fact’ are essentially analytic truths.\nMatters of Fact • Hume says that the foundation of knowledge of matters of fact is what we experience here and now, or what we can remember • All our knowledge that goes beyond the aforementioned rests on casual inference • For example, if I receive a letter from a friend with a French postcard on it, I’ll believe that my friend is in France. • I know this because I infer from post mark to place • I think that where something is posted causes it to have a postmark from that place. • If the letter was posted by my friend, I believe that he is in France. • I ‘know’ this because I rely on past experiences.\n• I don’t work out what causes what by thinking about it • It is only our experience of effects and causes that brings us to infer what cause has what effect. • Hume denies that this is ‘proof’ • He says that knowledge of matters of fact, beyond what we’re experience here and now relies on induction and reasoning about probability. Induction and Deduction • The terms relate to a type of argument • Inductive is where the conclusion is not logically entailed by its premises, but supported by them • If the premises are true, the conclusion is likely to be true. • The French letter example is an example of inductive reasoning.\n• A Deductive argument is an argument whose conclusion is logically entailed by its premises • If the premises are true, the conclusion cannot be false • E. g. Premise 1: Socrates is a man; Premise 2: All men are mortal; Conclusion: Socrates is mortal. Using a priori intuition and demonstration to establish claims of what exists • Rationalists argue against Hume, saying that some claims about what exists can be grounded on a priori intuition.\n• A priori demonstration, or deduction, is deduction that uses a priori premises • Rational intuition is the view that you can discover the truth of a claim by thinking about it Descartes • Descartes says that we can establish the existence of the mind, the physical world and God through a priori reasoning.\n• He attacks sense experience, and how they can deceive us • We can’t tell if we’re being deceived by an evil demon through our senses, as what we are experiencing will be false • We can establish that we think, and therefore we exist, even if our senses do deceive us (as we don’t need our senses to know our mind exists) • This conclusion of thinking and doubting that we exist was gotten to by pure reasoning. • He also establishes that the mind can exist from the body.\n• Descartes says we don’t know what causes these experiences • It could be an evil demon, God, or the physics world exists exactly how we perceive it. • If it was God, it would mean he was a deceiver as we have a very strong tendency to trust our senses • If it was a demon, God must have created this demon to deceive us, and because God is perfect by definition, this would mean God isn’t a deceiver, and so he can’t have made a demon – so there must be some kind of a real world • Through a priori intuition and reasoning, Descartes says that the external world must exist, because God exists, and he would not deceive us.\nConceptual Schemes and Their Philosophical Implications • Humans don’t all have the same concepts • There are two distinguishable elements to our experience: the data of the senses, and how this data’s interpreted by our concepts • By the latter, it implies that different people would impose different conceptual scheme if they have different concepts. • Conceptual relativism claims that because our conceptual scheme affect how people experience and understand reality, people with different conceptual schemes have different realities. An Implication: Conceptual relativism.\n• We assume people have different ‘realities’ because we can’t translate their to ours • It assumes language ‘constructs’ reality to say reality is relative to our conceptual schemes • It would mean that reality is dependant on language, which isn’t true – we express our realities by language • A proposition in one conceptual scheme can be true without needing to be express in another set of scheme. • This means that there isn’t one set of scheme with how the world works • An objection is that people argue that the relation between experience anc conceptual schemes doesn’t make sense.\n• Benjamin Whorf says that languages organize our experience of the world • This is like trying to organize a wardrobe itself and not the clothes in it • If a conceptual scheme organizes our experience, then our experience must be comprised of individual experiences • Conceptual scheme all have a set of experiences in common • We can pick out individual experiences like smelling a flower, feeling cold, etc. • Any conceptual scheme with these sorts of experiences will end up similar to our own, despite the concepts one hold and their language, and so translation between two different conceptual schemes will be possible.\n• There may be small parts that can’t be translated, but this only leads to a very mild form of conceptual relativism. • We can’t necessarily combine conceptual scheme • An example is that we can have more or less colours in our vocabulary, and so can describe things in different ways. • The Greeks thought that there was only one colour – bronze, and that everything else was a different shade of bronze. • This doesn’t mean they saw everything in what we call ‘bronze’, it’s just how they described their experiences. • We can therefore only state things depending on the concepts we have.","If one subject, more than any other, has come to dominate philosophical inquiry it is epistemology. Epistemology deals with questions concerning the nature of knowledge, what we can know, and how we come to know it. Modern philosophy’s focus on epistemology might be considered the legacy of René Descartes; however, as we have already seen, epistemological concerns were being addressed as early as Plato.\nAs previously mentioned, one of the concerns of philosophy involves coming up with definitions. These, more often than not, are provided in terms of necessary and sufficient conditions. For example, a necessary condition for being a sister is that you are female. However, this alone is not sufficient for sisterhood; it is also necessary that you be a sibling. As such there are two necessary conditions for being a sister and these are jointly sufficient. Therefore, we can define a sister as a female sibling.\nThere are generally thought to be three individually necessary and jointly sufficient conditions for knowledge. Firstly, in order to know something you must believe it (ignore the fact that sometimes people will say such things as ‘I know Boris Johnson is the Mayor of London but I don’t believe it!’); this is known as the belief condition. Obviously, it’s not sufficient for having knowledge that one has a belief. I, for example, may believe that as you read this you are slowly transforming into a giant beetle. But, could I be said to know this? If not, why not?\nOf course, I don’t know that you currently undergoing metamorphosis. Why not? Well, simply because it’s not true (I hope). The second condition, then, for a particular claim to be known is that it be true; the truth condition. Having knowledge, then, involves having some sort of true belief, but is this enough? Consider the following claim: ‘I know that you are a Capricorn’. Now, roughly 8.33% of you will be Capricorns, and let’s suppose that you’re one of them (even if you aren’t). In that case I have a belief that you’re a Capricorn and my belief is true. But do I know that you are a Capricorn?\nMost people would, I believe, say not. Why not? Well, perhaps the reason that my true belief would not count as knowledge has something to do with the fact that this claim is only accidentally true, if it is true at all. That is to say, if my belief is true, it is due merely to the fact that you happen to be one of the 8.33% of people who are Capricorn and not due to my having any particular reason or justification for holding this belief. If, however, my true belief that you are a Capricorn was justified in some way (for example, by my knowing that you were born on December 25th) then most people, I think, would agree that I know you are a Capricorn. This final necessary condition is known as the justification condition.\nAs such, we may define knowledge as justified true belief; these three conditions being individually necessary and jointly sufficient for knowledge. That is to say, if you have knowledge you must have a justified true belief and if you have a justified true belief then you have knowledge. Or not!\nIn 1963 Edmund Gettier published a very short paper entitled ‘Is Knowledge Justified True Belief?’ in which he presented counterexamples to the tripartite definition of knowledge. Gettier’s paper had a huge impact on philosophy and a number of Gettier-like counterexamples have been constructed to show that a justified true belief is not always sufficient for knowledge.\nConsider the following:\nJennifer believes that Brad is having an affair with Angelina and, in fact, it’s true that Brad and Angelina are having an affair. Jennifer’s suspicions were aroused by the fact that the paparazzi photographed the pair together in a restaurant on a night when Brad had said that he was busy filming. As such, Jennifer’s belief is justified. However, what Jennifer doesn’t know is that Angelina was actually out with a Brad impersonator that night (Brad was actually filming and Angelina was so besotted that she hired a look-alike). So Jennifer has a justified true belief that Brad and Angelina are having an affair, but does she have knowledge? Does Jennifer know about Brangelina?\nMost people here are inclined to say ‘no’. Perhaps they would say, though, that this is not a counterexample to knowledge as justified true belief as Jennifer’s belief was not really justified in the right kind of way. Either way, what these examples highlight is the major difficulty with justifying one’s beliefs; what, if anything, counts as an adequate justification? When can we be said to know something – for certain? These are exactly the type of questions which struck the aforementioned Descartes some 300 years earlier.\nIn his Meditations on First Philosophy (1641), René Descartes (1596-1650) set out to establish a firm foundation for the sciences. In attempting to do so he succeeded, via two of the most famous sceptical arguments in philosophy, only in confirming how little we actually know for certain.\nIn the Medieval world [and indeed still to this day in some dark corners] the best way of acquiring knowledge was via Revelation or Authority. But Descartes was writing at a time of scientific revolution when many doctrines which had hitherto been accepted as certain were being overturned and, as such, he was struck by the instability and unreliability of scientific ‘knowledge’.\nIn his First Meditation, Descartes aims to sweep away all of his previously held opinions and start afresh. His ‘method of doubt’ entails that if anything can be doubted, however slightly, then we are to treat it as if it is manifestly false and reject it outright. It is not, however, necessary that we subject each and every one of our opinions to this hyperbolic (exaggerated) doubt, as this would be a Sisyphean task. Rather, Descartes aims to test the ‘foundations’ of what we claim to know – ‘as the removal from below of the foundation necessarily involves the downfall of the whole edifice’.\nDescartes claims that our knowledge comes either from the senses or from reason, and in order to subject these foundations to his method of doubt he unleashes two powerful arguments: the dream and demon hypotheses. Firstly, let us consider the Dream Hypothesis. What Descartes hopes to establish via this argument is that, given any particular experience, we can never know that that experience is not a dream. As such, we have reason to doubt the senses and therefore should treat all beliefs that we receive from them as manifestly false. [Note that all Descartes requires here is the universal possibility of illusion (that for any experience we have, that experience may be a dream) not the possibility of universal illusion (that we may be dreaming all the time).]\nDescartes believes, however, that some beliefs are immune from the dream hypothesis – namely, those that we gain not from experience but from reason alone – ‘for whether I am awake or dreaming, it remains true that two and three make five, and that a square has but four sides’. In order to subject this realm to the method of doubt Descartes conjures the second of his sceptical arguments: the demon hypothesis.\nI will suppose … that some malignant demon, who is at once exceedingly potent and deceitful, has employed all his artifice to deceive me; I will suppose that the sky, the air, the earth, colors, figures, sounds, and all external things, are nothing better than the illusions of dreams.\nIn case you find the introduction of a malevolent genie too much to bear, Hilary Putnam (Reason, Truth, and History, 1981) updates the argument by asking you to consider the possibility you are a brain in a vat and that your experiences are just electronic signals being sent to your disembodied brain by an evil scientist. [‘Utter nonsense!’ you exclaim, but that’s exactly what a brain in a vat would say.] This thought experiment also forms the plot of the Hollywood blockbuster The Matrix.\nBy the end of the First Meditation Descartes has done a terrific demolition job. By applying his method of exaggerated doubt to the foundations of knowledge the entire edifice has indeed crumbled. At the outset of Meditation II, he states that:\nThe Meditation of yesterday has filled my mind with so many doubts, that it is no longer in my power to forget them… I suppose, accordingly, that all the things which I see are false (fictitious); I believe that none of those objects which my fallacious memory represents ever existed; I suppose that I possess no senses; I believe that body, figure, extension, motion, and place are merely fictions of my mind. What is there, then, that can be esteemed true? Perhaps this only, that there is absolutely nothing certain.\nIn order to progress, Descartes must establish one thing that is certain and indubitable. This eventually leads him to the cogito: ‘this proposition I am, I exist, is necessarily true each time it is expressed by me, or conceived in my mind’. This one truth, believes Descartes, is immune from all doubt for even a malignant demon cannot deceive me into thinking that I exist if I do not; if I am being deceived, then I exist.\nIt is worth questioning why Descartes employs both the Dream and Demon hypotheses when it seems clear that the latter covers everything included in the former; that is to say, the Demon argument attacks both the senses (experience) and reason, while the Dream argument is directed only at the unreliability of the senses. The answer to this is, I think, that Descartes believes (wrongly) that he can defeat the Demon argument. [Descartes’ rejection of the Demon argument is actually risible in light of his own demanding method.] As such, he still requires the Dream argument to cast doubt on the reliability of the senses.\nDescartes is a Rationalist; he believes that some knowledge can be had via reason alone, unaided by the senses. This form of knowledge is known as a priori knowledge. In opposition to this, Empiricists believe that knowledge must come via experience derived from the senses: a posteriori knowledge. This division between Rationalism and Empiricism can be traced back as early as Plato and Aristotle.\nOne of the major benefits of a priori knowledge is that it delivers certainty; it is indubitable. For example, the proposition that ‘2+2=4’ or that ‘either Jim is in Edinburgh or he’s not’ just have to be true (they are necessarily true). Some a priori claims, such as the aforementioned ‘All sisters are female siblings’, are also called analytic. This is due to the fact that they contain no more information than is already contained in the meaning of the terms (‘sister’ just means ‘female sibling’). In establishing the truth of all of these propositions there is no need to appeal to the senses; the truth of these claims is not established by your counting your fingers (hopefully), going to check whether I’m here or not, or interrogating sisters.\nThe problem, an empiricist might claim, is that while such a priori/ analytic propositions may be necessarily true, they are actually rather trivial and worthless. What we really want to know, they argue, is whether ‘Jim is in Edinburgh’ or if ‘Lucy is a sister’, and they only way we can establish the truth (or falsity) of these propositions is by looking for Jim or asking Lucy. If such propositions are true, they are only contingently so; that is, they happen to be true but could have been false (Jim need not be in Edinburgh and Lucy could have been an only child). Note also, that these propositions are not analytic but rather synthetic; they bring together different concepts and, as such, offer meaningful information. The problem, of course, is that, as Descartes and Gettier discovered, they are far from certain. For example, it may be that it was Jim’s identical twin brother you saw in Edinburgh while Jim is in fact sunning himself on a beach somewhere, and Lucy may be a compulsive liar.\nSo, there we have it. In simple terms, knowledge can be defined as justified true belief, however, it is difficult to establish what exactly counts as an adequate form of justification. Rationalists maintain that useful knowledge can be gained through the use of reason alone. Such a priori/ analytic claims are self justifying and, therefore, necessarily true. Empiricists, however, claim that the price of this certainty is triviality and that the only route to useful ‘knowledge’ about the world is experience.\nIf you enjoyed this post, you may also find my discussion of Abre los ojos interesting."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:012dd877-e92d-43c1-8aec-9cdf63c19311>","<urn:uuid:25c327b3-0395-4231-b85b-cf46234c7946>"],"error":null}
{"question":"how many hour sleep normal adult need?","answer":"The average adult needs between 7-9 hours of sleep every night.","context":["What is excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS)?\nExcessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is a common problem that affects both adults and children. It occurs when a person experiences an overwhelming urge to sleep during the day, despite having had a full night’s sleep. A variety of medical conditions can cause EDS, including sleep apnea, depression, narcolepsy, and sleep deprivation, as well as lifestyle choices such as alcohol or drug use. It can also be a side effect of certain medications.\nCauses of EDS\nDaytime sleepiness is a condition that can undermine a person’s quality of life. While occasional episodes of daytime sleepiness are normal, chronic EDS can have serious underlying causes.\nOne of the most common causes of excessive daytime sleepiness is not getting enough sleep at night. The average adult needs between 7-9 hours of sleep every night, but many people do not get enough. Sleep deprivation can cause a wide range of symptoms, including daytime sleepiness.\nAnother common cause of daytime sleepiness is sleep apnea. Sleep apnea is a condition in which a person’s breathing is interrupted while they are sleeping. This can lead to poor quality sleep and excessive daytime sleepiness.\nPoor sleep hygiene can also lead to excessive daytime sleepiness. Sleep hygiene refers to habits and activities that promote better sleep. Poor sleep hygiene can include things like drinking caffeine late in the day, using electronic devices in bed, and eating an enormous meal before bed.\nMedications can also cause excessive daytime sleepiness. Many medications, including sedatives and antihistamines, can cause drowsiness. It is important to talk to a doctor before taking any medication, as some medications can have serious side effects.\nNumerous medical conditions can cause excessive daytime sleepiness. Conditions such as narcolepsy, thyroid problems, and depression can all cause symptoms of daytime sleepiness.\nSymptoms of EDS\nThe most common symptom of Excessive Daytime Sleepiness is a powerful urge to sleep during the day, even when one has had enough sleep the night before. This can lead to difficulty in concentrating and an inability to focus on tasks.\nOther symptoms include:\n- difficulty in waking up in the morning,\n- feeling tired and sluggish throughout the day,\n- and difficulty in staying awake for extended periods of time.\nDaytime napping is another symptom of EDS, as well as having difficulty in waking up from naps. People with EDS may also experience feelings of irritability, depression, and anxiety because of their lack of sleep.\nLifestyle changes can be an efficient way to reduce excessive daytime sleepiness. These changes include getting regular exercise, reducing caffeine consumption, establishing regular sleep and wake times, avoiding alcohol and other drugs, and avoiding huge meals and arduous exercise close to bedtime. Creating a comfortable sleep environment, such as keeping the bedroom dark, cool and quiet, can help to promote a restful sleep. Medication can also treat EDS.\nStimulant medications, such as modafinil, are commonly prescribed to increase alertness and reduce fatigue. Other medications, such as sodium oxybate, are used to improve the quality of sleep. In addition, medications such as antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications can help to reduce sleep disruption and improve sleep quality.\nWhen treating excessive daytime sleepiness, it is important to talk to a healthcare provider to determine the best course of action. Depending on the severity of the condition, lifestyle changes and/or medication may be necessary. It is also important to note that lifestyle changes may take several weeks to take effect, while medications may take several days to become effective.\nWith the right combination of lifestyle changes and medication, we can manage excessive daytime sleepiness.\nExcessive daytime sleepiness can have serious implications for an individual’s physical, mental, and emotional well-being. It can lead to impaired concentration and memory, mood swings, and a decrease in productivity. It can also be a sign of an underlying sleep disorder or medical condition, so it’s important to address the issue and seek professional help as soon as possible. With proper diagnosis and treatment, EDSs can be managed and even eliminated.\n- NCBI – WWW Error Blocked Diagnostic. (n.d.). https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33840518/\n- Pacheco, D. (2022, June 10).

{"question":"Between Samuel Beckett and traditional classic authors, who received more formal recognition for their literary contributions?","answer":"Samuel Beckett received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1969 for his innovative contributions to novel and drama forms, while classic authors like Shakespeare, Austen, Dickens, Hugo, and Tolstoy are recognized for their exceptional storytelling and exploration of societal issues. Both have achieved significant recognition, with classic authors' works becoming cultural touchstones that have persisted for centuries.","context":["Underneath the soft glow of a solitary lamp, the pages of a book rustle, as if whispering age-old secrets. The words are a portal, drawing us into worlds of timeless tales that have left an indelible mark on humanity’s collective consciousness. Classic literature, a treasure trove of human experiences, often invites a multitude of questions. Allow me to guide you as we navigate through ten of these pressing queries, illuminating the intriguing realms of classic literature.\nA question often posed by new explorers of this realm is, “What is classic literature?” In the simplest terms, classic literature refers to works of superior quality that have stood the test of time—works that have made a significant impact on our culture, society, and personal lives. These are books that continue to speak to us, their themes resonating across centuries and borders.\nThis invariably leads to the query, “What makes a book a classic?” It’s a complex combination of factors. Firstly, a classic exhibits exceptional artistry, exhibiting a command over language, depth of characters, and intricacy of plot. Secondly, it explores universal themes that echo through the human experience. Lastly, a classic transcends the era of its creation, its relevance persisting even as societies evolve.\nPeople often wonder, “Who are some notable authors of classic literature?” A multitude of brilliant minds grace the canon of classic literature. Shakespeare, often referred to as the Bard, is a luminary, his plays and sonnets captivating readers for centuries. Jane Austen’s keen social commentary and memorable characters render her works perennial favorites. Others like Charles Dickens, Victor Hugo, and Leo Tolstoy have left indelible imprints with their extraordinary storytelling and exploration of societal issues.\nA common question is, “What are some must-read works of classic literature?” While the list is vast and varied depending on personal preferences, a few works consistently appear in the annals of classic literature. These include Shakespeare’s ‘Hamlet’, Austen’s ‘Pride and Prejudice’, Dickens’s ‘Great Expectations’, Hugo’s ‘Les Misérables’, and Tolstoy’s ‘War and Peace’. Each offers a unique perspective into the human condition and society.\nInvariably, a curious reader might ask, “What themes does classic literature explore?” Classic literature delves into timeless and universal themes. Love and hate, life and death, ambition and disillusionment, justice and inequality—these are but a few. The exploration of such themes in different historical and cultural contexts is part of what makes classic literature eternally relevant.\nOne might then ponder, “Why is classic literature important?” Classic literature serves as a mirror, reflecting the societies and eras they were penned in, offering valuable historical insights. Moreover, it cultivates critical thinking, empathy, and emotional intelligence, enriching our understanding of the complex tapestry of human existence.\n“How has classic literature influenced modern works?” is another intriguing question. Classic literature has profoundly shaped modern literature, from story structures and themes to character archetypes. Many contemporary works are reimaginations of classic tales, while others draw inspiration from the themes and styles of classical authors.\nA question often posed is, “How can I understand and appreciate classic literature?” Reading classic literature can be challenging due to archaic language and complex themes. Familiarizing oneself with the historical context of the work, reading slowly and attentively, discussing with others, and even seeking scholarly analysis can enhance understanding and appreciation.\nAnother thoughtful question is, “Can classic literature be entertaining?” Absolutely! While classic literature often deals with profound themes, it is also filled with gripping plots, memorable characters, and moments of humor, horror, and suspense. It offers a rich, immersive experience that can be as entertaining as it is enlightening.\nLastly, one might inquire, “Are there classic works from non-western cultures?” Indeed, there are! Classic literature is not limited to the Western world. Works like ‘The Tale of Genji’ from Japan, ‘One Thousand and One Nights’ from the Middle East, ‘Journey to the West’ from China, and ‘Mahabharata’ from India are all integral to the global tapestry of classic literature.\nAs we turn the last page of our exploration, we leave with a greater appreciation for the vast and vibrant realm of classic literature. Through the lens of these ten questions, we’ve journeyed across centuries and cultures, immersing ourselves in the timeless tales and eternal echoes of the human experience. As we continue to explore this enriching realm, we carry with us the knowledge that each classic work, in its unique way, serves as a reflection of humanity—its triumphs, its failures, its complexities, and its enduring spirit.","James Hanley claimed he was born in Dublin on 3 September 1901, but was actually born in Liverpool in 1897 to Irish parents.

{"question":"How did the living conditions compare between Heart Mountain and Tule Lake internment camps during World War II?","answer":"Heart Mountain and Tule Lake were both significant Japanese internment camps during World War II, though they had different characteristics. Heart Mountain became Wyoming's third-largest city with nearly 14,000 residents, featuring blocks of barracks with shared mess halls, laundry, and restrooms. Each barrack had no cooking facilities, but the camp provided services like warm bottle delivery for babies. At Tule Lake, which held over 18,000 Japanese Americans, conditions were more militarized, particularly in 1943 when martial law was declared due to fears of rioting. During this period, 2,000 soldiers were stationed there with tanks and machine gun-mounted jeeps. Both camps had guard towers and fences, with Tule Lake detainees being warned they might be shot if they got too close to the fence.","context":["Over the weekend, the Heart Mountain Wyoming Foundation provided a tour of the camp and local homes for University of Wyoming American studies students. The tour allowed the students to identify barracks used by the Japanese, and those same barracks that were later dismantled and moved to settler sites around Heart Mountain.\n“These historic barracks, and the stories that surround them — from the days of the Heart Mountain Internment Camp, when they were occupied by Japanese American prisoners, through the post-war settlement times and their occupation and use by American veterans and their families — are an important part of Wyoming’s history and heritage,” said Rick Ewig, associate director of the American Heritage Center and a board member of the Heart Mountain Wyoming Foundation.\nNear a corner of the abandoned hospital, old green asphalt shingles, used as siding, flutter slightly in the gusty wind. Lumber, browned by the elements for more than 60 years, is exposed in places, making the facility appear forlorn.\n“The Heart Mountain community has many layers of history and many stories to tell,” Blewer said, standing at the Heart Mountain Interpretive Learning Center Saturday.\nThe scholars started at the center, slated for completion in August, and later visited the camp and locals in the area living in homes that were once part of the camp.\n“There are little pieces of Heart Mountain (Relocation Center) scattered all over Wyoming,” Brewer said.\nAccording to the UW, around 40 surviving barracks have been relocated in Park County and south to Riverton and the Wind River Indian Reservation.\nBrewer said he was interested in the Japanese and the settlers who homesteaded the Heart Mountain area after World War II.\nThe camp officially opened Aug. 12, 1942. A month later, four or five Japanese were arriving daily by train, said Christy Fleming, director of the Heart Mountain Foundation.\n“Each one of them had their own history and experience here,” Fleming said.\nThe area was just prairie before the camp was built. A massive landscaping effort was undertaken. Orchards planted were removed to create space for U.S. 14-A, said Dr. Eric Sandeen, who led the students’ expedition.\nPrior to the internment, 2,500 men were hired in June of 1942 to build the camp. They were told to bring a hammer and saw. In two months, 456 barracks were erected, Fleming said.\nGrass and sagebrush that have seized the once-bustling walkways lend a ghost town quality to the abandoned community.\n“(A) very self-contained little town,” Fleming said, standing in the partial shelter of the old hospital.\nFleming said, nearly 14,000 people lived in the camp. Most were Japanese.\nSome staff, such as medical personnel and military police, lived on site with the detainees, Fleming said.\nThe relocation camp was the third largest city in the state at the time, Brewer said as he braved a blustery wind outside the abandoned hospital.\n“This is a typical Heart Mountain day,” Fleming called, raising her voice to be heard above a particularly robust gust pummeling the group.\nEach block of barracks had a mess hall, laundry and restrooms. There was no cooking in the barracks, so the ambulance on site delivered warm baby bottles to mothers, Fleming said.\nLaDonna Zall, now the site’s curator, was a child at the time. She watched the last of the detainees walk down the hill to board the train when the camp closed at the end of the war.\nIt was a windy day then too, Fleming said.\nDuring the culmination of World War II, some homesteaders settling on land around Heart Mountain, may have occupied the barracks with the Japanese, Sandeen said.\nBarracks were sold for $1 each, but it took the federal government two or three years to declare the stuff surplus materials, Sandeen said.\nSandeen said he believed it likely locals were salvaging the lumber before it was declared surplus.\nThe barracks were hauled away intact or in pieces to homestead sites nearby.\n“A good number of them are still in sight,” Sandeen said.\nPhotographer Kevin Miyazaki’s grandparents, uncle and father were detainees.\n“My father didn’t talk about it much when we were young,” said Miyazaki, near an interpretive plaque a stone’s throw from the camp.\nAccording to the New York Times, President Ronald Reagan signed legislation establishing a $1.25 billion trust fund in 1988 to pay reparations for those placed in internment camps.\nAlthough his father was a boy at the time, Miyazaki said many Japanese lost farms, homes and businesses.\nMiyazaki said he believed the internees received around $20,000 each.\n“That’s how governments apologize,” Miyazaki said.\nThe tour involved the Foundation, the Shoshone Irrigation District, the Homesteader Museum, Powell High School faculty and numerous citizens throughout the region, said a Foundation news release.\nFolks are encouraged to contact the Foundation or the University of Wyoming if they have information regarding the relocated barracks.","|Hiroshi Shimizu and Sadako Kashiwagi shared their stories of internment.|\nTHE CURRENT POLITICAL CLIMATE casting a suspicious eye on Muslims and refugees is all too familiar to Sadako Kashiwagi.\nAt just 10 years old, she was rounded up and imprisoned along with more than 18,000 Japanese Americans in Tule Lake in California, one of ten concentration camps set up by the federal government.\nWhen asked if history was repeating itself, Sadako’s eyes began to well up. She cupped her hand and raised it to cover her mouth. Nodding affirmatively, she simply said “I can’t speak.”\nSadako was one of a nine people who spoke at a news conference at the Japanese American National Historical Society in San Francisco. As the country celebrates President’s Day this weekend with sales and a three day weekend, many are also pausing to remember Sunday’s 75th anniversary of Executive Order 9066. The order by President Franklin D Roosevelt set the stage for the incarceration of more than 110,000 Japanese Americans during World War II.\n- California county apologizes for Executive Order 9066\n- 'Images of Internment' photo exhibit at FDR Library\nHer husband Hiroshi Kashiwagi was also imprisoned at Tule Lake, although the two didn’t meet until after they were released. His memory of his experience is still vivid.\n“The fence, and the guard tower,” Hiroshi responded when asked about his strongest images from Tule Lake. “The fact that we were penned in, that we couldn’t go near the fence. And we would be warned to not go too close. If you continued to go on your way, they might shoot you. There were cases like that where person got maybe unknowingly close to the fence and he was shot.”\nThe news conference Friday took place just a few hours after the Associated Press reported on a draft memo which called for 100,000 National Guard troops to augment border security.\nThe White House quickly said the memo was never seriously considered and never made it up the chain of command.\n“How much of this is about direct impact and targeting and how much is about creating a culture of fear,” asked Zahra Billoo, executive director of the Council of American Islamic Relations, Bay Area. “Even if 10 percent of that rumor with the Associated Press is true, that’s still a frightening idea that we maxed out on custom and border protection agents and ICE agents, so now we’re going to bring up the National Guard.”\nHiroshi Shimizu was just 5 when he also was at Tule Lake. The AP report reminded him of 1943, when authorities at Tule Lake declared martial law out of fear of rioting. He remembers 2,000 soldiers at Tule Lake, many with tanks and jeeps mounted with machine guns. He says Tule Lake was under martial law for five months.\n“That is very similar of a military action that happened then and could happen today,” he said about reports of the National Guard. “That’s what we need to keep guard about.”\nIn 1988, President Ronald Reagan signed the Civil Liberties Act which approved a formal apology and $20,000 to each Japanese American incarcerated in the incarceration camps. The movement continues to win redress for 2,200 Latin Americans of Japanese descent who were forcibly deported to concentration camps in the United States.\n“What we’re seeing too is more normalization of trying to identify an enemy and vilify an enemy and right now it looks like anybody can be the enemy,” said Grace Shimizu; Campaign for Justice: Redress Now.\nThe news conference was part of a series of events taking place in cities across the U.S. that has commonly become known as a Day of Remembrance.\n“I see the Day of Remembrance as a way of bringing light to what people are capable of doing to each other and from that become a little aware of how as human beings we can become example of Hitler or a Mother Teresa,” said the Rev. Ron Kobata of the San Francisco Buddhist Church.\n“Know your history, be strong, and don’t be ashamed,” concluded Sadako."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"non_native_learner"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:30d8ad3a-b2f9-4dc1-9e1e-2212259c792a>","<urn:uuid:198a2bc7-74c6-4c2c-87c0-c17c3595cc16>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do the evaluation methods differ between the Watson-Glaser Critical Thinking Appraisal and the CogAT's verbal section when assessing language-based reasoning?","answer":"The Watson-Glaser Critical Thinking Appraisal and CogAT use distinct approaches to assess language-based reasoning. The Watson-Glaser focuses on sophisticated analytical skills through five sections: assumptions, argument analysis, deductions, inferences, and information interpretation. These sections require evaluating complex statements and logical relationships in a professional context. In contrast, the CogAT's verbal section is designed for younger students (K-9) and uses simpler methods including verbal classification, sentence completion, and verbal analogies. The CogAT's approach is more foundational, asking students to identify patterns among words, complete sentences, and understand basic word relationships like 'new is to old as wet is to dry.'","context":["Note: AssessmentDay and its products are not affiliated with Pearson or TalentLens. Our practice tests are intended only for candidate preparation and not for employee selection.\nAbout Critical Thinking Tests and How They Work\nCritical reasoning tests, also known as critical thinking tests, are psychometric tests commonly used in graduate, professional and managerial recruitment. These high-level analytical test are most commonly encountered in the legal sector, but other organisations such as the Bank of England also use them as part of their selection process. This test may be pencil and paper or it may be administered online depending on the format and the structure of the recruitment process. The questions will be multiple choice format and will usually be administered under time constraints\nCritical Thinking Test Formats - Common test formats as follows:\n- 40 questions - 30 minutes\n- 80 question - 60 minutes\nCritical thinking can be defined as ‘the ability to consider a range of information derived from many different sources, to process this information in a creative and logical manner, challenging it, analysing it and arriving at considered conclusions which can be defended and justified’ (Moon, 2008). If we lack critical thinking skills, it is possible to be misguided into believing that an argument is strong, when in actual fact there is little evidence to support it. Critical thinking skills therefore include the ability to structure a sound, solid argument, to analyse and synthesise available information, and to make assumptions and inferences. Critical thinking skills are also about being able to evaluate the information and draw conclusions that can be supported.\nTry a free Example Critical Thinking Test below\nLoads of extra tips broken down into separate sections:\nClick any of the buttons below to start an online simulation of each section, or the full test, or download the questions and solutions as PDF documents.\nOverview of the Watson Glaser Critical Thinking Appraisal\nBy far the most common type of critical thinking test is the Watson-Glaser Critical Thinking Appraisal (W-GCTA) which is published by TalentLens. You can visit their official site here: Watson Glaser. With over 85 years' worth of development, the Watson-Glaser Critical Thinking Appraisal is the most popular measure of critical thinking ability. The test is most commonly used by law firms, which is understandable as the abilities measured by the W-GCTA are good predictors of future success in roles which require clarity of understanding from multiple perspectives and the ability to reason with fact versus assumption.\nThe Watson-Glaser Thinking Appraisal (W-GCTA) is one of the main evaluating tools for cognitive abilities in professionals, since it measures critical thinking. It is seen as a successful tool to predict job success, as well as being used to select good managers and finding possible future leaders. It is also used in order to select the right person for a specific job role, especially for careers in the law.\nThe most recent revision of the W-GCTA was published in 2011 with notable improvements being better face validity and business-relevant items, scoring based on Item Response Theory (IRT), updated norm groups, and an online retest which can be used to validate a paper and pencil test result.\nThe W-GCTA was originally developed by Goodwin Watson and Edward Glaser. The W-GCTA measures the critical skills that are necessary for presenting in a clear, structured, well-reasoned way, a certain point of view and convincing others of your argument. The test questions are looking at the individual’s ability to:\n- 1.Make correct inferences\n- 2.To recognise assumptions\n- 3.To make deductions\n- 4.To come to conclusions\n- 5.To interpret and evaluate arguments\nWhat Does a Critical Thinking Test Measure?\nCritical thinking tests assess your ability to logically analyse assumptions, arguments, deductions, inferences and interpreting information. You will be given a passage of information which may contain a mixture of verbal and numerical data, and will be provided with a statement which requires the candidate’s critical assessment of how true that statement is based on the above passage.\nThe Watson and Glaser Critical Thinking Appraisal contains five sections which are specially designed in order to find out how good an individual is at reasoning analytically and logically. There are five sections:\n- 1. Assumptions: In these questions a statement will be presented and the candidate will have to decide if an assumption has been made in making the statement. For example in the statement “only people earning a high salary can afford a fast car” it is assumed that fast cars cost more than not fast cars (this is just one of many assumptions implicit in the statement). An assumption is something someone effectively takes for granted. Statements are given for the individual to read and they are then followed by several proposed assumptions. The candidate has to select whether an assumption has or has not been made.\n- 2. Analysing arguments: Candidates will be provided with a given scenario i.e. “Should the government pay student’s tuition fees?” They are subsequently provided with a list of arguments for or against the scenario presented. The candidate will need to assess if each argument is strong or weak, based on how relevant it is and how well it addresses the question. The argument is considered to be strong if it directly relates to the question or statement, and weak if it is not directly related to the question or statement.\n- 3. Deductions: Candidates will be provided with a passage of information and candidates will need to evaluate a list of deductions made based on that passage. If one cannot deduce a particular statement from the passage, then that deduction does not follow, and the candidate must select which deductions follow and which do not follow. The answer must be entirely based on the statements made and not on conclusions made from one’s own knowledge.\n- 4. Inferences: In this section candidates will be provided with a passage of information on a scenario. A subsequent list of possible inferences will follow, and candidates will be asked to rate if they are true, false, possibly true, possibly false or whether it is not possible to say based on the information in the passage.\n- 5. Interpreting Information: A paragraph of information will be provided to the candidate, with a list of possible conclusions. Candidates will need to interpret the information in the paragraph and decide if each conclusion follows based on the presented information. Once again the decisions must solely be based on the information given.\nWhat Should you Know Before a Critical Thinking Test?\nIf a critical reasoning test is used in the assessment centre stage of the recruitment process then it is unlikely that it alone will be the sole decider of the selection decision. Instead a mixture of tools will be used and combined to get a varied view of the candidate’s abilities. However if a critical reasoning test is used at the early stages of the recruitment process, it may be that this is being used as a screening tool, and poor performance may screen that candidate out at that early stage. For a critical reasoning test candidates will not be required to learn any specific material before the test and will not be asked to use prior knowledge. All the information needed to complete the questions will be provided in the test.\nTypical Critical Thinking Tests\nHere is a list of critical reasoning tests on the market at present, which candidates may be likely to encounter for recruitment, selection or development.\n- 1. Watson Glaser Critical Thinking Appraisal: The W-GCTA is the most widely-used critical reasoning test on the market, and the one candidates are most likely to encounter.\n- 2. GMAT: The general management aptitude test (GMAT) contains sections which require the use of critical reasoning ability. The GMAT is used as an entry requirement into business schools, and tests a candidate’s ability to think critically and make decisions in a business setting.\n- 3. SHL Critical Reasoning Test Battery: The SHL Critical Reasoning Test Battery is a collection of 60 critical reasoning questions with varying difficulty depending of the level of candidate. This test has a time limit of 30 minutes.\n- 4. Cornell Critical Thinking Assessment: The Cornell Critical Thinking Assessment is a test primarily used in educational settings. There are two versions of this test, one for children and one for adults. This test may be used for entry onto particular degree courses or for recruitment/development purposes.\n- 5. Verbal and numerical critical reasoning: Some tests may specifically test verbal critical thinking, or numerical critical thinking. Similarly verbal/numerical reasoning test will employ critical thinking questions in their tests, or will have questions which may implicitly require the use of critical thinking.\nGeneral Critical Thinking Test Advice\nHere is some general advice to help you perform to the best of your ability for your critical reasoning test.\n- 1. Only use the information contained in the test: When reading the passages of information within the test, your first instinct may be to use general knowledge or your own personal experience. Critical reasoning tests are not tests of what you think; they are tests of how you think. You will not be required to utilise any prior knowledge when answering a question, and at times the correct answer will completely contradict what you know to be true based on your own knowledge, but is true in the context of the passage.\n- 2. Read the instructions thoroughly: Critical reasoning tests will require numerous separate types of logical reasoning, and reading the instructions will inform you of how to answer questions correctly. For example if a question requires you to evaluate the strength of an argument, the instruction page will inform you what constitutes a strong or weak argument. Take ample time to ensure you know how to answer questions regardless of any time limits.\n- 3. Time limits: Due to the complex nature of critical reasoning tests, there will often be no time limits or there will be generous time limits. Candidates are advised to use this to their advantage and take plenty of time when reading, evaluating and answering. An easy mistake to make is treating this type of test like a verbal or numerical reasoning test and answering questions as quickly as possible. Rushing through a critical thinking test may lead to candidates missing key points, and answering incorrectly as a result.\n- 4. Logical fallacies: Understanding logical fallacies is an important part of the test, and researching the difference between sound and fallacious logic can help maximise performance on a critical reasoning test. A fallacy is an error in reasoning due to a misconception or a presumption, and an argument which employs a formal fallacy, logical fallacy or a deductive fallacy in its reasoning becomes an invalid argument. Researching the different types of fallacy (i.e. red herring argument, straw man argument, confusing correlation and causation etc.) can help you identify them in the test and therefore answer the question correctly.\nHow AssessmentDay Can Help With Critical Thinking Tests\nPractice critical reasoning tests as offered by AssessmentDay are a useful method of preparation. Having actually undertaken a critical reasoning test before the real thing can be a great confidence booster, and help you to learn from your mistakes in the practice test.\nThe best place to get advice on taking a critical thinking tests is the test publisher's website, for example this one for the Watson Glaser.\nAt the later stages of the recruitment process companies are unlikely to base their entire selection decision on a single score on a single exercise. Instead recruiters will use scores from numerous measures and make a balanced decision based on all factors. Critical thinking tests are used to measure a candidate's fit for a role, so being rejected after taking a test means that the role is not a good fit for you. If you have been invited to undertake a critical reasoning test then the organisation clearly has an interest in hiring you, let that fact inspire confidence and perform to the best of your ability on your test, good luck!","The Cognitive Abilities Test, otherwise known as the CogAT test, is an aptitude test published and produced by Riverside Publishing Company. The CogAT is generally used to test students from grade levels Kindergarten to 9th grade, or first year high school, to determine whether or not they are qualified for their local Gifted and Talented Education (GATE) programs.\nThe CogAT attempts to quantify the intelligence of children by testing them in the following categories:\nEach section of the test contains three (3) types of questions in which each question will attempt to gauge the intelligence of its test taker.\nDepending on the grade level, students will find that the CogAT may either be entirely picture based, word based, or a combination of both. The verbal section of the CogAT contains the verbal classification section, sentence completion section, and verbal analogies section. The verbal classification section will pose questions to students by giving three ideas, objects, or adjectives that all have something in common, and then tasking the student to pick a fourth idea, object, or adjective that fits the pattern of the first three.\nSentence completion is as simple as it sounds. Students are tasked with choosing a word (or picture) to fill in the blank of a sentence in order for it to make the most sense.\nFinally, verbal analogies tests a student’s ability to detect relationships between words, such as: “new is to old as wet is to dry”.\nIn the quantitative section of the CogAT, students will have their mathematical skills and numerical knowledge evaluated. Firstly, the student will be tested on the quantitative relations section. This section merely tests the student’s ability to appraise numbers and determine which number is greater than another.\nNext, comes the number series section in which the student is presented with an array of numbers and must choose the answer to match the present underlying pattern. And thus finally, under equation building, the student is tasked with combining numbers based on which numerical operation they are tasked to employ.\nLastly, in the non-verbal section, students will be faced with figure classification, figure analogies, and figure analysis questions. In the figure classification section, the student will be evaluated based on their ability to find a pattern amongst three given objects their ability to apply that pattern to the answers. Next, in the figure analogies section, students are tasked with determining the relationship between two given objects and then applying that same relationship to the third given object and the answer. Finally, in figure analysis, the student is evaluated on their ability to accurately determine where holes would appear in a piece of paper after it has been folded, hole punched, and then unfolded.\nWith this, the CogAT is a test that aims to see where the child that takes it falls on the spectrum of ability. This will then help the student move forward by determining which program they would be most suited for. This test is the tool for them to measure themselves against themselves and see what they can possibly improve on, or what part of their abilities they have advanced in. It is always a good idea to push oneself further to reach their potential, and this test can help determine the boost your child needs!"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"english_native_fluent"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:8070330f-b8fe-42b7-8657-892fb6f2f57a>","<urn:uuid:2312f96e-b9fb-4b9d-bea7-3039df242b11>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Why is the genetic explanation for East African running success considered oversimplified?","answer":"The genetic explanation for East African running success is considered oversimplified because excellence in running represents a complex bio-social interaction rather than just genetic inheritance. While over 100 genes have been linked to physical capacity, research shows that many elite athletes succeed without identified 'performance genes,' and many people with these genes show no athletic ability. The case of European runners' past dominance and their subsequent decline cannot be explained by sudden genetic mutations. Additionally, there's a clear correlation between investment in sports and Olympic performance, suggesting that environmental factors like full-time training opportunities, comprehensive support systems, and proper nurturing play crucial roles in athletic success.","context":["Although sporting world records continue to be set, the improvements are getting smaller, suggesting that human athletic performance is reaching its limit. As athletes move ever closer to this performance ceiling, the search for ways of identifying and developing future champions grows increasingly frenetic, and debate returns, inevitably, to the perennial question of whether winners are born or made.\nDo winners possess innate traits from birth, gifted to them through their genes, or is the development of talent more important in success? Opinion is polarised: in one camp, those preaching the necessity of \"superhuman\" performance genes; in the other, those who believe nurturing is the key to excellence. Somewhere along this continuum, perhaps, are the unique circumstances that create champions.\nElite performance represents a complex bio-social interaction across a spectrum of influences. Since the mapping of the human genome, and the development of technologies to sequence individual genes, the search for factors underpinning athletic performance has focused on nature (genetic inheritance) as the principal determinant. There is little doubt that the genes we are born with are a crucial piece in the performance jigsaw. Certain genetically inherited traits are directly linked to strong performance in a particular sport, such as height in high jumping. However, the influence of these genetic factors is often simply responsible for the choice of sport or event that an individual selects – a choice that elite athletes make at an early age.\nBeyond this point – where we start to examine the direct influence of genes on performance – is where the controversy starts. Recent studies have highlighted an \"association\" between the presence of certain gene variants and high-quality performance in large numbers of athletes. But the results are not conclusive: many elite athletes without the identified gene still manage to become world leading; and, conversely, many people carrying the \"performance gene\" have no obvious athletic ability.\nA complex question\nGiven the huge number of variables that affect athletic performance, it's not surprising that a performance gene – a single gene sequence possessed exclusively by elite athletes – does not exist. Countless studies seeking to find such a gene have, between them, identified more than 300 genes associated with performance. But this does not rule out the importance of inheritance from the performance equation, it merely articulates the complex interaction of genes and their products in determining athletic prowess. Genes have also been linked to other critical elements in determining success, suggesting, for example, a link between genes and injury. Similarly, an athlete's response to training appears to be influenced by their genes – explaining, in part, why some athletes progress up the rankings faster than others, despite an identical training environment.\nDespite the certain influence of genes on performance, their importance is often overstated. One irrefutable fact exists within the nature versus nurture debate: training is a critical element of the nurture algorithm, a key plank in the optimising of physical, psychological and technical performance. But training is not everything. A complex bio-social interaction exists including factors such as family, coaching, facilities, wealth, sports structure, sports science and medicine. These factors are far more potent in the development of elite performers than training or DNA polymorphisms alone.\nThe pro-nature riposte tends to draw upon a particular nation's dominance in certain athletic events, such as East African runners' dominance in middle- and long-distance running or Jamaican athletes' dominance in sprinting. But this is a flawed argument. On closer examination, it's clear certain nations were not born excelling, but, rather, have been developed by their environment. Do we really believe British middle-distance runners' dominance in the 1980s – with the likes of Coe, Ovett, Cram, Elliot and McKean – was due to a spate of spontaneous genetic mutations that were neither present before nor since? And have East African women suddenly begun to bear genetically modified children predisposed to endurance running? Of course not. This excellence is the result of a complex interaction of bio-social events.\nThe simplistic approach of scientists to base their pro-nature argument on relationships between genes and athletic performance fails woefully in its demonstration of cause and effect. Furthermore, if it were simply about genetic inheritance, we would not expect to observe the direct correlation between investment and performance that characterises the Olympic/Paralympic medal tables. Investment in sport has its greatest impact on environment and does not alter individuals' genes. The professionalisation of sport through funding has provided a platform for full-time training. Furthermore, comprehensive systems of support now exist in sport to cater for everything from diet to technology. No stone is left unturned in the pursuit of excellence. These are the fruits of nurture.\nIn everyday life\nAlthough the nature versus nurture debate is invariably targeted at elite sport, it resonates through many spheres of life. Think of things you may consider yourself to have been born with – intelligence, musicianship, the ability to draw, or business acumen – and then consider whether nurture hasn't played a part in how those attributes flourished (or otherwise). The debate can also be applied to inanimate objects. Does a new idea or concept get born at a single moment in time or does it evolve from earlier iterations, combined with industrious development and support? The concept of a motorised vehicle to transport people, for example, may have been born, but it has taken decades of nurturing across multiple industries to deliver the Formula 1 car of today. Certainly, both nature and nurture are critical to that highly specialised car's continued success.\nOur genes may be instrumental in determining elite performance, but evolution is not simply the product of spontaneous mutations in the DNA helix. The environment plays a key role in evolution, not merely as a test bed for survival of the fittest, but also in directly affecting the way genes evolve through interaction with their environment.\nNature may provide us with the initial foundations, but it is the quality of the nurturing that generates the potential to stretch the limits of human performance. So, it would appear winners are born, then made!\nGreg Whyte shares five of the most memorable human achievements he has witnessed\nDavid Walliams swimming the channel\n\"A non-swimmer completing this blue ribbon event proves that anything is possible.\"\nMeeting \"Current Mohan\" aka \"Electric Man\" in Kerala, India\n\"No one can explain how he conducts electricity through his body.\"\nCoaching James Woods, a paraplegic, to swim the channel\n\"James's achievement was all about the human spirit.\"\nWatching Michael Johnson break the 200m world record at the Olympic Games in Atlanta, 1996\n\"The atmosphere in the stadium was unbelievable.\"\nMeeting a colon cancer patient given weeks to live – and working with him for the next two years\n\"He wanted to engage with his kids; thanks to a programme of intervention and his determination, he enjoyed two physically active years with them.\"\nProfessor Greg Whyte\nA leading authority on exercise physiology, sports performance and rehabilitation, former Olympic modern pentathlete Professor Greg Whyte is committed to helping people \"achieve what they, and others, think is unachievable\". He says he uses many of the same strategies to train sportspeople, cancer patients and celebrities: \"It's all about preparing the body and mind. Today there's real synergy between sports coaching and science. We can see exactly what our bodies need to go through to meet our physical targets.","Environmental factors and the physiological variables associated with performance are so complex that there is a tendency for many to take the simplistic view that genes are dominant in determining running success. A facile view is that genes can act as magic bullets that propel athletes with the right genetic compositions to inevitable success. As an example, Scientific American once predicted that performances at the 2012 Olympic Games would depend on the insertion of key genes into the nuclei of athletes’ muscle cells. There is a belief that an examination of a runner’s genes can yield important information about whether he or she should become a sprinter, a middle-distance athlete, or a marathoner. There is also a common perception that East African runners (primarily from Kenya and Ethiopia) have a monopoly on the genes that code for endurance performance.\nProponents of a dominant role for genes, or nature, in determining running performances point to the relatively recent discovery of more than 100 genes that have an impact on physical capacity. Such findings reinforce the idea that an individual’s potential for running performance could be largely determined at birth. A runner with the right configuration of this multitude of genes, for example, might have an inborn talent for running that would always elevate him or her above other athletes with less optimal genetic makeup.\nAt first glance, such thinking does not seem entirely unreasonable. Research has revealed that an individual’s genetic makeup has a significant effect on physical characteristics, including body size and shape. Although there are many exceptions to the rule, the best distance runners tend to be relatively short in stature and light in weight with slim calves, factors that probably have some genetic component. Greater height tends to dampen distance-running performance because of added mass: Bone mass increases exponentially as a function of height, instead of linearly, giving the taller runner relatively more dead weight to move around a 10K or marathon course. In general, enhanced body mass, either in the form of fat or nonpropulsive muscle mass in the upper body, makes endurance runners less economical and less able to sustain high speeds for continuous periods. Scientific studies also have identified many genes that are linked with greater endurance performance.\nSomewhat oddly, the East African dominance of distance running is often cited as further evidence that genes are the strongest determinants of endurance performance. An inescapable fact is that the best middle- and long-distance runners in the world are Africans. Over the last five Olympic Games, from 1996 to 2012, male runners of African origin have captured 11 of the 15 possible gold medals in the 1,500 meters, 5K, and marathon competitions, as well as all 10 gold medals awarded in the 10K and 3K steeplechase events. Males of African origin currently hold 11 of the 12 world records recognized by the International Association of Athletics Federation in events ranging from 800 meters to the marathon.\nSuch African dominance was not present as recently as 20 years ago when European runners ruled supreme at all competitive distances from 800 meters to the marathon. In 1987, 58 of the 120 runners on the all-time top 20 lists of performances in races of 800 meters, 1,500 meters, 5K, 10K, marathon, and steeplechase were European. Just 32 of the 120 best runners of all time were African, and 16 of those 32 were Kenyans. The majority of world-record holders were European.\nBy 2003 the composition of the lists had changed drastically. There were 67 Kenyans in the top 120 and 102 Africans in all, leaving the entire rest of the world with just 18 slots. The European contribution to the world’s-best lists had slipped from 58 runners to only 14.\nThe Kenyans and other East Africans were sending shock waves through the endurance-running community with their sizzling performances. The issue was not that the European runners had suddenly begun to run slowly; they were running as fast as they always had. The change occurred because the African runners, particularly the Kenyans, were running extraordinarily fast times. An additional startling fact was that the majority of the Kenyans competing on the world stage were Kalenjins, a rather small tribe of about 3 million people.\nObservers of this transformation of the running world have been tempted to conclude that Kenyan runners, and especially Kalenjins, have some inborn capacity for long-distance running. In competitive running, nature seems to be winning out over nurture. Kenyans and other East African runners appear to have the right genes for elite performance. There is indirect evidence this might be true.\nTesting the Nature-Versus-Nurture Hypotheses\nConcluding that genetic differences are the paramount factor underlying endurance-performance success is premature, however. In many cases, further analysis of the actions of specific genes reveals that the effects are not always consistent or that the genes that seem to have the biggest impact on performance are not necessarily monopolized by—or even present in—groups of high-performing endurance runners. Many other possibilities for the determination of performance are apparent. Training, or nurture, is certainly one of those elements; even the biggest advocate of nature over nurture must admit that training plays a large role in determining what the race clock reveals when a runner crosses the finish line. In the East African case, there is considerable evidence that Kenyan training differs dramatically from the training carried out by endurance runners in other parts of the world.\nIn fact, training is commonly considered to be the most important extrinsic, or environmental, factor affecting performance. Scientists use two techniques in their attempts to disentangle environmental and genetic effects and thus provide answers to the debate over nature versus nurture. One method is to look for evidence of patterns of variation in performance variables (for example, VO2 max or responsiveness to training) in a population. As long as there is variation for a given performance-related trait, estimating the relative contributions of environmental and heritable (genetic) factors to this variation is possible.\nThis kind of work can be carried out with families. For example, maximal aerobic capacity (VO2 max), a physiological variable linked with exercise capacity, can be studied in large populations containing family groups. If VO2 max varies considerably between families but very little among family members, there is evidence that VO2 max is strongly determined by genetic factors because individuals in the same family tend to have nearly identical VO2 max values and are very similar genetically. If VO2 max varies just as much within families as it does between families, then genetic factors would appear to play a small role in determining VO2 max. The VO2 max of one’s father, mother, or sibling is not necessarily closer to one’s own maximal aerobic capacity than the VO2 max of the unrelated stranger living across town.\nResearch using the heritability model has revealed that heritable, or genetic, factors are important but not exclusive determinants of several physiological variables that contribute to success in endurance running. One investigation found that 48 to 74 percent of baseline submaximal aerobic performance—the ability to sustain continuous exercise without previous training—could be attributed to genetic factors. The same inquiry discovered that responsiveness to training—the degree to which aerobic capacity improved as a result of a specific training stimulus—had aheritability of 23 to 57 percent.\nAn additional scientific study detected a heritability of 38 to 87 percent for maximal aerobic capacity, VO2 max, a traditional measure of running fitness. Another inquiry estimated that the degree to which VO2 max increases in response to exercise has a heritability of about 47 percent, and that anaerobic, or lactate, threshold has a heritability of 55 to 80 percent.\nIn an important investigation, the performance of mothers, fathers, daughters, and sons on exercise bikes was measured in 86 nuclear families. VO2 max turned out to have a heritability of about 51 percent in these individuals. The other 49 percent of the variation might be accounted for by diet, attitude toward exercise, daily activity pattern, or other factors.\nTaken together, these wide-ranging values for heritability tell runners and their coaches that genetics do play a role in performance; after all, heritability does not drop below 23 percent and can be as high as 87 percent. This is hardly a shocking discovery, however, and it contains no practical information for a runner or coach. It is impossible for an individual to tell to what extent his or her performance is based on genes rather than environment, nor would such knowledge have a significant impact on training, which should always be formulated to be the best, most up-to-date, and most scientifically based regardless of underlying genetic constitution.\nNote also that heritability studies have trouble truly differentiating between genetic and environmental factors. Family members share not only their genes but also their environments, which undoubtedly include important dietary and psychological factors. Thus, some unknown portion of the genetic variance for the heritability of a trait is probably environmental in nature.\nThe heritability studies referred to in this chapter suggest that an individual’s capability for distance running is determined by both genetic and environmental factors, and the exact proportion of influence is unknown. This is certainly logical, because it is unlikely that a runner’s performance characteristics would be completely unmarked by either genetic or environmental elements. However, the heritability research has not been carried out with elite athletes, and it does not answer the basic question of whether Kenyan and other African runners enjoy a genetic superiority that causes the variance due to genetic factors (i.e., the genetic contribution to performance) to be maximized."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"non_native_learner"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:166f5a02-5677-4389-a22d-609123370a32>","<urn:uuid:7ca8b655-158e-479c-aced-69ba9a1a6099>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How did early epidemiology emerge from individual patient care, and what research methods are used to study diseases today?","answer":"Early epidemiology evolved from an individual-focused curative approach to a population-based preventive one. Initially, medical science was individual-oriented, with doctors viewing patients as ill people needing treatment. The shift began with Hippocrates in the 5th century BC suggesting disease development might relate to external and personal environment. Later, in 1700, Bernardino Ramazzini expanded from individual cases to considering work circumstances. Today, diseases are studied through multiple research methods including chemical/mechanical/mathematical simulations, in vitro tests, animal studies, human clinical trials, and epidemiological studies. Clinical trials follow four phases with increasing numbers of participants, taking approximately 11 years total for drug approval. Post-marketing studies continue monitoring long-term safety and effectiveness.","context":["Presentation on theme: \"Prof. Saman Wimalasundera\"— Presentation transcript:\n1 Prof. Saman Wimalasundera MBBS DO PhDProfessor in Community MedicineFormer Head, Department of Community MedicineIn charge OphthalmologistCommunity Ophthalmology centerFaculty of MedicineUniversity of RuhunaGalleSri Lanka\n3 The concepts of epidemiology were first suggested by Hippocrates in the fifth centuryB.C. that the development of human diseasemight be related to external and personnelenvironment of an individual.\n4 The word epidemiology is derived from Greek and means “Studies upon people”Epi – Upon, Demos – People, Logia – StudyIn contrast to clinical medicine epidemiologyinvolves the study of group of people ratherthan individuals.\n5 Epidemiologist vs. clinician A clinician identifies the ailment in his patientsusing certain scientifically developed tools toascertain history of illness, clinical examinationand investigations.Epidemiologist addresses the understandingof the distribution and determinants of adisease in a community (not an individual)using standard parameters.\n6 What constitute epidemiology Epidemiology includes:-1. The methods for measuring the health ofgroups and determining the attributesand exposures that influence health.2. The study of the occurrence of disease in its natural habitat rather than in the controlled environment of the laboratory.\n7 3. The methods for the quantitative study of the distribution, variation, and determinantsof health related outcomes in specificgroups (sub populations) of individuals, andthe application of this study to thediagnosis, treatment, and prevention ofdisease status or events.\n8 Evolution of epidemiology The evolution of medical sciences in itsearlier phase was based on curativemedicine. The primary objective was to curea patient of his illness. Doctors in historicaltimes looked at their patients as ill peoplewho needed some treatment.\n9 Thus medical science was individual oriented. But gradually it became evidentthat better human health could be achievedby prevention of diseases rather than bycure.\n10 A Historical Sketch A Long sketch of time ran for more than 2 millennia from Hippocrates ( B.C.) tothe first third of 19th century.Hippocrates developed the medicalapproach by providing concise, accurate andcomplete description of actual clinical cases.\n11 An Italian clinician called Bernardino Ramazzini in 1700 moved from observation ofclinical cases to the consideration of ‘workcircumstances’ in similar cases. He is nowregarded as the founder of occupationalmedicine. (Explained in his book. “De MorbisArtificum Diatriba”).\n12 The major step forward in epidemiology occurred in 1662 The major step forward in epidemiology occurred in John Graunt analyzed the weekly reports of births and deaths in London.For the first time in the history, a quantified pattern of disease, deaths and births was Found. John Graunt is regarded as the founder of demography now.His observations were published in hisbook. Named “ the nature and politicalobservations made upon the bills of Mortality”.\n13 After two centuries William Farr (1839) a physician was given the responsibility formedical statistics in England and Wales. Heset up a system for routine compilation of vitalstatistics and application of data for evaluationof deaths.\n14 Hippocrates, Ramzinni, Graunt and Farr contributed to the understanding of diseasefrequency and distribution.Another British physician John Snowformulated and tested a hypothesis concerningthe origins of an epidemic of cholera in Londonon the basis of available descriptive data.\n15 Snow postulated that cholera was transmitted by contaminated water. (thenunknown mechanism)He observed that death rates from Cholera were particularly high in certain areas of London.Those areas were supplied with waterby two water companies namely “Lambeth”and “Southwark & Vauxhall” in Both thecompanies that time drew water from riverThemes at a point heavily polluted with sewage.\n16 The Lambeth company then changed its source to an area of Themes where the waterwas quite free from sewage of London.The rate of cholera deaths then declined inthose areas suppied by Lambeth company.\n17 Death rates from cholera According to water company supplying sub districts of London Population in 1851Cholera deaths inDeaths per 100,000 livingSouthwark and VauxhallBoth companiesLambeth167, 654301, 14914, 6321921820011460\n18 Concepts of epidemiology Definitions“Epidemiology is defined as the study of thedistribution and determinants of health relatedstatus or events in specified populations andthe application of this study to control the healthproblems” (Last 1988)\n19 Applications of epidemiology The epidemiology is useful in:1. Search of cause/causes of disease/diseases.2. Helps to describe the health status ofpopulation or groups.3. Helps to discover and bridge gaps innatural history of diseases.\n20 4. Helps in controlling the diseases. To break the weakest link in chain of transmission ofcommunicable diseases and reducing noncommunicable diseases.5. Helps in planning of health programs onevidence basis and setting up of healthpriorities.6. Helps to evaluate health programs andinterventions.\n21 7. Helps to determine the chances or probability of occurrence of disease/deaths and disability8. Helps in better management of healthservices and hospital services.9. Helps to set-up cut-off levels betweennormal and abnormal population andestablish trigger levels for action orintervention.\n22 Sources of epidemiological Measurements 1. Cross sectional surveys2. Medical records3. Death certificate4. Census5. Organizational data\n23 Domains of epidemiology Descriptive epidemiologyDescriptive epidemiology is the most Basic form of epidemiology. It is concerned with the description of the patterns of occurrence of health-related status or events in groups.The determination of frequency and distribution of disease, incidence, prevalence, and mortality rates are included in descriptive epidemiology.\n24 Analytical epidemiology Analytical epidemiology is based on theobservations made in the descriptiveepidemiology. The design, execution andanalysis of subjects between groups helpsevaluate potential association between riskfactors and health outcomes to answer thequestion “why?”.\n25 Analytical epidemiology consists of two types of research processes 1. Observational process2. Experimental studies\n26 Basic triads of descriptive and analytical epidemiology There are two different triads (3 essentialcomponents) considered in studying differentsections\n28 Triad of descriptive epidemiology TimeChanging or stableSeasonal variationsSecular trends (long-term study ofincidence)Point source or propagatedCyclical variations (spikes ofincidences at regular intervals)\n29 Triad of descriptive epidemiology PlaceGeographically restricted or widespreadRelation to water and food supplyMultiple cluster involvement or oneRural/Urban distribution\n30 Triad of descriptive epidemiology PersonAgeSocio economic statusGenderEthnicity / RaceBehavior\n31 Triad of analytical epidemiology AgentNutrientsPoisonsAllergensRadiationPhysical traumaMicrobesPsychological factors\n32 Triad of analytical epidemiology Host factorsGenetic factorsImmunologic stateAgePersonal behavior\n33 Triad of analytical epidemiology EnvironmentOvercrowdingAtmospheric changesModes of transmissionVectorVehicleReservoir\n34 This forms the basis of clinical epidemiology. When periodic observations are made overa long period of time in patients with a widespectrum of clinical manifestations of thedisease, a complete profile of the naturalhistory of the disease may be obtained.This forms the basis of clinical epidemiology.\n35 Epidemiology of diseases Sri Lanka is said to be facing a doubledisease burden due to communicable and noncommunicable diseases (NCD) today.What is triple burden???\n36 The diseases burden in the country is given in terms of (apart from basic measures)1.Years of potential life lost2.Life expectancy free from disability3. Disability adjusted life years lost – DALYs4.Quality adjusted life years lost - QUALYsloss per 1000 population.Country has to fight to control communicableand non communicable diseases.\n37 Epidemiology of communicable diseases (CCD) Definition :- Communicable diseaseA communicable or infectious disease is anillness caused by transmission of a specificinfectious agent or its toxic products from aninfected person or animal to a susceptiblehost, either directly or indirectly through anintermediate animal host, vector or inanimateenvironment (Last 1995)\n39 What is an Epidemic? It is the occurrence of cases of illness, specific health related behavior or otherhealth related events clearly in excess ofnormal expectancy in a community or region.\n40 An Endemic disease A disease that usually present in a population or given area at a relatively highprevalence and incidence rates in comparedto other areas.E.g.

Rise in life expectancy and increasing number of senior citizens.2. Changing life styles: Faulty diet, use ofalcohol, sedentary life-physical inactivityand rising stress-leading to obesity andstress related problems.\n62 3. Exposure to environmental risk factors-air pollution.4. Use of tobacco5. Increasing population and rise inautomobiles and trauma incidence.\n63 Implications In view of the chronic morbidity and high cost involve in the management of non-communicable diseases attention need to befocused on prevention, early detection andappropriate management. Further, thesediseases cause lot of disability anddependency and disease burden.\n64 Multi - factorial origin Causes of NCD are multi-factorial.

It is spread when a person eats food or drinks water that has come in contact with infected stool.Sometimes a group of people who eat at the same restaurant can get hepatitis A. This can happen when an employee with hepatitis A doesn't wash his or her hands well after using the bathroom and then prepares food.The disease can also spread in day care centers. Workers can spread the virus if they don't wash their hands well after changing a diaper.Some things can raise your risk of getting hepatitis A, such as eating raw oysters or undercooked clams. If you're traveling in a country where hepatitis A is common, you can lower your chances of getting the disease by avoiding uncooked foods and untreated tap water.\n45 Hepatitis BHepatitis B: Hepatitis B is a virus that infects the liver.

{"question":"How many runners participated in the 2017 Athens Authentic Marathon?","answer":"18,500 runners participated in the 2017 Athens Authentic Marathon, many of them aware of the story of Pheidippides/Philippides and wanting to retrace his famous run from Marathon to Athens.","context":["Around The World With William Barnes: Part 2 - Greece\nByron, Barnes, Hardy - Athens and the Influence of Greek Culture\nLord Byron is still generally held in high esteem in Greece. Greek academics can sometimes be ambivalent about his private perceptions and critical comments, as revealed in his letters rather than in his poems.\nThose Greek scholars who are familiar with the works of William Barnes have tended to perceive him as an Anglo-Saxon language fanatic, hostile to the Greek language, a kind of linguistic nationalist or purist vocabulary-cleanser who wanted to eradicate or purge all traces of the Greek and Latin languages from the English language - albeit with the intention of making it more understandable to the less highly-educated reader or listener.\nSo why was I thinking about Byron, Barnes and Hardy when I was in Athens in November 2017, primarily to watch the beginning and ending of the 42.195kms Athens Authentic Marathon? My daughter had flown in from Washington DC to run in the marathon (like 18,500 other runners, many of them conscious of the story of Pheidippides/Philippides, determined to retrace his famous run from Marathon to Athens). In the words of Robert Browning (Pheidippides):\nUnforeseeing one! Yes, he fought on the Marathon day:\nSo, when Persia was dust, all cried \"To Akropolis!\nRun, Pheidippides, one race more! the meed is thy due!\n'Athens is saved, thank Pan,' go shout!\" He flung down his shield,\nRan like fire once more....\nThe 2017 marathon provided the ideal opportunity for us to get together, to show our support, and to explore the centre of Athens. I had had little time to wander around the city when I was working there in the summer of 1985, when Athens was celebrating its role as the Cultural Capital of Europe.\nLord Byron’s legacy may be valued more highly in Greece than that of any other British poet, but both Barnes and Hardy studied Greek literature (Hardy was interested in Hellenic traditions and he was particularly influenced by Aeschylus and Sophocles and the other Ancient Greek dramatists; he also translated a fragment of Sappho); William Barnes had a good knowledge of the Greek language (Ancient and New Testament Greek, rather than the Modern Greek or Romaic that Byron soon picked up in the country). Two editions of his poems carry quotations in the Ancient Greek of the bucolic poets Theocritus and Moschus on the title pages. Barnes must have admired them, and wanted to emulate them.\nContemporary British poets like Tony Harrison have carried on this tradition, which may be traced back to George Chapman and even earlier (Chapman’s translations of The Iliad and The Odyssey were first published in complete form in 1616; publication had begun in instalments in 1598).\nWilliam Barnes demonstrated his knowledge of Greek on pages 235-237 of\n\"A philological grammar, grounded upon English and formed from a comparison of more than sixty languages. Being an introduction to the science of grammar and a help to grammars of all languages, especially English, Latin and Greek, 1854.\"\n?n An Outline of English Speech-Craft, Barnes seems to favour the clarity and precision of the Greek over the English language when he comments on the challenges of translating the Greek Gospel into English.\n“It seems that much wrong is done to the Greek of the Gospel by the putting, for the same Greek word, sundry English ones at sundry passages; and by what right do we try an Evangelist’s or an Apostle’s wisdom in the use of the same word, by which he must have meant to give the same meaning? Or why should we make him to mean by ??????, at one time, a trying of a soul and at another time a fordooming of him?”\nAll three poets (Byron, Barnes and Hardy) had an informed interest in archaeology and architecture generally, but also in ancient Greek architecture. When I was Acting Representative of The British Council in Greece during the celebrations and events for the “Cultural Capital of Europe” in 1985, I did of course visit the Acropolis and other archaeological sites, but my workload was very heavy and I had little leisure time to explore the city. A highlight of the British cultural contribution was the remarkable, high-energy, open-air performance of Shakespeare’s Coriolanus at the Herodus Atticus Theatre in Athens. In Sir Ian’s own words:\n“In September 1985, after 102 performances on the South Bank, we did two open-air performances below the Acropolis at the Herodus Atticus Theatre in Athens. I was exhausted by the part, although not with it. Playing Shakespeare to 6000 in the open air, with inadequate amplification and chasing up and down ancient steep and deep stairs between the throng, with banner and sword aloft, is a young man's game. During the final show I drank five litres of water and a jar of Greek honey that I filched from Greg Hicks. Even so, after it was over I leant against the backstage wall unable to move and I was half-carried back to the dressing-room and an ouzo. That is the day I first felt mortality as an actor - not that I gave into it”.\nBarnes and Hardy never visited Greece (except in the virtual sense through their wide reading), but both of them had a serious interest in Greek architecture.\nO noble art! how greatly I delight\nIn noble works of thy gigantic hand!\nThe lofty columns' massy shafts, that stand\nBeneath entablatures of stately height;\nThe tap'ring spire that reaches out of sight;\nThe lofty roof; with arches that expand\nTo dumb-beholden width; and windows grand\nAnd glorious with many-colour'd light!\nO noble art! how long thy works out-dwell\nThe sons of men! The piles that linger still\nIn early-citied Egypt's rainless clime,\nAnd on the holy soil of Greece, will tell\nHow masterly thou workest, since thy skill\nCan mock the working of all-wasting time.\n(Bernard Jones gives the final line as “So braves the working of all-wasting time”).\nInÂ Athens in November, 2017, I was particularly interested to view the Lysicrates Choragic Monument, and the site of the Capuchin Monastery where Byron had stayed in 1810-1811, where he wrote The Curse of Minerva, in March 1811.\nWe were fortunate to be able to spend time at the stunning new Acropolis Museum. From our hotel roof garden, and from the top of Lycabettus Hill, the views of the Parthenon were truly spectacular. I revisited the Areopagus (the rocky Hill of Ares), amongst other sites.\nThomas Hardy wrote two important poems concerning the Parthenon Marbles and about the ‘echoes’ of the sermon given by the Apostle Paul at the Areopagus;\nIn The British Museum\n'What do you see in that time-touched stone,\nWhen nothing is there\nBut ashen blankness, although you give it\nA rigid stare?\n'You look not quite as if you saw,\nBut as if you heard,\nParting your lips, and treading softly\nAs mouse or bird.\n'It is only the base of a pillar, they'll tell you,\nThat came to us\nFrom a far old hill men used to name\n- 'I know no art, and I only view\nA stone from a wall,\nBut I am thinking that stone has echoed\nThe voice of Paul,\n'Paul as he stood and preached beside it\nFacing the crowd,\nA small gaunt figure with wasted features,\nCalling out loud\n'Words that in all their intimate accents\nThat marble front, and were far reflected,\nAnd then were gone.\n'I'm a labouring man, and know but little,\nOr nothing at all;\nBut I can't help thinking that stone once echoed\nThe voice of Paul.'\nChristmas in the Elgin Room\nBritish Museum: Early Last Century\n‘What is the noise that shakes the night,\nAnd seems to soar to the Pole-star height?’\n– ‘Christmas bells,\nThe watchman tells\nWho walks this hall that blears us captives with its blight.’\n‘And what, then, mean such clangs, so clear?’\n‘– ’Tis said to have been a day of cheer,\nAnd source of grace\nTo the human race\nLong ere their woven sails winged us to exile here.\n‘We are those whom Christmas overthrew\nSome centuries after Pheidias knew\nHow to shape us\nAnd bedrape us\nAnd to set us in Athena’s temple for men’s view.\n‘O it is sad now we are sold –\nWe gods! for Borean people’s gold,\nAnd brought to the gloom\nOf this gaunt room\nWhich sunlight shuns, and sweet Aurore but enters cold.\nRather than quote Lord Byron’s harsh and uncompromising assessment of Lord Elgin, I refer readers to The Curse of Minerva\nOn the Trail of Byron in Greece\n10:30 till 12:00\nAnnual Service of Remembrance of William Barnes\n15:00 till 16:30\nRambling with Dorset Poetry and Song\n11:00 till 16:00\nThe Thomas Hardy Victorian Fair\n11:00 till 17:00\nSturminster Newton Literary Festival\n10:00 till 16:15\nHistoric Church Tours 2019 - Dorset Inspirations\n12:30 till 17:00\nYetminster Street Fair"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:3441d292-a54d-47e7-a322-19dbca8a76aa>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How does Theravada Buddhism affect mental state and where is it practiced today?","answer":"Theravada Buddhism is predominantly practiced in Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Thailand, Laos, and Burma. According to research by NUS, Theravada meditation creates a relaxed state in practitioners by activating the parasympathetic system. The meditation style emphasizes relaxation, and it's considered an exoteric teaching that anyone can learn. Theravada practitioners aim to achieve freedom from suffering and liberation from mental afflictions primarily for themselves.","context":["Seated but immense, with his eyes closed in meditation and reflection, the giant, austere statues of the Great Buddha look over a population of adherents that stretches from Indonesia to Russia and from Japan to the Middle East. His gentle philosophy also appeals to many believers scattered all over the world.\nSomewhere between 500 million and 1 billion people worldwide are estimated to be Buddhists.\nIt’s exactly the nebulous nature of Buddha’s philosophy, crisscrossed by many sects of adherents with a dizzying assortment of beliefs and approaches to the faith, that makes it so difficult to estimate exactly how many Buddhists there are. Some scholars go so far as to refuse to define Buddhism as a religion at all, and prefer to refer to it as a personal philosophy, a way of life, rather than a true theology.\nTwo and a half centuries ago, a boy named Siddhartha Gautama was born into a royal family in a rural backwater in the northeast corner of the Indian subcontinent, in modern-day Nepal. An astrologer told the boy’s father, King Suddhodana, that when the child grew he would either become a king or a monk depending on his experience in the world. Intent on forcing the issue, Siddhartha’s father never let him see the world outside the walls of the palace, a virtual prisoner until he was 29 years old. When he finally ventured forth into the real world, he was touched by the suffering of the ordinary people he encountered.\nSiddhartha dedicated his life to ascetic contemplation until he achieved “enlightenment,” a feeling of inner peace and wisdom, and adopted the title of “Buddha.” For over forty years he crisscrossed India on foot to spread his Dharma, a set of guidelines or laws for behaviors for his followers.\nWhen Buddha died in 483 BC, his religion was already prominent throughout central India. His word was spread by monks seeking to become arhats, or holy men. Arhats believed they could reach Nirvana, or perfect peace, in this lifetime by living an ascetic life of contemplation. Monasteries dedicated to the memory of Buddha and his teachings became prominent in large Indian cities like Vaishali, Shravasti, and Rajagriha.\nShortly after Buddha’s death, his most prominent disciple called a meeting of five hundred Buddhist monks. At this assembly, all of Buddha’s teachings, or sutras, as well as all the rules Buddha had set down for life in his monasteries, were read aloud to the congregation. All of this information together forms the core of Buddhist scripture to this day.\nWith a defined way of life outlined for all his disciples, Buddhism spread throughout the rest of India. Differences in interpretation crept in as the number of adherents grew distant from each other. One hundred years after the first great assembly, another was convened to try to iron out their differences, with little unity but no animosity, either. By the third century BC, eighteen separate schools of Buddhist thought were at work in India, but all the separate schools recognized each other as fellow adherents of Buddha’s philosophy.\nA third council was convened in the third century BC, and a sect of the Buddhist called the Sarvastivadins migrated west and established a home in the city of Mathura. Over the intervening centuries their disciples have dominated religious thought throughout much of central Asia and Kashmir. Their descendants form the core of the current-day schools of Tibetan Buddhism.\nThe Third Emperor of the Mauryan Empire, Ashoka, became a supporter of the Buddhist religion. Ashoka and his descendants used their power to build monasteries and spread Buddhist influence into Afghanistan, great swathes of central Asia, Sri Lanka, and beyond into Thailand, Burma, Indonesia, and then China, Korea, and Japan. These pilgrimages went as far as Greece in the east, where it spawned a hybrid of Indo-Greek Buddhism\nOver the centuries, Buddhist thought continued to spread and splinter, with innumerable changes added to its scriptures by a multitude of authors. During the three centuries of the Gupta period, Buddhism reigned supreme and unchallenged throughout India. But then, in the sixth century, invading hordes of Huns raged across India and destroyed hundreds of Buddhist monasteries. The Huns were opposed by a series of kings that defended the Buddhists and their monasteries, and for four hundred years the Buddhists thrived once again in northeastern India.\nDuring the Middle Ages, a great, muscular religion appeared from the deserts of the Middle East to challenge Buddhism. Islam spread quickly east, and by the late Middle Ages Buddhism was wiped almost completely from the map of India. It was the end of the expansion of Buddhism.\nBuddhism today is represented by three main strains that cover distinct geographical areas.\n- Theravada Buddhism- Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Thailand, Laos, And Burma\n- Mahayana Buddhism- Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, Vietnam, and China\n- Tibetan Buddhism- Mongolia, Nepal, Bhutan, Tibet, a bit of Russia, and parts of northern India\nSince Buddhist thought is more of a personal philosophy than a well-defined creed, it has always invited an enormous multitude of interpretations. This continual churning of thought in Buddhist thought continues into the present day with contemporary Buddhist movements with names like Neo-Buddhism, Engaged Buddhism, and an array of truly tiny, and sometimes, literally individual traditions in the West.\nIn the latter half of the 20th century, a movement of Japanese Buddhists calling themselves the Value Creation Society sprang up and spread to neighboring countries. The members of this Soka Gakkai movement are not monks, but consist solely of lay members interpreting and meditating on Buddha’s legacy on their own, centuries after Siddhartha first stepped foot outside his palace walls and looked on the world that he felt need his call for peace, contemplation, and harmony.","Reaching Different States Of Mind\nby Joyce Teo\nStudy shows that practising certain forms of Buddhist meditation influences human physiology and behaviour differently.\nMeditation has long been associated with stress relief, but a recent study by researchers from the National University of Singapore (NUS) has shown that the meditation practised in Vajrayana Buddhism, which is predominant in Tibet, can enhance brain performance.\nIt also demonstrated for the first time that the meditation styles done according to Vajrayana and Theravada traditions influenced human physiology and behaviour differently. The former creates a state of arousal while the latter creates a relaxed state.\nIn contrast to relaxation, arousal is a physiological and psychological state of being awake or responsive to stimuli, say the researchers.\nVajrayana Vs Theravada\nThe Theravada form of Buddhism is dominant in Southern Asia. The meditation done in that tradition has been shown in previous studies to lead to a relaxed state.\nIn the Vajrayana tradition, the meditation done is a “really active kind of meditation” and the monks feel really refreshed after it, said Associate Professor Maria Kozhevnikov from the department of psychology at NUS’ faculty of arts and social sciences, who conducted the study with her colleague, Dr Ido Amihai.\nReferring to their findings, she added: “Expert meditators were able to boost their cognitive performance after just one meditation session. It resulted in an expanded awareness state that may last for about half an hour.”\nBoth Theravada and Vajrayana traditions use various types of meditation techniques. They may sometimes be similar.\nWhat Prof Kozhevnikov showed in the study was that “despite some surface similarities between the practices of both traditions, Vajrayana aims to bring about a state of arousal (sympathetic system activation) while Theravada aims to bring about a state of relaxation (parasympathetic system activation)”.\n“Theravada is exoteric teaching, so anyone can learn it; while Vajrayana involves esoteric, secret teachings. The latter requires taking vows, initiations and meditation practice,” said Prof Kozhevnikov.\nIn addition, during the teaching of Theravada styles of meditation, the teachers usually emphasise the importance of relaxation, while in the Vajrayana tradition, teachers emphasise the state of “wakefulness”, she said.\nThe difference between the Theravada and Vajrayana meditation practices lies with the motivation of the practitioner, said Ms Alma Ayon, a meditation teacher who is currently based in Nepal.\n“The Theravada practitioner aims to be free from suffering and to be liberated from mental afflictions and ignorance, mainly for himself.” she explained.\n“The Vajrayana practitioner also aims to achieve the same freedom from suffering and enlightenment, but he does so for the benefit of all beings by using the methods that can lead them to enlightenment in one lifetime, in order to help liberate other beings from their suffering.”\nThe Science Behind It\nProf Kozhevnikov, who is from Ukraine but had spent much of her life in the United States, started her research a decade ago.\nHer interest was piqued after she participated in a Life and Mind meeting in Boston, where the Dalai Lama and Tibetan scholars met with Western neuroscientists for a dialogue about the mind and brain.\nFor the study, she and Dr Amihai collected electrocardiographic (EKG) and electroencephalographic (EEG) responses from experienced Theravada practitioners form Thailand and Nepal, as well as top Vajrayana practitioners from Nepal.\nAn EKG records the heart’s electrical activity while and EEG measures and records the electrical activity of the brain.\nThe duo also measured the monks’ behavioural performance on cognitive tasks and observed a dramatic increase in performance on cognitive tasks, such as memory tests, immediately after Vajrayana styles of meditation, but not for the other type of meditation.\nThe findings suggest that Vajrayana meditation could be especially useful in situations where it is important to perform at one’s best, such as during a competition.\nThe researchers are planning to investigate whether permanent enhancement to the brain could occur after long-term practice.\nThey are also looking at how non-practitioners can benefit from such meditative practices.\n“Vajrayana meditation typically requires years of practice, so we are looking into whether it is possible to acquire the beneficial effects of brain performance by practising only certain essential elements of meditation,” said Prof Kozhevnikov.\n“This would provide an effective and practical method for non-practitioners to quickly increase brain performance in times of need.”"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"non_native_learner"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:246d670b-9d1b-4646-b375-2da0a98e1c56>","<urn:uuid:346fa1f9-aabf-4792-89f6-4e671433b5f5>"],"error":null}

This brings us to the final.\n7th. Boxing - and so on - a rare life of sport and fun.\n15th. September. Anniversary of my first show, two years ago, at Martinpuich on the Somme.\n16th. Boxing. Was beaten by Pullen, an R.E.\n19th. Fine dinner at PreChatelaine with Neame, our O.C. Platoon, a major in the Artist's Rifles.\nFriday 20th. Guest night at the School - terrific scenes - the band - the champagne - the speeches - Burnet - Neame's promotion - rushing the band - dancing on the tables - chairing the Commandant - the names of those who weren't drunk easily counted.\nLearned that my name had been singled out several days before from amongst the 150 officers at the school for retention as an instructor. It was submitted to Army H.Q. but Army would not allow it as the 15th. Div. is no longer in First Army. Am quite glad. Also heard that I was being very strongly recommended for Staff duties. Seems to me there is no chance of this happening as there are so many senior captains in my own battalion now that I can't even get a company for myself.\nIt has struck me that our instructing officers at the School here are, with a few exceptions unable to inspire any confidence in one. So few of them have ever seen any actual fighting. Some have never been in the trenches for more than a week.\nSunday 22nd. Early train. Up to St. Pol with Bob Semple and Brown, two pals at my school. Reached Calonne-Ricquart at 8 p.m. and billeted with Green of our regiment.\nMonday 23rd. Rejoined Battalion details at Noeux-les-Mines. All well. Found Bennett, our old Q.M. and Major Kirsop. Battalion is now in the line at Hulluch and Loos, near where it was in September 1915. Sgt. Mitchell, my dour, old, trusted signaller sergeant, has been killed in a raid on 19th., after 3 1/2 years very active, courageous service. Poor beggar! A few officers wounded after a successful raid by the Bn. Coogan and McAinsh did well. Prosser gone away for instructional duties. I wonder what they will do with me!\nI heard from Bennett, the late Q.M. of the 11th. Bn. that after I had come out of the first show at Ypres last year (where I was with the stretcher parties) that a deputation from amongst the men, headed by Sergeant McQuarrie of 'D' Coy. waited on the C.O. at Orderly Room (i.e. Colonel Duncan) and said they had come to ask if I might be recommended for gallantry while with them, as they thought I deserved it thoroughly. Duncan, of course, said this was too irregular for anything. This now brings back to my memory many complementary and sympathetic remarks by officers which I did not quite understand at the time. Well! It was better to be thought well of by the men than to receive any decoration at the hands of Colonel Duncan.\n24th. Took a cycle run up to the Battalion in the morning - H.Q. in the village of Loos. Stayed for the tour. Had a walk round companies. Very interesting place. Am to be signalling officer in the meantime. Played Vingt et un at night. Don't see any chance of promotion yet. Am full of beans and itching for work. I'd almost like a battle (Note from RLM, 1972: pseudo-euphoria?).\n25th. and 26th. Round line a lot. Now know it backwards. Great rumours that Boche is going back. We are going to try to hurry him.\nSaw figures for our casualties at Soissons - pretty high, but not half as bad as at Ypres. For the Division, figures are 165 officers and 3351 other ranks, of which 34 officers and 441 men were killed.\n27th. Conference. All excitement. Hope the Boche will move.\n28th. and 29th. More conferences and preparations. Camerons did a raid on our left but took no prisoners.\n30th. Am taking over from Captain Macleod as he is going on leave.\n1st. October, 1918. Fairly quiet day. Began again as acting Adjutant. Boche patrols pretty active at night. Got no sleep owing to continued calls. About 9.20 a.m. word came that Boche was going back in front of Hulluch. Our companies, headed by patrols, were moving forward an hour later.\nWe encountered resistance from Bois de Dix-Huit and Bois de Quatorze but made very good progress by manoevring. Our first and second objectives taken by 2 p.m. 'B' and 'C' Coys. in front, 'D' and 'A' in support. Mens' spirits rampant. Lord! How I have longed for this time. Kept splendidly busy. C.O. at advanced H.Q. Very few casualties.\nAt 6 p.m. I went along to fix up food, and then opened a new H.Q. in the old front line at 7 p.m. Busy night again. Messages coming and going. Water, food and ammunition parties. Very dark. No moon. No sleep. Our patrols worked into 3rd. objective during the night, chiefly owing to Nairn, who was topping. It was apparent in many ways that the Hun meant to hold his third line but our early move where we broke in and rolled up his flanks, upset him. Nairn's work was 'A.l.'. We got 12 prisoners, 7 machine guns, and killed 27 Boches. By 8 a.m. on 2nd. Oct. the 3rd. objective was ours all over, and patrols were working into Vendin. 'A' and 'D' went through 'B' and 'C' at 11 a.m. Lord, it was grand!\nMuch sniping. Capt. Billy Irvine on the right simply in his element. People further to the right somewhat slow - opposition from a switch line held them up slightly. Bn. H.Q. to Bois de Quatorze at 11 a.m. Relieved at night by Royal Scots. Our total casualties 5 killed and about 20 wounded.\nBack to Loos on 3rd/4th. Grand feed on arrival at old dressing station. Bed at 1 a.m. on 4th. Slept like a log for 8 hours. Bumph all day.\n6th. Boche asked for armistice. Hurrah! Hope we don't give it until we reach the Rhine.\n7th. to 9th. Having a good time.\n10th. Bn. relieved in Loos by K.O.S.B. Came down to Mazingarbe in daylight to a fair billet.\n11th. Discussed staff appointment with C.O. and Bde. Major. Will probably remain with the Bn. especially as war is near an end.\n13th. Colonel Wilson's birthday! - a big splash. (Note from RLM, 1972: He never disclosed his age to anyone. I guess he might be 2 or 3 years older than myself.). Bed very late.\n14th. Busy day. Dined with 'D' Coy. Billy Irvine is going home for six months rest.\n15th. Warned to go up the line. Inspection by General Birdwood, G.O.C. 5th. Army. Was introduced to him afterwards. Moved off at 6 p.m. in hell of a hurry, via Vermelles, Hulluch, to Bienfontaine. Arrived at 9 p.m. Cold night. 44th. and 46th. Brigades are moving forward.\n16th. Oct. A day of tremendous rumours. One order followed and contradicted another in quick succession. Finally it was decided to march via Vendin-le-Vieil and Pont ˆ Vendin where there was a great block in the traffic. Bridges broken. Dead horses. Huge mine craters. On to Estevelles and Evinoy which we reached at 4 p.m.\n17th. Passed through 44th. Brigade at dawn - through Bois d'Epins - Libercourt - then Wahagnies where I got bitten to death by mosquitos.\n18th. On again. Camerons in front, forming advance guard to Division. On again, always just failing to see Boche by two or three hours. Then to Doeux Ville, Loffrande and Chateau de Bloc, where we spent the night. Some machine gunning. Camerons held up.\n19th. Our turn for advance guard. Passed through Capelle, and several other places. Some opposition on the right, but on the whole it was child's play. Am enjoying this immensely. Am bang full up with work, but it's fine. I've a horse too, and I use it! H.Q. in the huge castle at Genech. Rode round the front line on horseback. (Note from RLM, 1972: Did I?).\n20th. Rested at Genech.\n21st. Off again at noon via Bercu to Mourchin, just short of the Scheldt Canal where evidently Boche was prepared to fight. Guns busier again.\n22nd. Easy day. Played football against the sergeants. Won by 5 goals to 2.\nPitiable scenes outside H.Q. with refugees. Appalling beyond all description. I feel bitter against the Hun, as never before. Our village is full of white-haired women, pale faced girls, and little mites of babies. Lorry after lorry has been passing through, with refugees, each piled high with a mass of suffering humanity, shawl-less women and babies. Some of the latter were even gassed. There were young women too who had been forced to work in the mines, and others who had been outraged. It was a never ending procession of the hungry, helpless, homeless and tired.\nI have seen some aspects of life since my last leave!\nI arrived back in France on March 14th, 1918, just in time to be in at the beginning of the Hun offensive on 21st. March, when he attacked us in great numerical superiority with more guns, and a heavier concentration of men, and materials, and aeroplanes than we had. I was then present when the evacuation of Monchy was ordered. Then again, I had the luck to be in it when the 3rd, 15th. and 4th. Divisions stopped his road to Arras, when we had no other reserves than the Divisional Cyclists and R.E.s - and even they were in the line - when everything looked black, and every Boche gun pointed to Paris (Note from RLM, 1972: Oh!).\nI was there when he made his last bid for that city, when the Division was hustled down to Champagne, and pitched into line at Compiegne, and where we had to carry out our counter-attacks on July 23rd. and succeeding days, which, carried on at every point of the line, have sent the enemy back over his much-vaunted Hindenburg line, cleared the coast of Belgium, and taken us into territory we have not seen since August, 1914. Now we have pushed forward over the Loos Battlefield of 1915, past Lens and Lille, and up to the gates of Tournai. In all my experience there has not been such an eventful period. It has been great for a mere schoolboy like myself to be present during these great shows.\nAt night, in the midst of a tremendous argument about the League of Nations, Macleod suddenly blew back from leave.\n24th. Handed over to him. Left Mouchin at 3 p.m. Stopped a corps car which took me to Corps H.Q. at Thurmerses, got a corps car to Carvin, and then obtained an R.F.C. tender to Petit Sains, near Mazingarbe, where I had dinner.\n25th. Fine sleep. Walked to Noeux-les-Mines, via Bracquemont. Very few soldiers about. They have all gone forward. Car to Bethune. I'm now pretty good at stopping cars. Bethune is a pitiable spectacle - in ruins - like Ypres, a City of the Dead. One would think a destroying angel had passed over the town. A lorry to Lillers. An ambulance to Aire. R.F.C. tender to St. Omer where I had a fine lunch. Lorry to Guines, tramway to Calais which I reached about 4 p.m. Pretty good going for 24 hours! Got a room in Sauvage Hotel. Met Fyfe, Mackie, Eric Duncan, and best of all, Bobby Semple who stayed the night with me.\n26th. Embarked at 7 a.m. Changed the date of my leave warrant so that I got over the day before. After all I had signed it myself! (Note from RLM, 1972: I think!). Crossed over with all my souvenirs, and reached Dover at 11 a.m. Wired L.M.M. to meet me in London, but she went to the wrong place. Bath at Euston Hotel. Gati's for dinner. Chin Chin Chow at night. Nearly lost my train. Travelled up with Bob Semple to Carlisle. Arrived home at 9.20 a.m. on 27th. and met Father.\n9th. November 1918. Leave finished and it was good.\n10th. Met L.M.M. in London. Stormy day at Dover. Good tea as usual. Good dinner too! Great shouting in streets of Calais at night. News of Armistice.\n11th. November. Mobs rushing singing through the streets of at night. News of Armistice confirmed - Thank God!\nI set off again for the battalion, but stopped en route to give me a chance of finding the grave of my friend, John McIntosh, a gunner, killed at Neuve Chappelle. Found gun pits. No graves nearby.\n11th. NOVEMBER, 1918.\nPhotographs courtesy of Photos of the Great War website\nAn Adrian Helmet was a French regulation helmet named after its designer.\n- Did you know?","The Complete Guide to the British Peerage & Baronetage\nOrders of Chivalry and Merit\nThe British Orders of Chivalry and Merit\nOrders of Chivalry and Merit in Other Countries\nFalse Orders of Chivalry and Merit\nComparison between grades in British and Foreign Orders\nReligious Orders of Chivalry\nThe origins of Orders of Chivalry must be sought in the mediaeval organisations of the Catholic Church, whose religious orders, the monastic communities, formed the basis. The word \"Order\" comes from the Latin \"ordo\", which referred at that time to an association of a limited circle of persons who took upon themselves certain obligations and who subjected themselves to certain rules. At the time of the Crusades we see the rise of religious Orders amongst the crusading knights in the Holy Land, the main objects of which were to fight for the Christian Faith and to care for pilgrims and the sick. The best known of these are the Order of the Knights Templar, the Order of Malta and the Teutonic Knights, which all exercised considerable power and at times achieved great political influence.\nThese religious Orders of Chivalry were confirmed by the Pope and were directly subordinated to the Holy See, but otherwise they acted independently under the leadership of a Grand Master, elected for life by the knights and assisted by a chapter composed by the holders of the highest offices of the Order.\nFrom Religious to Temporal Orders of Chivalry\nOther Orders were founded apart from the three leading religious Orders of Chivalry referred to above. Some of these were founded in Spain, were the centuries' old battle against the Moors inspired the foundation of Orders which had the fight against the infidel as their main object. Among these were the Order of Alcantra (1156), the Order of Calatrava (1158), the Order of Aviz (1162), the Order of Sant' Iago (1170) and the Order of Monteza (1316), all of which still exist today. As the fight against the Moors was carried on by the rulers of the various kingdoms, these rulers became the natural focal point for the foundation of the Orders. It is true that the Orders were directly subordinated to the Holy See, but over the years, as the the various rulers gradually took over the offices of Grand Master and made them hereditary in their own families, the Orders became more dynastically dependent, although they maintained their religious character.\nThese Orders formed the link to the next large group, the Royal Knighthoods, also called the dynastic or temporal Orders of Chivalry.\nWith the change in the structure of society from Church power to royal power during the fourteenth century, a number of temporal Orders of Chivalry were founded all over Europe. Their object was no longer the fight against the infidel, but to strengthen the power and prestige of the kings. The kings themselves occupied the offices of Grand Master, but the meetings, the so-called Chapters, were still held in special chapels of the Orders in churches. Similarly the Orders, like the religious Orders of Chivalry, generally had a patron saint and sought papal confirmation.\nThe number of members in these temporal Orders of Chivalry was limited, and all were equal in one class. Admission was conditional upon noble birth, and initiation was conducted at a solemn ceremony including a vow of fidelity and the receiving of the accolade. The members wore a habit, and the insignia of the Order was often a jewel with a picture of the patron saint of the Order, worn on a chain or ribbon around the neck. Members who enjoyed these privileges were required to lead a blameless life, to support charity by giving large sums of money, to promote the prestige and power of the king, and always to bear the insignia of the Order. Originally membership of one Order excluded membership of another, at least as regards the Order against whose king one went to war.\nSeveral of these temporal Orders of Chivalry still exist today, for example the British Order of the Garter (1348), the Danish Order of the Elephant (1462) and the Swedish Order of the Seraphim (1748), although in many cases their original significance of membership of a society of chivalry with a strong religious basis has now changed to merely bearing the insignia of membership, the token of royal favour. The development of history has thus made these temporal Orders of Chivalry dating from the fourteenth century into a form of Order of Merit, although still highly exclusive, as opposed to those emerging around the year 1800 which were specifically founded as Orders of Merit.\nOrders of Merit\nOnce more a change in the structure of society affected the development of the Orders. The commune, which was consolidated by the French Revolution, wished initially to reward the citizen from a military point of view for his services in the fight for freedom, and later from a civilian point of view for his services for the benefit of the new society. Thus arose the Order purely for services or merit, of which the French Legion of Honour (1802), with its division in 1805 into five classes, became the prototype.\nIn the Legion of Honour, democracy made its entry into the world of chivalry. No longer was it a limited number of men of the most noble birth in the land who could receive honours from their king. The Orders of Merit became society's recognition of \"acknowledged worthiness of citizenship\", which the Head of State personifying society, be he King or President, could bestow on any citizen.\nDemocratization rapidly swept through all countries, either in the form of dividing existing Orders or one class into several classes - as was the case in 1808 in the Danish Order of the Dannebrog (1671) - or by founding new Orders of several classes. An actual division into classes, however, already existed before the French Revolution in the French Military Order of St Louis (1693), whose three classes were referred to as the Grand Cross, Commander and Knight. This became the pattern of the democratic Orders, which took over the division into classes as well as designations.\nOrders of Merit can be either purely military Orders or purely civil Orders or mixed Orders which have both military and civil divisions.\nAmong purely military Orders of Merit which still exist are the Swedish Order of the Sword (1522), the Dutch Military Order of William (1815) and the Finnish Order of the Liberty Cross (1918). The latter is peculiar in that, as with the German Iron Cross (1813), it can only be awarded in time of war, and in that it distinguishes between combatants and non-combatants. This was also the case with the Iron Cross before 1939. The greater number of the new Orders founded after the Second World War in communist countries are solely military Orders.\nIn countries having purely civil Orders of Merit, the civil field is often divided into several categories with a separate Order for each. For example, in Sweden the Order of the Northern Star (1748) is awarded for the humanities and for official services, and the Order of Vasa (1772) for commercial services. In the years just before and after the Second World War a marked division took place in France, in that individual Ministries each awarded its own Order. These Ministerial Orders, however, were, with one exception, later absorbed into the new National Order of Merit (1964).\nIn countries having several civil Orders of Merit which may be awarded for the same category of services, it is the qualitative side of the question which decides the Order to be awarded. For example, the Legion of Honour (1802) is awarded in France for eminent services, and the National Order of Merit (1964) for distinguished services. In Finland, a similar distinction is made between the Order of the White Rose of Finland (1919) and the Order of the Lion of Finland (1942).\nAmong the mixed Orders of Merit are the Belgian Order of Leopold (1832) which in addition to a civil and a military division also has a naval division, the Norwegian Order of St Olaf (1847), the British Order of Merit (1902) and the former Czechoslovak Order of the White Lion (1922). The military divisions of the mixed Orders of Merit are characteristic in that the otherwise common insignia are provided with crossed swords. The papal Order of St Gregory the Great (1831), however, uses a trophy instead of the crossed swords, and in the Order of the British Empire (1917) an extra band in the otherwise common riband indicates the military division. The British Order of the Bath (1725) is exceptional in that its divisions each have their own insignia.\nOrders for Science and Art\nSeveral civil Orders of Merit are also awarded for deserving services to science and art. Special decorations for service in this field were, however, founded quite early on, for example the French Palms in Gold and Silver (1808) which was extended in 1945 into an Order of three classes. Similar decorations are found in Germany, such as the Order \"Pour le Mérite\" for Science and Art (1842) and in Austria the Insignia of Honour and the Cross of Honour for Science and Art (1955). When in 1964 the award of Ministerial Orders ceased in France, the Order of \"Arts et Lettres\" (1957) was retained as the exception. Apart from scientific and artistic services, this may also be awarded for literary services.\nWhere the Royal Knighthoods, because of the influence of the State in the choice of those to be honoured, gradually took on the character of State Orders, the Royal Houses often founded special Family Orders, partly as a reward for services rendered to the King personally or to his family, and partly as a sign of mutual alliance when they were conferred on other Sovereigns and their families. Such Family Orders still existing include the British Royal Victorian Order (1896), the Dutch Order of the Family of Orange (1905) and the Greek Order of St George and St Constantine (1936). One and the same Family Order is sometimes conferred by several Sovereign whose Houses are related, for example, the Luxemburg Order of the Golden Lion of the House of Nassau (1859), which can be conferred by the House of Orange in the Netherlands.\nSocialist Orders of State\nIn about the year 1900, another change in the structure of society affected the development of the system of Orders. First, the Soviet Union, and after the Second World War the new so-called Democratic People's Republics, abolished the existing system of Orders which had been built up on the original chivalrous concept. In their place, a number of new State Orders were founded. It is true that the designation \"Order\" was maintained, but the division into classes was now designated by a simple number rather than the old Grand Cross, Commander or Knight. These include, in the Soviet Union the Order of Lenin (19300 and the Order of Honour (1943), in Roumania the Order of the Star of the Roumanian People's Republic (1948), in Bulgaria the Order of \"Georgi Dimitrov\" (1950) and in Hungary the Order of Merit of the People's Republic of Hungary (1953).\nOnly in Poland and Czechoslovakia have or had a few of the old Orders been maintained in a different form: for example, the Order \"Virtuti Militari\" (1792) in Poland, and in Czechoslovakia the Order of the White Lion (1922).\nLast updated 3 Jul 2012\nã Copyright: Heraldic Media Limited.

{"question":"Could you explain how the bubonic plague theory of the Black Death is challenged, and what evidence links climate changes to historical disease outbreaks like this pandemic?","answer":"The bubonic plague theory of the Black Death faces several challenges: medieval symptoms don't match modern plague symptoms, the mortality rate was higher than expected for bubonic plague (which has 60% mortality untreated), the disease spread too quickly for a flea-based transmission, and there's no evidence of the prerequisite rat die-off. Additionally, the disease remained active in winter despite fleas requiring warm temperatures. Regarding climate's role in disease outbreaks, historical evidence shows that climate changes can trigger disease spread, as demonstrated in Central Asia where temperature changes caused marmots to become more active, leading to increased human contact and helping spread the bubonic plague to Europe. Climate changes have historically contributed to disease vulnerability through food crises and population movements, as seen in the 14th century when climate-induced Great Famine (1315-1322) weakened Europe's population before the Black Death struck.","context":["Was the Black Death a Virus?\nTextbooks tell us that the bubonic plague caused the Black Death. But not everyone is convinced. Since 1984, scientists have put forward alternative explanations for the Black Death. For example, sociologist Susan Scott and biologist Christopher J. Duncan claim that a hemorrhagic fever, similar to the Ebola virus, caused the Black Death. And others blame anthrax or say that some now-extinct disease was the culprit.\nBubonic plague just doesn't make sense, they argue. The symptoms, the high mortality rate, the speed at which the disease spread, and the way the disease spread -- none of it jibes with typical bubonic plague.\nMedieval accounts of symptoms don't match the symptoms of modern-day bubonic plague, either. Accounts describe buboes covering the entire body. But today, buboes would most commonly show up in the groin area, and aren't likely to spread all over the body. Additionally, medieval accounts mention awful odors, bruise-like splotches and disrupted nervous systems that resulted in delirium and stupor -- none of this happens with modern-day bubonic plague.\nIf the Black Death was caused by the bubonic plague, then the mortality rate was much higher than it should have been, they argue. The bubonic plague is fairly curable; even untreated, bubonic plague has a mortality rate of about 60 percent [source: Kelly]. If mostly everyone affected died, some feel that a hemorrhagic fever, with no cure, was the more likely culprit.\nProponents of these new theories also point out that bubonic plague usually moves very slowly. But the Black Death swept across Europe at enormous speed, especially given the fact that transportation was pretty undeveloped at the time. A hemorrhagic fever, in comparison, has a longer incubation period, in which people are contagious, but not yet symptomatic. People might have spent that incubation period traveling, inadvertently spreading the fever more rapidly. Writings from the Black Death also indicate that people were extremely contagious, so much so that people were scared to be in the same town as the infected. But modern-day plague outbreaks are nowhere near as contagious.\nVirus advocates find other problems with the rat-and-flea bacterial infection theory. Since fleas only attack humans after all rat hosts have died, then there should have been a large die-off of rats before the Black Death. There's no evidence for a rat disappearance. Additionally, fleas require high temperatures and humidity to survive, which means that the plague should have essentially died out in winter months. It did not.\nNone of this reasoning has won over the scientific community yet. It's difficult to truly know what the Black Death was like. The only evidence we have are the written accounts of the time, and these accounts provide few details. Obviously, the people who wrote them didn't use our technical language for diagnosing and describing diseases. What they described as a tumor may not have been a tumor at all, by our modern-day medical standards.\nTo learn more about the Black Death and its aftermath, take a look at the links that follow.\nRelated HowStuffWorks Articles\nMore Great Links\n- Barris, Colin. \"Black Death casts a genetic shadow over England.\" New Scientist, August 2007.

Most scientists agree with this. But the debate about the speed of change and the impact of climatic metamorphosis on people does not subside. Surprisingly, the answers to questions about how climate change will affect our future may lie in the past, especially if it concerns the health of the inhabitants of the planet.\nAll these moments, the Australian health expert Anthony McMichael was going to raise in his book “Climate change and the health of nations: hunger, fever and the fate of the population.” McMichael suddenly died in 2014, not having completed his work. It was supplemented by epidemiologist Alistair Woodward. He explained how man-made global warming differs from climate change, which naturally took place in the past; Why Mozart became a victim of El Niño; And when a catastrophic famine and infectious diseases will occur, if we do not act.\nThe arguments put forward by people who do not want to take action to combat climate change fall into three categories. The first say that there is no such thing in principle. Others agree that the world is warming up, but they say that people are not to blame for this. And the third argument disputed by Tony McMichael’s book is: climate change is happening, people are likely to contribute to this, but this problem is not of primary importance compared to other problems that humanity is facing.\nMcMichael says: what we have seen in the past is a pale version of what we can face in the next 100 years.\nA relatively recent example of the impact of climate change on the world population occurred in the early XIX century. The Tambor volcano in Indonesia exploded on an unprecedented scale. During the eruption into the air, it got like this with the huge volcanic eruption of Tambor in Indonesia. The eruption threw so much ash into the air that the global temperature fell by 2-3 degrees. This, in turn, has caused a decade of food crises. Harvest in Europe and other parts of the world fell significantly, which led to problems with nutrition, epidemic and infectious diseases.\nAlong with public unrest due to the movement of people from one place to another in search of more reliable sources of food, climate change has caused a decline in population, reproductive capacity and the rate of infectious diseases.\nWhat distinguishes man-made climate change from natural climate change in the past? Carbon dioxide is the main greenhouse gas that causes global warming. Unlike the ashes in the atmosphere after the Tambor explosion, which has settled in 2-3 years, CO2 will remain for a long time. There is one more factor: the speed of climate change. The world warmed twice by 4-6 degrees Celsius over the last 60 million years due to natural cycles, but warming has occurred for thousands of years and not for a century, as now.\nIf you look at the death rate in London (UK) or Oakland (New Zealand) relative to daytime temperatures, the following pattern is visible. If it gets too hot or too cold, the mortality rate increases. Now Australia is facing an abnormal summer: over 200 days, 200 records were updated, reports the independent Climate Council. And the weather negatively affects people’s health. So, the 30-year-old pilot died of heat stress while riding a bicycle next to Brisbane.\nAnother example of how climate affects health is the activity of vectors of infection. Mosquitoes, for example, carry viruses and other pathogens that affect people, most actively at a certain temperature range and quickly respond to warming, becoming many times more active. Once climate change in Central Asia triggered the spread of bubonic plague in Europe. A sleeping plague bacterium in the marmot colonies in Central Asia was awakened by the activity of rodents, which in turn reacted to a rise in temperature. Marmots began to move more and more often come into contact with people. From marmots to people bubonic plague passed by means of vectors, for example, fleas.\nAnother theory links Mozart’s death to the El Niño phenomenon. At the end of the XVIII century, in 1791, the composer developed a mysterious disease. The body began to swell, it vomited and fevered. Mozart died relatively quickly. From what is not clear until now. It is believed that the composer had acute rheumatic fever, but it could be an infection. The disease coincided with a very strong El Niño, which lasted 5 years. The phenomenon was the strongest in the XVIII century and definitely had an impact on the climate in Europe. The daytime temperature in winter, when Mozart died, was much higher than normal and was unusually high in the month when the composer died.\nVery difficult for Europe was the XIV century. There was one catastrophe after another, but the beginning of the sad events gave the Great Famine from 1315 to 1322 years. The event devastated Europe and England and was clearly connected with the climate. The temperature dropped, the rain models became unpredictable, the harvest rotted in the fields. Twenty years later, the Black Death began. People did not eat well and were especially prone to infections. As a result, the plague greatly reduced the population.\nLooking back at examples of hunger, bubonic plague outbreaks, heat waves that killed tens of thousands of people in Europe in the Middle Ages, or recent events such as Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans, one can not deny the link between climate and the welfare of the world’s population."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"non_native_learner"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:373cb909-d932-4e91-ad31-bb9f710a7a0d>","<urn:uuid:9cceac47-16b0-4e0e-aa1c-44b0fd9af427>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do traditional Bar/Bat Mitzvah celebrations and modern hydroponic farming systems each address the challenge of urban space utilization? What specific methods or adaptations are employed in each context?","answer":"Bar/Bat Mitzvah celebrations traditionally take place in synagogues and reception venues, adapting to urban settings while maintaining their spiritual significance. The ceremony typically moves from the synagogue's Torah reading to a reception area, making efficient use of available space. Similarly, hydroponic farming has innovatively adapted to urban environments - for example, companies like Lufa Farms have engineered greenhouses on top of office buildings, utilizing 31,000-square-foot rooftops. Their systems can deliver more than 1,000 baskets of produce weekly, tripling the output of traditional land-based farms. According to experts, a 30-story, one square block hydroponic farm could match the production of a 2,400-acre outdoor soil-based farm, demonstrating efficient urban space utilization in both contexts.","context":["Caterer? Photographer? What is the essence of a Bar/Bat Mitzvah? Here are the seven key points you need to know.\n(1) Bar Mitzvah Basics\nFirst, let's understand what the words \"Bar (or Bat) Mitzvah\" actually mean. The phrase translates as \"son (daughter) of commandment\" – i.e. the young person becomes responsible to observe the commandments (mitzvot) of the Torah.\nThe purpose of the commandments are to keep our lives focused on what's truly important: family, community, and a relationship with God.\nAlthough we commonly refer to \"having\" a Bar Mitzvah, technically speaking, this is impossible. The term \"Bar Mitzvah\" refers to a status, in the same way that being a student or parent is a status.\nA Jewish boy automatically becomes Bar Mitzvah when he turns 13 years old, and a girl at age 12. (In general, girls tend to mature earlier than boys.)\nOn a deeper level, just as their bodies are growing and changing, so too their souls are growing and changing. Kabbalistic tradition says that a person's spiritual being has several levels of soul. A new level of soul (called neshama) comes into awareness at Bar/Bat Mitzvah time. This is the time when moral awareness and sensitivity fully develops, enabling young people to take responsibility for their actions.\nOne's actions after reaching this stage of life are considered more significant for another reason: The Talmud explains that a mitzvah performed because one is commanded, is considered greater than a mitzvah performed voluntarily. This is because a person has a natural aversion to fulfilling an obligation. Overcoming this aversion is a sign of maturity, and this is what the Bar/Bat Mitzvah celebrates – reaching the stage of obligation.\n(2) Synagogue Event\nOn Shabbat (and various other days), the Torah – a scroll containing the Five Books of Moses – is read publicly. The Torah is divided into 54 portions, following an annual cycle, with one portion read each week in the synagogue.\nThe weekly portion is further sub-divided into seven sections. At Shabbat morning services, people are called up and honored with saying the special blessings before and after the reading of each section.\nThe Torah is removed from the holy ark, and then carried to the bima, the raised platform from where the Torah is read. While the Torah is being carried, everyone stands out of respect.\nColloquially speaking, when people say, \"I had a Bar Mitzvah,\" it means that they had an aliyah to the Torah in synagogue. \"Aliyah\" means to \"go up\" to the bima.\nThe Torah scroll is meticulously written by hand by a God-fearing scribe. A number of rules ensure that the Torah is written with perfect accuracy, thus maintaining the unbroken chain of tradition back to Mount Sinai.\nOn the Shabbat following his 13th birthday, the young man is called up to the Torah. This calculation follows the Jewish calendar. At the conclusion of his final blessing, some synagogues have the custom to good-naturedly pelt the young man with candies.\nAt this point it is customary for the father to recite the following blessing:\nFollowing this, the bar mitzvah boy reads a portion from the biblical prophets, called the Haftorah. During a period of persecution 2,000 years ago, Jews were forbidden from reading the Torah, so they instituted a reading from the prophets that corresponds to the theme of that week's Torah portion. The Haftorah is read with a unique traditional melody.\nFollowing services, the congregation usually joins in a Kiddush, a small lunch that begins with a blessing over wine.\n(3) The Reception\nOne popular feature of the Bar/Bat Mitzvah celebration is a reception. This should ideally be held on the day which the young man/woman becomes 13/12 years old. If necessary, the celebration may be postponed somewhat.\nThere are different practices regarding what is done at a Bar Mitzvah celebration. It is proper for the young person to relate some Torah thoughts at the celebration – i.e. the famous Bar Mitzvah speech. The speech usually contains ideas from the weekly Torah portion, and emphasizes the young person's commitment to Jewish values.\nAnd what about that Titanic-themed party with Hollywood-style special effects? It's important that the festivities should not become so ostentatious that the spiritual significance becomes secondary. The new adult should appreciate that this is a celebration of maturity and responsibility, a message which will carry through for the rest of their life.\n(4) The Gift\nNow what about the ubiquitous Bar Mitzvah gift? In the old days, the gift of choice was a fountain pen, then a Walkman, and today an iPod.\nThose are just fine but there are much more meaningful gifts for a Bar/Bat Mitzvah. Since this event celebrates the young person becoming obligated in the commandments, the most appropriate gift is, naturally, one that gives a deeper understanding of the Jewish heritage and enables one to better perform the mitzvot! (An iPod, s/he can get anytime.)\nWith that in mind, my favorite gift idea is a tzedakah (charity) box. Every Jew should have a tzedakah box in his home, so he can drop in change on a regular basis. The money can then be given to support a Jewish school or institution – in your home town or in Israel (every Jews' \"home town\"). There are beautiful tzedakah boxes made of wood and silver, and you can see a selection here.\nThe next obvious gift is a Jewish book. There are many hundreds of titles to choose from, so I've narrowed it down to the Bar/Bat Mitzvah Top 10. Just click on the title to order:\n• Stone Chumash (published by ArtScroll), an excellent translation of the Five Books of Moses with running commentary on every page\n• Book of our Heritage by Rabbi Eliyahu Kitov (Feldheim), a beautiful overview of the Jewish holidays\n• The Bar Mitzvah Treasury, an illustrated collection of customs and inspiring stories (by Rabbi Yonah Weinrib and Rabbi Yaakov Salomon; ArtScroll)\n• The Thinking Teenagers Guide to Life by Rabbi Akiva Tatz (Targum), gripping essays on forging a path through life\n• Sand and Stars by Yaffa Ganz (ArtScroll), a two-volume book about Jewish history, written especially for teenagers\n• Shmooze by Rabbi Nechemia Coopersmith, a fun book that provokes thoughtful discussions on essential Jewish issues\n• The Long Road to Freedom, by Avner Gold, an exciting historical novel filled with intrigue and insight into Jewish life.\n• Bible for the Clueless But Curious by Rabbi Nachum Braverman (Leviathan), packed with wisdom on relationships, spirituality and more\n• Candles in my Window by Beth Firestone, a delightful fiction book about a young girl discovering her Judaism\n• Triumph – Aish.com's popular book of inspiring true stories of challenge and spiritual growth.\nIf all else fails, you can always give money. It is a nice idea to give $18 (or some multiple thereof), since the numerical value of 18 in Hebrew is \"Chai,\" which means \"Life.\"\nUpon reaching age 13, a boy begins the obligation to put on tefillin every day (except Shabbat and holidays).\nTefillin are two square, black leather boxes, which contain parchments of Torah verses. Attached to each box are black leather straps. One of the boxes is worn on the bicep, and the other is worn on the front of the head.\nThe two boxes represent the two ways that we serve God in this world: thought (the head) and action (the arm). The arm-tefillin contains one parchment in one compartment, whereas the head-tefillin is four parchments, each in its own separate compartment. This is to signify that in service of God, the two powers must work congruently: We use the totality of our mind to gain the full perspective, and then we act with a singular clarity of purpose.\nInside each tefillin box are parchments containing four Torah sections, which speak about God's unity, the obligation to observe the commandments, and the responsibility to transmit Judaism to our descendants.\nIf you're really feeling generous, Tefillin is a wonderful gift for a Bar Mitzvah boy. Owning a pair of Tefillin (and wearing them!) is an important part of Jewish identity. But since they are expensive (about $400), not every Bar Mitzvah boy has a pair. To make sure you get kosher Tefillin, see here or here.\n(6) The First Bar Mitzvah\nNow here's a Jewish trivia question: Who was the first person to have a Bar Mitzvah?\nWe could actually suggest three answers:\n1) Abraham – The first person to begin observing some of the mitzvot was \"the first Jew,\" Abraham. However, he was older than age 13 when he started, so...\n2) Isaac was the first person who was \"Jewish\" upon reaching age 13. The Torah writes, \"And Abraham made a great party on the day\" (Genesis 21:8), which the Midrash explains was a celebration for Isaac becoming Bar Mitzvah.\n3) Mount Sinai – Only when the Torah was given at Mount Sinai did Jews became truly obligated to observe the mitzvot. Therefore, the Sinai experience was actually a mass Bar/Bat Mitzvah of the entire Jewish people.\n(7) What's Next?\nSome have the misconception that Jewish practice is confined to the synagogue, or to an occasional holiday celebration at home. The truth is that Torah and mitzvot punctuate every moment of our lives: setting standards for business ethics, proper speech, honoring parents, what we eat, and even how to care for pets!\nWe refer to these laws as Torat Chaim, literally \"instructions for living.\" Torah is the ultimate \"owner's manual\" for maximizing our pleasure and potential in life.\nTorah is a basis for life's most important questions: How can I live a meaningful life? How can I build successful relationships, deal honestly in business, and fulfill my personal potential? How can I really make a difference in the world?\nTorah study emphasizes building a rational basis of belief, to engage one's mind, stimulate the intellect through questioning and debate, and thereby nourish the soul. It does not endorse a leap of faith, all-or-nothing decisions, or disengagement from the world.\nThe goal of any Jew is not only to study the Torah, but to become a \"living Torah,\" who embodies the lofty ideals of \"love your neighbor,\" \"peace on earth,\" \"justice for all,\" \"universal education,\" \"all men are created equal,\" \"dignity of the individual,\" and \"the preciousness of life.\" These concepts all originate from the Torah, and these have defined the moral makeup of humanity.\nIn Jewish life, a Bar/Bat Mitzvah does not represent the culmination of one's Jewish education, but rather a stepping-stone to a more mature and profound relationship with Jewish learning.\nThis is illustrated by the following idea: If even one letter is missing from a Torah scroll, it is rendered invalid. According to tradition, each Jew corresponds to one letter in the Torah. This teaches that each and every one of us has an integral role to play in the future of the Jewish people.\nBar/Bat Mitzvah means to become educated, and to strengthen one's Jewish pride through knowledge and understanding. It means to grow Jewishly, one step at a time. It means standing up for Israel and respecting every Jew. It means taking responsibility for the world, using the Torah as our guide, because that is the mission of the Jewish people. And most of all, it means to love being Jewish.\nSuccess in achieving these goals is what we wish for the Bar/Bat Mitzvah, and the beginning of that journey is what we celebrate on this joyous occasion.\nArticles on Aish.com:\n• My Son's Bar Mitzvah by Emuna Braverman\n• Bar Mitzvah Highlights by Sara Yoheved Rigler\n• Post-Bar Mitzvah Stress Disorder by Judy Gruen\n• Bar Mitzvah Motivators by Rabbi Avi Shafran\nWith thanks to Rabbi Dov Lev and Rabbi Moshe Schapiro","Fresh water may soon become a costly commodity. The fundamental social problem of feeding society is growing larger due to a rising scarcity of water and an ongoing depletion of agricultural land. Population growth, climate changes, pollution, and agricultural water waste contribute to growing fresh water shortages around the world. Depletion of soil nutrients through poor farming techniques, floods, poor irrigation, and winds have seriously damaged agricultural land.\nApproximately 40% of the world’s agricultural ground is unsuitable for farming. The role of agricultural business desperately needs to align with the evolving ethos of a rapidly growing society. Can hydroponic farming provide a sustainable solution to environmental problems caused by traditional farming methods? What practical applications does hydroponics have in densely populated urban areas? Farmers describe soil degradation as thinning and unproductive land that leads to low yielding crops.\nLand degradation includes nutrient depletion, loss of biodiversity, climate change, erosion by water, erosion by wind, reduced vegetative cover, pollution, drought, compaction by animals or machinery, sedimentation, increased soil temperatures, reduced organic matter, and salinization (Stockings, 2000 pg 5). According to the United Nation’s food and agriculture program, 854 million people do not have sufficient food for an active and healthy life (Sample, 2007). The population has increased by nearly 2 billion in the last 20 years and food production increased by 50%.\nIt is estimated that by 2050 the population will reach 9 billion. (Sample, 2007). State and federal officials have drafted accords in attempts to rectify water shortages. UN officials have gathered to create and execute a plan of action to improve conservation of soil and restoration of degraded land, but such plans are merely band-aids on a broken limb. The ultimate form of soil conservation is eliminating the use of soil in agriculture completely. Hydroponic agriculture offers a permanent solution to this rapidly growing problem of water shortages, pollution, and land degradation.\nDevelopment of hydroponic systems took place from 1925 through 1935. Experimentation with soil-less nutrient solutions and advancement in agricultural plastic by Professor Emery Myers Emmert at the University of Kentucky sparked an interest in hydroponic food production. Efforts were primarily aimed at large scale commercial food growth, but Hydroponic food systems were eventually abandoned due to high construction and operation costs (University of Arizona). Modern hydroponic systems are relatively inexpensive to build and offer several effective methods of food production.\nThe most popular commercial agriculture hydroponic system is the Nutrient Film Technique. NFT consist of a plastic pipe or gutter, a water reservoir, and a water pump. A thin film of nutrient infused water constantly flows through the tubing. Plant roots are suspended over the piping with only the roots touching the stream of nutrient water. The pipe or gutter is slightly elevated at the far end to allow water to drain back into the water reservoir. The NFT system delivers high levels of oxygen to the roots promoting vigorous plant growth.\nNFT systems are ideal for leafy greens such as lettuce, cabbage and basil but are effective for a multitude of fruits, herbs, and vegetables. A minimal operating cost makes this system ideal for commercial applications. [pic] [pic] A popular system for larger plants is the ebb and flow or flood and drain system. This table system consists of a plastic tray, water pump, timer, reservoir, and tubing. The plants lay on the top table separate from the nutrient reservoir. The pump is programmed to turn on in 15 minute increments with variations specific to the type of plant and stage of development.\nWhen activated, the pump will fill the table at top with the nutrient infused water from the reservoir below. Once it is turned off the water will drain back into the reservoir below. [pic] One of the simplest hydroponic methods is the deep water culture system. Often used in commercial applications, this system can be built with materials found at a local hardware store or discount retail market. The deep water culture system can be built with a non-transparent storage tote, an aquarium air pump, and an air stone commonly used in fish tanks.\nPlant roots are permanently submerged in nutrient rich water. This system does not require a water pump or timer. Urbanization and technological developments extended the distance produce traveled to reach consumers. Heilbroner explains the changed by describing that “industrial technology has literally refashioned the human environment, bringing with it all the gains-and all the terrible problems-of city life on a mass scale” (Heilbroner, Milberg pg 83 ). Hydroponics is the tool to address the basic social problem of feeding society by making produce readily accessible and grown in urbanized areas.\nAlthough traditional agriculture has served its purpose for many years, the ethos of rapidly growing demands sustainable and healthy forms of food production. Hydroponic farming in conjunction with greenhouses can help solve land degradation and water pollution problems through out the world. Lufa Farms, a Canadian farm based in Monteral, engineered a series of greenhouses on top of a 31,000-square foot office building. Greenhouse growing allows the Canadian farm to supply fresh produce all year round, even in 45 degree temperatures.\nIt is estimated that Lufa Farms can deliver more than 1,000 baskets of produce per week, three times more than land-based competitors. ( Business and the Environment). Greenhouse hydroponic farming not only solves the problem of land degradation and a water shortage due to traditional farming practices but it also alleviates the pressure of fossil fuel consumption and vehicle pollution. Because sustainable farming systems can be established in city rooftops and barges, transporting fruits and vegetables from remote farms is no longer necessary.\nProduce grown in the city have shorter distances to travel reducing transportation expenses and fuel consumption. Consumers can purchase a fresher product at their local market. According to Columbia University professor of public health and microbiology Dickson D. Despommier, a 30-story, one square block farm could produce the same amount of produce as a 2,400 outdoor soil based farm ( Business and the Environment ). The Science Barge, a greenhouse and hydroponic system on top of a barge based in Yonkers, New York, is a fully functioning urban farm prototype for a fully sustainable food production sytem.\nThe Science Barge produces tomatoes, cucumbers, and lettuce without carbon emissions, chemical pesticides, or waste water runoff (New York Sun Works, 2010-2011). The barge uses solar and wind power to sustain greenhouses on top of the barge. Purified river water and rain water is used to irrigate the crops. Science Barge grown produce use seven times less land and four times less water than traditionally grown crops. (New York Sun Works, 2010-2011). The economic advantage of hydroponic farming can be identified through a cost-benefit analysis.\nConsidering that in 2000, 41% of all freshwater used in the United States was for Agricultural purposes (Agricultural Resources and Environmental Indicators, 2006 Edition); reduction in water cost is one of the main economic advantages of hydroponic farming. BrightFarms is a company that has taken this emerging technology and developed a business model of “Better food, better prices, better environment. ” BrightFarms designs, finances, builds, and operates hydroponic greenhouse farms on supermarket rooftops.\nBrightFarms pledge is “to deliver produce at equal or higher service levels than the retailer currently requires of its other suppliers. There is no cost to the retailer to build the BrightFarm, only an obligation to purchase the output. ” The company intends to increase profits by reducing shrink due to longer produce shelf life. They have calculated that this practice will produce higher gross margins for the retailer. The company implements a long-term price fix contract to protect the retailer from unstable prices, rising cost costs and inconstant supply. BrightFarms 2012). BrightFarms feels that “with the elimination of shipping, and the drastic reduction of fuel consumption, carbon emissions and water use, BrightFarms enables grocery retailers to change their produce supply chain in a way that improves the planet and their bottom line. ” (BrightFarms 2012). According to Brian H. Kurbjeweit, professor of Contemporary Business at the University of Redlands, economic progress is an interconnected system comprised of science, economics, law, and ethics all influenced by the ethos of a society.\nThe ethos of modern society has expressed an urgent need for sustainable business practices. Science has engineered the tools to effectively create a new form of responsible farming. Materials to build hydroponic systems are readily available at a relatively low cost. Through social media, instructional videos and written instructions to build and operate hydroponic systems are readily accessible world wide through urban farming forums free of cost on the Internet. There is a basic economic need to feed and sustain life.\nThe basic economic problem creates a market for those willing to invest in large-scale urban farming businesses. Responsible agriculture is an ethical guideline that all farmers in global and local economies should follow to ensure the basic economic problem is addressed. Continued land degradation, water pollution, and pesticide smothered produce combined with a rapidly growing world population will lead to further human suffering. It is an ethical duty of world leaders to implement sustainable forms of agriculture to nurture its citizens. Law, the missing factor is yet to be addressed.\nIt may be the ethos of future generations that persuades governments to execute laws to speed up the implementation of sustainable farming techniques or it may be severe ethical violations by non-complying agricultural corporations that spark the creation of laws to effectively protect citizens from illness caused by pesticides and water pollution. It may simply be an epidemic interest in well being or as author Malcom Gladwell describes, a tipping point may be reached where local co-ops solve the basic economic problem, one small community at a time, using sustainable forms of agriculture.\nStockings, M., Niamh, M.

{"question":"Between a Unity galaxy's star system and a Rubik's cube, which one has more basic components to work with?","answer":"A 3x3 Rubik's cube has fewer basic components than the Unity galaxy system. The Rubik's cube consists of 6 centerpieces that are fixed in position, 12 edge pieces between the centerpieces (with 2 colors each), and 6 faces determined by the center piece colors. In comparison, the Unity galaxy system has more components, starting with 300 default stars (which can be adjusted), each being a 3D sphere object with position coordinates in a circular layout determined by radius (up to 100 units) and angle parameters.","context":["Let’s Make a 4X Space Game with Unity! – Part 1 Creating the Galaxy!\nHi guys! Welcome to a tutorial on how to make a 4X space game using unity. This tutorial will have multiple parts and I am hoping to publish a new part at least once a week. I will assume you have some basic Unity and C# knowledge. The code may not be the most efficient way to make things work, however, I find it is better to make things work first and then go back and optimise it later. All the code in each part will be available to download at the bottom of the post.\nIn this first part, we will create a galaxy of stars using the Unity sphere GameObject. Making the stars a 3D object might not be the best way to do things but this will demonstrate the concept (and they could be substituted for 2D sprites later on).\nFirst things first create a new project in Unity and call it whatever you want.\nNow that the new scene is open create a new Empty GameObject, call it something like Galaxy Manager and set the position to (0,0,0). This will be the object which holds all the scripts and objects related to our galaxy. Also save the scene and name it whatever you’d like.\nLet’s keep things organised. In the project tab create two new folders. Call one Scenes and one Scripts. Drag the newly saved scene into the Scenes folder. In the scripts folder create a new C# script and call it Galaxy.\nOpen up the script. I am using Visual Studio to write the code but if you are using MonoDevelop it will work the same; so don’t be put off if the program in the picture looks different to yours.\nAt this stage we need to ask ourselves ‘what does a galaxy require?’\n- A galaxy is made up of stars so it would be a good idea to add an int of number of stars.\n- The initial galaxy we will be creating is a simple disc. Disc galaxies are circle shape, usually with a higher density of stars in the centre. Circles have a radius so we should include a maximum radius the stars can be away from the centre of the galaxy.\nWe will make these values public for now to make it easy to change the number. However, in the future we will probably want to be able to import these values from the settings the player chooses on a main menu screen. Let’s give the number of stars a default value of 300 and the maximum radius 100.\nSo how do we make a sphere? In unity there is an easy way to make the built in primitive shapes like spheres – GameObject.CreatePrimitive . We will add this to the Start method.\nLet’s add this script to the Galaxy Manager object we made earlier. Don’t forget to save the script.\nNow if we press play, a sphere should appear in the centre of the scene. Notice it also appears in the hierarchy.\nWhile this is a good first step, a galaxy with only one star isn’t a very good galaxy! So how do we add more stars?\nA simple for loop will do the job. We simply nest the line that generates the sphere in a for loop which starts at 0 and ends when we reach the correct number of stars.\nBut before we press play, we need to solve a problem. All the spheres will appear in the same place! So how do we position all the stars in a circle? The answer is we create some polar coordinates and then convert them to Cartesian coordinates which we insert into the spheres transform. If that sounds complicated, don’t worry its not as hard as it sounds.\nTo get a polar coordinate we need a distance (the radius) and an angle. So in our for loop we need to create two private floats to represent these two things.\nNow we need to assign these floats some values. In most 4X games the galaxy is randomly generated at the start of the game so that no two games are the same. This is the approach we will take. To do this we use Random.Range for both distance and angle. That way the stars will be in a different position every time we load a new galaxy. But what will our ranges be? For the angle, it is easy; it is simply between 0 and 2π (we will use radians instead of degrees as this will make things much easier). For the distance we will use a range of 0 and the maximum radius we declared at the very start of our class.\nNow we have some polar coordinates we need to convert them to Cartesian coordinates. To do this we need to create a Vector3 where the X coordinate is distance * Cos(angle) and the Z coordinate is distance * Sin(angle). The Y coordinate will be 0 for now as we will be creating our galaxy in the XZ plane. Call this Vector3 something like cartPosition.\nNow we can change the spheres transform to these coordinates. To do this we will first need to edit the line where we create the sphere. We will need to store this in a GameObject variable. Let’s call this starGO to make it easy to identify as the star GameObject. Next we need to change the transform of starGO using transform.position.\nSave the script. Back in Unity change the camera transform to (0, 200, 0) and it’s rotation to (90, 0, 0). Still in the camera inspector change “Clear Flags” from “SkyBox” to “Solid Color”. Change “Background” to a black colour so the stars standout more. Save the Scene and finally hit play. You should see a disk galaxy appear! Not only that but every time you stop the game and press play again the galaxy should be different!\nCongratulations, you have made it through the first part of the Tutorial! In the next part we will stop the stars from overlapping with each other, discuss ring shaped galaxies and create data for each star so it is unique. In the meantime experiment with different numbers of stars and size of galaxies by changing the values on the Galaxy Manger object.\nDownload the Galaxy script here:\nscripts_for_part1 (zip file)\nGalaxy (paste bin)","How to Solve A 3x3 Rubik’s Cube\nTo 99% of the planet, solving a Rubik’s cube can seem like an impossible task to complete. Similar to a Chinese finger trap, the harder you try to solve it the more difficult it gets. It even took the inventor of the cube Erno Rubik an entire month to solve his own creation. The secret to solving the cube is understanding some basic algorithms. The following tutorial will teach you everything you need to know in order to solve your first 3×3 cube from start to finish.\nIn order to understand and perform the algorithms, let’s name the different parts of the cube.\nFace: There are 6 faces on a cube. The face is determined by the color of the centerpiece, which never moves.\nCenterpiece: These are the center tiles, and are fixed in their positions. There are 6 centerpieces.\nEdge piece: These always lie between the centerpieces, and are 2 colors. There are 12 edge pieces.\nA rubiks cube is solved using a series of movements that form algorithms. These movements are represented by 6 letters, known as notations. The default position of the cube should remain fixed, with the white face always facing up.\nR– rotate the right face of your cube clockwise\nL- rotate the left face of your cube clockwise\nU– rotate the up face of your cube clockwise\nD– rotate the down face of your cube clockwise\nF– rotate the front face of your cube clockwise\nB – rotate the back face of your cube clockwise\nNotations followed by an apostrophe ( for example: U’) indicate a counterclockwise rotation of that face.The suffix “2” (e.g. R2, U2…) means a double rotation of that face, or turning 180 degrees.\nThe following are two examples of algorithms that will be used to solve the cube: the “right hand algorithm” and the “left hand algorithm”.\nSome algorithms may include the notation “spin the cube”, the rotation direction will be specified in the step.\n1- The first step to solving the cube is creating a white cross\nThis step includes 2 mini-steps: the daisy and the cross. Start with daisy, or four white edge pieces around the yellow center piece. This mini step is based on trial and error, but for extra help view this video.\n2- Turn the daisy into a white cross.\nPosition the cube with the daisy facing up and the green-white edge facing you. Holding the top layer in place, rotate the bottom 2 layers so the green edge is lined up with its center. Now rotate the front face twice to bring that piece to its correct position in the bottom layer, or F2.\nNext, perform the same steps for the other white edges one at a time. Spin the cube so the next edge is facing you and repeat this step three times until a white cross is formed.\n3- Complete the white face, solving the corners one at a time.\nLocate a corner piece and where it would be in the solved state by identifying the 2 faces it should sit between (a face is identified by the centerpiece).\nFlip the cube so yellow is on top. Choose a corner piece in the top layer. Position the cube so the corner piece faces you on the right side. Holding the top layer in place, rotate the bottom 2 layers until the corner is above its placement in a solved state. Use the “right-hand algorithm” or RUR’U’. Repeat this move until the corner piece is properly in place. When it is in place, locate the next white corner and repeat the same process for the next 3 corners. In the case where a corner is placed correctly in the bottom layer but not oriented correctly, repeat the right-hand algorithm until the corner is in place.\n4- Solve the middle layer.\nThis step will use both the “Left hand” and the “Right hand” algorithm. The idea here is to locate the 4 edge pieces that belong in the middle layer and correctly place them. Yellow faces up for this step. Find an edge at the top layer that doesn’t contain yellow. Position the cube so this edge is facing you. First, rotate the bottom 2 layers so the edge piece is on the correct face.\nThere are 2 cases: this piece needs to move right or left.\nIn order to move this edge piece right, complete the following steps. First rotate the top layer to the opposite direction that the edge piece should go. Since you want the edge piece to go to the right, start with the right-hand algorithm. Spin the cube clockwise. There should be a white corner on your left side. Perform the left-hand algorithm using your left hand. The edge is now in place.\nIn the case where the edge piece needs to move to the left complete the same algorithm mirrored. First rotate the top layer to the opposite direction that the edge piece should go. Since you want the edge piece to go to the left, you’re going to start with the left hand algorithm. Spin the whole cube 90 degrees counterclockwise. There should be a white corner on your right. Perform the right hand algorithm. The edge is now in place.\n5- Create a yellow cross or 4 yellow edges around the centerpiece.\nCurrently, there are 3 optional positions for the yellow face: a dot with no edges in place, a half cross, or a line. If the yellow face contains a half cross spin the cube so the cross is pointing right and facing you. If the yellow face contains a line, spin the cube so that it is horizontal. For each case use the following algorithm, F, right-hand algorithm, F’. This algorithm may be needed a few times in order to place the corner correctly.\n6- Position the yellow corners in place.\nFirst, locate where each yellow corner should be placed on the solved cube. Keeping in mind orientation of the corner doesn’t yet matter, you may need to swap 2 adjacent corners. Use the following algorithm. Keeping the yellow face on top, spin the entire cube so both corners that need to be swapped are to your right. Next perform three right hand algorithms, spin the cube clockwise, then three left-hand algorithms. Lastly, rotate the top layer until all of the corners are in the right place. To swap 2 diagonal corners perform the same series twice until it is placed correctly.\n7- Complete the yellow face.\nThere might be corners that are in the correct place but not oriented in the right direction. Hold the cube so white faces up and the corner that needs reorientation is on your bottom right. Repeat the right-hand algorithm until the corner is in place. Then hold the top 2 layers while rotating the bottom layer clockwise. If this corner is not correctly oriented repeat the right-hand algorithm until it is in place. Do this for all four corners.\n8- Position the yellow edges in place, or swap the location of the last 4 yellow edges.\nIf there is no solved side (orange, blue, red and green) in order to solve one side first perform this algorithm holding the yellow side up F2 U L R’F2 L’R U F2. When one side is solved, hold your cube so the yellow face is up and the solved side is facing backward. There are 2 cases: the edges need to move clockwise or counterclockwise. To move the edges clockwise perform this algorithm: F2 U L R’F2 L’R U F2. To move the edges counterclockwise perform this algorithm: F2 U’ L R’ F2 L’ R U’ F2"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:baee90b4-861c-4781-965b-98285ec02eab>","<urn:uuid:78ea2b86-ef99-4d3c-b9c3-f0be85df7b01>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the typical target depths and fishing techniques used in deep sea versus ice fishing?","answer":"Deep sea fishing typically involves multiple techniques like trolling with artificial lures or live baits, jigging with lures, or bottom fishing with baits near structures like reefs and wrecks.

{"question":"What are the key differences between melodic and harmonic intervals, and how do they relate to transposition in music?","answer":"Melodic intervals are the distances between two notes played successively, while harmonic intervals are the distances between two notes sounding simultaneously. Transposition relates to both types of intervals as it involves modifying the pitches of a musical piece while maintaining the relationships between notes. When transposing, each note and chord is shifted by the same number of steps to match a new key, resulting in the piece sounding either higher or lower than the original while preserving both melodic and harmonic relationships.","context":["The process of transposing a musical piece involves modifying the pitches but not the connections between them (or notes). Transposition is often used in vocal music to accommodate performers with varying ranges.\nSimilarly, How do you transpose in music?\nA singer who wants to transpose a work to modify its range may simply repeat the procedure of identifying the original key, choosing a new key, and shifting each note the same number of steps and half steps throughout the composition. The notes you read in this circumstance will be the real concert pitch.\nAlso, it is asked, What does it mean to transpose chord?\nWhat Is the Meaning of Transposition? Transposition is the procedure by which a musician alters the key of a piece of music that has already been created. Each chord and note will be changed to match a new key, and the piece will sound either higher or lower than it did before.\nSecondly, What does it mean to transpose music for an instrument?\nInstrument that creates a higher or lower pitch than the music intended for it (transposing musical instrument). Clarinets, English horns, and saxophones are examples. The relative pitches generated, rather than the precise pitches, are shown in musical notation when transposing instruments.\nAlso, Why do we need to transpose music?\nTo Make Music Simpler to Read One rationale for transposing music is to make it easier to read for the musician. The double bass, for example, interprets music at one pitch but produces notes that are an octave below.\nPeople also ask, Is a clarinet a transposing?\nBecause the clarinet is a transposing instrument, the notation pitch differs from the concert pitch.\nRelated Questions and Answers\nWhat is meant by transposition?\ntransposition definition 1a: a transposing or being transferred act, process, or event. b: the movement of a fragment of DNA from one part of the genome to another. 2a: the transfer of any term from one side of an equation to the other, with a matching change in sign.\nHow do you tell what key A song is in?\nThe quickest approach to figure out what key a song is in is to glance at the key signature on the sheet music. If the sheet music doesn’t contain a key signature, you’ll have to figure out the key by analyzing the chords or notes used in the song.\nWhat happens when you transpose a song?\nYou’ll have to transpose down if a song pushes the top boundaries of your vocal range. If you’re performing a song in the key of G, for example, transposing down means changing the key to a lower one, such as F. If it’s still too high, you may move down to E, and so on.\nIs the guitar a transposing instrument?\nBecause the heard note is an octave below the notated pitch, the classical guitar is a transposing instrument. Another example is the descant recorder (which is an octave above notation), which explains why it seems to be able to play lower than the (non-transposing treble recorder) But it can’t!\nWhy are songs in different keys?\nMusic for solo voice and piano is often offered in a variety of keys to accommodate various vocal ranges. You’d notice if the same performer performed the same song in multiple keys since the vocal range would be different.\nWhat key is a piano in?\nSeven octaves plus three lower notes (B, B flat, and A) are available on an 88-key piano. It contains 52 white keys and 36 black keys (sharps and flats), with seven white keys and five black keys in each octave.\nDoes A capo transpose up or down?\nThe open notes are transposed up using a capo. You can use a capo to keep playing open notes if you’re in the open position and transposing up the fretboard.\nIs there A program to transpose music?\nSimply download ScanScore and scan your sheet music with your smartphone, tablet, or scanner and have it played back to you. You may also transpose your score and export your notes to practically any music application to further alter them.\nCan you transpose from major to minor?\nTransposing a music allows you to simply alter its key. It’s a little more difficult to get from major to minor, however there is software that can help. To make a minor 3rd, you’d have to reduce every occurrence of the 3rd Scale degree.\nHow do I turn my major into a minor?\nSwitching from major to minor while maintaining the melody Make a basic two-chord progression focusing on minor, then shift it to relative major. Create a three- to six-note melody that complements your minor progression. Switch to major chords while keeping the same melody.\nIs a double bass a transposing instrument?\nThe double bass is traditionally a transposing instrument. Because so much of the range of the double bass is below the usual bass clef, it is notated an octave higher than it sounds to avoid having to employ too many ledger lines below the staff.\nHow do French horns transpose?\nTo get the pitches that would sound in music composed for a French horn, transpose down by a perfect fifth: a written C sounds like a written F, and a written D sounds like a G, and so on.\nIs trombone a transposing instrument?\nTrombone music, like that for euphonium and tuba, is usually written in concert pitch in either bass or tenor clef, however there are exceptions, most notably in practically all brass-band work, where the tenor trombone is written in treble clef as a B transposing instrument.\nWhat is corni music?\nCorni in F stands for horns (often incorrectly called French horns). It refers to a natural horn that was similar to a hunting horn during that historical period.\nWhat is transposition in music theory?\nThe technique or procedure of shifting a group of notes (pitches or pitch classes) up or down in pitch by a consistent interval is known as transposition in music.\nWhat is an example of transposition?\nA transposition mistake is an accounting error that occurs when two (or more) consecutive digits are substituted. A transposition mistake occurs when a bookkeeper enters the number 56 instead of 65. Find the difference between the reported and correct amounts to identify the inaccuracies.\nWhat is transposition in drama?\nAdaptation is the process of adapting an existing book, play text, or screenplay to a new setting. Context: The medium’s context: a book might be adapted for the theatre.\nHow do you know if a song is in minor or major?\nYou may also listen to a song’s melody and see where it stops. Melodies usually resolve to the key’s tonic note. Again, a song is in C major if all of the melody notes are in C major/A minor and the last melody note is C. It’s in A minor if it concludes on A.\nTransposing is the process of moving all or part of a musical piece up or down in pitch. In music, transposing means changing the key. The word “transpose” comes from the Latin verb “transponere,” which means to move something around.\nThis Video Should Help:\n- types of transposition in music\n- transpose music chart\n- transposition in music pdf\n- transpose key chart\n- transpose music software","Melodic Interval: the distance between two notes sounding successively\nHarmonic Interval: the distance between two notes sounding simultaneously\nAny interval name is divided in two parts: a number and a modifier preceeding the number.\nThe numerical part of an interval is an integer number: 1, 2, 3, ......n; these numbers are referred to as thirds (or 3rds), fifths (or 5ths), and so on with the exception of the 1 and the 8 instead of which the terms unison and octave (or 8ve) are used. Intervals form the unison to the octave are called simple intervals ; all the others are called compound intervals and they are formed by some combination of an x number of octaves plus a simple interval, which makes them behave as their simple component.\nThe numbering system is based upon the degrees of the major scale and that is why even though there are 13 notes in an octave we only use 8 numbers. Each degree or note of the scale corresponds to a specific number which means, for example, that the interval C-G is only and always a fifth regardless of alterations. At this point, since the notes can be altered in both directions by means of flats and sharps, we need something that takes these variables into account so that we will know precisely the distance between the two notes. Here is where the modifiers become essential. Their function is to label the direction of the alteration (if any) so that we can precisely identify any interval within the octave. The modifiers' names are:\nThe meaning of these names is derived from the relationship between the notes (frequency ratio) in the harmonic series.\nThe modifiers are also based on the major scale. In Ex.1 you can see how every interval between any note in the C major scale and its tonic is either perfect or major.\nAs you can see the term perfect is used with the unison, the 4th, the 5th, and the 8ve while major is used with all the others.\nIn order to determine the exact distance between two notes in a given interval we need to know how many half steps there are between them:\nThe fact that the interval number and the corresponding number of half steps do not match (with the exception of the 2nd) might seem a little confusing at first, but remember that there is no relation between the two whatsoever.\nThis nomenclature is one out of the many existing ways to catalog the chromatic scale. One of these, for example, identifies intervals by numbering them accordingly to the number of half steps between the notes. In the latter system a 7th would be what we call a perfect fifth. The reasons why we study this system instead of another are 1) because it is the most widely used and 2) because of tonality; since 99% of the music we deal with every day is mostly tonal this nomenclature is the one that most efficiently classifies it.\nNow that we know exaclty what these intervals mean let's take a look at the remaining modifiers.\nAugmented Interval: a perfect or major interval made larger by a 1/2 step without altering its numerical name\nDiminished Interval: a perfect or minor interval made smaller by a 1/2 step without altering its numerical name\nDouble Diminished: a diminished interval made smaller by a 1/2 step without altering its numerical name\nDouble Augmented: an augmented interval made larger by a 1/2 step without altering its numerical name\nIt is imperative for the numerical name to remain constant when we alter an interval otherwise we will end up with a different one! For example, let's say we have the same interval C-G and this time we specify that there are no alterations so that the interval is a perfect fifth; if we lower the G by a 1/2 step we obtain a new interval C-Gb which is a \"diminished fifth.\" Now, if we raise the C by a half step we will have C#-Gb as our new interval and since the numerical name is still a 5 (for 5th) we must call it a \"double diminished fifth.\" Suppose that we want to count the half steps between the two notes, we would find out that there are 5 of them: C -(1)- D -(2)- D# -(3)- E -(4)- F -(5)- Gb. But this is the number of half steps for a \"perfect fourth\"! Yes, also. These kind of intervals are called enharmonic : two different interval names used for the same \"distance in pitch.\" This can be confusing and you might wonder why can't we just use one name for each pitch distance. The answer is that most of the time we do, it is much more common to encounter a perfect fourth than a double diminished fifth since, on tempered instruments, they sound exactly the same. But sometimes another name might be more appropriate; instruments that are not tempered, for example, will play a double diminished fifth a little sharper that a perfect fourth.\nAs we have seen before the term \"perfect\" is only used in connection with unisons, fourths, fifths, and octaves, while seconds, thirds, and sixths can only be major or, as we know now, minor. Augmented and diminished, and obviously their doubles apply indifferently to all of them. You can also have triple and quadruple augmentations and diminutions even though they are rarely encountered, but at least it should be clear that after the doubling the behaviour of the interval remains constant.\nEvery rule about the modifiers can be reversed; for example, minor intervals made larger by a 1/2 step without altering their numerical name become major intervals. But while this is always true for the major and minor modifiers we have to be careful with the diminished and the agumented ones. As we have seen the augmented and diminished modifiers can apply to every numerical interval; for this reason if we enlarge a diminished interval by a 1/2 step the resulting interval will depend on the numerical name: a perfect interval if it was a unison, a fourth, a fifth or an octave, or a minor interval if it was a second, a third, or a sixth.\nOne last note before taking a look at the inversions: the term tritone is sometimes used instead of the augmented 4th. This is because of the three whole steps which characterize this particular interval.\nThe following chart lists the most common simple intervals.\nCompound intervals, as we said, have the same behaviour of their simple components; the only difference is in their numerical number. In order to isolate the simple interval in a compound one we subtract the number \"7\" from the numerical number of the latter until we obtain a number between 1 and 8. That number is the numerical of the simple component. For example, a 13th behaves like a sixth (13-7=6). The number \"7\" is used instead of \"8\" because we number the degrees of the scale from 1 to 8 thus omitting the zero.\nINVERSION OF INTERVALS\nJust as every particle of matter in the universe has its own anti-material counterpart, every interval has its own unique inversion.\nAn interval is inverted by transposing the bottom note up by an octave or vice versa. For example, the inversion of the interval C-G is G-C. Note that for compound intervals you must also add the number of octaves that are in the interval itself multiplied by two.\nWhen an interval is inverted the numerical name and the modifier change accordingly with the inversion. The new numerical name can be calculated by subtracting the old one from the number \"9\" (same reason as for the number \"7\" for the compound intervals). The modifiers change as follow:\nMinor intervals become major intervals\nPerfect intervals remain perfect intervals\nAugmented intervals become diminished intervals\nDiminished intervals become augmented intervals\nAgain, double and triple augmented or diminished intervals behave as the augmented and diminished ones.\nA good understanding of intervals is the base for the understanding of scales, chords, harmony, and every other musical aspect concerning pitches.\nSometimes we tend to dismiss as superfluous a particular theoretical aspect of music just because we cannot see their practical implication.

{"question":"How do mindfulness practices impact self-organization in therapeutic settings versus academic environments?","answer":"Mindfulness practices affect self-organization differently in therapeutic and academic settings. In therapeutic contexts, mindfulness relates to embodied self-organization within bodies and brains, working through consciousness to enhance mental health and promote well-being. In academic settings, like ASU's Center for Mindfulness, the focus is on developing practical skills like time-management, self-efficacy, and emotional regulation to help students intentionally design their lives rather than operating on default.","context":["Mind, Consciousness and the Cultivation of Well-being: Transformation through the Lifespan (audio)\nConsciousness is fundamental to human change processes, and in this immersive experience you will learn about the art and science of cultivating the kinds of conscious experiences that promote wellbeing, cultivate resilience, foster integrative neurological growth, raise telomerase levels to maintain and repair the ends of chromosomes, optimize epigenetic regulators to decrease inflammatory diseases, and improve other physiological measures of medical health. These states of consciousness also are essential for relational health, equanimity and neural integration.\nBoth presentations and experiential immersions focus on what the mind is and how to cultivate a healthy mind. One aspect of mental life is the process of being aware, the ways we know and have a sense of the known within our subjective experience of being alive. When we combine a deep view of consciousness with emerging findings from the study of the social brain, we will see that clinical work to promote mental health can be greatly enhanced with these new insights and practical applications.\nMind includes consciousness and information processing, as well as a regulatory function called “self-organization.” This emergent, self-organizing process of the mind is both embodied—it is within our bodies including our brains—and in our relationships with others. How consciousness itself may relate to this self-organizing function will be explored in depth and clinically relevant information and practices will be offered to cultivate a healthy mind.\nCE Credit at no extra cost when you pass the online test with a score or 80% or better.

Since then, the center has flourished, welcoming its inaugural executive director for university engagement, Nika Gueci; settling into its new home at the Arizona Center on ASU’s Downtown Phoenix campus; and rolling out a suite of community-wide events, including trainings, workshops and conferences around mindfulness.\n“The center’s mission is to enforce well-being and mindfulness as a value at ASU,” Gueci said. “We hope to promote the vision of the center to create an academic ‘culture of caring’ by advancing mindfulness and compassion practices at ASU and in the surrounding community to nurture purpose, focus, resilience and connection.”\nThis Friday, Feb. 2, the center will host its first ASU Open Door event, “Mindfulness through the Senses,” from 4 to 8 p.m. in Health North, room 110 at the Downtown Phoenix campus, where students, staff, faculty and community members will be encouraged to engage in mindfulness through sight, sound, smell, movement, taste and touch.\nTaking time to really think about how we experience bodily senses is a good way to understand how mindful practices can be incorporated into everyday life. Mindful eating, for example, “is a very simple thing that you can do on a daily basis,” said Tiara Cash, senior program coordinator with the center. (In the video below, she demonstrates mindful eating.)\nVideo by Ken Fagan/ASU Now\nFriday’s event will feature mindful artwork, samples of tea and essential oils, and a Tibetan singing-bowl demonstration performed by William Heywood, assistant director of ASU’s Design School.\nASU Now spoke with Gueci to get a primer on the basics of mindfulness ahead of Friday’s event.\nQuestion: What is mindfulness?\nAnswer: To me, the practice of mindful awareness is a lifestyle, it is not finite and the mindful practitioner is never “done” exercising mindfulness. Mindfulness is a way of reconnecting with the inner self by bringing attention and awareness to the present moment. Awareness of the ideas and thoughts that go through the mind is important, as thoughts can influence emotions. The way we think about our physical body and our circumstances can either expand or limit our ability to live in the present moment without judgment. In fact, mindful meditation is a practice in being present in the moment without judgment — a way to “be” instead of “do.”\nQ: Some people write mindfulness off as New Age wishful thinking. Is there real evidence to support its benefits?\nA: There is a wealth of literature about mindfulness and meditation … and it shows that mindfulness has been linked to a wide range of benefits in both personal and professional dimensions of life, including: enhanced time-management skills; compassion toward self and others, in other words, kindness; and increased self-efficacy, or the perception of one’s own abilities. In college students in particular, a greater acceptance in the face of disappointments and stressors; resilience, or “bouncing back” from life challenges; and equanimity, or a more balanced mood, are benefits that mindfulness can bring.\nQ: What are the influences behind mindfulness?\nA: We honor the cultures and religions that have used mindfulness for centuries, such as Buddhism. Mindfulness itself, however, is not a religion. Secular interventions such as Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) — created by Jon Kabat-Zinn, professor of medicine emeritus and executive director of the Center for Mindfulness in Medicine, Health Care, and Society at the University of Massachusetts Medical School — were developed to reduce stress, promote a rise in non-judgmental awareness, encourage a positive outlook and increase self-efficacy. MBSR is a formal, eight-week course that aims to guide the student toward leading a more mindful, intentional life. Through sessions such as mindful eating, walking and communication, the student learns to regulate their emotions to external stimulus (i.e., traffic, emails and other people), to react intentionally rather than automatically. In other words, MBSR teaches the student to live a life of one’s own design rather than default.\nQ: What areas of your life can you apply mindfulness to?\nA: There are many ways to practice wellness and mindfulness. Non-judgmental awareness of everyday choices is the first step in adopting or enforcing habits to bring forth your most creative and healthy self. Without judgement, begin by noticing how you feel. For example, how is your mental and physical state affected by lack of sleep versus eight to 10 hours of sleep? How do you feel when you engage in physical exercise? Noticing your habits can lead to more informed decision-making — and that is what mindfulness is: making the daily decisions that allow you to be your best self. Research has shown that mindfulness can enhance focus, creativity and time-management skills; reduce stress and anxiety; and promote a greater equanimity and resilience, which are all skills that support a healthy academic and social life.\nVideo by Ken Fagan/ASU Now\nThere are three more free Open Door events in February:\nEditor’s note: Responses edited for length and clarity.

{"question":"What are wicked sustainability problems (WSPs) and what makes them challenging for engineering students?","answer":"Wicked sustainability problems (WSPs) include issues like climate change, poverty, and resource scarcity. They are particularly challenging for engineering students because they involve complexity, uncertainty, and value conflicts. Students often feel overwhelmed by WSPs when they lack appropriate tools for dealing with these aspects of the problems.","context":["Many of the most pressing sustainability issues are not purely technical problems. To work for sustainable development (SD) requires addressing wicked sustainability problems (WSPs), such as climate change, poverty, and resource scarcity. Previous research has shown that addressing WSPs is challenging for engineering students. In particular, students may feel overwhelmed by a WSP if they lack appropriate tools for dealing with the complexity, uncertainty, and value conflicts that are present in the situation. In this paper, we aim to investigate whether systems thinking competence (ST) can provide such a tool in engineering education for sustainable development (EESD). For this purpose, we elaborate on previous descriptions of WSPs, and draw on (E)ESD literature about ST to discuss different approaches to ST and their usefulness for addressing WSPs. We conclude that ST indeed can be valuable for addressing WSPs, but that it is necessary to be clear about how ST is defined. We suggest that mainstream approaches to ST in engineering education (EngE) are not sufficient for addressing WSPs.\n- Systems thinking competence\n- Wicked sustainability problems\n- Sustainable development\n- Engineering education\nThis is a preview of subscription content, access via your institution.\nBuchanan, R.

{"question":"What challenges did both Gracia and Churchill face in defending their interpretations of texts and historical rights respectively?","answer":"Both faced similar challenges in justifying their interpretative frameworks. Gracia had to defend his definition of texts against those who viewed virtually anything as a text (like car crashes) while maintaining sensible boundaries about what constitutes a text. He argued that texts must be composed of intentionally arranged signs meant to convey meaning. Similarly, Churchill had to defend his interpretation of Jewish historical rights to Palestine against skeptics, notably asserting before the Peel Commission that Jews were the true indigenous population and challenging a commission member who referred to Jews as a 'foreign race.' Both men had to establish clear boundaries and criteria for their interpretative positions while facing opposition from contemporary thinkers.","context":["Issue #03. November 1995.

Gracia. Albany: State University of New York Press, 1995. xxviii + 309 pages.\nA Theory of Textuality is an important and welcome addition to the literature on texts and their interpretation. The value of Gracia's work lies in its extended treatment of the question: What is a text? Much of the literature on hermeneutics and theory of interpretation asks this question only in passing, if at all. The result has been a vague and imprecise conception of textuality which has swelled outside its proper domain. It has become common in continental circles, for example, to conceive of texts as occasions for interpretation. This conception allows dreams, historical occurrences, and other such phenomena to be considered texts. The problem with this conception is that it does not have a clear way to draw the line between text and nontext, for nearly everything is an occasion for interpretation of some sort. To borrow an example of Gracia's, even a car crash could be seen as a text under this conception. Something is clearly amiss with this understanding of textuality, and that cannot be ignored. Gracia sees this clearly and is of the conviction that we must come to terms with the logic of texts, including the definitional elements of their intension and extension, before considering the epistemological questions they pose.\nPart one of A Theory of Textuality examines the logic of texts, and it is here that Gracia deals most directly with the question: What is a text? Chapter one is devoted to the intension of texts, chapter two to the extension of texts, and chapter three to a taxonomy of texts. In chapter one Gracia defines a text as, «a group of entities used as signs, which are selected, arranged, and intended by an author in a certain context to convey a specific meaning to an audience.»(4) Gracia justifies this definition through his characteristically rigorous argumentation, considering various counterexamples and counterarguments. Indeed, one of the virtues of the book is that the author takes his reader through his thought process and argumentation in scrupulous detail.\nTo return to the issue at hand, I find much of merit in Gracia's definition of 'text'. The definition, in fact, explains why we often use what seem to be incompatible predicates as applied to texts. For example, we use both physical predicates (such as heavy) and nonphysical predicates (such as incoherent) in speaking of texts. The distinction between signs and texts which is explicit in Gracia's definition (and which he argues for in detail) explains the apparent contradiction. A physical predicate refers to entities that can constitute texts (among them written signs as well as paper), and nonphysical predicates refer to the meaning of a text. This is a relatively simple and easily acceptable explanation. In fact it is so simple and acceptable that it is easy to overlook its weight and value. Much of Gracia's writing is similarly deceptive. It is often only after some reflection that the reader realizes that he has been mechanically nodding a yes as Gracia has made an important point on a controversial issue.\nGracia's example also explains why, for example, a car crash is not a text, although it may be an occasion for interpretation. Firstly, a car crash is not ordinarily composed of signs as a text must be. Secondly, even if it were composed of signs, these signs would not have been selected and arranged by someone with the intention of conveying meaning. Of course it is possible that one could orchestrate a textual car crash in which various parts of it would be intended as meaningful signs to some esoteric audience, but this is ordinarily not the case. Gracia's definition, then, does not restrict texts to the written, but it does draw sensible boundaries.\nChapter two deals with the extension of texts. Here Gracia is concerned with distinguishing texts from four entities with which they are sometimes confused: language, artifacts, art objects, and works. Texts are frequently composed in languages, but they are not themselves language. Texts do not have the flexibility and independence of authors and audiences that language per se does. A detailed discussion of the nature of artifacts concludes with the claim that texts are artifacts but not all artifacts are texts. An intriguing discussion of the distinction between the artistic and the aesthetic concludes that texts can be art objects or aesthetic objects but they need not be either.\nPerhaps the most provocative discussion in chapter two focuses on the distinction between texts and works. The words 'text' and 'work' have often been seen as synonymous, largely due to their ordinary language use and conceptual overlap. Still, philosophers have sensed that there is a difference between 'work' and 'text', and have made attempts at clarifying the difference. Gracia considers all the most popular and viable attempts, in particular the idea that a work is a type of text. Nehamas has made this view attractive by speaking of works as interpreted texts. This definition does not work, as Gracia points out, because it does not account for translation. There is only one work The Sun Also Rises, but there are as many different texts which embody the work as there are translations of it. Translations are different texts because they are composed of different signs, but we speak of the work as remaining the same even when the text changes in translation.\nGracia proposes that we understand a work as being the meaning of a group of signs which is independent of that group inasmuch as other groups can be used to convey it. It is not the case, however, that the meaning of just any group of signs is a work. Gracia is not far from Nehamas's claim that only interpreted texts are works. Gracia does not hold, however, that all interpreted texts are works, but is somewhat more vague. As he says, «what makes the meaning of a particular text a work is that it fits a certain view of what a work is as developed by a culture at a particular point in history.»(67)\nThis is indeed an appropriate account because we do not speak of the meanings of all interpreted texts as works, but only of a select number. This is the first time in the book that Gracia makes use of a cultural explanation. He does so with impunity here largely because his aims are descriptive. As we shall see, in section two of his book Gracia at times leans too heavily on cultural explanations of normative and epistemological issues.\nChapter three which deals with the taxonomy of texts is the least interesting section of part one, although it contains at least one provocative discussion. Gracia's taxonomy offers both a modal and a functional classification of texts. The modalities of texts include actual texts, intended texts, and ideal texts. The most intriguing and controversial claim of chapter three is that there is no such thing as an intended text. Gracia argues that this is so because a text is always a result of a process of production and does not precede such a process in any way.(72) Upon reflection it does seem true that before the composition of their texts authors have only more or less vague sets of ideas which they aim to realize and embody. They do not ordinarily have a text per se.\nWhat Gracia can prove, however, is only the weaker claim that intended texts are quite uncommon especially when dealing with texts of any length and complexity. Although he addresses the most viable counterexamples, he does not do so successfully in all cases. We can, I submit, have intended texts particularly in the case of short and simple texts. For example, the nervous student who mentally rehearses the answer «Albany is the capital of New York.» only to say «Atlanta is the capital of New York.» surely had an intended text that was not realized in the spoken word.\nIt is true enough, as Gracia might object, that what the student had was an actual mental text. Still, that actual mental text also played the role of intended text for a spoken text that was imperfectly produced. There is no reason that a text cannot be actual in one medium, for example the mental, and intended for another medium, for example the spoken or written. Gracia suggests that we can explain slips of the tongue, such as in the example I have given, in terms of what we 'meant' and not what we 'intended'. Ordinarily we correct slips of the tongue by saying «That is not what I meant to say.» rather than «That is not what I intended to say.» This is very true, but the reason that it is true is that most slips of the tongue are not preceded by intended mental texts. Still some can be, as in the example I gave, and in those cases it would be proper to explain «That is not what I intended to say.» In the end, though, we owe a debt to Gracia for at least making us aware that intended texts are exceedingly scarce, especially for long and complex texts.\nPart two of A Theory of Textuality deals with the epistemology of texts, specifically with questions of understanding, interpretation, and discernibility. Perhaps the greatest merit of chapter four is its clear and precise distinction between 'understanding' and 'meaning'. «Understanding is a kind of mental act whereby one grasps something which in the case of texts is their meaning.»(103) Meaning, on the other hand, is what is understood when one is said to understand a text.(108) Gracia has much of value to say about the nature of understanding itself, but his most important contribution here is this simple yet vital distinction between 'meaning' and 'understanding'. The two terms are frequently used as interchangeable in the literature, and clearly this practice is misguided.\nThe remainder of chapter four is devoted to a discussion of the limits of textual meaning and textual understanding. Noticeably absent from this section of the chapter is a discussion of textual significance. Gracia does deal with significance briefly in chapter one, saying that significance involves the relevance, importance, and consequences of a text.(18) Chapter four, however, is the place where a discussion of textual significance is most clearly needed. Ever since E.D. Hirsch first drew attention to the distinction between a text's meaning as opposed to its significance, this has become a distinction which demands attention. It is, then, disappointing and unfortunate to see it omitted here. Indeed, Gracia's discussion of the limits which authorial intention and understanding place on textual meaning suffers in the absence of a consideration of significance.\nGracia's account of the relationship between a text's «cultural function» and its meaning is also deficient in its neglect of significance. Gracia insists, as many would, that the cultural function of a text plays an important role in the determination of its meaning. I would argue that there are important consequences of a text's cultural function, but these are consequences affecting significance rather than meaning. Certainly this is a point of much debate, and I do not have the space to address it fully here.\nWhether we attribute the relevance of a text's cultural function to its meaning or significance, we must look critically at what the cultural function demands. This is a normative issue which is inextricably bound to the epistemological issue, but one which Gracia neglects. We cannot afford to accept the status quo of textual cultural functions uncritically, just as we cannot afford to accept the cultural dictates of mores and ethics uncritically. Without critical reflection on and ethical analysis of the cultural functions of textual genres we slide down the slippery slope into interpretive relativism. Under Gracia's scheme a culture which took all works of literature to be the word of God would be justified in doing so. Certainly though, such an interpretive practice would demand more justification than mere cultural fiat.\nChapter five «Interpretation» provides an insightful account of the function of interpretations, and makes a keen distinction between two primary types of interpretation, textual and nontextual. Textual interpretations are those whose main or only purpose is to produce understandings of the meanings of texts and of the implications of those meanings. Nontextual interpretations are those whose primary aim is other than to produce such understandings. Nontextual understandings may be, for example, Freudian, Marxist, or feminist. Such interpretations are more concerned with a certain significance of the text than its meaning (although Gracia does not put it in quite these terms).\nThe distinction between textual and nontextual interpretations is important because, as Gracia makes clear, they are very different things and often interpreters are not themselves clear as to what type of interpretation they are offering. Gracia also cogently argues that there is nothing wrong with textual interpretation, as long as it is recognized as such and is built on understanding not misunderstanding.\nChapter six «Discernibility» addresses three questions: 1) How do I know that something is a text? 2) How do I learn the meaning of a text? 3) How can I be certain that I know the meaning of a text? To be clear, the certainty with which we can ever know that something is a text or know its meaning is not apodicitic certainty. Still, Gracia offers well-considered and valuable answers to these questions. The common sense analysis, that ultimately the basis on which we learn the meaning of a text is expected behavior in context, has definite appeal. Gracia claims that behavior is actually the key to breaking the hermeneutic circle. As he says, «to break the circle we need only one case in which we can have certainty that a text has been understood on the basis of something that is not a text.» (206) We should acknowledge that many continental philosophers do not see the hermeneutic circle as being a problem but as actually having an ontologically positive status. Still Gracia's proposal seems to me to be the beginning of a promising solution to one of the problems that has haunted interpretive theory since its inception.\nA comprehensive conclusion to the book follows chapter six. The conclusion brings together all the major elements of Gracia's theory in a few short pages, and will serve as a good reference for the reader who wishes to reacquaint himself with the theory. A thirty-six page bibliography provides the reader with a detailed source of classical and contemporary hermeneutical studies, and a thorough index facilitates searches within the book.\nA Theory of Textuality is an excellent work of philosophy, and is essential reading for all those concerned with the study of texts and their interpretation. I believe both continental and analytic philosophers will find much of value in this book. Although the book is relatively free of struggles with specific historical and contemporary theorists, it reflects a broad reading and consideration of both analytic and continental philosophers. Gracia has continued in the spirit of rapprochement he called for in Philosophy and Its History (1992) by himself delving into much of the continental tradition. His consideration of the postmodernists, deconstructionists, and hermeneuticists is apparent, although these groups are unlikely to find his conclusions congenial. In conclusion, then, this reviewer highly recommends A Theory of Textuality, and wishes to draw the reader's attention to Gracia's forthcoming volume on the metaphysics of texts. This book will complete Gracia's study of textuality and address many of the important metaphysical and ontological issues which were outside the scope of the current volume.\nState University of New York at Buffalo, Department of Philosophy\n607 Baldy Hall45-38-25, Buffalo, New York 14260-1010","Review: Churchill’s Promised Land: Zionism and Statecraft\nby Michael Makovsky (Yale University Press, 368 pages, $36)\nWinston Churchill is not usually regarded as one of the leading British statesmen responsible for Britain’s backing of the Zionist movement and the resurrection of the Jewish national home. The names of Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour, who authored the Balfour Declaration, or his prime minister, David Lloyd George, more readily come to mind. Indeed, Churchill, who in the early 1920s became colonial secretary, is more associated with the 1922 decision to cut off 75 percent of the territory of British Palestine from the proposed Jewish national home to create Transjordan, in order to give the Hashemite dynasty from Arabia a consolation prize of sorts after their loss of Syria to the French.\nMichael Makovsky helps dispel this perception of Churchill in his highly readable Churchill’s Promised Land: Zionism and Statecraft. He discloses how Churchill already expressed his support for restoring Jewish nationhood in Palestine in 1908, nine years before it became British policy. In a written message to the English Zionist Federation in Manchester, which was read aloud in his absence, Churchill in fact wrote: “I am in full sympathy with the historical traditional aspirations of the Jews.”\nChurchill opposed the idea of seeking an alternative Jewish homeland in East Africa, which was under consideration in certain Jewish circles at the time, and instead focused on Palestine, even while it was still formally part of the Ottoman Empire. He concluded his 1908 remarks as follows: “Jerusalem must be the only ultimate goal. When it will be achieved it is vain to prophesy; but that it will some day be achieved is one of the few certainties of the future.”\nChurchill’s Zionism did not come out of a vacuum. Like others in his era, he became a believer in Jewish restorationism — reestablishing the Jewish people as a sovereign nation. His father, Randolph Churchill, was cut from the same philoSemitic cloth, championing Jewish rights in his public addresses. Both were inspired by the great British Conservative leader and former prime minister Benjamin Disraeli, who, though born into a Jewish family, was baptized as a child and became a member of the Church of England.\nDisraeli visited Jerusalem in 1831 and later wrote a novel about a Baghdadi Jew who dreams of leading his people back to Jerusalem to restore their “national existence.” It was a time when Lord Palmerston, the British foreign secretary, was pressing the Ottoman sultan to allow the Jews to return to Palestine. Makovsky delves into this history to better understand the milieu in which both Churchills received their political education, for after Disraeli’s death in 1881, Randolph Churchill tried to claim his political mantle.\nAs Makovsky details, Winston Churchill was fully aware of the Randolph Churchill–Disraeli political connection. Protesting the anti-Semitic pogroms in Russia in 1905, Winston Churchill would cite Disraeli with the remark: “The Lord deals with the nations as the nations deal with the Jews.” This was a double-edged comment promising difficulties for nations that would oppress their Jewish populations, as well as a blessing for those that would defend them.\nChurchill’s story recapitulates a whole school of thought that was prevalent in the early 20th century in England that would provide the eventual political support for the rise of the Zionist movement. After the breakup of the Ottoman Empire as a result of the First World War, the League of Nations approved the mandate for Palestine based on the Balfour Declaration’s support for creating a Jewish homeland.\nThe Palestine mandate gave recognition to “the historical connection of the Jewish people with Palestine.” It did not create a new national right, but rather acknowledged a preexisting right that was broadly accepted in international circles within the League of Nations at the time. Although Makovsky does not specifically deal with the legal background of how the Palestine mandate was drafted, it becomes clear when reading his work how British diplomats would come to adopt this kind of language.\nIn fact, in June 1922 Churchill would declare that the Jews had returned to Palestine “as of right and not by sufferance, and that this was based on their ancient historical connection.” Speaking before the Peel Commission years later in 1937, Churchill snapped at a commission member who referred to the Jews in Palestine as a “foreign race.” For Churchill, the Jewish people were the true indigenous population of the land: “The Jews had Palestine before that indigenous population [the Arabs] came in and inhabited it.”\nAnyone reading Makovsky’s book who thinks that Churchill backed the rise of a Jewish national homeland in Palestine because of his concerns with protecting the British Empire’s strategic interests will be surprised. In some Western academic circles, where the rise of the Zionist movement is seen as a manifestation of Western imperialism, it is just assumed that Britain’s motivation for sustaining its wartime support for the Balfour Declaration in the interwar years came out of imperial calculations: Britain sought to safeguard the approaches to its imperial jewel, India, which required control of the Suez Canal in the west, Cape Town in the south, Singapore in the east, and Palestine along the eastern Mediterranean.\nBut in the 1920s, when Churchill was Britain’s colonial secretary, his primary consideration was finding ways of containing the expansion of the newly formed Soviet Union. Initially he even opposed the breakup of the Ottoman Empire and eventually focused on strengthening British-Turkish ties for the same reason. He was hardly enthusiastic about Britain assuming new imperial responsibilities in the Arab provinces of the former Ottoman Empire.\nMakovsky explains how Churchill wrote in 1920 to Lloyd George: “You are up against a shocking bill for Mesopo ta – mia, Palestine & Persia. More will have to be spent in these countries next year than the Navy is demanding to save our sea supremacy.” His view was summarized a year earlier when he insisted that, “The need of national economy is such that we ought to endeavor to concentrate our resources on developing our existing Empire instead of dissipating them in new enlargements.”\nIt becomes clear, reading Makovsky, that for Churchill a peace treaty with post-Ottoman Turkey was Britain’s paramount Middle Eastern interest. Had the new Turkish state not relinquished sovereignty over its former Arab provinces and created a vacuum for the claims of various national movements, one wonders how Churchill’s whole view of the Zionist enterprise would have changed. Still, what emerges from Makovsky is that Churchill never lost his fundamental sympathy with the restoration of Jewish sovereignty. Enraged at the Attlee-Bevin government’s hostility toward the new state, he declared in the House of Commons in 1948 that Israel’s independence was “an event in world history to be viewed in the perspective, not of a generation or a century, but in the perspective of a thousand, two thousand or even three thousand years.”\nRealpolitik tempered many of Churchill’s public statements, but never diluted his faith in Israel’s cause.\nDole Gold ’75CC, ’84GSAS served as Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations from 1997 through 1999.

{"question":"Why was cancer named after a crab, and how do current immunotherapy treatments exploit the body's natural defenses to fight it?","answer":"Cancer was named after a crab because ancient physicians, particularly Galen in the 2nd century CE, noticed that the swollen veins surrounding tumors resembled crab legs. This observation led to the use of the Latin word 'cancer' and Greek 'karkinos' (meaning crab) to describe the disease. In modern treatment, immunotherapy exploits the body's natural immune system, particularly T cells that patrol the bloodstream for threats. These treatments work by teaching the immune system to recognize cancer cells as enemies, despite their similarity to normal cells. Scientists can create customized monoclonal antibodies that specifically target cancer molecules, acting like guided missiles to destroy tumors while sparing healthy tissue. This approach differs from traditional treatments like chemotherapy and radiation, which can damage both healthy and cancerous cells.","context":["This week, we lost two greats to cancer: David Bowie and Alan Rickman. Their passing so sudden, the news hit many hard, but cancer, as so many know too well, can be such a creeping foe. In its own small way, the etymology of cancer bears this out.\nCancer spread into English from French and Latin, both taking the forms cancer. Latin’s cancer is ultimately connected to Greek’s καρκίνος (karkinos). As in its root tongues, the word cancer has had several meanings: “sore” or “ulcer,” the constellation Cancer and sign of the Zodiac, and, unifying these, “crab.”\nAccording to the Oxford English Dictionary, the earliest English record of cancer comes in the late 1300s and is astrological, referring to the fourth sign of the Zodiac, representing the constellation Cancer, or the crab. The sign’s symbol, ♋, is said to depict the claws of a crab.\nHercules, so it goes, crushed a crab while fighting the Hydra. To honor the slain crustacean, Hera, that hater of Hercules, placed the crab among the stars, whose form clusters Cancer’s stars, at least to the ancient imagination.\nIn the early 1400s, English sees a reference to cancer, meaning “crab,” though the creature is likened to disease, in particular ulcers and sores, such were the early meanings of the word. References to tumors appear by the 1500s at least. It seems to me that something approaching a more modern sense begins to emerge in the late 1600s.\nWhile cancer has a very specific medical meaning today, long has it named a spreading and creeping medical malignancy. And ancient, too, is the crab-like depiction of cancer (or the sorts of sores the word denoted in early healthcare). As the Barnhart etymology dictionary explains:\nThe sense of a spreading sore developed, according to the Greek physician Galen, from the resemblance of the swollen veins surrounding the sore to the legs of a crab.\nGalen was an influential and physician working in 2nd century CE – and should now have ruined crab legs for you.\nThe Latin and Greek roots of cancer also cause other English words. Canker is the oldest. It’s cited in early Old English and was associated with ulcers. Via a French form, chancre, especially allied with venereal lesions, comes in the late 1500s. As does carcinoma, which shows its Greek roots (karkinos) more conspicuously. Like carcinogen, a mid-19th century word formed on carcinoma. (Carcinogen, we saw not too long ago, ruined bacon for you.)\nAs for the deeper origins of cancer and karkinos? Indo-Europeanists diagnose *kar-, a root hypothesized to mean “hard” – and indeed related to English’s very hard. These ancient words for crab, so it goes, are named for their hard, outer shell. (This root also produced a Greek word for “rule” and “strength,” preserved in the suffix -cracy, as in democracy.)\nTo put it very mildly, cancer is hard. Really effin’ hard. But that hasn’t stopped us from searching for its Hercules. Indeed, in his final State of the Union address this past week, US President Barack Obama announced a mission to find a cure for cancer – a new moonshot. Which is metaphorically apt for our etymological purposes here, for, perhaps somewhere beyond the constellation Cancer, live on Ziggy Stardust and Alexander Dane.","Immunotherapy—cancer's new frontier\nYour immune system never sleeps. Every moment of the day, immune cells monitor your body for disease, calling for backup when they detect a threat. It's a system that works elegantly—most of the time. It's not foolproof; if it were, we would never get cancer in the first place.\n\"The immune system is supposed to fight tumors, but it doesn't do it very effectively,\" says Dr. Daruka Mahadevan, director of the University of Arizona Cancer Center Early Phase Clinical Trials Program.\nIf the immune system is unable to suppress their development early, abnormal cells can blossom into cancers, and cancers can spread throughout bodies, eventually claiming lives.\n\"So many of my patients feel like cancer is a betrayal of their own immune system's ability to survey and protect them,\" says Dr. Julie Bauman, Cancer Center division chief of hematology and oncology.\nWhen tumors evade detection by the immune system, we turn to chemotherapy and radiation. However, these old standbys don't exclusively target cancer cells and are notorious for the collateral damage rained upon healthy cells, often causing side effects such as nausea and hair loss.\nWhat if we didn't have to subject normal cells to the friendly fire sprayed haphazardly by chemo and radiation? Many cancer researchers are optimistic about immunotherapy, a treatment that harnesses the power of the immune system, teaching it to recognize—and destroy—cancer cells.\n\"An educated immune cell, like a guided missile, can specifically recognize and destroy the tumor target, sparing normal tissues,\" says Protul Shrikant, professor of immunobiology at the UA College of Medicine – Tucson.\n\"The development of immunotherapy has revolutionized the way we treat cancer,\" says Dr. Clara Curiel, leader of the Cancer Center's cutaneous oncology team. \"It's a paradigm shift.\"\nThe idea that the immune system could do the job \"really appeals to people,\" Bauman says. \"There's this notion that we're restoring a natural process in the body, the ability to harness its wisdom to attack cancer.\"\nT Cells: A Crash Course in Immunity\nThe immune system evolved to distinguish between foreign invaders, such as viruses and bacteria, and friendly faces, namely a person's own \"self\" cells. The ability to recognize this difference is essential to keeping the system in balance.\nOne crucial component of the immune army are T cells, which cruise the bloodstream, on the lookout for \"bad guys.\" T cells can call in reinforcements by special-ordering customized proteins called antibodies, which are able to lock onto these \"enemy\" cells and mark them for destruction.\nWhen T cells see a \"non-self\" invader, such as a virus, they mount an attack. But when they see a \"self\" cell, they need to know to leave it alone—otherwise, the immune system would be attacking its own body, a misfire that can lead to autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. When all goes according to plan, the immune system's foot soldiers patrol the body for enemies while leaving innocent civilians alone.\nBut recognizing a cancer cell isn't as easy as it might seem.\n\"Cancer cells arise from our own cells, so they have a lot in common with our normal cells,\" Bauman explains. \"We have to exploit the things that are different about cancer and teach the immune system to recognize cancer as the enemy. Exploiting that difference is tricky.\"\nThe idea to harness the immune system in the fight against cancer is not new. In New York, as the 19th century was ending, a doctor named William B. Coley developed a rudimentary predecessor to immunotherapy. After noticing that some patients with cancers of the bones or soft tissues, called sarcomas, went into remission after coming down with strep infections, he hypothesized that the bacteria that caused strep also killed cancer.\nBased on this hunch, Coley started injecting strep bacteria into sarcoma patients, some of whom experienced dramatic remissions. Rather than directly killing the cancer, the bacteria probably provoked an immune response that was strong enough to wipe out the cancer along with the infection.\n\"He was hyperactivating the immune system by injecting these bacteria,\" says Dr. Emmanuel Katsanis, the Cancer Center's division chief of pediatric hematology and oncology. \"The activated immune system was trying to fight the infection—and, at the same time, fighting the cancer.\"\nIn 1899, Coley's treatment was licensed by Parke-Davis and Co. It certainly wasn't a cure-all, and it was eclipsed by radiation treatment in the early decades of the 20th century. Chemotherapy came into use during the post-World War II period, and by 1965 the American Cancer Society had put Coley's bacterial cocktail on a list of \"unproven\" treatments.\nBut the idea that the immune response to infection could be conscripted in the fight against cancer never completely vanished.\n\"When I first started in oncology,\" Katsanis recalls, \"some of my mentors were saying, 'This patient got a severe infection. Hopefully this has stimulated their immune system and they're not going to relapse.'\"\nThese days, instead of pinning our hopes on the ability of viruses and bacteria to incite the immune system into a cancer-fighting state, we can create more precise tools.\n\"We've learned how to turn antibodies that we engineer in the laboratory into proteins that fight cancer,\" Bauman says.\nScientists customize these so-called monoclonal antibodies to lock onto a specific cancer molecule, and physicians deploy these \"supersoldiers\" into the body. One subtype of monoclonal antibody, called a checkpoint inhibitor, can tinker with a specific component of a T cell, which is akin to a \"brake.\"\nShrikant likens the immune process to driving a sports car.\n\"A Ferrari owner needs to appreciate and understand the use of the accelerator and the brake to enjoy the car over the long haul,\" he explains. \"Otherwise, the Ferrari would be wrapped around a tree.\"\nWhile a normally functioning immune system needs those brakes to protect self cells from immune attack, some cancers can slam on the brakes to suppress the immune response. Checkpoint inhibitors cut the brakes—a boon in an environment in which cancer cells, rather than autoimmune diseases, pose the most serious threat.\nWhat's more, educating the immune system to recognize cancer cells can lead to long-lasting immune responses well after a patient completes treatment.\n\"When you prime the immune system to recognize a target, it stays as a memory in your immune system,\" Curiel explains. If, after treatment, a tumor cell starts replicating again, the immune system \"will remember that it is a 'foreign' target and will attempt to eliminate it,\" she says.\nCollaboration at the UA\nCancer Center researchers traverse the \"bench-to-bedside\" continuum, solving the immune system's riddles to develop new drug candidates. If successful in the lab, these therapies are taken into the clinic to test in patients.\n\"If we want to understand how to fight a disease, we have to do basic research to understand how that disease comes about, or how the body can naturally take care of that disease,\" says Michael Kuhns, associate professor of immunobiology at the College of Medicine – Tucson.\nKuhns' research focuses on the \"conversations\" between T cells and the rest of the immune system. T cells are able to respond to threats and coordinate attacks. Manipulating these messages can change a T cell's behavior.\nKuhns reports that his team already has achieved success in a basic lab setting.\n\"I can redirect T cells to kill targets,\" he says. \"One day, that could have immunotherapeutic applications.\"\nLikewise, Shrikant's research focuses on how T cells recognize and destroy cancer cells.\n\"Our laboratory studies span from detailed understanding of fundamental immunology, to validating in animal models, to early phase clinical trials,\" he says of the ongoing work in his laboratory.\nMahadevan specializes in the development of drugs for lymphomas, including peripheral T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, or PTCL, a cancer of the T cells.\n\"PTCL is an aggressive form of lymphoma, and we don't have any good treatments,\" Mahadevan says. Because immunotherapy harnesses the power of T cells, T-cell lymphoma is an especially challenging target: \"The very cells that we are trying to activate are the cells that are abnormal,\" he says.\nMahadevan's lab has identified a combination treatment that is effective against PTCL tumors in lab mice. While the immune system is suppressed in these lymphomas, his team has been able to wake the immune system back up by blocking the ability of cancer cells to divide, significantly improving the survival of these mice. He is now working with pharmaceutical companies and the National Institutes of Health to find a combination that works in patients.\nAcross campus, collaborations between basic scientists and physician-scientists are helping to expand our understanding of how the immune system can be enlisted in the fight against cancer.\n\"There's incredibly good science on campus, and there are a lot of clinics,\" Shrikant says. \"There's tremendous potential.\"\nDespite the promise that immunotherapy holds, most patients don't experience the dramatic results that make headlines.\n\"It really depends on the disease and the drug, but I would say that 30 percent of the time, we see some efficacy,\" estimates Dr. Hani Babiker, associate director of the Cancer Center Early Phase Clinical Trials Program.\nFor her head-and-neck cancer patients, Bauman estimates immunotherapy's efficacy at about 15 percent.\n\"I've seen patients achieve deep remission that we never thought possible,\" Bauman says. \"I wish this worked for everyone, because if 15 percent of people have meaningful responses to immunotherapy, that means 85 percent come to the table with that level of hope and are disappointed.\"\nTo realize immunotherapy's full potential, it needs to work for more patients.\n\"I don't know whose T cells will be awakened in the right way and attack the cancer, and whose T cells will be awakened in the wrong way and attack the patient,\" Bauman says. \"My hope is that I learn how to unlock the right T cells at the right time for the right cancer.\"\nWhile it's tempting to imagine a future in which immunotherapy alone can vaporize tumors for good, chemotherapy and radiation aren't going away soon, and in fact they can be combined with immunotherapy to increase its effectiveness—leading to longer survival and less disappointment.\n\"I believe we can improve response rates to 70 to 80 percent with these rational combinations,\" Mahadevan says. \"A tumor that is resistant to one immune checkpoint therapy may be really sensitive (to) a combo.\"\nRadiation and chemotherapy directly kill tumor cells in a process that can release cellular debris into the body.\n\"Radiation breaks a cancer cell open and exposes all of its hidden 'guts' to the immune system,\" Bauman explains. \"Chemotherapy directly poisons the cancer cell. It dies an immunogenic cell death, and also shows more of its abnormal contents.\"\nWhen immune cells are activated by immunotherapy drugs, this debris can help train the newly empowered immune system to recognize the enemy.\n\"An army of T cells is waiting to recognize some part of that cancer cell as foreign and, therefore, worthy of attack,\" Bauman says. \"Immunotherapy is there to prime that response and help those T cells become more active.\"\nHope for the Future\nAlthough the idea of immunotherapy is not new, in the clinic it is still in its infancy. The therapy has been responsible for remissions that previously were unimaginable, and patients exhausted by the harsh effects of chemotherapy and radiation may find that immunotherapy is a gentler experience. But most patients fail to respond—while those who do see results also run the risk of potentially serious side effects in which an \"over-revved\" immune system attacks healthy cells.\nAlso in its infancy is precision medicine, a strategy that helps physicians match patients to drugs based on their genetic profiles. Researchers hope to use such an approach to predict which patients are more likely to respond to particular cancer drugs, including immunotherapy, and who might be at risk for side effects. Undertakings such as the National Institutes of Health's Precision Medicine Initiative, from which the UA Health Sciences and Banner Health have received funding, eventually will help physicians choose optimal treatments based on an individual patient's unique cancer genetics.\n\"We have the ability to sequence the human genome, and we have a multitude of immunotherapy candidates,\" Bauman says. \"When these two things come together, we will have powerful cancer therapy for every person. We can wake up their immune system to the unique antigens within their cancer. That is the holy grail.\"\nEnergized by the swift advances in the field over the last couple of decades, scientists and physicians look forward to what the future holds.\n\"It's a really exciting time in drug development,\" Babiker says. \"We're discovering a different modality in cancer treatment—using our patients' own immune system to target and fight the cancer.\"\n\"My hope for the future is that cancer will not be a word we are afraid of,\" Curiel says. \"We have made huge progress in a very short time—it is encouraging.\"\nAlthough there still is much work to do, scientists around the world are devoted to unraveling the secrets of the immune system. UA Cancer Center researchers are involved in laboratory research and clinical trials to plumb the depths of immunobiology, discover new immunotherapy drugs, find more effective treatment combinations and reduce the occurrence of side effects.\nThe hope is that, someday, the wisdom of scientists will join forces with the wisdom of the body to equip our immune cells to lead the charge in vanquishing cancer.\nProvided by University of Arizona"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:da419667-fa8d-40b2-a683-a7a8df85d3ac>","<urn:uuid:6fd754d0-2764-4ae2-9ee1-b82acac69df4>"],"error":null}

But with it come several challenges, and as we improve our ability to share large amounts of information between computers and other digital devices, the risk of that data falling into unauthorised hands increases significantly.\nVarious cryptographic protocols have been introduced to prevent cyber-criminals from accessing sensitive data as it moves through the internet. The most famous of these are secure socket layers (SSL) and transport layer security (TLS).\nSSL has long been defunct, replaced by TLS and its subsequent versions. And with TLS 1.0 and 1.1 deprecated as of the end of 2020, organisations and web hosts wishing to ensure data safety need to move to support TLS 1.2 across all their deployments.\nBut what is TLS 1.2, and how does it work? To answer that, let’s first take a quick look at the history of cryptographic protocols.\nSSL 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0\nBack in 1995, when the internet was still figuring itself out, Netscape created a form of encryption that would allow data to travel safely without the risk of being intercepted. SSL 1.0 was flawed, and never saw general release — but SSL 2.0 followed shortly afterwards and was then superseded by the much-improved SSL 3.0.\nThis final SSL version became the standard for internet encryption for nearly two decades. Unfortunately, as technology improved, so did the capabilities of various online threat actors. In late 2014, the Google Security Team detected a significant security flaw in SSL 3.0, necessitating a new approach to communication encryption. TLS was the solution.\nEnvisioned initially as another SSL protocol upgrade, TLS instead grew into something unique enough to deserve its own designation. And while TLS 1.0 was different enough from SSL as to make interoperability impossible, it was designed with a mechanism allowing it to fall back on SSL 3.0 when needed — at reduced security effectiveness.\nTLS 1.0 was followed by TLS 1.1, improving its security offering and addressing several newly discovered weaknesses in the previous version. And TLS 1.1 was an effective cryptographic protocol for several years. But as with all of the previous protocols, eventually it became outdated and incapable of supporting modern cryptographic algorithms.\nTLS 1.2 addressed these issues while also including increased protection against newly discovered security vulnerabilities.\nWhat Is TLS 1.2?\nTLS 1.2 is simply an upgraded form of TLS 1.1. It was released in 2008, offers improved security, and was designed for high performance and enhanced reliability. To accomplish this, it relies on a combination of symmetric and asymmetric cryptography.\nMore specifically, TLS 1.2 replaces the MD5/SHA-1 combination in the digitally-signed element with a single hash, ensuring increased security in negotiation during the handshake.\nAt the same time, it provides improvements to both the client’s and the server’s ability to designate algorithms for the hash and the signature. TLS 1.2 also supports increased authentication encryption and adds TLS extensions and AES cipher suites.\nTLS 1.2 was a definite improvement over its predecessors. But, as anyone who works with technology knows, you can’t stop progress.\nIn 2018, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) finalised and published TLS 1.3, making it the most advanced and secure cryptography protocol available. TLS 1.3 improved web performance and security by increasing TLS handshake speed, improving load times, and removing obsolete and insecure TLS 1.2 cipher suites.\nSimply put, TLS 1.3 is designed to secure against every known TLS 1.2 vulnerability and simplify the configuration process. So, with TLS 1.3 currently the obvious best choice for online data encryption, why should you still care about TLS 1.2?\nThe TLS 1.2 deadline\nBy the end of 2020, TLS versions 1.0 and 1.1 were no longer supported. That means that websites that don’t support TLS 1.2 or higher are now incapable of creating secure connections.\nAttempting to access those sites using a mainstream web browser will return a ‘secure connection failed’ error message. Similarly, eCommerce sites required to accept credit card payments and remain PCI compliant must use TLS 1.2 or higher.\nThe overwhelming majority of websites currently support TLS 1.2 and will not be affected by the loss of TLS 1.0 and 1.1. That said, there may still be a handful of sites that have not yet upgraded. By delaying support for TLS 1.2, these sites put themselves and their clients at significant risk.\nDangers of not upgrading to TLS 1.2\nTLS 1.2 isn’t simply the obvious next step for Transport Layer Security; it’s an actual solution to serious security threats.\nIn recent years, both TLS 1.0 and 1.1 have become vulnerable to various advanced cryptographic threats, including BEAST and POODLE. Both of these threats allow attackers to take advantage of TLS security weaknesses to recover potentially sensitive data.\nThese are by no means the only threats facing outdated TLS protocols. Organisations that resist upgrading put themselves and their users at risk of data theft.\nBeyond the dangers of insecure data, non-1.2-compliant sites will also suffer significant traffic loss. As visitors attempt to use standard browsers to access these sites, they will encounter the aforementioned error message, essentially deflecting them away from accessing the desired content.\nThis means that these sites will be unable to interact with potential customers or negatively impact an organisation’s credibility. Those who see ‘secure connection failed’ are much less likely to trust that particular site. Outdated TLS versions have also been linked to lower rankings in Google search engine results pages.\nFinally, eCommerce sites that do not have TLS 1.2 support risk up to $100,000 in non-compliance fines and will likely be unable to process payments.\nHow to upgrade to TLS 1.2\nUnfortunately, there is no single button or process to ensure TLS 1.2 compatibility; depending on the platform and software solutions currently in use, the process may be extremely simple or unnervingly complex.\nStart by identifying which systems may need to be upgraded and which don’t. Reviewing local software, legacy systems, and online stores, and payment gateways may reveal TLS vulnerabilities.\nPlatforms and connections that may need to be upgraded to TLS 1.2 include internet information services, web servers, eCommerce applications, and .Net Framework. Thankfully, third-party eCommerce support will likely have already been upgraded.\nWorking closely with IT and security teams is vital, as is creating a detailed migration plan. Upgrading to support TLS 1.2 is essential, particularly as TLS 1.0 and 1.1 are deprecated. But for the best possible protection, upgrade to TLS 1.3 and regularly patch and upgrade TLS software to protect against new threats.\nAs internet information technologies evolve, so do the threats that they face. The coordinated move to TLS 1.2 is an effective solution to help ensure optimal data security, both for organisations and customers."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"english_native_fluent"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:b8384b70-f64a-4d25-81d9-516e038a7926>","<urn:uuid:dae4d72b-087b-465f-9d34-34b6e96e038f>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Can you explain how both quantum teleportation and Panama Canal transit involve the precise measurement and control of movement across distances - what are their key differences and similarities?","answer":"Both systems demonstrate controlled movement across distances but with distinct approaches. Quantum teleportation works by transferring data between photons through fiber optic cables, recently achieving a 60-mile distance using four high-detection-efficiency superconducting detectors. It relies on the quantum property of entanglement, where particles can affect each other regardless of distance. The Panama Canal, spanning 80 kilometers/50 miles, moves ships through a series of locks that precisely control water levels to raise vessels 85 feet above sea level and then lower them again. While quantum teleportation operates at the subatomic level with photons, the Panama Canal handles massive ships, including cargo vessels carrying up to 14,000 containers in its new expanded canal. Both systems require exact measurements and careful control, but operate at vastly different scales and using different physical principles.","context":["A recent demonstration from scientists at the National Institute of Standards and Technology suggests that we may be one step closer to developing quantum teleportation.\nPhysicists have just shattered a new record in the quest to develop quantum teleportation this week by transferring data from one photon to another through a 60-mile fiber optic cable. According to a report from CS Monitor, researchers from the National Institute of Standards and Technology have demonstrated a new design that allows photon detectors to take accurate measurements of even the weakest signals.\nThe report explains that quantum teleportation over fiber optic cables was possible with the use of four high-detection-efficiency superconducting detectors that were just nanometers wide. These SNSPDs allow “highly efficient multifold photon measurements,” which confirm that the quantum states of the original protons were transmitted successfully to the receiving end.\nSubatomic particles behave differently than most observable matter in the universe. The rules of physics fail to apply to photons and other quantum particles as physicists study them. They can become ‘entangled’ with each other, and outside forces have an effect on both as if they were one, regardless of the distance that separates them. This property allowed physicists at the National Institute of Standards and Technology to transfer the quantum state of one particle to a remote location.\nThere still may be a ways to go before we can teleport people instead of just photons. The study can offer new insights into the field of quantum encryption, which could lead to information that is impossible to hack by ordinary means. Over the past twenty years, the information security field has increasingly looked toward the quantum properties of light and matter to increase the speed and distance over which secure information can travel. At this point, engineers have figured out how to transfer a message via a key that unlocks secured information, but not yet an entire message.\nQuantum properties refer to the German scientist Heisenberg’s “uncertainty principle.” It states that if you measure one thing, it is impossible to measure another thing accurately. What does this mean? For example, the position of an electron orbiting an atom cannot be measured at the same time you’re measuring its velocity. If you measure its speed, you are unable to tell exactly where it is at that moment.\nThe uncertainty principle is interesting because it only becomes true when you’re trying to measure something. If you were unable to measure someone’s height and weight at the same time, both would exist in an intermediate state. Luckily, these properties don’t necessarily apply to people like they do to quantum particles.\nPhotons are the easiest particles to observe these properties in. They travel in a wave like formation and are polarized, which means they are constantly tilted in a specific direction.\nQuantum properties are believed to be constant throughout all of time and space. Even if two photons are millions of light-years away at a given instance, the polarity of one photon affects the other. If you could place two observers watching the photon pair at each end of the distance between the particles, a switch in polarity on one end to vertical would result in a shift to a horizontal polarity on the part of the other photon.\nEinstein was famously quoted, “God does not play dice with the universe.” Quantum mechanics were difficult to comprehend, and still are for the most part. Star Trek was famous for citing quantum mechanics as the secret to teleporting across the universe.\nEven half a century after their discovery, quantum mechanics continue to baffle scientists. While the recent NIST demonstration proves that it is possible to alter the state of a photon in a deliberate and calculated fashion, recent developments could very soon lead to increased security for communications.","For the last 100 years the Panama canal has served as a maritime shortcut. This 80 kilometer / 50 mile long waterway connects the Atlantic and the Pacific Ocean without having to sail all the way around the southern tip of South America. The canal uses a system of locks that operates as water elevators to raise vessels 26 meters / 85 feet above sea level. Through the fresh waters of Panama ships can make their way to the other side where they will be lowered again back to sea level. Passing through all of these different stages makes any transit by cruise ship a special experience which should always be on your cruise bucket list. The original Panama Canal The current canal was officially opened on August 15th 1914. Since it’s opening more than one million ships from all over the world have sailed the canal. When the canal was build the maximum width of ships being able to go through was 33,5 meter thus officially establishing the “Panamax” for ships around the world. For over a century almost every ship in the world would not exceed the Panamax. Although the world was ready for bigger ships, the Panama canal was not. Therefore plans were made to create a new canal with a wider span: 55 meter. The new Panama Canal The new panama canal will open up in juni 2016. This $5.25 billion expansion project started in 2007.. For the last 9 years Panama has been working on a new canal where larger ships are able to go through. The new canal will be able to handle cargo ships carrying 14000 20 foot containers. This is nearly three times the size it can currently accommodate. With the opening of the new canal the new Panamax is being established changing the future of the cruise and maritime industry. The old and new canal will both be operational after the opening of the new canal. Cruise ships larger than the original Panamax obviously pass through the new canal whereas other cruiseship from now on have to confirm a preference with reservation on wether they want to pass through the old of new canal. The new locks have been build parallel to the old locks. The rest of the route remains the same.\nPanama canal transit by cruise ship\nA transit through the canal typically takes around 10 hrs. Hours may vary because the speed of your cruise ship will be determined by the canal authorities and pilots.\nIn the early morning 3 pilots will board te vessel the get your cruise ship through the canal. Usually a speaker of the Panama Canal will also board te vessel to give scenic commentary as you go through the canal.\nThere are several locks, lakes and canals that your ship will pass through when transiting through the Panama Canal. From the Caribbean Sea to the Pacific these would be:\nA. Entering the Panama canal at Christobal and leaving the Caribbean sea. This is where you pick up the local pilots and narrator.\nB. Pass through the Gatun locks. This is where the cruise ship will be elevated 26 meters / 85 feet above sea level. If your cruise ship passes through the new canal your ship will use the locks parallel to the old locks.\nC. Sail over the Gatun lakes which is a large fresh water lake through the Panamanian rain forest. Keep your eyes open for pelicans and crocodiles.\nD. Gamboa is the half way point and headquarters of the Panama Canal dredging division.\nE. Sail through the famous Culebra Cut, also known as Gaillard Cut. This is where you will pass gold hill and sail under the Centennial Bridge.\nF. Pass through the Pedro Miguel Locks and Miraflores locks. If your cruise ship passes through the new canal you will just go through 1 set of new locks which runs parallel to the 2 older locks.\nG. You will sail under the bridge of the Americas and have a beautifull view over the skyline of the Panama city.\nH. Exiting the canal at Balboa at the Pacific ocean.\nIf you are doing the transit from the Pacific Ocean to the Caribbean Sea you can obviously start at letter G and work up to A.\nYou can share your experience in the canal with friends and family back home. They can watch your cruise ship go through the locks via the live Panama Canal webcam. Click here to be forwarded to the webcam page.\nMost asked questions about the Panama Canal:\nHow much does it cost to go through? Tolls vary and are never public. It is know however that the most a cruise ship every paid to go through was 500.000 US dollar.

{"question":"What are the key differences in how game design theory is taught through paper-based prototyping versus introductory game development courses, particularly in terms of understanding narrative and player interaction? For example, how does each approach handle storytelling elements?","answer":"Paper-based prototyping focuses on experiential learning through constraints and parameters, such as creating games with specific player counts (one-player, two-player, or three-player games) and exploring gameplay through physical limitations like surface size and game pieces. In contrast, introductory game development courses take a more comprehensive theoretical approach, covering interactive storytelling as a distinct component alongside critical game studies and game design principles. The paper-based approach emphasizes direct player interaction through physical gameplay and rule sets, while digital game development addresses narrative through formal study of traditional storytelling and the specific challenges of interactive narrative. Both approaches aim to teach game design fundamentals, but through different methodological frameworks.","context":["Model syllabus for paper-based game design\nSubmitted by Rafael Fajardo on Wed, 06/20/2007 - 2:41pm\n- To explore the creation of games through experimentation.\n- To protoype 10 paper-based games in 10 weeks.

{"question":"How does carbon tax work as a GHG reduction mechanism, and what are its main limitations?","answer":"A carbon tax works by adding a cost to each unit of greenhouse gas emissions, directly incentivizing lower emissions through financial means. While simple in operation - lower emissions result in lower taxes paid - this approach has key limitations. It does not establish a mandatory cap on emissions, allowing entities to simply pay the tax if more profitable than reducing emissions or pass costs to consumers. Additionally, carbon taxes can potentially worsen poverty, particularly in developing countries. The effectiveness of the tax also depends on whether the penalty is steep enough to drive companies toward more sustainable practices.","context":["Greenhouse gases (GHG) are a group of gases that, when in the atmosphere, reflect sunlight back towards the planet, heating it up as a result. Carbon dioxide, water vapor, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone are the primary gases that carry this property, varying drastically from gas to gas with respect to the magnitude of their contribution and its duration. Cumulatively, this process, known as the greenhouse effect, plays a major role in determining the surface temperature of Earth.\nAs a result of concerns raised over the magnitude and significance of the human role in atmospheric GHG levels, GHG reduction efforts have blossomed, ranging in scale from personal initiatives to international laws and agreements that operate on a truly global level. In the past, GHG levels were restrained to some degree by laws aimed at increasing air quality by reducing pollution. Today, initiatives take aim at the reduction of GHG emissions specifically. These initiatives, alongside standards published through a consensus process, laws and agreements enacted at all levels of authority, and the creation of organizations and processes designed to hold others accountable, together function to address concerns over atmospheric GHG levels.\nStandards, designed by open consensus-based processes, are voluntary guidelines and procedures that represent industry-wide views on the proper way to go about a specific activity, promoting fair competition, interoperability, reliability, and consistency. Regarding GHG, standards exist to guide basic assessment and measurement of GHG, quantification, monitoring, and reporting of GHG reductions or removals at a project or organizational level, as well as more specific standards, such as one detailing a specific test method for measurement of particulate emissions and heating efficiency of outdoor solid fuel-fired hydronic heating appliances.\nLaws and agreements that affect GHG emissions take many forms. Chief among these are enforced mandatory caps or carbon taxes. Additionally, others voluntarily promise to reduce their GHG emissions. In either case, those involved in GHG reduction make assertions about their efforts. In those cases where the amount of GHG emitted is tied to a financial or legal system of incentives and/or repercussions, assertions of GHG emission quantities must be validated/verified by an impartial third-party. GHG emitters must, for example, make assertions based upon GHG emission measurement methods that have been shown to be both accurate and precise, as well as comply with many other prerequisites for trustable and actionable GHG assertions.\nThe impartial third-parties that validate/verify GHG assertions are known as GHG Validation/Verification Bodies (V/VB). The American National Standards Institute (ANSI), the national standards organization of the United States of America and its representative internationally, offers accreditation services for V/VBs through the ANSI Accreditation Program for Greenhouse Gas Validation/Verification Bodies. The program essentially does for V/VBs what V/VBs do for those making GHG assertions; it looks for consistency and reliability in the operating procedures of V/VBs, inspiring confidence in the claims they make.\nCap and Trade Programs\nCap and Trade programs, one of the more popular approaches to GHG reduction, seek to reduce GHG emissions by utilizing the free market instead of working against it, consisting of two predictably named parts, an initial cap and subsequent trading. The cap is a mandatory reduction in the total amount of emissions. Trading then serves to incentivize the reduction of GHG emissions by offering a competitive financial motive.\nEssentially, everyone involved receives a certain number of allowances (either for free or by auction), translating to an absolute volume of GHG they can each legally emit. If an entity does not utilize all of their allowances, the remainder can be either kept for use at a later date or auctioned off. Conversely, an entity emitting more GHG than they have in allowances would purchase additional allowances at auction. In this manner, the auction price is dictated by supply and demand. As a whole, Cap and Trade programs are cost-effective with respect to their goal of reducing GHG emissions.\nThe effectiveness of Cap and Trade programs hinges directly upon the accuracy of GHG emissions and reductions data, coupled with rigorous enforcement for instances of fraud or noncompliance. This accuracy is necessary for both the accomplishment of the program’s environmental goals, as well as promoting trust among the companies involved and therefore the market as a whole. ANSI-accredited V/VBs fill this niche, serving as an impartial check upon GHG emitters and assuring that programs like Cap and Trade are achieving their desired goals.\nA tax on GHG emissions is another method of financially incentivizing GHG reduction efforts. Simple in its workings, a carbon tax appends a cost to every unit of emitted GHG. Lower emissions translate directly to less carbon taxes being paid. However, while carbon taxes do encourage reductions in GHG emissions, they do not put a mandatory limit on GHG emissions, allowing for some to simply pay the tax if doing so is more profitable than reducing emissions or, alternatively, passing the cost directly to the consumer or end-user. Comparing carbon taxes to Cap and Trade programs, both options have their relative advantages and disadvantages and care must be taken to select the appropriate GHG reduction strategy.\nHere, as in Cap and Trade programs, accurate GHG assertions are vitally important, creating the same need for V/VBs and the ANSI accreditation process behind them.\nValidation/Verification and Accreditation\nValidation/Verification, as explained earlier, is crucial to any GHG reduction program. However, while V/VBs look at GHG assertions, V/VBs must themselves be tested for competency, impartiality, and consistency. Filling this role, the ANSI Accreditation Program for Greenhouse Gas Validation/Verification Bodies accredits GHG V/VBs based upon their adherence to the requirements set out in ISO 14065:2013, including, for example, the requirement “that validation bodies and verification bodies establish and maintain a procedure to manage the competence of its personnel,” among others. Another relevant standard is ISO 14064-3:2006, offering “guidance for the validation and verification of greenhouse gas assertions.” Additionally, a relatively recently published standard, ISO 14066:2011, will be introduced into the process in the near future as well.\nIn this way, ANSI accreditation serves to assure other entities of a V/VB’s competency and adherence to international and widely agreed upon standards. The ANSI GHG V/VB accreditation procedure is itself thorough, lending additional credibility to those organizations that successfully complete the process, earn accreditation, and go on to retain it after ongoing ANSI surveillance and reassessment.\nThe Entire Process\nThe entire process, with GHG assertions validated/verified by V/VBs and ANSI accrediting those V/VBs, is an integral part of the foundation of any GHG reduction program. Essentially, the influence of ANSI-accredited V/VBs is always preferable. For some emission reduction programs, such as The Climate Registry, a collaboration spanning across Canada, The United States, and Mexico, validation/verification by an ANSI-accredited V/VB is not only preferable but a prerequisite for participation. As today’s world is increasingly concerned with the level of GHG in the atmosphere and the processes that affect it, this system of validation/verification and accreditation is a critically important fixture.\nFor further information, consult, alongside others, the following sources:\nWhat are Greenhouse Gases? From the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), a statistical agency of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE).\nGreenhouse Gas Emissions and Cap and Trade. Both are from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\nThe Frequently Asked Questions section of the ANSI Accreditation Program for Greenhouse Gas Validation/Verification Bodies website.","Examining Governmental Policies\nClimate change has become one of the most significant issues of our time, with Earth’s temperatures already rising above pre-industrial averages and polar ice caps melting at an unheard-of rate. The United Nations defines Climate Change as a “change of climate which is attributed directly or indirectly to human activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere and which is in addition to natural climate variability observed over comparable time periods.” In response to the crisis, world governments have developed and implemented a variety of different policies and laws to reduce emissions and limit global warming, as part of an effort to meet the Paris Agreement’s goal of limiting global temperature increases to below 2°C.\nIn this article, we’ll examine some of the most significant governmental policies related to climate change, discussing their purpose and how they work in theory. We’ll also take a look at some of the potential issues that could arise from implementing these policies, as well as their potential effectiveness in helping to tackle the crisis.\nOne of the most significant governmental policies that exist to address climate change is the introduction of carbon taxes. Carbon taxes typically involve the government imposing a fee on the burning of fossil fuels, measured in terms of tons of carbon dioxide equivalent. The goal of the tax is to induce producers and consumers to move away from carbon-intensive forms of energy and towards solutions that are less polluting. By making it more expensive to release carbon into the atmosphere, the theory is that this will incentivise businesses and individuals to change their habits and reduce their carbon emissions.\nIn practice, one of the potential issues with carbon taxes is that they can exacerbate poverty among some parts of the population, generally in developing countries. Further, it’s not necessarily clear how much of an effect the taxes will have. If the penalty is not steep enough, it may not be enough to incentivise companies to switch to greener and more sustainable practices.\nEmissions Trading Scorcles\nEmissions trading schemes, sometimes referred to as cap-and-trade, are another of the main strategies employed by governments to reduce emissions and tackle climate change. The idea is to limit the overall amount of carbon that can be emitted by creating a cap on the number of permits that allow for the burning of fossil fuels. The permits are then distributed amongst companies or buyers, who can then trade them with each other to control their emissions.\nThe advantage of such a system is that it puts the economic burden on those who are actually causing the emissions, rather than simply raising taxes on everyone. However, the effectiveness of this system is highly dependent on the nature and implementation of the rules, as well as the number of participants involved. If the permits are distributed too liberally, there may be little or no incentive to reduce emissions, and in some cases, the scheme can be easily manipulated, such as in the case of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme.\nRegulations and Laws\nGovernments can also address climate change by instituting regulations and laws that prohibit certain emissions, or require companies to offset their emissions through investments in green technology or other forms of carbon sequestration. These regulations can be both legally binding and voluntary.\nOne example of a legally binding regulation is the EU’s Renewable Energy Directive, which requires companies to acquire a certain portion of their energy from renewable sources or face significant fines or even the suspension of their operations. Similarly, the US’s Clean Air Act regulates the total amount of pollution that motor vehicles are allowed to emit.\nVoluntary regulations, on the other hand, usually take the form of corporate responsibility programs, in which companies commit to certain sustainability standards. For example, the Aleron Group has a Clean By Design program, which commits member companies to reducing their greenhouse gas emissions in order to reduce their impact on the climate. The UN Global Compact is another example of a voluntary program, in which hundreds of companies have agreed to work towards a set of sustainability goals.\nSubsidies and Other Financing Mechanisms\nFinally, governments can also implement policies that provide subsidies or other financing mechanisms to help businesses transition to green practices. These subsidies can take many forms, such as direct payments to companies to invest in green technology, loans or grants to cover the cost of making the transition, or tax credits for companies that make significant investments in renewable energy.\nThese subsidies can be an effective way of providing an economic incentive for businesses to switch to green technology, as it reduces their overall out-of-pocket costs. However, there are some potential issues with using subsidies, as they may end up diverting investments away from existing technologies or economically beneficial practices. Additionally, subsidies can be difficult to manage, as they can be difficult to quantify and require considerable administrative resources to sustain.\nUltimately, governmental policies are an essential part of the effort to combat climate change, as they provide the necessary financial and legal incentives to reduce emissions while ensuring that the burden of the transition to cleaner methods of energy production is shared fairly. Carbon taxes, emissions trading schemes, regulations, laws, and subsidies are some of the most significant strategies employed by governments, though their effectiveness is dependent on the specifics of their implementation and execution. As governments continue to develop and implement new policies to address climate change, it is essential that their approach considers the potential pitfalls of their plans and takes steps to ensure that the necessary investments are made in the most efficient and effective manner."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:13cbb6f4-02a7-49be-93be-c3de1cc9a41b>","<urn:uuid:eed61778-c2ed-4c70-b92d-7f471c4daa3d>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Can both Pittsburgh's HERB robot and modern humanoid robots detect physical contact with humans?","answer":"Yes, both types of robots can detect physical contact. HERB from Pittsburgh's Robotics Institute is designed to tell when it's bumping into someone, while modern humanoid robots are equipped with touch sensors that prevent them from bumping into things and causing self-damage. Both utilize sensors to safely interact with their environment and humans.","context":["After more than a century, steel production in Pittsburgh is all but over, leaving in its wake industries based on higher education, health care, academic research, and robots. Lots of robots. And when it comes to robots, the goal is more focused on building a framework for the future than an infrastructure from the past. And for that reason, the city has become a place where far-flung ambitions are supported and encouraged, even if the end goal is a long way off. Sometimes it’s as “far off” as the moon.\nThat’s where John Thornton wants to go. And while the president of the Pittsburgh-based space-robotics company Astrobotic Technology knows it might take some time to get there, he’s convinced it’s possible. The first step is to build a robot that’s designed to do the most practical things one might imagine about moon exploration: first, deliver exploratory robots to and from the lunar surface. And next, find water there.\n“We call it the FedEx / UPS model,” he says, laughing a little.\nAlso available on YouTube\nThe plan, he says, is to charge a fee (currently estimated at around $550,000 per pound) to deliver cargo to the lunar surface. The deliveries will be done for the benefit of any institution — universities, private companies, and whoever else can afford the cost — and if all goes according to plan, they’ll be shipping as soon as 2019.\nWith the revenues from the FedEx model, they’ll then explore the lunar surface in search of a water source. And from there, it’s anyone’s guess where they’ll go.\n“If you’re trying to tackle something like moon exploration, you don’t start with how to build a futuristic city on the moon,” he says. “You start simple.”\nThat premise tends to embody much of the robotic exploration going on in Pittsburgh right now.\n\"No one really knows what the robot of the future is going to look like.\"\nTake Beyond Theory as an example. This company isn’t going to the moon anytime soon, but they’re taking on a similarly ambitious task: they want to rebuild the human arm from their basement in Pittsburgh’s west suburbs. More specifically, they want to make robotic limbs that can function by detecting eye movements alone.\nFor example: if your arm has been amputated, you might attach a prosthetic limb to your body. But that prosthetic is probably just going to hang there; you won’t be able to grasp objects or wave or type. There are experimental projects — the main one based out of a medical research lab at Pittsburgh’s UPMC hospital chain — that allow people to manipulate prosthetic limbs by simply thinking about it. But those require brain surgery, and they’re not available on the open market.\nBeyond Theory hopes to do the same thing, developing a technology that will understand and act upon the wants and needs of the brain, but without actually cutting into gray matter. They want to create a non-invasive prosthetic arm that’s inexpensive, easy to use, available to the public, and, most importantly, reliable.\nThat’s an ambitious goal. And like Astrobotic’s lunar explorer, the path they’re taking is relatively simple. Baby steps. Astrobotic had the “FedEx / UPS model.” Beyond Theory has the “Pop-Tarts model.”\n“I wanna hire the guy that makes the machine that makes Pop-Tarts,” says Chase Dudley, co-founder of Beyond Theory. The idea is that the Pop-Tart machine “just goes all day and cranks out Pop-Tarts.”\n“For us, one of the main concerns is reliability,” says Chase’s partner and co-founder, Shane Adams. “To have a functional device is great. But it’s not great when it breaks.” Especially when the device is your arm. The goal, he says, is to create a robotic device that’s as consistent and manipulable as the human arm itself. “Can this be used 22 hours straight?” he asks rhetorically. Not yet, but that’s the goal.\nPittsburgh today is a city with big goals.\nJust ask Siddhartha Srinivasa, an associate professor in Carnegie Mellon University’s Robotics Institute, who oversees the Home Exploring Robot Butler project (HERB). Although the immediate goal is to design a machine that can perform “challenging manipulation tasks in places where people live and work,” the broader goal is to create a robot that can exist and interact seamlessly with a human environment. A robot that can tell when it’s bumping into someone, for instance. Or that can find and retrieve a milk carton from the refrigerator. A robot that can be, in a sense, human. Srinivasa says HERB’s not there quite yet. But that’s the goal.\n“No one really knows what the robot of the future is going to look like,” Srinivasa says. “And that’s the beauty of robotics. It’s not so rigidly structured — like a car, for example. Robots can be anything. And so, we’re still in the stage where we’re trying to figure out what these robots should look like, what they should be, how they should behave.”\nAnd that’s an exciting place to be, he says.","The use of humanoid robots is becoming widespread all over the world. Humanoid robots are designed to mimic the human body and differ from other kinds of robots such as industrial ones in that their movement is human-like, based on legged locomotion, especially biped gait. They move about the “real world” and interact with it, performing a growing diversity of specialized and everyday tasks, unlike factory manipulators and other robots that work in highly structured environments.\nSignificantly, the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) plans to send a humanoid robot into space towards 2020-end as part of a crewless mission. The humanoid called Vyommitra, a legless female robot, will help ISRO prepare for its Gaganyaan manned space flight mission, the country’s first attempt at sending humans into space slated for 2022. Before accomplishing this mission, ISRO will send Vyommitra, which can speak but doesn’t move much, into space.\nWhat’s a humanoid robot?\nA humanoid robot’s overall appearance and body shape is built to resemble the human body. Generally, humanoid robots have a torso with a head, arms, and legs, though some of their types may have only some specific human parts, for instance, from the waist up. Some forms of robots have heads designed to replicate human facial features such as the face, eyes, and mouth. Humanoid robots built to aesthetically resemble a male human are termed as androids, while female counterparts are called Gynoids.\nLeonardo Da Vinci is credited with creating one of the earliest forms of humanoids in 1495. Modeled on an armor suit, it could perform several human functions such as sitting, standing, and walking.\nHow do humanoids move, talk, and carry out actions?\nInventors and engineers study the human body structure and behavior (biomechanics) and attempt to simulate human cognition, which relies on sensory information to acquire perceptual and motor skills. First-grade sensors and actuators are deployed to enable humanoids to perform multiple functions. Based on computational models of human behavior, the sensors aid robots in sensing their environments, while cameras allow them to see clearly. Motors or actuators placed at strategic points guide these robots in moving and making gestures. Creating their fully functional and realistic versions necessitates the following mechanisms:\nSensors measure attributes of the human world. Besides the essential requirements of planning and control, sensing plays a significant role in robotic paradigms. To help the humanoids sense their environment, sensors empower them with the ability to touch, smell, sight, hear, and balance themselves properly.\nWhile the hearing sensor helps humanoids hear, decipher, and carry out instructions. Thanks to the touch sensor, they are prevented from bumping into things and causing self-damage. A force sensor helps them maintain balance and orientation, and heat and pain sensors enable them to know the impending harm or damage. Also, there are facial sensors that make humanoids capable of a wide range of expressions. Therefore, sensors can be categorized under the physical process with which they work or according to the type of sensory information that they give as output.\nScientists are continually working to make the sensors more efficient for accomplishing multiple tasks. They have turned their gaze on proprioceptive sensors (e.g., touch, muscle extension, limb position) to sense the position, the orientation, and the speed of the humanoid’s body and joints. Some of the areas that have received increasing emphasis include: accelerometers to measure the speed from which velocity can be computed by way of integration; tilt sensors to measure inclination; and force sensors placed in robot’s hands as well as feet to measure contact force with the environment.\nAttention has also been given to position sensors that indicate the actual position of the robot (from which the velocity can be calculated by derivation) or even speed sensors. Tactile sensors provide information about forces and torques transferred between the robot and other objects; they use arrays of tactels to provide data on what has been touched.\nIn humanoid robots, vision sensors work to recognize objects and determine their properties. CCD cameras, which use the electromagnetic spectrum to produce an image, are used as the sight faculty of humanoids. Usually, microphones are deployed to enable the functionality of sound sensors that allow the robots to hear speech and environmental sounds.\nActuators or motors\nActuators or the motors responsible for motion in the robot, help robots move and make gestures akin to the flexible human body. Strong, efficient actuators can perform a wide range of actions, much like humans or even better.\nHumanoid robots mainly utilize rotary actuators that perform human motions, much like muscles and joints, though with a different structure. Actuators can be either hydraulic, electric, piezoelectric, ultrasonic, or pneumatic.\nHydraulic actuators operate at low speed and high load applications. Electric coreless motor actuators are better suited for high speed and low load applications, though both can only be made to act in a compliant manner through rigid control strategies.\nPiezoelectric actuators, on the other hand, can produce a small movement with a high force capability after the application of voltage. They are capable of ultra-precise positioning and for generating and handling high forces or pressures in static or dynamic situations.\nUltrasonic actuators generate movements in a micrometer order at ultrasonic frequencies (over 20 kHz). They can be used for controlling vibration, positioning applications, and quick switching.\nPneumatic actuators rely upon gas compressibility to function. Inflated, they expand along the axis, and when deflated, they contract. When one of their ends is fixed, the other will move in a linear trajectory. Intended for low speed and low/medium load applications, pneumatic actuators comprise cylinders, bellows, pneumatic engines, pneumatic stepper motors, and pneumatic artificial muscles.\nAfter the mechanisms that imitate human body parts are put in place, inventors program the instructions and codes that would enable the humanoids to carry out specific functions. Powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI), they can glide around and give replies when asked questions.\nAI is critical to enhancing the level at which humanoid robots can interact with humans. It can make them decipher commands, questions, indication, even understand random, ambiguous statements and give replies laced with wit and sarcasm.\nFunctions of humanoid robots\nInitially, AI was utilized in humanoids for research and experimental tools in several scientific areas such as the study of bipedal locomotion to explore ways to create leg prosthesis, ankle-foot orthosis, biological realistic leg prosthesis, and forearm prosthesis for the neuromuscularly impaired. Some were created for entertainment purposes of singing, playing music, dancing, and speak to audiences.\nNow, the aim of humanoids has extended beyond research and experimentation to functional purposes such as performing various human tasks, such as interacting with human tools and environments and occupying different roles in the employment sector. They are an increasingly common feature in the workplace and can perform human tasks and act as personal assistants, receptionists, front desk officers, and automotive manufacturing line workers. They can help out at homes to assist the sick and elderly as household helps and nursing assistants, perform dirty or dangerous jobs, play and use tools, operate equipment and vehicles designed for the human form.\nThese life-like robots could also prove useful in helping out the children, or any person who needs assistance with day-to-day tasks or interactions. There have been many studies pointing out the effectiveness of humanoid robots supporting children with autism.\nIt has been decided by various countries to send humanoid robots for dangerous and distant space exploration missions, without needing to turn back around again and return to the Earth once the mission is completed. In essence, robots can perform any task a human being can, thanks to AI algorithms.\nScientists are striving to reduce energy consumption in humanoid movements. In this context, studies on dynamics, control, and stabilization of walking biped robots on the surface have acquired crucial importance. Equally important is the maintenance of the robot’s gravity center over the center of the bearing area for providing a stable position.\nAs a humanoid needs information about contact force and its current and desired motion to maintain dynamic balance during the walk, the Zero Moment Point (ZMP) is an essential balancing approach that has been receiving the attention of inventors. Also, they are focussing on planning and control to allow humanoids to move in complex environments, armed with the knowledge of self-collision detection, path planning, and obstacle avoidance.\nHumanoid robots include structures with variable flexibility that provide safety to the robot itself as well as to the people, more degrees of freedom, and wide task availability. To optimize these functionalities, scientists plan to further hone planning and control strategies in the functioning of robots.\nEngineers at MIT and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign have developed a method to control balance in a two-legged, teleoperated robot. It marks an essential step toward enabling a humanoid to carry out high-impact tasks in challenging environments. The robot is controlled remotely by a human operator donning a vest that relays information about the human’s motion and ground reaction forces to the robot. Through the vest, the human operator can direct the robot’s locomotion and feel its motions too. If the human feels that the robot is starting to tip over, she can adjust in a way to rebalance both herself and the robot.\nIn Japan, Prof Hiroshi Ishiguro of Osaka University and his team members have developed a humanoid robot with the ability of a human-like conversation. In the ERATO ISHIGURO symbiotic human-robot interaction project, they focused on the affinity process that emerges during the movement of the robot with a human. Towards this end, they developed a child-like android named “ibuki” who could walk together with the human by using equipped wheels.\nHumanoid robots can talk like us, walk like us, and express a wide range of emotions. Some of them can engage in a conversation; others can recall the last interaction you had with them. With constant advancements in AI, humanoid robots are all set to acquire more developed human attributes and competencies. Advanced android robotics is all set to facilitate the dramatic enhancement of life going forward."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"english_native_fluent"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:ea4da3d6-437e-41bb-8058-71affceeb1cc>","<urn:uuid:0ad66357-c679-40aa-a400-ecbf874f16ac>"],"error":null}

{"question":"What does the Dirac equation tell us about particle physics, and how is this knowledge being applied in modern particle accelerator experiments?","answer":"The Dirac equation, derived in 1928, describes all spin-1/2 massive particles like electrons and quarks, and predicted the existence of antimatter. The equation is represented in its simplest form as [𝑖(𝜕/) - 𝑚]𝜓 = 0 using Feynman slash notation. This theoretical foundation is now being applied in practical experiments at facilities like the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), where particles are crashed together at near light speed in a 27km-long tunnel. The LHC uses this understanding to investigate fundamental physics questions, including the search for dark matter particles and studying matter-antimatter asymmetry through the behavior of beauty quarks in the LHCb detector.","context":["The Dirac equation is a relativistic wave equation derived by Paul Dirac in 1928. In its free form or including electromagnetism interactions, it describes all spin-1/2 massive particles such as electrons and quarks for which parity is a symmetry. The equation also implied the existence of a new form of matter. antimatter, previously unsuspected and unobserved and which was experimentally confirmed several years later.\nAlthough Dirac did not at first fully appreciate the importance of his results explanation of spin as a consequence of the union of quantum mechanics and relativity - and the eventual discovery of the positron - represents one of the great triumphs of theoretical physics. The accomplishment has been described as fully on par with works of Newton, Maxwell, and Einstein.\nAccording to Schrödinger Equation the Hamiltonian operator and momentum operator may be written as (𝑉: potential energy) \n(3.25) 𝑖ℏ ∂𝜓/∂𝑡 = Ĥ𝜓.\n(3.26) Ĥ = -(ℏ2/2𝑚) ∂2/∂𝑥2 + 𝑉\n(3.29) 𝑃^ = -𝑖ℏ ∂/∂𝑥.\nThe operator version of classical total-energy equation 𝐸 = 𝑇 + 𝑉 = 𝑝2/2𝑚 + 𝑉: (𝑇: kinetic energy)\n(3.30) Ĥ = (𝑃^)2/2𝑚 + 𝑉\n(3.31) (𝑃^)2𝛹 = 𝑃^(𝑃^𝛹) = -𝑖ℏ ∂/∂𝑥(-𝑖ℏ ∂/∂𝑥) = 𝑖2ℏ2 ∂2𝛹/∂𝑥2 = -ℏ2 ∂2𝛹/∂𝑥2.\n(3.32) (𝑃^)2 = -ℏ2 ∂2/∂𝑥2\nHence the equation is written formally by\nĤ𝜓(𝑟̄) = 𝐸𝜓(𝑟̄)\nwhere 𝐸 is called the energy equivalence of the Ĥ-operator. Without potential energy Ĥ-operator can be written\nĤ = -(ℏ2/2𝑚) 𝛻2.\nAccording to special relativity the relativistic energy is given by (refer to 'MC Forum 61')\n𝐸2 = 𝑝2𝑐2 + 𝑚2𝑐4 or 𝐸 = ∓𝑐√(𝑝2 + 𝑚2𝑐2)\nwhere the case of 𝐸 < 0 will be for the positron which is the antimatter counterpart of the electron!\nDirac derived a realistic wave equation  which has the form for kinetic energy (operator) \n(2.2) 𝑖ℏ ∂𝜓/∂𝑡 = [-𝑖ℏ𝑐(𝛼^1∂/∂𝑥1 + 𝛼^2∂/∂𝑥2 + 𝛼^3∂/∂𝑥3) + 𝛽^𝑚𝑐2]𝜓 ≡ Ĥ𝜓,\nwhere 𝛼^𝑗 (𝑗 = 1,2,3) and 𝛽^ cannot be a simple number, therefore matrices can be solutions.\nWe consider a particle, such as an electron with mass 𝑚 in field-free region of space here now.\n(14.5) 𝑖ℏ ∂𝜓/∂𝑡 = √ ∣𝑃^2𝑐2 + 𝑚2𝑐4∣ 𝜓\nIf we are to make the standard replacement 𝑃^𝑥 = -𝑖ℏ∂/∂𝑥, etc., folllowing Dirac, we write\n(14.6) 𝑖ℏ ∂𝜓/∂𝑡 = [𝑐𝛼^1𝑃^𝑥 + 𝑐𝛼^1𝑃^𝑦 + 𝑐𝛼^1𝑃^𝑧 + 𝛽^𝑚𝑐2]𝜓\n(14.7) [𝑐𝛼^1𝑃^𝑥 + 𝑐𝛼^1𝑃^𝑦 + 𝑐𝛼^1𝑃^𝑧 + 𝛽^2𝑚𝑐2]2 = 𝑐2𝑃^2 + 𝑚2𝑐4\nMultiplying out the lef-hand side of (14.7) and equating the corresponding terms leads to\n(14.8) 𝛼^12 = 𝛼^22 = 𝛼^32 = 1\n𝛼^1𝛼^2 + 𝛼^2𝛼^1 = 𝛼^2𝛼^3 + 𝛼^3𝛼^2 = 𝛼^3𝛼^1 + 𝛼^1𝛼^3 = 0\n𝛼^1𝛽^ + 𝛽^𝛼^1 = 𝛼^2𝛽^ + 𝛽^𝛼^2 = 𝛼^3𝛽^ + 𝛽^𝛼^3 = 0\nWe call them the Dirac matrices which Dirac found.\n(14.9) 𝛼^1 = 4⨯4 matrix [row-1 (0 0 0 1), row-2 (0 0 1 0), row-3 (0 1 0 0), row-4 (1 0 0 0)],\n𝛼^2 = 4⨯4 matrix [row-1 (0 0 0 -𝑖), row-2 (0 0 𝑖 0), row-3 (0 -𝑖 0 0), row-4 (𝑖 0 0 0)],\n𝛼^3 = 4⨯4 matrix [row-1 (0 0 1 0), row-2 (0 0 0 -1), row-3 (1 0 0 0), row-4 (0 -1 0 0)],\n𝛽^2 = 4⨯4 matrix [row-1 (1 0 0 0), row-2 (0 1 0 0), row-3 (0 0 -1 0), row-4 (0 0 0 -1)],\nOne remarkable feature of the expression is that the matrices are all made from 2⨯2 Pauli spin matrices as\n(14.10) 𝜎^𝑥 = 2⨯2 matrix [row-1 (0 1), row-2 (1 0)], 𝜎^𝑦 = 2⨯2 matrix [row-1 (0 -𝑖), row-2 (𝑖 0)], 𝜎^𝑧 = 2⨯2 matrix [row-1 (1 0), row-2 (0 -1)].\nwhere 𝛽^ can be expressed in terms of unit matrix 𝐼. Thus\n(14.11) 𝛼^𝑗 = 2⨯2 matrix [row-1 (0 𝜎^𝑗), row-2 (𝜎^𝑗 0)], (𝑗 = 1,2,3) and 𝛽^ = 2⨯2 matrix [row-1 (𝐼 0), row-2 (0 -𝐼]\nwhere 𝜎^1 ≡ 𝜎^𝑥 etc.\nThe fact that the Dirac equation is a matrix equation implies that 𝜓 is a now a vector formed out of four functions\n(14.13) 𝜓 = column matrix [𝜓1, 𝜓2, 𝜓3, 𝜓4] ≡ column matrix [𝜓+, 𝜓-]\nwhere 𝜓+ and 𝜓- are two-component vector defined by (14.13).\nThe Dirac equation is studied such that a Lorentz covariant form is given by using 𝛾𝜇 matrices instead of 𝛼^ and 𝛽^ matrices.\n(3.9) 𝑖ℏ(𝛾0∂/∂𝑥0 + 𝛾1∂/∂𝑥1 + 𝛾2∂/∂𝑥2 + 𝛾3∂/∂𝑥3)𝜓 - 𝑚𝑐𝜓 = 0,\nwhere 𝛾0 = 𝛽^, 𝛾𝑖 = 𝛽^𝛼^𝑖 (𝑖 = 1,2,3). When we use Einstein summation convention, it can be written in a short form as follows\n(3.16) (𝑖ℏ𝛾𝜇𝜕𝜇 - 𝑚𝑐)𝜓 = 0,\nwhere 𝜕𝜇 = ∂/∂𝑥𝜇. And if we use natural units such that ℏ = 𝑐 = 1, the equation takes the simpler form as\n(𝑖𝛾𝜇𝜕𝜇 - 𝑚)𝜓 = 0.\nwhich can be written the simplest form using Feynman slash notation, that is, (𝜕/) ≡ 𝛾𝜇𝜕𝜇 as follows\n[𝑖(𝜕/) - 𝑚]𝜓 = 0.\nAccording to the principle of relativity 𝜓'(𝑥') must be a solution which has the form (3.16)\n(3.19) (𝑖ℏ𝛾'𝜇∂/∂𝑥'𝜇 - 𝑚𝑐)𝜓'(𝑥') = 0, ※\nin the primed system, too. And the Dirac equation satisfies the form invariance for the relativity.\nFinally, it is worth noting that that all the coordinates 𝑥0, 𝑥1, 𝑥2, 𝑥3 have the symmetric positions and roles!\nHole Theory \nThe negative 𝐸 solutions to the equation were problematic, but mathematically there is no reason for us to reject the negative-energy solutions. To cope this problem, Dirac introduced hypothesis, known as hole theory, that the vacuum is the many-body quantum state where all the negative-energy electron eigenstates are occupied. It is called Dirac sea. Dirac reasoned that if the negative-energy eigenstates are incompletely filled, each unoccupied eigenstate - called a hole - would behave like a positively charged particle. the hole possesses a positive energy since energy is required to create a particle-hole pair from vacuum. The hole was eventually identified as the positron, experimentally discovered by Carl Anderson in 1932.\nHowever in quantum field theory, a Bogoliubov transformation on the creation and annihilation operators (turning an occupied negative-energy electron state into an unoccupied positive energy positron states and an unoccupied negative-energy eclectron state into an occupied positive energy positron state) allows us to bypass the Dirac sea formalism, formally it is equivalent to it.\nAntimatter of the Utmost Gravity \nDirac gave his Nobel lecture on 12 December 1933 and suggested that Universe could contain both matter and antimatter without us knowing. If Dirac were right, the whole Universe should be a uniform mix of matter and antimatter. Where is this antimatter? Certainly there is no accumulated antimatter on Earth, nor even in the Solar System. If the Universe contains antimatter, examples being the positron and the kaon, then cosmic ray should also contain in cosmic rays.'Fountains' of positrons have been seen by satellite-borne detectors peering into the centre of our Galaxy, but there are no fountains of any other sort of antiparticle.\nWhere has all the Big Bang antimatter gone? If we cannot see any antimatter, perhaps matter and antimatter are separated into distinct domains. The Universe we know is a matter domain. Maybe somewhere else there is a corresponding antimatter domain. Wherever and whenever the boundaries of the domain and antidomain briefly touched, pieces of matter and antimatter would have mutually annihilated to give powerful bursts of radiant energy - gamma rays. As the Universe subsequently cooled down, these gamma rays would have cooled down too and produced a dim but uniform cosmic gamma-ray signal all over the sky. In 1991, the Space Shuttle Atlantis placed into orbit a new eye, the Gamma Ray Observatory (GRO). GRO clearly saw bursts from out space against a faint but uniform gamma-ray backdrop. The gamma-ray background shows no sign of matter-antimatter annihilation processes ever having taken place on a large scale. the Universe we can see looks to have been eternally free of nuclear antimatter.\nThe evolution of the whole Universe has been and still is controlled by the all-pervading forces of gravity and gravity will ultimately seal its fate. If a certain probability of finding a transient quantum pin-point is plugged into Einstein's equation of general relativity, the equation reveal that the quantum bubble expands faster even than the speed of light, doubling its size in just 10-34 of a second. Through called 'inflation' by cosmologist, the matter and antimatter had to resolve their differences, This tug-of-war between the initial expansion phase of gravity and the subsequent pull of aggregate matter has been continuing eve since. However Black hoes caused by the collapse of an antimatter star would look just the same as any other black hole. Moreover, the expansion of the Universe now appears to be gently speeding up rather than slow down. To allow for these effects, some bold theorists suggested that the new face face of gravity is repulsive between matter and matter or antimatter, and antimatter, but is attractive between matter and antimatter. Our understanding of cosmology and the origin of the Universe would require a major rethink, a Copernican revolution for the twenty-first century.\nThe Mystery of the Missing Antimatter \nThe established wisdom is that the energetic fireball of the Big Bang fourteen billion years ago spawned matter and antimatter in perfect balance. If in the first moment matter and antimatter emerged equally from the Big Bang, an instant later they should have annihilated one another. The mystery is more a question of why has matter survived? Searches for antimatter in the rays above the atmosphere are being made by the AMS (Anti Matter Spectrometer) satellites and so on. However none has been seen, not even anything as simple as antihelium but the abundance of individual positrons and antiprotons. All of the evidence suggests that, with the exception of transient antiparticle, everything within several hundred million light years of us is made of matter. Everything that we know about the early universe, from theory, observation and the results of experiments at LEP (Large Electron-Positron Collider), suggests that in the hot aftermath of the Big Bang those numbers would have been ten billion quanta of radiation, ten billion antiprotons, and ten billion and one protons. The inference is that one of the first acts after creation was a Great Annihilation such that the matter-dominated universe today is made from the surviving one out of ten billion protons.Somewhere in the first moments of the universe, earlier than the billionth of a second that was studied by the experiments LEP, an imbalance between matter and antimatter must have emerged.\n* Reference:  T.

After the latest run of experiments ends next month, the huge superconducting magnets that line the LHC’s 27km-long tunnel must be warmed up, slowly and gently, from -271 Celsius to room temperature. Only then can engineers descend into the tunnel to begin their work.\nThe machine that last year helped scientists snare the elusive Higgs boson – or a convincing subatomic impostor – faces a two-year shutdown while engineers perform repairs that are needed for the collider to ramp up to its maximum energy in 2015 and beyond. The work will beef up electrical connections in the machine that were identified as weak spots after an incident four years ago that knocked the collider out for more than a year…\nThe particle accelerator, which reveals new physics at work by crashing together the innards of atoms at close to the speed of light, fills a circular, subterranean tunnel a staggering eight kilometres in diameter. Physicists will not sit around idle while the collider is down. There is far more to know about the new Higgs-like particle, and clues to its identity are probably hidden in the piles of raw data the scientists have already gathered, but have had too little time to analyse.\nBut the LHC was always more than a Higgs hunting machine. There are other mysteries of the universe that it may shed light on. What is the dark matter that clumps invisibly around galaxies? Why are we made of matter, and not antimatter? And why is gravity such a weak force in nature? “We’re only a tiny way into the LHC programme,” says Pippa Wells, a physicist who works on the LHC’s 7,000-tonne Atlas detector. “There’s a long way to go yet…”\nThe search for dark matter on Earth has failed to reveal what it is made of, but the LHC may be able to make the substance. If the particles that constitute it are light enough, they could be thrown out from the collisions inside the LHC. While they would zip through the collider’s detectors unseen, they would carry energy and momentum with them. Scientists could then infer their creation by totting up the energy and momentum of all the particles produced in a collision, and looking for signs of the missing energy and momentum.\nOne theory, called supersymmetry, proposes that the universe is made from twice as many varieties of particles as we now understand. The lightest of these particles is a candidate for dark matter…\nAnother big mystery the Large Hadron Collider may help crack is why we are made of matter instead of antimatter. The big bang should have flung equal amounts of matter and antimatter into the early universe, but today almost all we see is made of matter. What happened at the dawn of time to give matter the upper hand?\nThe question is central to the work of scientists on the LHCb detector. Collisions inside LHCb produce vast numbers of particles called beauty quarks, and their antimatter counterparts, both of which were common in the aftermath of the big bang. Through studying their behaviour, scientists hope to understand why nature seems to prefer matter over antimatter…\nExtra dimensions may separate us from realms of space we are completely oblivious to. “There could be a whole universe full of galaxies and stars and civilisations and newspapers that we didn’t know about,” says Parker. “That would be a big deal.”\nRead the whole article.

Badgers are not fast runners, while coyotes are. The two get together while chasing for food and coyotes benefit from the badgers’ digging abilities. It is unclear whether badgers derive any advantage from coyotes, thus making it difficult to say whether their relationship is that of mutualism or commensalism.\nDeciduous forests are home to a wide variety of plants and animals. They are found in North America, Europe, southwest Russia, Japan, eastern China, southern Chile, New Zealand, and southeastern Australia. The trees found in these forests include ash, oak, lime, beech, birch, and northern arrowwood. Among animals, red squirrels, coyotes, timberwolves, mountain lions, American bald eagles, Eastern chipmunks, European hedgehogs, raccoons, deer, and beavers inhabit the deciduous forests. They share different ecological relationships, one of them being symbiosis.\nThe word symbiotic, in a broader sense, means ‘living in concert’. The two members that are involved in a symbiotic relationship are known as symbionts. Mutualism, commensalism, parasitism, amensalism, and the predator-prey relationship are the main types of symbiosis.\nIn a mutualistic relationship, symbionts benefit from each other. In commensalism, one participant enjoys the benefits from the other participant without causing any harm to it. In a parasitic relationship, one organism thrives on another organism, thus harming it. In a predator-prey relationship, one member is a prey and the other is its predator. Amensalism is a relationship between two organisms where one species is conquered and the other is unaffected. Competition and antibiosis are the two kinds of amensalism. In competition, two members hunt for the same type of food (the larger/stronger member emerges winner). In antibiosis, one organism is killed by another through a chemical secretion. Synnecrosis is a type of symbiosis where the interaction between two members is detrimental to both the organisms involved. Described below are some examples of symbiotic relationships between organisms living in the deciduous forests.\nEastern Chipmunk and Oak Tree\nThe eastern chipmunk has a mutualistic relationship with the oak tree. The chipmunk takes shelter from the tree. Staying on these trees help it seek protection from predators. It takes seeds from the tree and disperses them, thus benefiting the tree too.\nBirds and Deer\nDeer allow birds to eat bugs off their fur. In this way, deer can get rid of the insects on their bodies, while birds derive their food from them.\nAnts and Plant Thorns\nAnts in the deciduous forest nest inside the plants’ thorns to take food and shelter from them. In turn, the ants protect the plants from attack by herbivores.\nMorels and Plants\nMorels attach to the roots of plants to derive nutrition from them. Due to the attachment, the absorption capacities of the plant increase. Thus, even the plant benefits from the relationship.\nRed Squirrels and Oak Tree\nAn example of commensalism in the deciduous forest is that of red squirrels and oak trees. The squirrel receives shelter and food from the oak tree. The oak tree is neither harmed nor benefited from this relationship.\nMoss and Oak Tree\nMoss thrives on the barks of oak trees. The oak tree is unaffected while the moss is saved from choking due to the leaf litter. Here again, the moss is benefiting without harming the oak tree.\nPseudoscorpions and Trees\nPseudoscorpions eat mites under the trees. Thus, they derive food with the help of the trees, without benefiting or harming them.\nRacoons/Owls and Trees\nRacoons and owls live in the trees for shelter and the tree is neither harmed nor benefited.\nInsects and Trees\nSome insects have developed to look like twigs or leaves. This makes it difficult for the predators to spot them. This benefits the insects and the tree is not harmed.\nWhite-tailed Deer and Ticks\nA classic example of parasitism in the deciduous forest would be the relationship between a tick and a white-tailed deer. The tick stays and feeds on the nutrients in the deer. In this process, the deer may get an infectious disease from the tick. The tick sucks in nutrients from the deer and harms it.\nAmerican Beech Tree and Beech Drops\nAnother example of a parasitic relationship would be that between the American beech tree and a plant called beech drops. Beech drops solely grow under beech trees. They lack chlorophyll. They live wholly on the sap of the beech tree. The beech drops have a special root structure known as a haustorium which helps them adhere to the host plant.\nLaetiporus sulphureus and Oak Tree\nThe fungus Laetiporus sulphureus and oak trees share a parasitic relationship. The fungus sucks in nutrients form the oak tree because of which the oak tree does not get all the nutrients it needs.\nMistletoe and Mangrove Tree\nThe mistletoe grows on mangrove trees. It penetrates through the bark of the tree and takes in nutrients, thus weakening the mangrove tree.\nCatalpa Hornworm and Cotesia Congregata\nThe wasp Cotesia congregata injects its eggs into the body of the caterpillar catalpa hornworm with the help of a long sting-like ovipositor. The wasps may also lay eggs on the leaves which are eaten by the caterpillar. These eggs grow into larvae which feed inside the caterpillar. When the wasp grubs grow, they break out through the skin of the larvae and form cocoons. The caterpillar then dies. After a few days, adult wasps come out of the cocoons and find another caterpillar to parasitize.\nSycamore Lace Bug and Sycamore\nParasitism in the deciduous forest is also seen between sycamore lace bug and sycamore. The bugs adhere to the leaves of the sycamore to suck out juices from it.\nOak Treehoppers and Oak Tree\nThe treehoppers suck out sap from the oak tree, thus making the tree devoid of nutrients.\nIndian Pipes and Mycorrhizae\nThe Indian Pipes plant lacks chlorophyll and cannot produce food on its own. It taps into the mycorrhizae and derives carbohydrates from them. The mycorrhizae get carbohydrates from their photosynthesizing plant partner.\nSquawroot and Oak Tree\nThe squawroot is a flowering plant that gets its energy by tapping into the oak’s roots.\nBobcat and Tapeworm\nThe tapeworm lives inside the bobcat and gets its nutrition. The bobcat is harmed in this association.\nBobcat and Deer\nBobcat, the predator feeds on deer and small rodents.\nMountain Lion and Caribou\nIn a predator-prey relationship, one member is a prey and the other member is the predator. An example of this relationship would be a mountain lion preying on a caribou.\nOwls and Birds\nAn owl feeds on rodents and other small birds.\nSkunks and Insects\nSkunks feed on insects and by using their anal scent glands, defend themselves against predators.\nOpossum and Insects/Birds/Frogs/Snakes\nOpossum feeds on insects, frogs, birds, snakes, small mammals, slugs and earthworms. To defend themselves, they act as a dead or sick animal. They hiss at their target if they feel threatened.\nMountain Lions and White-Tailed Deer\nMountain lions are the predators and the white-tailed deer are their prey.\nDog-day Cicada and Cicada-Killer Wasp\nDog-day cicada are preyed on by cicada-killer wasps. These wasps can sting and paralyze a cicada. They fly it home to their burrow and bury it with an egg on it. The egg hatches and the larva of the wasp eats the flesh of the cicada.\nCopperheads and Rodents\nCopperheads, the predators, eat rodents, their prey.\nRed-Shouldered Hawk and Lizards/Insects/Rodents\nThe hawk preys on lizards, insects, and various rodents.\nHawk and Squirrel\nThe relationship between a hawk and a squirrel is a predator prey type. The hawk is the predator and squirrels are the prey.\nEastern Chipmunk and Bald Eagle\nThe eastern chipmunk is food for the bald eagle.\nCougar and Bear\nAn example of competition would be the cougar and the bears. Both these animals fight over fish and deer.\nKudzu and Trees\nThe Kudzu competes with trees for sunlight. It grows up the tree trunk to the top to get sunlight for itself. This in turn deprives the trees from the energy intake from sunlight. The Kudzu also sucks energy from it. The tree dies, leaving the Kudzu as the winner.\nCoyotes and Wolves\nCoyotes and wolves eat animals like hares, small birds, and squirrels. They compete for food.\nBears and Coyotes\nAnimals like bears and coyotes compete in temperate deciduous forests for food and territory.\nSquirrel and Chipmunk\nThe squirrel and the chipmunk compete for food. They also compete with other animals for resources like nesting sites or mates.\nBlack Walnut and Other Plants\nBlack Walnut is an important tree in the deciduous forest. Its leaves and roots secrete hydrojuglone, a chemical, that kills other plants near it.\nDeciduous forests are just a small part of the ecosystem. Thus, the symbiotic relationships given here are only a glimpse of the many different ways in which living beings co-exist on earth.","Mistletoe is a plant with an influential Christmas reputation that has antique beliefs attached to it. It is a plant common in Europe and in North America and is considered a symbol of love.\nIt is the most legendary of plants.\nSome used to call mistletoe an “all heal” plant and thought there was no illness it could not cure. However, mistletoe is, in fact, poisonous, particularly the berries. European customs regarding mistletoe (its scientific name is viscum album) were passed down during immigration to North Americans. It is considered an amulet and a good luck charm, and it is sold everywhere as a Christmas token.\nKissing under the mistletoe is a favored Christmas tradition.\nMistletoe in European tradition\nIn Europe, mistletoe branches were placed over house and stable doors to prevent the entrance of witches.\nMistletoe was held in great reverence in Europe by the Druids. At the start of the new year, and at a particular age of the moon, the mistletoe was cut. Dressed in white robes, Druids would go in search of this sacred plant, one climbing the tree to gather it, separating it from the oak with his golden knife. If, by chance, the mistletoe fell to the ground, it was considered an omen and a great misfortune was to be expected.\nFor the Druids, mistletoe was a protector from all evil. It was believed, too, to be a fertility enhancer and aphrodisiac: however, you may prefer staying away from it for these purposes: as we said, mistletoe is poisonous, and large quantities can be lethal!\nMistletoe in Literature\nMistletoe is present in Classical literature as well: Virgil writes about it in the sixth book of the Aeneid, where he narrates Aeneas’ discent to Hades. The sibyl of Cumae, Virgil says, had ordered Aeneas to find a golden bough, which would have placated the Gods: according to anthropological research, it appears that such branch was, indeed, mistletoe.\nIf you are interested in this particular story, you may like to check out James Frazer’s work: he dedicated his anthropological career to this!\nAnd how should we behave while kissing under the mistletoe? Well, the boy should pick a berry and kiss the girl. He should then keep on picking berries from the mistletoe branch until there is none left, at which point –and only then!– kissing should stop!\nButcher’s Broom and Holly\nButcher’s broom is a plant with sharp pointy leaves like the holly (agrifoglio in Italian, Ilex aquifolium – scientific name). Butcher’s broom also has red berries, just like the holly, but they have a different, more oblong shape. The plant bares tiny greenish flowers. In Italy, butcher’s broom often takes the place of holly for Christmas decorations, since holly has been declared a protected plant and is now illegal to pick.\nWhy the name “butcher’s broom?” Because its branches were used to clean butchers’ blocks in English butcheries. In Italy, it is comically called pungitopo (its scientific name is ruscus aculeatus), which translate as “Prick the Mouse.” The name probes an interesting story indeed. In the past, pungitopo branches were used to save hanging meats, cheeses and salumi from being nibbled by mice. Italian farmers used to gather butcher’s broom for its poker sharp ends, and would use it to scare mice away!\nBunches of it were tied as bouquets, and several were placed around aging foods in cellars and grottos. The sharp edges of the leaves were enough to prick any mouse’s nose and make it scurry away!\nButcher’s broom’s young sprouts were eaten in the place of asparagus, and its seeds were toasted and prepared to replace coffee.\nButcher’s broom was also known among ancient Romans, when its leaves and berries were mashed and added into wine, and were also often used to make a popular wine based decoction.\nHolly was also popular among the Romans, who celebrated the god Saturn with it from the 17th to the 23rd of December. Saturn was the god of agriculture and harvest and was honored in a week long series of celebrations which very much resemble those we have today for Christmas. Romans brought branches of holly into their homes or planted it nearby, as they, too, believed that holly had the capability to ward off evil spirits.\nMore on Mistletoe: its Name, its Varieties\nThe Word ‘mistletoe’ is of uncertain etymology: the English name is said to derive from the Anglo – Saxon misteltan, tan signifying ‘twig’, and mistel from ‘mist’, which in old Dutch meant ‘birdlime.’ Thus, mistletoe means ‘birdlime twig,’ reference to the fact that the berries have been used for making birdlime. Mistletoe berries were excreted in bird droppings and stuck to twigs.\nBirds, moreover, would grip the fruit in their bill, squeezing the sticky, coated seed out to the side, and then wipe their bill clean on a branch: this explains why mistletoe sprouts in trees. Dense clumps would grow well in these trees, attaching themselves on tightly, burrowing down into the trees bark. They make excellent clumps for birds to make their nests and are favored by species such as spotted owl and painted honey eaters.\nAt its natural state, mistletoe is, in fact, a type of parasitic plant. The “Dwarf Mistletoe,” for instance, belongs to the santalaceae family, and relies on its host for nutrients and photosynthesis. It grows on almost any deciduous tree, preferring those with soft bark, and perhaps being commonest on old apple trees.\nMistletoe is a true parasite, for at no period does it derive nourishment from the soil.\nEuropean mistletoe bares robust and beautiful globular white berries that ripen in the Winter and, being an evergreen, has leaves that remain green throughout the colder months. The berries contains one or two seeds each. The plant’s flowers are tiny and yellow, arranged in threes. If they are female, they turn into round shiny berries, that remain luscious until March.\nIt would not be surprising if there was some confusion between these three plants, as they are all common around Christmas time, and, with the exception of mistletoe, which has different leaves and berries, look very much alike.\nMistletoe has a long track record for its mystical uses, and was introduced as a fertility enhancer, thus “the kiss under the mistletoe we know today.” With their red berries and their beautiful green leaves, butcher’s broom and holly are highly decorative and they are both used during Christmas celebrations, in a manner similar to that favored by the Romans, hundreds and hundreds of years ago.\nBy Jackelin J.Jarvis"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"english_native_fluent"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:3b1fcf75-68c3-4047-acd2-c6d96d74fd6e>","<urn:uuid:de8ad72e-297d-4024-aeb3-4a07f8f44137>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How does the brain affect decision making in FHP teens vs regular teens?","answer":"In regular teens, the brain's decision-making ability is affected by an overactive emotional center that makes it hard to plan and think about consequences, especially when peers are present. However, FHP teens face additional challenges - they show distinctively weaker activation in the prefrontal cortex and cerebellum during risky decisions compared to their non-FHP peers. These areas are crucial for higher-order functioning and decision-making. While all teens may struggle with impulsive choices due to their developing brains, FHP teens demonstrate specific neural differences that may make them particularly vulnerable to poor decision-making, especially regarding alcohol use.","context":["Researchers know that adolescents with a family history of alcoholism (FHP) are at risk for developing alcohol use disorders. Some studies have shown that, compared to their peers, FHP adolescents have deficits in behavioral inhibition. A study of the neural substrates of risk-taking in both FHP adolescents and their peers with a negative family history of alcoholism (FHN) has shown that FHP youth demonstrated atypical brain activity while completing the same task as the FHN youth.\nResults will be published in the April 2012 issue of Alcoholism: Clinical & Experimental Research and are currently available at Early View.\n“We know that a familial history of alcoholism is a significant risk factor for future alcohol abuse,” said Bonnie J. Nagel, assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral neuroscience at Oregon Health & Science University as well as corresponding author for the study. “We were interested in determining whether adolescents at heightened risk for alcohol use made more risky decisions during a laboratory task compared to their lower-risk peers. Additionally, we wanted to examine whether differences in brain responses when making risky decisions were present in these two groups. We wanted to investigate pre-morbid neural risk factors during decision making in FHP youth, as opposed to differences in brain response due to heavy alcohol use itself.”\n“This is the first study to examine the neural substrates of risk-taking in FHP adolescents who are substance naïve,” added Megan Herting, a PhD candidate in behavioral neuroscience at Oregon Health & Science University. “A previous study looked at young adults who were drinkers, therefore, it is hard to say if the differences found were purely a pre-existing neural risk factor for alcohol use. Alcohol use may also differentially impact the brains of those with and without a family history of alcoholism. Thus, the current study is a very novel and important piece of work showing that the brain is doing something different during risky decision making in substance-naïve FHP adolescents.”\nStudy authors recruited 31 youth – 18 FHP (12 males, 6 females) and 13 FHN (8 males, 5 females) – between 13 and 15 years of age from the local community. All of the youth had little to no alcohol involvement prior to their participation in the study. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to examine brain responses of the youth during a Wheel of Fortune (WOF) decision-making task, which presented risky versus safe probabilities of winning different amounts of money.\n“While our study found that FHP adolescents did not perform significantly differently on the WOF task compared to the FHN adolescents,” said Nagel, “we found two areas of the brain that responded differently. These areas were in the prefrontal cortex and cerebellum, both of which are important for higher-order day-to-day functioning, such as decision-making. In these brain regions, FHP adolescents showed weaker brain responses during risky decision-making compared to their FHN peers. We believe that weaker activation of these brain areas, known to be important for optimal decision-making, may confer vulnerability towards risky decisions with regards to future alcohol use in adolescents already at risk for alcoholism.”\nHerting noted that higher-order or executive functioning is also important for things like attention, working memory, and inhibition. “Therefore, differences in brain activity may impact the ability of FHP individuals to make good decisions in many contexts, and in particular may facilitate poor decision-making in regards to alcohol use,” she said. “Taken together with other studies on FHP youth, these results suggest that atypical brain structure and function exist prior to any substance use, and may contribute to an increased vulnerability for alcoholism in these individuals.”\nBoth Nagel and Herting believe these findings can help to develop better prevention programs based on familial risk factors. “These findings may suggest a neurobiological marker that helps to explain how family history of alcoholism confers risk,” said Nagel. “Furthermore, our research may aid clinicians who work with high-risk youth to develop effective prevention strategies for these adolescents to promote healthy decision-making.”\nHowever, they both added, having a familial history of alcoholism is just one of many different factors involved in future alcohol abuse. “While having a family history of alcoholism may put one at greater risk for alcohol abuse, personality and behavioral risk factors are also important to consider,” said Nagel. “The combination of genetic and environmental factors is very different for everyone, so some individuals may be at higher risk than others, and certainly there are genetic and environmental factors that can also protect against alcohol abuse. Future research will need to determine the relative influence of these traits on alcohol abuse risk to be able to design specific prevention strategies for different high-risk populations.”\nAlcoholism: Clinical & Experimental Research (ACER) is the official journal of the Research Society on Alcoholism and the International Society for Biomedical Research on Alcoholism. The first co-author of the ACER paper, “Risky Decision-Making: An fMRI Study of Youth at High Risk for Alcoholism,” was Anita Cservenka in the Department of Behavioral Neuroscience at Oregon Health & Science University. The study was funded by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, the Portland Alcohol Research Center, and the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.\nAdolescents with a family history of alcoholism (FHP) are at risk for developing alcohol use disorders.\nA new study has compared the brain activity of FHP youth to peers with no family history of alcoholism.\nTwo areas of the brain – the prefrontal cortex and cerebellum – responded differently during risky decision-making in high-risk youth compared to their lower-risk peers.\nBonnie J. Nagel, Ph.D.\nOregon Health & Science University\nMegan Herting, B.S.\nOregon Health & Science University","Many parents look at their teenagers and ask themselves, “What happened to the sweet child we once knew?” They are now hard to communicate with and always want to be out with their friends. In many ways, teenagers seem able to make reasonable decisions. But, the next thing you know, they and their friends have gone to the wrong place at the wrong time and made some surprising decisions.\nThis is normal adolescence. Adolescence is a period of life when changes happen throughout the body that affect the way teens interact with the world. Hormones are racing. They affect what motivates teenagers’ behaviors. During this time, the brain changes a lot. This causes teens to act in ways they find engaging and motivating.\nResearch studies show that the parts of the brain in charge of making decisions and controlling actions change as a child becomes a teenager. The front of the brain becomes stronger and more involved in adolescents’ decision making. However, although teenagers can make “adult” kinds of decisions, the new brain changes are not yet perfect and can easily result in teenagers making poor decisions. In addition, research being conducted at the University of Pittsburgh’s Laboratory of Neurocognitive Development has found that adolescent brains have a harder time paying attention to mistakes than adult brains. This means that teens might continue to make the same mistakes.\nResearch studies have also found that teens might struggle with planning and thinking about consequences. This is because the part of the brain that is in charge of excitement is very active and much more sensitive to emotional situations. Decision making becomes especially difficult when friends are around because they influence behavior. This may be why studies have found that when teens get in trouble with the law it is usually when they are in a group. For example, one brain study found that when teens are told they are being watched by other teens during a driving video game, they suddenly start making mistakes as the part of the brain that cares about excitement “lights up” (their brain activity shows up in an image during the study). This shows that being around their friends makes teens act more impulsively.\nAlthough adolescents can act irresponsibly and get into trouble, scientists understand that this time of the lifespan has a special purpose. Having a brain that is driven to explore new places and experiences, create new circles of friends and find a partner are very important for succeeding as an adult. It is a process that helps with the transition from being in the protective care of parents to an independent life. It is also important to recognize that the same part of the brain that cares about excitement also cares about learning. So, while adolescents do a lot of things that are impulsive and meant to get rewards, this is also a time when they can learn the best ways to interact with those around them. It’s important that parents and teachers not be discouraged if their teens appear not to care or listen; teens actually are listening and affected by what adults say. We can’t stop guiding and giving advice to the teens in our lives, but we need to do so with a calm tone as they are hypersensitive to emotions."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"english_native_fluent"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:55ba11da-0816-4c4f-a640-3499281f913b>","<urn:uuid:235c6a27-f142-462a-ba45-621d6545c53e>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do the brain regions responsible for communication compare between humans and chimpanzees, and what recent technological advances have helped researchers study these areas in detail?","answer":"The brain regions responsible for communication show remarkable similarities between humans and chimpanzees. Research has found that chimpanzees have an area similar to human Broca's area that becomes active during communicative tasks. Studies using positron emission tomography (PET) showed increased brain activity in this region when chimps were communicating to request food compared to non-communicative tasks. This suggests chimpanzees have a 'language-ready' brain, with neurobiological foundations of communication that may have been present in our common ancestor. In terms of studying these brain regions, technological advances like optogenetics, chemogenetics, and new imaging methods like light-sheet microscopy and serial two-photon tomography have revolutionized how researchers can probe and visualize brain structures and activity patterns in unprecedented detail.","context":["At noon every Tuesday from September through June, scenes from a revolution in neuroscience are playing out at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. Week after week, over 100 scientists cram themselves into a ground-floor meeting room in the Beckman Laboratory. It’s standing-room only as everyone in the Neuroscience Program settles in to hear details of the latest experiments being performed by their colleagues.\nOver the course of an academic year, these “in-house seminars” provide the opportunity for every scientist in the group to know what every colleague is working on. They learn from one another, offer critiques, and riff on one another’s ideas. Casual suggestions can lead to collaborations and important innovations.\nIt’s all part of a historic effort to figure out how the brain works—that magnificent yet endlessly complex and therefore still mystifying structure that “is evolution’s greatest triumph,” in the words of veteran CSHL neuroscientist Josh Huang.\nThis past year, Florin Albeanu, whose lab studies how the brain processes olfactory information, and Pavel Osten, whose group is devising new ways of visualizing the brain, introduced to the rest of the faculty a new method called light-sheet microscopy. It was the fruit of a single comment Albeanu made after a presentation by a member of Osten’s team. “Ideas are cheap,” Albeanu says. “It’s easy to say, ‘I think you can do this another way.’ But making it happen means working together, in this case for years, to solve the many little problems that crop up in new technologies.”\nThis is how progress is made on the continuously advancing front of a scientific revolution. At Cold Spring Harbor, it’s the product of getting the right people together and giving them room to interact and innovate, with a minimum of constraints. “We’re an especially cohesive group,” observes Professor Anthony Zador, neuroscience program chair. “I always say that our group is greater than the sum of its parts.”\nNew technologies create new research opportunities.”\nDavid L. Spector, Director of Research\nThe fact that a relatively small neuroscience group at CSHL is having an outsized impact on a dynamic and highly competitive field was recently reflected in a series of major grants awarded to faculty under the BRAIN Initiative managed by the National Institutes of Health.\nCSHL President Bruce Stillman says the story is actually much bigger, as the Laboratory is now seeing major returns on investments in neuroscience that have been made over a decade’s time. Each has involved committing substantial resources to individual investigators, based on novel, high-risk, high-reward ideas they’ve advanced. The approach is therefore “classic Cold Spring Harbor,” bringing to mind the first days of the Laboratory’s modern cancer research program in the late 1960s and its initial foray into neuroscience during the late ‘70s and early ‘80s.\nBig bet on rodents\n“About a dozen years ago we consciously re-invented ourselves,” says Zador, “focusing on a high-risk research program that we referred to as ‘rodent cognition.’ The aim was to understand the neural mechanisms by which animals perform complex behaviors, using rodents as a model system.” While most of the global neuroscience community has by now seen the light, only a few years ago “there was lots of skepticism about whether it would work,” Zador says.\nThe idea was to use rodents to learn about higher brain functions that many believed could only be studied in monkeys and chimps. Zador and others at the Laboratory had a problem with that. A typical primate experiment was performed on only two subjects at a time and took years to complete. Rodents, in contrast, were easy to breed, readily available, and easy to work with.\nWhat made the decision to focus on rodents seem inspired was the emergence of an array of tools and technologies with which to probe the rodent brain—which despite its comparatively small size is remarkably like the human brain, sharing key features of anatomy and genetics.\nIn 2005, researchers at Stanford demonstrated optogenetics, a technology that would take the neuroscience world by storm. It enabled experimenters to use beams of colored laser light, delivered painlessly through hairlike optical fibers into the brains of living rodents, to selectively switch individual neurons on and off.\nBo Li is among the CSHL neuroscientists who have used optogenetics, along with other tools, to make important discoveries about how specific brain areas and cell types are implicated in specific behaviors. In tracking down the precise area of the brain that governs fear learning and memory—the central amygdala, it turns out—the ability to optically probe genetically defined groups of neurons was vital in Li’s work because there are two sets of neurons important in fear-learning and memory processes. The difference between them, his team learned, was in their release of message-carrying neurotransmitters into the spaces called synapses between neurons. In one subset of neurons, neurotransmitter release was enhanced; in another it was diminished. If measurements had been taken using older methods across the total cell population in the central amygdala, neurotransmitter levels from these two distinct sets of neurons would have been averaged out, and thus would not have been detected.\nNot only could brain cells be controlled with light; chemogenetics made it possible to control individual neurons with engineered receptors and molecular activators. At CSHL, a genetic method called cre-lox recombination also had a great impact. It enabled Josh Huang to engineer two dozen mouse lines that each expressed fluorescent “reporter” molecules specific to individual cell types in the brain. One could image the entire brain and see every cell of a certain neuronal species glowing with green fluorescence. Other tools included deactivated viruses used to trace the sinuous, branching pathways that these cells deploy to communicate with one another.\n“All of these methods made the mouse, in particular, the preeminent system for understanding neural circuits,” says Zador. “We became equipped with techniques and tools to dissect an animal’s behavior at a level we couldn’t have imagined before 2005.”\nA vivid example is the research of Adam Kepecs and team. They have used rodents to study confidence, a brain-based phenomenon so difficult to grasp that we usually refer to it as a “feeling.” How do we know when a rat is exhibiting confidence? Kepecs and colleagues devised a method to study decision making in these animals. The rats were offered an odor that they were trained to associate with one of two doors. When they chose the correct door, they were rewarded. This part was easy for the animals: their selections were almost always correct. Things got trickier when the rats were offered a mixture of the two scents, with one dominating over the other by only a very small percentage. The rats now needed to choose the door representing the dominant odor in order to get their reward—a choice that reflects their best guess.\nThe innovation in this work was that Kepecs was able to measure confidence simply by challenging a rat to wait for the reward to be revealed behind the door. The time they were willing to wait served as a measure of their confidence in their original decision. “This is something that we can measure and create mathematical models to explain,” he says. And indeed he has, in subsequent work. It reveals that rodent and human brains are constantly processing data to make statistical assessments that translate into the feeling we call confidence. It’s a required first step to figure out how nerve cells in specific brain regions actually perform this operation.\nThe team that has made reality of the “rodent cognition” concept (and much more) was put together by CSHL President Bruce Stillman. Over the last decade, new faculty, bearing new ideas, have been brought on board. A great deal of research has been published. Stillman, in describing the state of neuroscience at the lab right now, acknowledges his predecessor. “Jim Watson was right on the cusp,” he says. “It seemed as if research had come to a fork in the road. Jim realized that there was no fork. The only way to move forward in biology was to take the molecular path. That’s what happened in cancer research. But it also is the key fact in understanding how our research on the brain has advanced so remarkably.”\nDirector of Research David L. Spector explains that the application of molecular biology techniques to the brain has given us a handle, literally, on dissecting its thicket of cells, circuits and networks. “Understanding the brain means understanding both the parts and the whole that they comprise,” he says. “It’s like a puzzle—taking the pieces apart, which many of our scientists have done; and putting them back together, which others focus on, to see how they work together as an ensemble that gives rise to consciousness, self-awareness, and thought.”\n“Science itself is always evolving,” Spector points out, “in part because new technologies create new research opportunities. We have transitioned into new areas that have since exploded with activity.”\nCSHL neuroscientists have pioneered the use of several of the new technologies, and were early adopters of most of them, according to Tony Zador. “So now the kinds of things that we’ve been doing for 10 years are just becoming standard at many other places.” This has been a great aid to recruiting the best young scientists, as “they see that the action is in the kinds of stuff that we’re doing,” Zador says.\nThis helps explain how the Laboratory attracts talents like Anne Churchland, whose postdoctoral work at the University of Washington was in primate cognition. Churchland has devoted her lab at CSHL to studying decision-making in both rodents and people. Her innovative approach to figuring out how the brain processes information flooding in from multiple senses is now part of the work of the International Brain Laboratory or IBL, of which the Churchland lab is one of 21 founding members. They’re trying to understand how the brain to combines a vast array of information from prior experience, current sensory stimuli, and internal and environmental contexts, using computational tools to help solve this massive problem.\nComputational biology, in which the Laboratory has made a significant investment in the last decade through the work of the Simons Center for Quantitative Biology, informs the work of the neuroscientists at a deep level. Two members of the neuroscience faculty, Alexei Koulakov and Tatiana Engel, work with data generated by experimentalists to theorize about how the brain is able to do what it does, and how the architecture of its circuitry is related to its astonishing functional capabilities.\nIvan Iossifov, Jesse Gillis, Dan Levy and Michael Wigler, all of them gifted in computational analysis, play key roles in research aiming to uncover the genetic underpinnings of illnesses from autism to schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Dick McCombie, the pioneer gene sequencer, has led his team in multiyear studies of specific “risk” genes in bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.\nApart from technology, the human factor is also critical. Years of experience at CSHL have convinced Director of Research Spector that “it is probably the most interactive scientific environment in the world,” a fact he attributes to the lack of formal academic departments. “It’s one big group, and the keynote is interacting and taking advantage of exciting discoveries and approaches that your colleagues are using and bringing them into another field.”\nHis favorite example—enthusiastically seconded by President Stillman—is what might be called the “molecular biologization” of Zador’s research. An expert on the auditory cortex in the mouse brain, Zador some years ago was influenced by informal discussions with CSHL colleagues about the use of genetic and viral technologies in cancer research. This was the spark that ignited five years of research in his lab, culminating a year ago in their introduction of a strikingly original way of mapping brain circuits. Called MAPseq, it converts the thorny problem of tracing the paths of individual neuronal projections—the axons that carry their information to other cells in the brain—from an optical problem into one of DNA sequencing. On the horizon is BARseq, a related method for mapping the projections of thousands of spatially resolved neurons by combining the high throughput of DNA sequencing with the high spatial resolution of microscopy.\n“This is a fabulous innovation,” says Stillman, “that is the result of Tony getting good input from molecular biologists on our faculty about creating identification tags that we call genetic barcodes, and figuring out how to express them in individual neurons.” Stillman adds that finding new ways to map the brain were a subject of interest at the Laboratory years before a wave of “connectome” projects swept the neuroscience world. He cites an influential 2008 meeting at Banbury Center out of which emerged a proposal by Partha Mitra. To understand how the brain works (or fails to work in disease), it is “critical that we understand its wiring diagram more fully,” Mitra said in a white paper published the following year, a road map for his Mouse Brain Architecture project.\nZador, for his part, wanted to see if brain circuits could be mapped much more rapidly and cheaply than available technology allowed. With MAPseq’s barcoding technology, a single experiment using a single mouse and requiring only a week of work and several tens of thousands of dollars can reveal the destinations of hundreds, thousands, even tens of thousands of neurons. This next-gen way of mapping the brain reveals for every barcoded neuron the location of every part of the brain it is communicating with. It’s a fine example, notes Spector, of how new technologies bring new kinds of information to light.\nZador’s rapid and economical MAPseq method makes it feasible to compare differences in the brains of different individuals, individuals of different genders, and individuals (mice in this case) that model human illnesses. The team has such mouse models to work with as a result of other faculty collaborations. CSHL geneticist Alea Mills has bred a line of mice that carries a powerful genetic mutation strongly implicated in a subset of people with autism. Beyond studying the behavioral impacts of the mutation, it is possible now to use various brain mapping methods to see how such mutations change brain biology—providing, it is hoped, targets for future therapies.\nSuch mapping experiments are in progress in both Zador’s lab and in the lab of Pavel Osten, who has also developed a novel method of looking at the brain called serial two-photon (STP) tomography. It too has caught on in labs across the world. By automating and standardizing the process in which brain samples are divided into sections and then imaged sequentially at precise spatial orientations in two-photon microscopes, Osten has succeeded in making whole-brain mapping mostly robotic, and therefore routine.\nBy tweaking STP, Osten’s team has made it possible for the first time to accurately count how many neurons are active in various brain areas during behavior. Another elaboration of STP enables Osten to comprehensively count the total populations of specific types of cells throughout the mouse brain. The first of these experiments yielded unexpected information about how the brain differs in males and females.\nSex-specific differences in the brain emerge during development, a focus of research by Jessica Tollhukn and colleagues. They join veteran CSHL experts on brain development, Josh Huang and Linda Van Aelst. Huang has shown how various subtypes of brain cells migrate to places in the cortex at key moments early in life. Van Aelst, an authority on how neural cells are generated by precursors and how they use specialized proteins to communicate, has shed light on how aberrations in signaling involving enzymes called small GTPases can result in diseases, including mental retardation.\nTollkuhn’s research has demonstrated for the first time the specific hormone receptors, brain cells and brain regions responsible for masculinization in the mouse. It’s part of her lab’s larger project aimed at understanding how hormones define distinct neurodevelopmental trajectories in male and female brains.\nDoing the near-impossible\nIn another example of improbable collaboration at Cold Spring Harbor leading to important discoveries, teams led by neuroscientist Stephen Shea and biochemist Nicholas Tonks began several years ago to work on different aspects of a common problem—the devastating illness Rett syndrome, an autism spectrum disorder. It all began when a postdoc in each lab had an informal chat at lunch. The neuroscientist explained a difficulty in her research to the biochemist; the latter related the problem to one that he had dealt with in a different context. This launched separate projects on Rett that led to two publications. One, from Shea’s lab, demonstrated in mouse model of a Rett how failure of a gene called Mecp2 has biological consequences that impair learning in adult females. The other, from Tonks’ group and also based on mouse experiments, showed that candidate compounds could ameliorate several behavioral symptoms of the disorder in female mice.\n“The question is: would this kind of cross-fertilization happened somewhere else? I’m not sure it would have,” says David Spector. “It’s an example of what makes Cold Spring Harbor such a unique place to do science.”\n“I call it the CSHL way of doing things,” Tony Zador says. “It’s something about the atmosphere, and a reason we’ve been at the cutting edge for so long. We complement each other. We don’t always work on the same projects, but we influence one another. New technologies get shared, quickly. The overall intellectual atmosphere makes possible here what’s near-impossible elsewhere.”","|Researchers at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center have found the area in the chimpanzee brain involved in the production of chimpanzee manual gestures and vocalizations is similar to what is known as Broca's area in the human brain. The study, available in today's online edition of Current Biology, is the first to directly link chimpanzee and human brain areas associated with communicative behaviors, suggesting chimpanzee communication is not only more complicated than previously thought, but also that the neurobiological foundations of human language may have been present in the common ancestor of modern humans and chimpanzees.\nIn the human brain, Broca's area is one of several critical regions associated with gestures and speech. Human functional imaging studies have shown significant patterns of activity in this area during language-related tasks. Lead researcher Jared Taglialatela, PhD, set out to determine if chimpanzees would show comparable patterns of activity in an area of the brain anatomically similar to the Broca's area.\n\"We were interested in determining the neurobiological underpinnings of chimpanzee communication, as a number of behavioral studies indicate chimpanzees intentionally produce manual gestures, as well as some types of vocal signals, to communicate with humans,\" said Taglialatela.\nFor the study, three chimpanzees each participated in two different tasks. For the communication task, a researcher sat outside the chimpanzees' home enclosures with pieces of food. After a set period of time, the researcher took the food and left the chimpanzee area. When the researcher was present, the chimpanzees produced gestures and vocalizations to request the food.\nFor the baseline task, the researcher again approached the enclosures with food, but this time, chimpanzees received small stones to exchange for pieces of food. After returning a fixed number of stones, each chimpanzee was rewarded with a small piece of food.\n\"The chimpanzees were not communicating with the researcher in this task; they were simply returning stones,\" says Taglialatela. \"We included this task to make sure we really were looking at neural activity associated with communicative signaling and not simply normal motor behaviors,\" he continues.\nDuring each task, researchers used positron emission tomography (PET) to monitor chimpanzee brain activity. Both tasks showed significant brain activity, but researchers found considerably greater levels of activity during the communication task as compared to baseline in an area of the brain similar to Broca's area.\nTaglialatela says, \"One interpretation of our finding is that chimpanzees have, in essence, a language-ready brain. Our results support that apes use this brain area when producing signals that are part of their communicative repertoire.\"\nResearchers plan to further study chimpanzee brain activity by examining chimpanzee perception of communication through the use of prerecorded chimpanzee vocalizations. Additionally, researchers will attempt to determine whether the observed activity in the brain is a result of manual gesture production, vocal production or, as is the case with humans, a result of the production of communicative signals, independent of modality.\nFor more than seven decades, the Yerkes National Primate Research Center, Emory University, has been dedicated to advancing science and to improving human health and well-being. Today, the center, as one of only eight National Institutes of Health-funded national primate research centers, provides specialized scientific resources, expertise and training opportunities. Recognized as a multidisciplinary research institute, the Yerkes Research Center is making landmark discoveries in the fields of microbiology and immunology, neuroscience, psychobiology and sensory-motor systems.

{"question":"What are the performance characteristics of automated industry classifiers, and what security measures are needed to protect their AI components?","answer":"Automated industry classifiers show varying performance levels across different sectors, with some industries like legal services (M69) and financial services (K64) achieving F1-scores of 82%, while others like personal services (S96) only reach 27%. The performance depends heavily on data heterogeneity and vocabulary consistency in company descriptions. To protect these AI components, several security measures are essential: regular independent testing for vulnerabilities like SQL injection, maintaining skilled staff with both cybersecurity and AI expertise, understanding vendor models when using third-party AI, and ensuring the system's ability to explain its recommendations. Additionally, organizations must feed real data into their AI solutions for proper security assessment while avoiding overly broad implementations that would be difficult to monitor from a security perspective.","context":["Assigning industry labels to companies is a manual, costly, slow and error prone process conducted by data providers. In order to solve this problem we developed a fully automated machine learning based industry classification that assigns WZ-2008 labels to companies in no time. Our classifier solely relies on the company purposes, which we extracted from the German company register. The classifier is composed of a natural language processing step and a bag-of-words based elastic-net classifier. This classifier enables us to predict the industry of a company in real-time, rises our data coverage by 30 %, and lowers the costs of the data acquisition to a fraction compared to conventional methods.\nThe state-of-the-art for enriching and enhancing data is to hire click-workers and let them extract information from unstructured data sources. This manual labeling process is slow, costly and error prone due to low experience and skill-level of click-workers. At Implisense we developed a natural language processing driven machine learning model in order to leverage those shortcomings and enhance the quality of our datapoints. This automated system lets us classify newly founded companies in no-time and at zero marginal costs.\nWe have been working on a machine-learning based industry-classifier specifically designed for small companies and startups. Our classifier’s main ingredient is the company purpose, which every company is legally obliged to submit to the German company register (see example).\n|(a) die Herstellung und der Vertrieb von Verpackungen, Verpackungsmaterialien und Behältern aller Art, insbesondere Intermediate Bulk Containern (IBC), und sonstiger Erzeugnisse aus Kunststoff und anderen synthetischen Materialien, aus Metall, Papier und Verbundstoffen insbesondere für die Industrie, (b) die Entwicklung aller hiermit zusammenhängenden Verfahren, insbesondere unter der eingetragenen Marke XXX, (c) die Beratung in Bezug auf die aufgeführten Tätigkeiten sowie (d) die Erbringung von Dienstleistungen und die Vergabe von Lizenzen oder sonstigen Rechten an Beteiligungsgesellschaften und ähnliche Unternehmen sowie für Auftraggeber aller Art einschließlich aller sonstigen in diesem Zusammenhang anfallenden Geschäfte.||(a) the manufacture and distribution of packaging, packaging materials and containers of all kinds, in particular Intermediate Bulk Containers (IBCs), and other articles made of plastics and other synthetic materials, metal, paper and composites, in particular for industry, (b) the development of all related procedures, in particular under the registered trade mark XXX, (c) advice in relation to the listed activities and (d) the provision of services and the granting of licences or other rights to affiliated companies and similar companies as well as for clients of all including all other transactions arising in this context.|\nAs a classification system we use the WZ-2008 schema, which incorporates the European NACE-standard. We trained a machine learning model on a dataset of roughly 650.000 company-purposes and their associated industry labels (as the target variable). From a machine learning perspective the problem can be referred to as a hierarchical, multi-label classification problem. There are 88 fundamental categories, which do split up in a tree-like manner into specific economic branches. Each company can be labeled with up to 3 industry labels.\nNatural Language Processing Approach\nWe experimented with different types of classifiers and concluded that a bag-of-words based logistic regression classifier best meets the problem requirements. Random forest classifiers are not suited due to the high dimensionality and sparsity of the one-hot encoded text-data. Nonlinear classifiers, such as neural networks, don’t give much of an improvement due the high dimensionality of the data. A classifier based on “bag-of-words” focuses on word occurrences but ignores the order in which they appear in the text. Features are extracted from single words and then “thrown into a bag”. This bag refers to an unordered set of features. The following processing steps make up the feature-extracting pipeline, which transforms the textual data into a form that is processable by the classifier.\n- tokenization (splitting up the text into single words, i.e. tokens)\nThe table depicts examples for some of our feature-extraction steps. To enhance the classifiers generalization abilities we use a “compound word splitter” as a special treatment for german compound. Compound words that were torn apart by enumerations are reassembled by our “compound word composer”.\n|compound word composing||Regie – sowie Film-, Fernseh- und Multimedia- und Videoproduktionen\n-> Multimediaproduktionen Fernsehproduktionen Filmproduktionen Regieproduktionen\nBeton-sowie Stahlbetonbauertätigkeit -> Betonbauertätigkeit\n|compound-word-splitting||Süßwarenerzeugnissen -> [Süßwaren, erzeugnissen]\nStahlbetonbauertätigkeit -> [Stahl, beton, bauer, tätigkeit]\nFernsehproduktion -> [Fernseh, produktion]\nMultimediaproduktion -> [Multimedia, produktion]\n|stemming & lowercasing||Demontagearbeiten -> demontagearbeit\nGebäude -> gebaud\nErbringung -> erbring\nThe following visualization shows a raw text (on the left) and it’s corresponding bag-of-words representation (on the right):\n|Die Verwertung von Urheberrechten, das Ausarbeiten von Ideen für Drehbücher, die Übernahme von Regie- sowie Film-, Fernseh- und Video- und Multimediaproduktionen und alle damit verwandten Geschäfte.||verwert urheberrecht , ausarbeit ide fur drehbuch , ubernahm regi – sowi film – , fernseh – video – multimediaproduktion all damit verwandt geschaft . videoproduktion . fernsehproduktion . filmproduktion . regieproduktion multimedia produktion|\nThe classifier is trained to assign weights to each feature and thereby learn to categorize text. In the following visualization the learned feature-weightings are encoded in font-size. Depicted are the features regarding the classification of the WZ2008 label J62 (information technology services).\nMachine Learning Classifier\nWithout further precautions machine learning models often tend to “over-fit” the training set. This effect occurs often if the data’s dimensionality is not significantly smaller than the size of the training set. From a mathematical perspective training a machine learning model means minimizing some sort of error function (i.e., the sum of misclassifications). Adding a regularization term, for example the sum the absolute values of the model’s learnable parameters (l1-norm), leads to a feature-selecting behavior of the linear classifier.\nIn contrast to the naive Bayes classifier the l1-regularized logistic regression classifier inherently incorporates a feature selection and can thus handle features of similar information with respect to the label of interest. The naive assumption of conditionally independent features does not hold for text-classification problems due to the interchangeability of synonymous words or the co-occurrence of inherently related terms.\nResults and Conclusions\nWe trained our machine learning models as one-vs-all classifiers with respect to a manually labeled target variable. We experienced a strong variation of classification performances for different industry labels. The histogram below depicts the F-scores over the 88 two-digit industry labels.\nThe classifier’s capability to predict meaningful industry-classes is strongly dependent on the heterogeneity of the data it was trained on. Depending on the vocabulary and wording that is used to describe a company’s purpose the categorization of certain industries is more demanding than of others. Another source of uncertainty is human inter-raterdisagreements, which we believe vary strongly between the different classes. For industries like M69 (legal and accounting activities) or K64 (financial services) we reach a comparatively good F1-score of 82%, while a sector like S96 (provision of miscellaneous predominantly personal services) only reaches an f1-score of 27%. The table below compares classification performances of the best and most challenging industry sectors:\nIn our productive setting we tuned the models performance towards a high precision (at the cost of a lower recall). This way we don’t have to completely abandon predictions for challenging sectors like S96. Future work lies in extending our NLP-preprocessing pipeline by use of dependency-parse-tags and/or use of word-embeddings obtained from pretrained models as well as deploying methods from the field of deep learning.\nWritten by Tilo Himmelsbach.","Your company has started to use Artificial intelligence (AI), but are you effectively managing the risks involved? It’s a new growth channel with the potential to boost productivity and improve customer service. However, particular management risks need to be assessed in cybersecurity. Start by considering AI trends to put this risk in context.\nWhy Is AI an Emerging Cybersecurity Threat?\nArtificial intelligence is a booming industry right now with large corporations, researchers, and startups all scrambling to make the most of the trend. From a cybersecurity perspective, there are a few reasons to be concerned about AI. Your threat assessment models need to be updated based on the following developments.\nEarly Cybersecurity AI May Create a False Sense of Security\nMost machine learning methods currently in production require users to provide a training data set. With this data in place, the application can make better predictions. However, end-user judgment is a major factor in determining which data to include. This “supervised learning” approach is subject to compromise if hackers discover how the supervised process works. In effect, hackers could evade detection by machine learning by mimicking safe code.\nAI-based Cybersecurity Creates More Work for Humans\nFew companies are willing to trust their security to machines. As a result, machine learning in cybersecurity has the effect of creating more work. WIRED magazine summarized this capability as follows: “Machine learning’s most common role, then, is additive. It acts as a sentry, rather than a cure-all.” As AI and machine learning tools flag more and more problems for review, human analysts will need to review this data and make decisions about what to do next.\nHackers Are Starting to Use AI for Attacks\nLike any technology, AI can be used for defense or attack. Researchers at the Stevens Institute of Technology have demonstrated that fact. They used AI to guess 25% of LinkedIn passwords successfully after analyzing 43 million user profiles in 2017. In the hands of defenders, such a tool could help to educate end users on whether they’re using weak passwords. In the hands of attackers, this tool could be used to compromise security.\nThe Mistakes You Need to Know About\nAvoid the following mistakes, and you’re more likely to have success with AI in your organization.\n1. You Haven’t Thought Through the Explainability Challenge\nWhen you use AI, can you explain how it operates and makes recommendations? If not, you may be accepting (or rejecting!) recommendations without being able to assess them. This challenge can be mitigated by reverse engineering the recommendations made by AI.\n2. You Use Vendor-provided AI Without Understanding Their Models\nSome companies decide to buy or license AI from others rather than building the technology in house. As with any strategic decision, there’s a downside to this approach. You can’t trust the vendor’s suggestions that AI will be beneficial blindly. You need to ask tough questions about how the systems protect your data and what systems AI tools can access. Overcome this challenge by asking your vendors to explain their assumptions about data and machine learning.\n3. You Don’t Test AI Security Independently\nWhen you use an AI or machine learning tool, you need to entrust a significant amount of data to it. To trust the system, it must be tested from a cybersecurity perspective. For example, consider whether the system can be compromised by SQL injection or other hacking techniques. If a hacker can compromise the algorithm or data in an AI system, the quality of your company’s decision making will suffer.\n4. Your Organization Lacks AI Cybersecurity Skills\nTo carry out AI cybersecurity tests and evaluations, you need skilled staff. Unfortunately, there are relatively few cyber professionals who are competent in security and AI. Fortunately, this mistake can be overcome with a talent development program. Offer your cybersecurity professionals the opportunity to earn certificates, attend conferences, and use other resources to increase their AI knowledge.\n5. You Avoid Using AI Completely for Security Reasons\nBased on the previous mistakes, you might assume that avoiding AI and machine learning completely is a smart move. That might’ve been an option a decade ago, but AI and machine learning are now part of every tool you use at work. Attempting to minimize AI risk by ignoring this technology trend will only expose your organization to greater risk. It’s better to seek proactive solutions that leverage AI. For instance, you can use security chatbots such as Apollo to make security more convenient for your staff.\n6. You Expect too Much Transformation from AI\nGoing into an AI implementation with unreasonable expectations will cause security and productivity problems. Resist the urge to apply AI to every business problem in the organization. Such a broad implementation would be very difficult to monitor from a security point of view. Instead, take the low-risk approach: apply AI for one area at a time, such as automating routine security administration tasks, and then build from there.\n7. Holding Back Real Data from Your AI Solution\nMost developers and technologists like to reduce risk by setting up test environments. It’s a sound discipline and well worth using. However, when it comes to AI, this approach has its limits. To find out whether your AI system is truly secure, you need to feed it real data: customer information, financial data, or something else. If all this information is held back, you’ll never be able to assess the security risks or productivity benefits of embracing AI.\nAdopt AI with an Eyes Wide Open Perspective\nThere are certainly dangers and risks associated with using AI in your company. However, these risks can be monitored and managed through training, proactive management oversight, and avoiding these seven mistakes."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:c2b40612-f04f-4cf2-9c30-d6157be85fd9>","<urn:uuid:75c20593-63bc-45e3-ac40-3a0820eb44e8>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do the liturgical and reconciliation-focused aspects of prayer compare between modern interfaith peace initiatives and traditional monastic practices?","answer":"Modern interfaith peace initiatives emphasize prayer as a tool for reconciliation and justice, focusing on bringing communities together through prayers that acknowledge persecution, promote nonviolence, and seek unity across faith traditions. This is exemplified in prayers that lift up persecuted Muslims, Arab-Americans, and Christians while calling for peace and mutual understanding. In contrast, traditional monastic practices, particularly in the Benedictine tradition, structure prayer around regular liturgical rhythms (especially the Liturgy of the Hours) and emphasize individual spiritual development through Scripture-based prayer. While both approaches seek peace, the interfaith focus is on immediate social reconciliation, while the monastic tradition emphasizes personal spiritual transformation through structured prayer practices.","context":["Biblical Justice, General Worship\nWorship Resources for Peace in a Time of Fear\nDecember 15, 2015\nUpdated February 28, 2018\n0 comments 202 views Posted by Office of Social Justice\nIn response to the San Bernardino shooting and increasingly hostile anti-Arab and anti-Muslim rhetoric, the Office of Race Relations and Office of Social Justice have collaborated on this litany and prayer.

Johnston\nSee the end of this article for a more comprehensive Study Guide.\nHow do we discover the ways of prayer? We can learn at home from parents, at the parish from the liturgy or the parish staff, at school from teachers, under the guidance of a spiritual director, on our own from study, or simply by listening to the movements of our hearts as they turn to God in love. We can also learn from the riches of the Church’s tradition of prayer. From among many others, here are four sources from that tradition.\nSaint Benedict (sixth century) is a leading figure in the history of monasticism and the founder of the Benedictine family of religious communities. A brief phrase that expresses the charism of monastic life is ora et labora, “pray and work.” This calls one to be devoted to God and to attend to the needs of self, community, and the wider world—a good recipe for a balanced life. At the heart of one’s daily rhythm of prayer is Scripture, in particular the Psalms—and this goes not only for Benedictines but for the whole Church in its daily prayer of the Liturgy of the Hours.\nA method of praying with Scripture that developed in the monastic tradition is known as lectio divina, a phrase often translated as “sacred reading.” The method is ancient but remains fully relevant for us today.\nIndeed, Pope Benedict XVI has called for renewed attention to lectio divina, saying that he is convinced it can bring the Church “a new spiritual springtime.” Its four parts can be practiced in various ways. The approach presented here is very simple. While useful for anyone, it is especially helpful for those new to lectio divina.\nWhat follows is based on “A Monastic Primer,” found at the New Melleray Abbey website, where it is explained more fully and very beautifully.\nThe first step is reading (lectio). Beginning in a spirit of prayer, open your Bible to the passage you have selected and simply start to read. Read slowly. You are not in a hurry because your point is not to finish the reading but to let God speak to you, here and now, in and through the sacred text.\nThen comes meditation (meditatio), sometimes referred to as repetition (repetitio). When a word or phrase grabs your attention and “speaks” to you, stop reading and simply stay with those words, prayerfully and slowly repeating them several times. No need to think about the text or draw lessons from it; just let God’s inspired Word do its healing, transforming work in you. Repeat the words in this slow, prayerful way for as long as they hold spiritual power. When that passes, return to the first step and continue reading.\nDuring this process, you sometimes will be drawn to offer God a brief word of prayer. This is the third component (oratio). Perhaps the phrase you are meditating on leads you to say to God, in some way, “Thank you for…” or “I’m sorry that…” or “Please help me to….” Such prayers may be very brief; then return to the reading or meditation.\nAt times, this process may lead to an inner silence. Here, no words are used and no thoughts are thought. You simply are present with the Lord in a wordless, loving communication. This is a form of “contemplation” (contemplatio), a fourth aspect of lectio divina. Stay with this prayer as long as it lasts—perhaps just a few seconds or minutes. When it ends, return again to the reading or meditation.\nThe regular practice of sacred reading will fill your mind and heart with a treasure trove of scriptural passages that can nourish your spirit with the power of God’s word. This is an especially fitting method of prayer for catechists who serve as ministers of God’s word.\nSaint Dominic (thirteenth century) devoted his life to preaching the gospel. To be prepared for this ministry, Dominic and his followers devoted themselves to study. Of the various features of Dominican spirituality that we might highlight, let us focus here on this Dominican commitment to study, which they practice not as something alongside and separate from their prayer and spirituality but as a form of it. There is a true “spirituality of study” that all can cultivate—not only in preaching but in all forms of teaching and catechesis.\nAnyone who teaches would want to learn more about those they teach (the learner), how to teach (the process of learning), and what they teach (their subject matter). A way to “pray” our studying of any of these topics is to begin and conclude times of study with moments of prayer, for ourselves that we may gain insight and wisdom, and for our students that they may benefit thereby.\nBut beyond this, the very act of studying and exercising the intellect God gave us in service to the welfare of others can become prayer. This happens when the time spent in study is also infused by the sheer joy of learning, and by our love—of the students we teach, of the subject we teach, of the knowledge and truth we seek to hand on, and of the Truth to whom we seek to lead our students, namely, Christ himself (John 14:6).\nThe more catechists can devote time to study in a spirit of prayer, the more their own catechist spirituality will be deepened and renewed.\nSaint Ignatius Loyola (sixteenth century), founder of the Society of Jesus, or Jesuits, was a master of the spiritual life because he reflected deeply on the ways he experienced God’s love for him and learned how to discern God’s presence and movement in his life. He became uniquely gifted in being able to guide and help others who sought to know God’s love and hear God’s call in their lives. The 30-Day Retreat is perhaps the most famous way the Ignatian practice of discernment is carried on in the Church today.\nFor those unable to take a month for such a retreat, there are other options. One is called the Nineteenth Annotation, where one does the retreat at home over the course of nine months or so, devoting an hour and a half each day to prayer and meeting with a retreat director weekly.\nThere is also an eight-day format that provides an abbreviated experience of the 30-day retreat; for many, this opportunity can prove to be a time of rich blessings and even a turning point in their relationship with God. Even a weekend of prayer at a Jesuit retreat house provides a nourishing taste of what these longer retreats offer.\nAn Ignatian practice that anyone can use, and that St. Ignatius recommended highly, is the daily examen. It takes about 15 minutes (less if need be), typically at the end of the day. The basic steps are these. First, let yourself be still and come to rest in the presence of God. Then recall God’s many good gifts to you, especially those of this particular day, and be thankful.\nSecond, pray that God enlighten your vision and memory to give you a Holy-Spirit-guided perspective on your life, and then ask yourself two questions.\n1. How was God present and active in my life today? Some people review their day like they were watching a movie, while others just let moments arise to consciousness as they will. Either method works. As you recall what happened, then ask yourself:\n2. How did I respond to God’s presence today? See what moments in the day draw your attention. Be honest—and talk with God about how things went. In a way, this is the heart of the daily examen. What do you learn in this conversation with God?\nThird, for the times you may have neglected God’s call, were slow to respond, or were sinful, ask for God’s merciful forgiveness and for healing and strength to be able to respond in a more faithful and loving way in the future. Then look forward to tomorrow, asking for God’s presence and guidance in a spirit of hope and trust.\nCareful and prayerful meditation of this kind each day will help one become more attuned to God’s movement and faithful to God’s call in life.\nEastern Catholic Spirituality\nJohn Paul II often said that the Church would be healthier if we breathed from both lungs—that is, from the Christian traditions of East and West. If we took his advice, those of the Western tradition (such as Roman Catholics) would try to learn something from those of the Eastern tradition. Doing so might lead us to a deeper value of silence, the beauty of the liturgy, or praying with icons.\nHere let me recommend a form of prayer more commonly practiced in the Christian East, often known as the Jesus Prayer. I first learned of this prayer in my college days by reading R. M. French, The Way of a Pilgrim (a book still in print, in various editions), which tells of the journeys of a Russian peasant in the nineteenth century, and of the prayer he learned and its impact on his life.\nThe prayer can be as short as two words, “Jesus . . . mercy.” But its long form is “Lord Jesus Christ, Son of the Living God, have mercy on me, a sinner.” The prayer is valued so highly because it uses the holy name of Jesus (e.g., Galatians 1:3) and the words of Scripture (see Luke 18:13, also 18:38); because it contains the heart of the gospel message of God’s great mercy; and because its use can fulfill the biblical injunction to “pray without ceasing” (see Luke 18:1; 1 Thessalonians 5:17, Romans 12:12).\nThe prayer is used by being repeated. Under the guidance of a staretz, or spiritual director (which is sometimes still recommended as the way to learn it), the peasant began repeating the prayer a few times each day, gradually increasing until he was saying it several thousand times a day. What might happen eventually, as it did to him, is that the prayer “sinks” from the lips and the mind into the heart and becomes what is called “self-actualizing.” It is as though the prayer goes on praying, even without one being conscious of it; once in a while (as when one awakes in the morning or there is a pause in one’s thinking during the day) a moment occurs and one realizes, “Oh, that’s the Jesus Prayer.” Thus, prayer without ceasing.\nThis is a prayer one can use during personal prayer time, simply praying the words slowly in the manner of lectio divina as described above. One could also use the beads of a rosary to pray the prayer in sets of 50. One can use the prayer in other settings as well—for example, while walking, as a way of becoming accustomed to the prayer. Just match the rhythm of the stride with the rhythm of the phrases of the prayer. It can work like this. Left stride (“Lord”), right stride (“Jesus”), left (“Christ”), right (pause), left (“Son of the”), right (“Living”), left (“God”), right (pause), left (“have mercy on”), right (“me”), left (“a sinner”), right (pause); then repeat. With a little practice it becomes quite natural. Does it sound a little strange? Well, what do you do while walking? Why not pray?\nAs the Catechism of the Catholic Church says, “By a living transmission—Tradition—the Holy Spirit in the Church teaches the children of God to pray” (n. 2661). May these and the many other sources from our tradition offer you and your students rich and varied guidance in the ways of prayer.\nDr. Johnston is Assistant Professor in the Department of Religious Studies at the University of Dayton where he teaches courses related to pastoral ministry. He has held parish and archdiocesan catechetical positions, directed a diocesan ministry formation program, and chaired the board of NALM.\nThis is the second article in our series titled “Spirituality: Grounding in the Mystery of God.” Dr. Johnston introduces us to four significant schools of spirituality: Benedictine, Dominican, Ignatian, and Eastern Catholic spirituality. Each school offers a unique approach to prayer, and Dr. Johnston briefly describes examples for practicing each prayer form. Many people do not realize the wealth of prayer forms that have been cultivated within the Church throughout history. As catechists, we are called to introduce our students to the Church’s treasury of wealth and wisdom within our Catholic tradition.\n1. Praying is more than simply saying prayers. How did I learn to pray? What have I learned about praying?\n2. What has been my experience with lectio divina? How do I incorporate lectio divina into my prayer life? What benefits have I realized with this prayer form?\n3. Do I understand “study as a form of spirituality”? What percentage of my week is dedicated to studying Scripture, Church teaching, the lives of the saints, and more? What have I learned from my study? How might I set aside time to incorporate “study as a form of spirituality” in my routine, as expressed in the Dominican tradition?\n4. How do I discern and practice God’s presence and movement in my life? How does the sense of God’s presence impact living each moment of my life? What might I consider for enhancing a more radical sense of God’s presence each day?\n5. What has been my experience of the Ignatian daily exam? If none, how might I consider integrating this prayer form into my life?\n6. What did Pope John Paul II mean by “the Church would be healthier if we breathed from both lungs”?\n7. What is the Jesus Prayer? How might I integrate this prayer into my life?\n8. What have I learned concerning schools of spirituality as a treasure of Catholic Tradition?\n9. What has been my most significant learning in reading and reflecting on this article? How does it connect with the September article by Fr. Heft (go to catechist.com, Support for Catechists, Article Archive, and search author Heft)? What would I like to learn more about regarding spirituality?\n1. Review the steps described in Johnston’s article for practicing or exercising lectio divina. Design a lesson or unit plan for introducing this prayer form to your students.\n2. Begin practicing lectio divina a few times each week. Note the difference that begins to emerge in your spiritual life and professional life.\n3. Applying the Dominican approach of study as prayer, how can you introduce the idea to your students in order to stimulate their appreciation for the value of study as an expression of spirituality? (Be specific.)\n4. If you have not been on a retreat, make a resolution to participate in one the coming year.\n5. Prepare a lesson for demonstrating and guiding your students through the Ignatian daily exam prayer. Discuss why the daily exam is a holy way of living.\n6. Prepare a series of lesson plans or create several prayer experiences that demonstrate the various prayer forms identified in Johnston’s article.\n7. Have students do research and develop a PowerPoint presentation on the schools of spirituality addressed in Johnston’s article.\nGallagher, Timothy M.

{"question":"What are the core elements of authoritarian leadership, and how does it compare to toxic leadership prevalence?","answer":"Authoritarian leadership involves making decisions alone, requiring strict compliance to orders, and micro-managing followers' work. These leaders offer both praise and criticism, communicate directly, and are most effective in crisis environments. While this might seem similar to toxic leadership, research suggests that overtly tyrannical or arrogant leadership is actually rare. More common forms of destructive leadership are passive in nature, with prevalence estimates of destructive leadership behaviors reaching up to 61% in organizations.","context":["- slide 1 of 5\nLeadership theories abound in our culture. Perhaps it is because we, as a society, are so diverse. Many different leadership styles are embedded in each theory associated with leadership. This article will focus on one branch of leadership, the behavioral theory. This is effective in group decision making, thereby working well in project management situations, as well as others.\nThere are three recognized leadership styles within behavioral leadership. Authoritarian, Democratic and Laissez-faire. You have most likely experienced working for at least one of these types of leaders. Generally, they are very effective leaders.\n- slide 2 of 5\nAn Authoritarian leader will make decisions alone and accept nothing less than strict compliance to his orders. He will micro-manage his followers work and generally not participate. He will offer praise or, on the flip side, criticism. Working for this type of leader demands a viewpoint of his superiority by his followers, otherwise, feelings will tend to get hurt and performance will suffer. The authoritarian leader will not want to sit at a cozy, round, conference table, this type of leader would rather sit at the head of a long conference table, dictating the flow of the meeting by his actions. He will participate heavily in the job. This type of leadership is very effective in a crisis environment.\nCommunication from this type of leader is best expressed as direct. Leaders should use this style when they are short on time, have all the necessary information they need to complete the job, and their employees are well motivated. Praise is a significant piece to this type of leadership, criticism is as well, but it must be constructive and informative, not attacking. Every leader should have this tool available to them, but must be wise about when to employ its use.\n- slide 3 of 5\nA Democratic leader will prefer assisting in a collective decision making process. This type of leader prefers brainstorming techniques and gaining insight from key members of his team. This leader would play a role in the process, but will not fully participate in all aspects. The job success or failure will be shared by all team members, while the authoritarian leader would generally take the credit of the success or responsibility of the failure. The democratic leader works best in fields where innovation is key.\nTechniques for a democratic leader must be closely followed. The necessity for timelines is essential; otherwise, due to the innovative spirit of the followers of democratic leaders it is very easy to lose the forest through the trees.\n- slide 4 of 5\nA Laissez-faire leader will not participate in the actual work. This leader will give freedom to his team to come up with the policy. This leader will not give praise or criticism and will not give an opinion or assistance unless directly asked to. This type of leader is best when you have highly motivated, well trained employees.\nIf a leader take this hands off approach, they must be certain to check in with their employees regularly. Hire only self motivated, highly trained individuals to build your team into a productive group.\n- slide 5 of 5\nAll of these styles of leadership have benefits and drawbacks. A mix of each type, when the situation calls for it, will bring about the best adjusted work atmosphere.","What comes to your mind when you think about toxic leadership? Are you envisioning an arrogant tyrant who rules by fear? While such an approach is indeed extremely harmful to others, research suggests that it is rare, and that a far more common form of destructive leadership is laissez-faire leadership¹.\nLaissez-faire leadership occurs when an individual with formal leadership responsibilities abdicates them by avoiding making decisions, addressing problems, and offering support when needed. In short, it is non-leadership and, while passive in nature, research indicates that it can be just as detrimental as more active forms of destructive leadership².\nThe Destructive Impact of Laissez-faire Leaders\nResearch shows that Laissez-faire leadership creates stress for followers in the form of role ambiguity and increases in conflict among team members that can lead to bullying³. This results in lower follower job satisfaction and organizational commitment, which can show up in 3 ways:\n- Followers are less likely to display Organizational Citizenship Behaviors⁴ (i.e., discretionary actions that benefit the company culture and organizational effectiveness)\n- Followers are more likely to exhibit Counterproductive Work Behaviors⁵\n(i. e., voluntary actions that have a negative impact on the company culture and organizational effectiveness)\n- Followers are more likely to turnover.\nThe Invisible Nature of Laissez-faire Leadership\nMaking matters worse, the absence of needed behavior is harder to observe than the presence of inappropriate behavior. This makes it easier for laissez-faire leadership to operate below the radar. Given its insidious nature and higher prevalence, it is likely that laissez-faire leadership is a more significant problem for organizations than more actively destructive leadership behaviors, even though the latter are more likely to make the news and gossip circles because they are more sensational.\nDestructive Leadership is a Widespread Problem\nWhen laissez-faire leadership behavior is combined with other forms of destructive leadership behavior, prevalence estimates are as high as 61%¹. What’s more, as many as 60-75% of employees identify their direct leader as the worst part of their job⁶. And, when people are dissatisfied with their direct leader, they are more likely to leave.\n- Avoid the substantial costs of hiring destructive leaders by investing in a pre-employment leadership style assessment that is backed by sound research. Click here to learn more: The Secret to Effective Leadership: Keep it Simple.\n- Consider using a 360-degree feedback tool to find out how often your leaders are exhibiting the necessary behaviors to foster a motivated, high performing team. Comparing the leader’s self-evaluation to that of their direct reports will be particularly helpful in identifying leaders who need development.\n- If you have a remote workforce, it is even more imperative to assess leadership style, given the invisible nature of Laissez-faire leadership and physical distance that separates remote teams.

{"question":"How does Indiana's architectural competition showcase architectural heritage, and what preservation resources are available for maintaining historic buildings in the region?","answer":"The J. Irwin and Xenia S. Miller Prize Competition, part of Exhibit Columbus, showcases Indiana's architectural heritage through temporary installations at five sites along 5th Street, each associated with an architectural icon. The competition features ten finalists who propose innovative designs judged on their spatial relationship, ability to activate space, and material innovation. The winning installations will be joined by other installations from international designers and students. For preserving historic buildings, there are various resources available including preservation tax credits (20% federal tax credit for commercial properties on the National Register, and 20-25% state tax credit for both commercial and residential properties), preservation easements that protect properties in perpetuity, and grant funding through the State Historical Fund for restoration projects demonstrating public benefit.","context":["On December 10th, ten finalists descended on Columbus, Indiana, to present concepts for the inaugural J. Irwin and Xenia S. Miller Prize Competition. The competition is the part of Exhibit Columbus, a yearly architectural event held to highlight the city’s vast collection of architectural masterpieces. Along with the competition, all ten finalists participated in the opening symposium for Exhibit Columbus earlier this fall.\nThe ten proposals took the form of temporary installations for five sites stretching across the city along 5th Street. Each site is associated with an architectural icon in the city, two of which are National Historic Landmarks. Judging the projects is a team of five guest jurors including Sean Anderson, associate curator in the Department of Architecture and Design, Museum of Modern Art, Lise Anne Couture, co-founder and principal, Asymptote Architecture, Jennifer Dunlop Fletcher, Helen Hilton Raiser Curator of Architecture and Design, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, and Dung Ngo, publisher, August Editions. Each project will be judged on “its formal/spatial relationship to the site, ability to activate the space, innovation in the use of materials, and ability to stimulate a dialogue with the context of the site.”\nThe format of the competition is not typical in that teams are paired head to head on each of the five sites. From the ten proposals, five will be awarded the Miller prize, one for each site, and given the opportunity to develop and build their installation for the 2017 Exhibit Columbus. Winners are expected to be announced in January 2017.\nJoining the five installations will be more than ten other installations by international designers, students from universities across the Midwest, as well as local students.\n“With such a talented group, each project was an incredible new idea for the jury to consider. Our expectation is that this event will have a big impact on the Columbus community for years to come,” said Richard McCoy, director of Landmark Columbus, the organization that created and runs Exhibit Columbus.\nThe sites and Proposals are as follows:\nSite number one is the First Christian Church by Saarinen and Saarinen, built in 1942.\nFor the site, Boston-based Höweler + Yoon proposed Pattern Pavilion. Taking cues from the decorative motif carved into the stone on the church and referencing other Saarinen projects, the Pattern Pavilion extrudes the 2-D geometry into a volumetric canopy. The alignment of the project frames the Church and the I.M. Pei-designed library across the street.\nAlso competing for the First Christian Church site is Milwaukee-based studio:indigenous. Inspired by the dwellings of the Miyaamia, the indigenous people of central Indiana, Wiikiaami is a contemporary take on the wigwam. Clad in copper scales, the project aligns with the church’s famed campanile and the autumnal equinox.\nAcross from the First Christian Church sits the second site, the Cleo Rogers Memorial Library, designed by I.M. Pei and Partners by 1969.\nBoston-based IKD’s Conversation Plinth was inspired by the conversation pit in the Miller House as well as the plinths that elevate the landmarks surrounding the Library. The design calls for large shifting timber plinths to wrap through the library’s front plaza.\nCompeting against IKD is the collaborative team of Los Angeles-based Johnston Marklee and Jonathan Olivares. Their View Room and Conversation Benches is a roofless structure which frames views of the library and the surrounding sculptures.\nThe 1954 Irwin Conference Center by Eero Saarinen and Associates is the third site.\nLos Angeles-based Ball-Nogues Studio designed Bank and Trust in Paper (a reference to the building’s original name) which echoes the plan and roof of the low-slung structure. Made of a waterproof treated recycled paper, the canopy is molded in forms reminiscent of Saarinen’s designs such as the iconic tulip chair.\nUntitled, by Los Angeles-based Oyler Wu Collaborative, is focused on three main concepts: Euclidean geometries, solid/void relationships, and tectonics. The design completes spaces implied by three canopies, originally part of the drive-up bank. The team adds new walls which are solid, built of thin lines, or carved away into voids.\nThe fourth site is Kevin Roche John Dinkeloo Associates’ 1983 Cummins Corporate Office Building.\nLos Angeles-based Baumgartner + Uriu’s Machines Suspended extrudes the saw-tooth pattern of the office building’s layout into a three-dimension multi-directional object. Hanging in the building’s colonnade, the object defines new spaces and ways of habituating the space.\nNew Haven-based Plan B Architecture & Urbanism’s proposal Anything can happen in the woods transforms the site’s colonnade into an urban forest of reflective columns. The surrounding greenery and built structure reflect in project.\nThe final site is the Mill Race Park, designed by Michael Van Valkenburgh Associates with architecture by Stanley Saitowitz in 1992.\nAnother Circle by Tuscon and New York-based Aranda\\Lasch adds a henge-like stone circle to the park. Using 2,800 pieces of salvaged Indiana limestone, the 3.5-acre stone circle ties together the park’s lake, pedestrian trail, and river.\nTulsa-based artist Rachel B. Hayes Studio proposal Chroma Connection is comprised of colorful ripstop nylon. Stretching through the site’s covered bridge into the lake at the heart of the park, the projects is meant to appear as if it is built out of pure color.","For Building Owners\nOwning a historic building, whether it’s your home, your business or an investment property, requires care and commitment. There are a variety and resources, tools and incentives designed to make caring for your property a little easier.\nA preservation easement is an interest in real property that the owner of the property transfers to a qualified organization such as Historic Denver, Inc. (or to a governmental body). To be eligible, the property must be historically designated either at the local, state or national level. An easement prohibits the demolition of the property and any modifications that will harm its historic character, and also requires that the property be maintained in good condition. Preservation easements are a powerful tool for protecting a historic property because an easement “runs with the land” – meaning it is perpetual and remains in place when the property is sold.\nHistoric Denver currently holds 64 easements in the Denver metro area. While Historic Denver is not a regulatory agency and is not involved in design review of local landmarks, we do have an obligation to ensure the general upkeep of these particular easement properties. In order to fulfill the conditions of the easement, Historic Denver conducts annual inspections of our easement properties in order to ensure that they are in good condition and have not been altered. Our experienced staff identifies areas of concern and recommends preservation approaches, materials and contractors for any needed work.\nIf you would like to train to become an easement inspector, please fill out this application form HERE. Inspections are generally conducted biennially, between May and September. Currently the Easement Inspection Internship has been filled for the Summer 2018.

Restoring or rehabilitating a historic structure requires planning, a love of challenges, and financing! Read more about Tax Credits, the State Historical Fund and other funding sources…\nDesignated historic properties can be eligible for preservation tax credits. These credits can significantly reduce the cost of restoration and rehabilitation. A 20% federal tax credit is available to commercial properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places. A 20-25% Colorado state tax credit is available to both income-producing and residential property-owners of properties listed on either the National Register of Historic Places, State Register of Historic Places or locally designated through a Certified Local Government, like the City of Denver. Buildings that contribute to a historic district are also eligible.\nColorado Job Creation & Main Street Revitalization Program\nOn Wednesday, May 14, 2014 Governor John Hickenlooper signed HB-1311, the Colorado Job Creation & Main Street Revitalization Act at a meeting of economic development organizations in Pueblo. Historic Denver advocated for this legislation along with our preservation partners, History Colorado, Colorado Preservation, Inc., the National Trust for Historic Preservation and Downtown Colorado, Inc.\nCo-sponsored in the House by Representatives Leroy Garcia and Tim Dore and in the Senate by Senators Pat Steadman and Larry Crowder, the bill improves Colorado’s existing state tax credit by increasing the project cap from $50,000 to $1 million for commercial projects and by making the commercial credits transferable. Fewer changes were made to the way the tax credit applies to single-family homes, although it can now be “re-used” more than once per property, which makes long-term stewardship more viable. To be eligible to use the credits, a building must be locally designated or listed on either the State Register or National Register of Historic Places.\nState Historical Fund\nThe State Historical Fund (SHF) is a unique program of the Colorado Historical Society that funds a wide range of preservation projects across the State of Colorado, including restoration construction efforts. SHF grant funds are generated from the state tax revenues produced by gaming in the historic mining towns of Black Hawk, Central City and Cripple Creek.\nSince grant applicants to the SHF must be either a non-profit organization or public entity, and the proposed project must be able to demonstrate a public benefit, SHF grants are not a good option for the restoration of a private residence. Private owners of buildings open to the public or otherwise offering a public benefit may apply for a grant with the sponsorship of an eligible non-profit. Historic Denver has successfully applied for and managed dozens of SHF grants on behalf of private and non-profit owners. Please visit the State Historical Fund’s website to learn more about the available grant types, application process and grant regulations.\nTo learn about how Historic Denver may be able to apply for and/or manage a grant on behalf of your organization, please contact our Director of Preservation Programs, John Olson by phone at 303-534-5288 ext. 4 or by email at email@example.com.\nOther Funding Sources\nHistoric Denver currently does not offer direct assistance in funding preservation projects.\nHistoric Designation Frequently Asked Questions\nIs your building a local landmark or located in a historic district? We’ve created a Historic Designation FAQ guide, which answers many of the questions we commonly receive from property owners. You can also visit the City of Denver’s Landmark Preservation website to search for designated properties, read about design review for designated properties, and find pertinent application forms.\nThe city of Denver’s Preservation Ordinance was created in 1967, just a year after the watershed passage of the National Historic Preservation Act. The ordinance is a framework that supports Denver’s historic districts and individual landmarks, and specifically outlines provisions related to historic designation, design review and demolition review. It is an important to note that these functions are managed by the City & County of Denver, its Landmark Preservation Committee, and the Denver City Council.\nThere are 52 local historic districts in Denver and over 300 individually landmarked properties. Landmark designation is a great tool for preserving the historic fabric of Denver’s neighborhoods while encouraging thoughtful and sympathetic improvements and additions. Navigating the ins and outs of what designation means for your property, however, can seem like a daunting task. Below we’ve compiled a number of questions we frequently receive about designation to highlight the benefits of landmark designation and to shed light on the many misconceptions surrounding the process. The City of Denver’s Landmark Preservation Commission also has a list of Frequently Asked Questions.\nPlease note: Historic Denver, Inc is a private, non-profit organization that provides ideas and actions for Denver’s historic places. We do not manage the city’s designation programs. The Landmark Preservation Commission is the formal city agency responsible for designation and design review. To contact the Landmark Commission, please visit their website or call them at (720) 865-2709.\nHomeowner Education Workshops\nHistoric Denver has produced a series of videos to capture information presented in four homeowner education workshops. Owning a historic building, whether it’s your home, your business or an investment property, requires care and commitment. There are a variety and resources, tools and incentives designed to make caring for your property a little easier.

If any portion of your sidewalk is lifted more than ¾” from one slab to the adjacent slab, this is considered a “tripping hazard” and the stones need to be re-leveled. If a slab of stone is shattered into several pieces, it is deemed beyond repair and the slab will need to be replaced.\nLearn more about flagstone repair methods, replacing flagstone, tree considerations, and city permits and licenses.\nReal Estate Professionals\nThe Annual Realtor Seminar will be held on December 11, 2019.

Since its inception in 2000, the program has aided in the protection and preservation of more than 50 historic sacred landmarks across the Denver metro area. The Sacred Landmarks program provides residents and community leaders with the tools necessary to be good stewards of their historic resources. This in turn ensures that these landmarks continue to serve as centers of community life for generations to come. This is particularly important as sacred landmarks typically serve a community much larger than their own congregation, hosting nonprofit agencies or community groups, and providing critical social services.\nThrough the program, we conduct research to determine the maintenance and renovation/repair costs of the historic sacred building; we strive to strengthen and maintain public education about the importance of sacred places by offering community-centered services; and we provide technical assistance to inner-city congregations and their pastors to help them accurately assess the enormous value of their physical and human resources, as well as identify funding sources and secure grants for restoration and rehabilitation — most often from the Colorado State Historical Fund.\nHistoric Denver’s Sacred Landmarks team is currently managing grant-funded projects at First Unitarian Church and the Althea Center in Capitol Hill, Trinity United Methodist in downtown, North Highland Presbyterian in West Highlands, and People’s Presbyterian in the North City Park/Skyland neighborhood. Past project include work at the former Temple Emanuel in Uptown, Central Presbyterian in downtown, 430 Years of Church in Christ in Five Points, and Four Winds American Indian Council in Baker.\nDoes your historic place of worship need help? You’re invited to contact us for help and information.\nBuilt in the 1890s, this property at 1400 N. Lafayette St. in Denver’s Capitol Hill/Cheesman Park neighborhood is a prime and unique example of construction using locally sourced rhyolite in the Richardsonian Romanesque style. It was designated a Denver landmark in 2016. This project will rehabilitate the masonry of all four facades of the church, and includes cleaning and re-pointing exterior stone masonry. It is funded, in part, by History Colorado’s State Historical Fund, in partnership with Historic Denver.\nThe building houses the oldest Unitarian congregation in Colorado. It was founded in 1871 – five years before Colorado statehood. During its first two and a half years, the congregation used seven different assembly venues, largely due to the controversial social action work undertaken by its members. The Unitarians often made news for bold moves like utilizing female ushers, teaching vocational skills to girls, educating boys who worked during the day and, later, advocating for reform against the imprisonment of children.\nIn 1958, First Unitarian Society of Denver purchased the building at 1400 N. Lafayette St. from the first owner, Plymouth Congregational Church. First Unitarian has been the proud steward of the building since, and has exhibited significant community and social justice work since its founding.\nThis important rehabilitation work will propel plans to engage the public, its membership, and numerous partner groups in the powerful story of the church and its building. First Unitarian is committed to maintaining its presence at this location as an “urban sanctuary in the heart of Denver.” Now as in the past, First Unitarian is active and influential in social justice issues of race, gay and lesbian rights, marriage equality, women’s rights, and immigration rights."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:e9a225fe-7a6e-4a64-a0d2-8d9ac52986e2>","<urn:uuid:a263acf5-aa85-4805-be04-3adc75428e5b>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do Catholic churches and the Todai-ji temple in Japan utilize monumental architecture and precious materials to represent divine authority and spiritual power? Please explain the similarities and differences in their approaches.","answer":"Catholic churches and the Todai-ji temple both use monumental architecture and precious materials to manifest divine authority, but in distinct ways. Catholic churches employ materials like precious stones, gold, and stained glass to represent the heavenly Jerusalem and manifest the beauty of heaven. The overall architectural design aims to evoke wonder and awe, making visitors feel 'transported' from the mundane to the sacred. The Todai-ji temple similarly employs grand scale, housing a massive 53-foot seated Cosmic Buddha statue. The temple's scale was deliberately designed to imply the consolidation of Imperial authority and the power of Buddhism. While both traditions use monumental architecture to inspire awe, Catholic churches focus on creating an overall environment of heaven-like beauty through decorative elements, while Todai-ji emphasizes the sheer scale of its Buddha statue and structure to convey authority. Both architectural approaches serve to physically manifest spiritual power, though they employ different specific techniques to achieve this goal.","context":["By Fr. Aaron Johanneck\n(From a series found in The Prairie Catholic)\nIn the last article we began to answer the question, “What exactly is a church?” As was explained, a church is much more than an event hall in which any activity can take place. It is even more than simply a place where Christians gather. A church is a building dedicated and set aside for worship and prayer, and a building with great meaning.\nThe Catechism of the Catholic Church teaches that when we enter a church we cross a threshold (cf. CCC 1186). It should be clear that we are entering a place unlike any other. Think about the beautiful churches that you yourself perhaps have visited; churches that truly struck you in some way as you entered, or even as you approached them. There are some churches that evoke in us true wonder and awe. We marvel at the craftsmanship, the artistry, the sacrifices made by the faithful for such a structure to be built and furnished, and at the overall effect the building has on us. We note how these churches move us to prayer, how they lift our spirits, and how they give glory to God. Many will comment on how they have felt “transported” as they entered a truly beautiful church. They felt as if they had left the mundane and worldly, and entered a place that is truly holy and sacred in which holy and sacred activities take place.\nThis is an appropriate experience. It is one that we should desire to evoke in the design of new churches or in the renovation of existing ones. As the Catechism states, the threshold we cross as we enter a church “symbolizes passing from the world wounded by sin to the world of the new Life to which all men are called” (CCC 1186). As we pass through the doors of a beautiful church we can have an experience of crossing the border from the fallen world affected by sin, evil, and disorder to the world redeemed by Christ and reconciled to the Father.\nAs we enter a church we pass from earth to heaven. As the Catechism explains, “Our visible churches, holy places, are images of the holy city, the heavenly Jerusalem, toward which we are making our way on pilgrimage” (CCC 1198). The Book of Revelation describes the heavenly Jerusalem as built of jasper and pure gold. The foundations of the city are adorned with every kind of jewel, and the gates are pearls (cf. Revelation 21:18-21). Thus churches are adorned with precious materials, stained glass, beautiful furnishings, and decorative paint schemes to manifest the beauty of heaven.\nAs mentioned in the previous article, a church building represents the Church, the Mystical Body of Christ. This is why the same word is used for both realities. The cleanliness, order, and beauty of a church images the purity, order, and beauty of the souls of those redeemed by the Blood of Christ and made holy through prayer and the sacraments. It represents the state of soul that we must strive to attain as baptized Christians. As St. Augustine writes, “The work we see complete in this building is physical; it should find its spiritual counterpart in your hearts. We see here the finished product of stone and wood; so too your lives should reveal the handiwork of God’s grace” (alternate Second Reading, Office of Readings for the Dedication of a Church).\nIn this way, a worthy and beautiful church issues a challenge to us to cross a threshold in our own lives, passing from the ugliness of sin and selfishness to the beauty of sacrificial, selfless love in a soul transformed by the grace of God.","Presentation on theme: \"South, East, Southeast Asia 1 images 192-197 Content Area 8 Themes: Sacred architecture, After life, Representation of Deities, Landscape, Royal Portraiture,\"— Presentation transcript:\nSouth, East, Southeast Asia 1 images 192-197 Content Area 8 Themes: Sacred architecture, After life, Representation of Deities, Landscape, Royal Portraiture, Power and Authority, Propaganda\nGuiding Questions 1.How do art and architecture reflect beliefs and practices? 2.How do art and architecture reveal cross- cultural connections and influences?\nRequired Images (21) 1.Great Stupa at Sanchi.

Color Lithograph.\nHinduism 101 Monotheism displayed through polytheistic views literary origins of Hindu date to the Vedic period and to the Indus Valley Civilization Multiplicity of deities suggest the all-pervasive nature of the Hindu gods. Three main gods: Shiva, Vishnu, and Devi The Hindu Trimurti consists of Brahma the Creator, Vishnu the Preserver, and Shiva the Destroyer. Hinduism is bound to the hierarchal structure of the caste system: Scholars (Bramans), Warriors/princesses/princes (Kshateriya), Merchants (Vyshas), and farmers and laborers (Shudras) Position in caste system is reflection of accumulated merit in past lives, cause and effect = karma. Samsara is the cyclical reincarnation Ultimate goal is liberation and release from samsara, known as Moksha\nHinduism 102 - Shiva Shiva is the Destroyer as well as a regenerative force. Duality through multiplicity of roles. Shiva can be represented in the form of a linga, a phallic or cosmic pillar, emphasizing his regenerative nature. Frequently depicted with many limbs or heads, again multiplicity in form and power – suprahuman Shiva as Nataraja, Lord of dance Attributes: multiple heads/arms, third eye on forehead, carries trident, dreadlock hair, represented as great yogi and teacher, linga, serpent scarf, rides the bull, Nandi Son is Ganesha, god of good fortune and remover of obstacles, has the head of an elephant\nHinduism 103 - Vishnu Vishnu is the Preserver of the Universe, embodiment of mercy and goodness, and maintains the cosmic order Often depicted with four arms holding different attributes, such as conch-shell, disc, a club, and a lotus Often laying on a coiled serpent Shesha in the cosmic sea Has transformed into 9 out of 10 avatars to help bring balance back to earth: fish, turtle, boar, lion, dwarf, Parasurama, Ram, Krishna, Buddha, and the tenth is yet to come (Kalki).\nHinduism 104 - Devi Devi the Great Goddess who take many forms Parvati is the wife of Shiva Lakshmi is the wife of Vishnu Radha is the lover of Krishna In on manifestation, Devi is Durga, a multi- armed goddess who often rides a lion. Devi creates and destroys Son is Ganesha\nBuddhism 101 - Buddha Buddha (the Enlightened One) was born Siddhartha Gautama, eldest son of a royal family. Was a Hindu At the age of 29, the prince abandoned everything and everyone, witnessed pain and suffering, and became an ascetic Reached enlightenment at age of 35 through meditation under the Bodhi tree at Bodh Gaya in eastern India.\nBuddhism 102 – Four Noble Truths The Wheel of the Law, or dharmachakra, are the teachings of the Buddha Four Noble Truths: 1.Life is suffering 2.The cause of suffering is desire 3.one can overcome and extinguish desire 4.the way to conquer desire and end suffering is following Buddha’s Eightfold Path\nBuddhism 103 – Eightfold Path 1.Right understanding 2.Right thought 3.Right speech 4.Right action 5.Right livelihood 6.Right effort 7.Right mindfulness 8.Right concentration Buddha’s path leads to nirvana. Life is cyclical until nirvana is reached.\nQuestions addressed by architects of sacred structures: 1. Is there communal ritual? 2. Is there movement from point to point by ritual participants? 3. Is there a focal point participants must be able to see during the ritual? 4. How can transitions into more sacred space be provided? 5. How can the plan and decoration reflect beliefs of the participants?\nGreat Stupa at Sanchi. Madhya Pradesh, India. Buddhist; Maurya, late Sunga Dynasty. c. 300 B.C.E.–100 C.E.

Han Dynasty, China. c. 180 B.C.E. Painted silk. 194\nThis T-shaped silk banner covered the coffin of Lady Dai Lady Dai was the wife of Han ruler Marquis Li Cang Also in her tomb was additional embroidered silk gowns, 154 lacquer dishes, 51 ceramics, 48 bamboo suitcases of clothing and household goods, baskets of gold pieces and bronze coins. All things needed to be comfortable in the AFTERLIFE There was also an inventory of food items offered in her tomb: rice, wheat, barley, millet, soybeans, red lentils, 13 different meat dishes made from a variety of 7 kinds of meat. The scenes are interpreted as showing the modes of existence of the soul after death. The corpse is placed in the tomb where it is served by underworld attendants. The body soul enjoys and consumes the burial objects and offerings. At the same time the spirit soul (hun) ascends to the realm of the immortals and seems to rejuvenate during this process.\nThe lower section of the banner shows the offerings and ceremonies devoted to her body soul (po). Sacrificial vessels are provided for her and attendants are standing next to her, ready to serve her soul which resides in the tomb. Beneath the tomb we get a glimpse of the creatures living in the underworld: A deity of the earth carries the foundation of the tomb, her netherworld dwelling.\nThe central part of the banner shows Lady Dai in a standing position. She leans on a cane, while two persons crouch or kneel in front of her and three women, presumably female attendants, stand behind her.\nThe upper part of the banner is said to show the realm of the immortals. The entrance is guarded by two deities holding the records of the life span of Lady Dai. They are identified as deities of destiny. In the top section we can see a standing woman. She is surrounded by a creature with a snake-like body and flanked by the depictions of the moon with a toad and a rabbit (which is said to pound the elixir of immortality) and the sun with a raven. Five birds seem to keep her company which may represent the figures of the lower parts of the banner.\nSilk Road is established during Han dynasty Tomb was found as a mound Body and tomb was very well preserved Heavens Earthly World Spiritual World\nChinese Buddhist Cave Shrines 4:35 Longmen caves. Luoyang, China. Tang Dynasty. 493–1127 C.E. Limestone. 195 b/c 2300 caves were carved into the cliffs with Buddha's of all sizes Central cosmic Vairocana Buddha is more than 44ft. tall – seated Commissioned by Empress Wu Zetian flanking the central Buddha are bodhisattvas, monks, and guardian figures\nThe central Vairocana Buddha (more than 55 feet high including its pedestal) is flanked on either side by a bodhisattva, a heavenly king, and a thunderbolt holder (vajrapani). Vairocana represents the primordial Buddha who generates and presides over all the Buddhas of the infinite universes that form Buddhist cosmology. This idea—of the power of one supreme deity over all the others—resonated in the vast Tang Empire which was dominated by the Emperor at its summit and supported by his subordinate officials.

{"question":"Why might deep-sea mining be both a promising solution for clean energy metals and a potential environmental threat?","answer":"Deep-sea mining presents a complex trade-off. On one side, it could provide essential metals like nickel, cobalt, manganese, and copper needed for clean energy technologies and urban infrastructure, potentially offering a more responsible alternative to land-based mining that avoids deforestation, relocation of peoples, child labor, and mountains of waste. However, it also poses significant environmental risks, particularly to marine ecosystems. Scientists warn that mining could cause irreversible damage to essential deep-sea microorganisms and unusual animal communities, especially around hydrothermal vents. These microbes are vital for ecosystem services and are very slow to recover from disturbances. Additionally, these environments contain valuable genetic information that could inspire new medical solutions, which would be lost if the habitats are destroyed.","context":["Mining the sea floor for precious metals such as zinc and cobalt could lead to ‘irreversible’ damage to marine eco-systems, scientists warn.\nDemand for battery powered devices such as electric cars has created a drive to mine the cobalt rich seabed, say researchers from Bigelow Lab for Ocean Sciences.\nExperts at the Maine, New England research facility examined the potential impact of disruption from mining to deep sea micro-organisms and the surrounding system.\nMicrobes on the seafloor are responsible for essential ecosystem services, said Beth Orcutt, a senior researcher at Bigelow, who urged caution from mining companies.\nThey found that environments that are promising for mining are also often sites of globally important microbial processes and unusual animal communities.\nScroll down for video\nThe Mafuta diamond mining vessel, operated by Debmarine Namibia, searches for diamonds using a ‘crawler’ tractor to suck up sediment from the seabed. More mining operations for other types of minerals are expected to come online in the coming years\nOrcutt said these communities are ‘very slow to recover from disturbances’ and so said policy makers should consider the impact when issuing licences.\n‘The push for deep-sea mining has really accelerated in the last few years, and it is crucial that policy makers and the industry understand these microbes and the services they provide’.\nOne of the first companies with a licence to explore the seabed for mining opportunities is Nautilus Minerals.\nThey plan to use a version of the systems created for offshore oil and gas extraction to remove gold, silver, zinc and copper from the deep ocean.\nThe European Commission says the quantity of minerals on the ocean floor is ‘potentially large’.\nThey say any mining on the sea bed should be to ensure security of supply and fill a gap in the market where either recycling isn’t possible or the burden on land minerals is too high.\nThe commission is working on a range of studies to investigate the impact and potential of seabed mining.\nThe United Nations has issued 29 licences to explore the deep sea for rare minerals that will go on to be used in electric vehicles and other battery devices.\nSome mining operations are already in place. De Beers and the Namibian government have an operation searching for diamonds at sea using a ‘crawler’ tractor to suck up sediment from the seabed in the Atlantic Ocean.\nA 2019 Greenpeace report said unless safeguards were put in place there would be ‘severe and irreversible harm’ to the world’s oceans from mining.\n‘This greedy industry could destroy wonders of the deep ocean before we even have a chance to study them,’ said Louisa Casson from the campaign group.\nResearchers from Bigelow say the impact varies from site to site, with not all locations on the seabed as vulnerable as each other.\nTheir findings indicate that the likely impacts of mining on microbial ecosystems vary substantially, from minimal disturbance to the irreversible loss of important ecosystem processes.\nHydrothermal vent systems are likely to be the most sensitive as well as the most valuable for mining operations, according to Orcutt and her team.\nTiny crabs, tubeworms, and other sea life live next to a hot hydrothermal vent.These vents contain potentially large amounts of precious metals such as cobalt and zinc\nThe hot, mineral-rich waters support robust communities of microbes that form the vital base of the food web in these ecosystems, she explained.\n‘These microbes have incredible potential to inspire new solutions to all sorts of medical and technical challenges we face today,’ said Julie Huber, a scientist from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and co-author of the new study.\n‘But if we damage or destroy a habitat like a hydrothermal vent, we lose the diverse pool of microbial genetic information from which we can find new drugs.’\nThe International Seabed Authority of the United Nations is working to establish guidelines for countries and contractors to explore the seafloor for minerals.\nThe heat and minerals expelled by the vent allow these creatures to survive without sunlight. They are important eco-systems that would be irreversibly destroyed if disrupted, say scientists\nThe team behind the study say that as well as considering how much microbial life is present at a potential mining site, as is currently in the draft guidelines, they should also look at the role microbes are playing and any impact on them from mining.\n‘It is important to understand the potential impacts of mining activities to figure out if they should occur and how to manage them if they do,’ said James Bradley, a scientist at Queen Mary University of London and co-author on the paper.\n‘This is an important conversation between policy makers, industry, and the scientific community, and it’s important that we work together to get this right.\n‘Once these ecosystems are damaged, they may never fully recover.’\nGreenpeace have called on governments to create a strong global ocean treaty to protect the underwater environments.\nThe research has been published in the journal Limnology and Oceanography Reports.\nWHAT IS SEABED MINING?\nThe number of minerals, including precious metals such as gold, zinc and cobalt buried in the seabed could be significant, say the EU.\nAs demand for electronic technologies such as electric cars and smartphones has increased, the idea of mining the seabed has become more prominent.\nIt is a complex and expensive process, but will become more lucrative as the supply of minerals from land based sources or recycling reduces.\nThere is currently a series of ‘explorations’ happening to discover the most valuable sites to mine.\nIt’s expected the most likely sites are around hydrothermal vents between 4,600ft and 12,100ft below the surface.","The latest news from GSR\nNEWS: Deep seabed mining exploratory mission begins today\nSan Diego, CA, 6 April: Global Sea Mineral Resource (GSR) is pleased to announce that its latest deep seabed mining exploratory mission begins today.\nOver the next four weeks the company will be conducting trials in part of the Clarion Clipperton Zone (CCZ). The CCZ is a six million square kilometre region of the Pacific Ocean between Mexico and Hawaii.\nGSR is collaborating with the European research project MiningImpact (1). Scientists from 29 European institutes will join efforts with the German exploration contract holder, BGR (Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources), to independently monitor the trials to help understand the environmental effects of collecting mineral resources from the seafloor.\nIn view of potential at-sea protests by Greenpeace during the trials, Kris van Nijen, Managing Director of GSR said:\n“Deep seabed mining is not settled science. There are gaps in knowledge and until these gaps are addressed it is not possible for final conclusions to be drawn about the appropriateness or otherwise of obtaining minerals from the seabed. Independent scientific research into the environmental effects of deep seabed mining is essential for good decision-making and well-informed regulation.\n“Deep seabed mining may or may not represent one of the more responsible ways to source the metals the planet needs. Without continued research we will never know the answer. We ask only that the research be allowed to continue so that evidence-based decisions can be made.\n“GSR will only apply for a mining contract if the science shows that, from an environmental and social perspective, the seabed can be a responsible source of the primary metals needed for population growth, urbanisation and clean energy transition.”\nDuring the trial, GSR will be testing its pre-prototype seafloor nodule collector, Patania II, a 25-ton robot on caterpillar tracks. Patania II is equipped with the latest cameras and sensors, including environmental sensors. The robot is controlled from a surface vessel via a 5 km-long umbilical that provides power and communication capabilities.\nThe trial will aim to confirm the trafficability and manoeuvrability of Patania II and its ability to pick up nodules. Following a successful trial, GSR will go on to design and build a full-scale nodule collector with a riser and lift system to bring the nodules to a surface vessel during a system integration test.\nEnvironmental monitoring is a key component of GSR’s development program, ensuring the effects of its activities are understood, can be accurately predicted and improved upon and can lead to the development and implementation of appropriate environmental management strategies.\nGSR acknowledges that before any deep seabed mining occurs, it needs to be clearly demonstrated that such activities can be managed in a way that ensures the effective protection of the marine environment. Deep seabed mining is an industry in the exploration, research and development phase. Years of detailed scientific work lie ahead before there is any prospect of commercial activity.\nNever before has so much thought gone into regulating an industry before it even exists. No State or entity can commercially explore the seabed or collect nodules except under contract with the International Seabed Authority (ISA).\nThe ISA, established in 1994, is mandated through the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) to organize, regulate and control all mineral-related activities in the international seabed area and for the benefit of humankind as a whole.\nTo date, the ISA has awarded 18 exploration contracts in the CCZ. The contractors who hold these 15-year licenses represent nations including China, Japan, Russia, France, UK, Korea, Germany, Poland, Cook Islands, Nauru and Belgium. All exploration contract holders are undertaking geological and environmental studies as part of their contractual obligations.\nThe ISA is in the process of developing regulations for commercial activity and any contractors wishing to undertake mining operations in the international deep seabed area will need to abide by these strict regulations.\nThe regulations incorporate specific provisions to ensure the effective protection of the marine environment and conservation of marine biodiversity, human health and safety, and a system of payments which aims to ensure the equitable sharing of financial and other economic benefits derived from seabed minerals. The regulations must be agreed and adopted by the ISA Council and approved by the ISA Assembly, comprised of 167 Member States and the European Union.\nDemand for metals\nTrillions of rock-like accretions called polymetallic nodules lie at a water depth of between 4,000 and 6,000 metres on the seafloor of the CCZ.\nSince the early 1970s, there has been growing interest in collecting these nodules due the high-grade and multiple metals they contain – metals like nickel, cobalt, manganese, and copper.\nThe metals found in polymetallic nodules are critical for clean energy technologies and urban infrastructure. In the long-term, a fully circular economy in metals is achievable but all credible studies (2) indicate that enormous quantities of primary resource will be required first.\nLand-based reserves will not be able to meet demand, while recycling will only make a modest contribution because of long in-use lifetimes, among other factors.\nCompared with the alternative, which is to rely exclusively on current and new land-based mines, the deep sea may present a more responsible way of sourcing the metals the planet needs for decarbonisation and sustainable economic development. Seabed minerals could diversify metal supplies and it could provide an option that does not involve deforestation, relocation of peoples, child labour and mountains of waste.\nTrials of GSR’s Patania II pre-prototype nodule collector will take place in the Belgian and German contract areas of the CCZ. The studies being conducted by independent scientists in the MiningImpact consortium will not only address the direct effects of collecting polymetallic nodules, but also those of the sediment plume created by the process. The data will provide information on ecosystem effects of potential future mining that cannot be drawn from the small-scale experiments conducted in the past.\nBy employing state-of-the-art scientific equipment researchers will be able to determine the spread of the sediment plume and how it resettles. They will also be able to survey the loss of biodiversity across different faunal classes.\nAmong the specialized instruments that will be deployed are two remotely-operated vehicles (ROV), an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), in situ oxygen profilers and experiment chambers, in situ pumps, as well as 50 inter-calibrated hydro-acoustic and optical sensors for measuring the suspended sediment concentrations and particle sizes.\n(1) 29 institutions from nine European countries, plus the International Seabed Authority, are partners in MiningImpact.

{"question":"What is the economic importance of the Indian Ocean's shipping routes today, and what are the main environmental threats facing its marine ecosystems?","answer":"The Indian Ocean serves as a crucial economic corridor, particularly for petroleum transport to Europe, North America, and East Asia. Major commodities transported include iron ore, coal, rubber, and tea. Container ships operate through key routes like the Cape of Good Hope, Suez Canal, and Strait of Malacca, while tanker traffic primarily moves from Persian Gulf ports across the northern Indian Ocean. However, this economic activity has led to severe environmental challenges. The marine environment faces multiple threats, including domestic and industrial waste accumulation in nearshore waters, oil pollution from tanker operations, and the introduction of pathogens to coastal waters. Oil spills have particularly harmful effects on the marine food chain by damaging phytoplankton and zooplankton populations. The degradation affects not only marine life but also impacts commercial fisheries, tourism, and recreational activities. These environmental issues are compounded by coastal development, population growth, and the modification of nutrient cycles in marine ecosystems.","context":["Indian OceanArticle Free Pass\n- Physiography and geology\n- Economic aspects\n- Study and exploration\nTrade and transportation\nThe economic development of the littoral countries since the mid-20th century has been uneven, following attainment of independence by most states. The formation of regional trade blocs led to an increase in sea trade and the development of new products. Most Indian Ocean states have continued to export raw materials and import manufactured goods produced elsewhere, with a few exceptions like Australia, India, and South Africa. Petroleum dominates commerce, as the Indian Ocean has come to be an important throughway for transport of crude oil to Europe, North America, and East Asia. Other major commodities include iron, coal, rubber, and tea. Iron ore from Western Australia and from India and South Africa is shipped to Japan, while coal is exported to the United Kingdom from Australia via the Indian Ocean. Processed seafood has emerged as a major export item from the littoral states. In addition, tourism has grown in importance on many of the islands.\nShipping in the Indian Ocean can be divided into three components: dhows, dry-cargo carriers, and tankers. For more than two millennia the small, lateen-rigged sailing vessels called dhows were predominant. The dhow trade was particularly important in the western Indian Ocean, where these vessels could take advantage of the monsoon winds; a great variety of products were transported between ports on the coast of East Africa and ports on the Arabian Peninsula and on the west coast of India (notably Mumbai, Mangalore, and Surat). Most dhow traffic has been supplanted by larger, powered ships and by land transport, and the remaining dhows have been equipped with auxiliary engines.\nMuch of the Indian Ocean’s dry-cargo shipping is now containerized. Most container ships enter and exit the Indian Ocean via the Cape of Good Hope, the Suez Canal and Red Sea, and the Strait of Malacca. South Africa and India have their own merchant fleets, but most of the other littoral states have only a few merchant vessels and depend on the ships of other countries to carry their cargoes. Most other dry cargo is transported by bulk carriers, mainly those used to carry iron ore from India, southern Africa, and western Australia to Japan and Europe. An important route from western Australia is via the Sunda Strait and the South China Sea to Japan. Major ports of the Indian Ocean include Durban (S.Af.), Maputo (Mozam.), and Djibouti (Djib.) along the African coast; Aden (Yemen) on the Arabian Peninsula; Karachi, Mumbai, Chennai, and Kolkata on the Indian subcontinent and Colombo in Sri Lanka; and Melbourne, Port Adelaide Enfield, and Port Hedland in Australia.\nTanker traffic moves primarily from ports in the Persian Gulf across the northern Indian Ocean to the Strait of Malacca and from the Persian Gulf south along the coast of Africa and around the Cape of Good Hope. The route via the Suez Canal has become far less important as the size of tankers has surpassed the canal’s capacity; the size of these tankers, however, compensates for the longer distances now required to move oil from the Persian Gulf to Europe. The largest tankers must now use the Lombok Strait through the Lesser Sunda Islands to carry oil to Japan, since their drafts are too great for the route through the Malacca and Singapore straits.\nEnvironmental impact of human activity\nEuropean colonial exploitation of Indian Ocean resources resulted in the first clear evidence of the degradation of both the terrestrial and oceanic environments. Deforestation, cultivation, and guano mining have had undesirable effects on terrestrial ecosystems. Guano mining, which removed vegetation and scraped the land surface, has caused the destruction of much native flora and fauna, and hunting and the introduction of exotic species have altered the ecological balance that previously existed. Man-made threats to the oceanic environment are of more recent origin. One is the quantity of domestic and industrial waste that has accumulated in nearshore waters as a result of increased urbanization and industrialization along the coast. This has been most evident in India, which is the most populous country of the region. Another is the concern caused by the transport of large quantities of crude oil across the ocean and its adjacent semienclosed seas. Oil spills from normal tanker operations and occasional large-scale tanker catastrophes have had deleterious effects on phytoplankton and zooplankton, both necessary parts of the food chain of commercial fisheries. The East African coast, the Arabian Sea, and the approaches to the Strait of Malacca are areas in which the threat of oil pollution and major phytoplankton productivity coincide.\nStudy and exploration\nThere is evidence that the Egyptians explored the Indian Ocean as early as about 2300 bc, when they sent maritime expeditions to the “land of Punt,” which was somewhere on the Somali coast. The expeditions, which may have begun even earlier—perhaps about 2900 bc, were numerous until about 2200 bc. Egyptian annals make no mention of journeys to Punt during the period 2200–2100 bc, but they began again in the 11th dynasty (2081–1938 bc), and records mention them continuously until the 20th dynasty (1190–1075 bc).\nEarly trade in the northwestern Indian Ocean was aided by an irrigation canal (navigable in high water) through the Isthmus of Suez that was built by the Egyptians during the 12th dynasty (1938–c. 1756 bc) and operated almost continuously until it was filled in ad 775. Early seafarers made good use of their knowledge of the monsoons and their associated currents; Arab sailors in their lateen-rigged dhows traded along the East African coast as far south as Sofala (present-day Nova Sofala, Mozam.) and north into the Red Sea and Persian Gulf. The writings of medieval Arab and Persian pilots from the 9th to the 15th century include detailed sailing instructions and information on navigation, winds, currents, coasts, islands, and ports from Sofala to China. It was on an Indian trading vessel that the Russian voyager Afanasy Nikitin reached India in 1469. Vasco da Gama, sailing around Africa in 1497, signed on an Arabian pilot at Malindi before he crossed the Indian Ocean to reach the western shores of India.\nThe Dutch, English, and French followed the Portuguese to the Indian Ocean. In 1521 the Spanish navigator Juan Sebastián del Cano crossed the central part of the ocean, continuing the first voyage of circumnavigation of the globe after the death of the original commander, Ferdinand Magellan, in the Philippine Islands. The Dutch navigator Abel Tasman, pursuing voyages of discovery in the eastern Indian Ocean from 1642 to 1644, explored the northern coast of Australia and discovered the island of Tasmania. The southern waters of the Indian Ocean were explored by James Cook in 1772. Beginning in 1806 the Indian Ocean was crossed repeatedly by Russian ships commanded by Adam Johann Krusenstern, Otto von Kotzebue, and others.\nBetween 1819 and 1821 the expedition of the Russian explorer Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen that circumnavigated Antarctica penetrated the Indian Ocean south of the 60th parallel. A number of important voyages to Antarctica followed in the 19th and early 20th centuries, led by the explorers Charles Wilkes (American), Jules-Sébastien-César Dumont d’Urville and Jean-Baptiste-Étienne-Auguste Charcot (French), James Clark Ross (Scottish), and others.\nDo you know anything more about this topic that you’d like to share?","State of the planet2 - Marine environmental polution\n\"It does not matter where on Earth you live; everyone is utterly dependent on the existence of that lovely, living saltwater soup.

Overpopulation of some non-indigenous species has resulted in the degradation and loss of wetland vegetation and other submerged aquatic vegetation as a result of overgrazing.\nBecause industrialized society depends on petroleum products to maintain its accustomed standard of living, large volumes of petroleum are transported each day in the coastal and marine environment.

{"question":"How do bus travel services compare between Europe and the UK for inter-city transportation?","answer":"Buses are the most popular mode of transportation in Europe, serving even smaller towns and cities, with tickets available for purchase before boarding. European intercity buses operate from major bus stations accessible by public transport, though some cheaper companies may use less official stations. In the UK, bus travel is particularly well-suited for inter-city travel, especially when considering that rental car companies charge hefty fees for different pickup and drop-off locations. The UK also offers specialized bus tours, such as castle tours, and travel packages that include bus tours are widely available.","context":["When it comes to traveling around Europe, the best transport to use depends on several factors. These include the number of people travelling, the length of the trip, the luggage they will need to carry and the booking date. Depending on these factors, you can choose a train or a bus that will fit all of these requirements. If you’re unsure, here are some tips to help you find the right transportation for your needs.\nBuses are the most popular mode of transportation in Europe. Even smaller towns and cities are served by buses, and tickets can often be purchased before boarding. European Intercity buses depart from major bus stations, which are easily accessible by public transportation. However, you may find a cheaper bus company operating from a less official bus station. It is recommended to check their website for details. Choosing a bus company is a good way to see a country in a short period of time.\nHigh-speed trains are also a good way to travel around Europe. They often arrive in the heart of the city. Additionally, they are more comfortable than buses and offer more leg room. In central and western Europe, trains are particularly good. In Eastern and Balkan countries, trains are not as effective and are often inconvenient. Regardless of your choice, there is a train to suit your needs. These are the best ways to travel around Europe.\nFor those who don’t want to take a train or bus, ferries are an excellent option. They can transport a large number of people and can accommodate a car rental. Larger ferries are typically cheaper than smaller ferries and are usually equipped with restaurants, lounges, spas and entertainment. Moreover, longer ferries may offer private cabins. If you’re unsure about the best transportation option, check out Kelby Hartson Carr’s travel guide.\nIn addition to trains and buses, every country in Europe has its own transport system. They have strong connections with their neighboring countries, so you can travel within a country easily. By using public transportation, you’ll be able to avoid stressful aspects of driving and dealing with traffic. Another option for traveling across Europe is to fly. There are many low-cost airlines that offer flights across the continent. With the right travel plan, you can enjoy a comfortable journey across Europe.\nDespite the low cost of renting a car in Europe, it isn’t for everyone. Many countries have efficient public transportation, so you’ll have more flexibility than you’d have with a train. However, it’s not always possible to find automatic vehicles in some European countries. Additionally, you’ll need to brush up on local road rules and make sure your car is equipped with automatic gears.\nIf you’re planning to travel for a long time, cheap flights in Europe are the best choice. These flights may cost less but will take you much longer than a train. Additionally, trains are more comfortable than buses and may even allow you to bring your own luggage. The best part about trains is that you don’t need to check your luggage, so you can spend as much time as you’d like to exploring each city.","Transportation throughout the United Kingdom is straightforward and convenient.

{"question":"How do the architectural histories of the Trappist monastery in Oita and the San Pedro Bautista Church compare in terms of their construction timeline and current location?","answer":"The Oita Trappist monastery was established more recently, in 1980 on July 11th, and remains in its original location in Hiji town, Hayami-gun, Oita prefecture. In contrast, the San Pedro Bautista Church has a much longer and more complex history, being initially built around 1590 by Franciscans, then experiencing multiple destructions and reconstructions - it was burned in 1593, rebuilt by 1599, burned again in 1639, rebuilt between 1684-1699, collapsed in the 1824 earthquake, and underwent renovations in 1912 and 1971. Today, only the façade of the 1684-1699 structure remains as the main altar. The church is now located in San Francisco del Monte in Quezon City.","context":["|OITA TRAPPIST MONASTERY GENERAL GUIDE|\n|What is a\nAlthough familiarly known as \"Trappists\" our formal name is the Cistercian Orderof the Strict Observance. We are one of the religious orders belonging to the Roman Catholic Church. The Cistercian Order has an ancient history and we trace our origins to the year 1098 in Citeaux in the Burgundy region of France. The Cistercians are a contemplative Order following the observances of the Rule of St. Benedict. Under St. Bernard of Clairvaux the new Order witnessed a remarkable expansion so that from the 12th to the 13th centuries there were about 1800 monasteries of the Order spread throughout Europe. Centuries later a part of the Order followed the reformed strict observances of the abbey of La Trappe in Normandy and so became known as the Cistercians of the Strict Observance, or more popularly called the \"Trappists.\" At present the total number of monks and nuns in our world wide order totals about 4,500. We live a life of \"prayer and work\" dedicated to world peace and the happiness of all humankind.\nYou Tube Movie of our Monastery1\nYou Tube Movie of our Monastery2\n| A Guide to Oita Trappist Monastery\nThe second monastery of Trappist monks in Japan\nOita Trappist monastery is located on a hill in the Yufu mountains commanding a fine view of Beppu Bay. As partof the Roman Catholic Church our official name is, \"The Order of Cistercians of the Strict Observance, Our Lady of the Annunciation Monastery\" The first Trappist monastery in Japan was founded with assistance from the French abbey of Bricquebec in Normandy in 1896 (Meiji 29) and is located in Kamiiso near Hakodate, Hokkaido. We are located in Hiji town, Hayami-gun, in Oita prefecture. The monastery was established in 1980 (Showa 55) on July 11th, the feast of St. Benedict by seven monks who were sent from the abbey of \"Our Lady of the Lighthouse\" in Hokkaido. Living the monastic life of \"prayer and work\" we follow the teachings of Christ and theRule of St. Benedict interceding for the salvation and peace of the world. It is said that St. Francis Xavier, the first to preach Christianity in Japan landed at Hiji, and so like Nagasaki this town is regarded as very important in the history of Japanese Christianity.\n|Daily Life at Oita Trappist\nOur monastic life is based on the Rule of St. Benedict (480-547). This Rule contains a compendium of the teachings of Jesus as found in the Gospels and they are intended to be fully put into practice. This way of life encourages us to always seek God with deep eyes of faith and to put everything into practice in our daily life in His presence.\nLife in a Trappist monastery is lived with God in silence and solitude, praying while working and working while praying. As disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ we offer our lives in service for the salvation of all. We remain separated from secular society and as such we do not engage in direct evangelization. Nevertheless through unceasing prayer, and a hidden penitential life, in a mysterious manner God's grace is continually implored for all of humanity.\nThe day of the Trappist monk begins at 3:30 am. We live in common as brothers celebrating the Eucharist, praying the Divine Office seven times a day, working and devoting ourselves to the prayerful reading of the Scriptures. The small hours of the Divine Office, Tierce, Sext and None are related to the division of time as it was established in the Roman period. While our practice of silence is not as absolute as in past times it still remains a characteristic observance of Trappist life.\n|The Trappist Monasteries of Japan\nThere are two monasteries of Trappist monks (Cistercians of the Strict Observance) and five monasteries of Trappistine nuns in Japan.\nOur Lady of the Lighthouse Abbey\n329 Mitsuishi Hokuto-Shi Hokkaido 049-0283 Japan\nOur Lady of the Annunciation Monastery\n3350-7 Minamihata Hiji, Hayami-gun Oita-ken 879-1509 Japan\nOur Lady of the Angels Abbey\n346 Kamiyunokawa Hakodate 042-0914 Japan\nOur Lady of Nasu Abbey\n3101 Toyohara, Nasu-Machi Tochigi-ken 329-3224 Japan\nOur Lady of Nishinomiya Abbey\n3-46 Jurinji-cho Nishinomiya 662-0003 Japan\nOur Lady of Imari Abbey\nP.O.

But many are unaware that there was actually a co-leader of what became known as the “Legazpi Expedition”: Fr. Andres de Urdaneta (i.e. the “cross”) of the Order of St. Augustine who before becoming the first Philippine missionaries of the Roman Catholic Church along with 4 other Augustinian friars was a priest assigned in Mexico. It is also little known that it was Fr. Urdaneta who helped made the Manila-Acapulco galleon trade possible by discovering the North Equatorial Current that became its route for 200 years. Yes, there is more to Urdaneta than being a city of Pangasinan and a forgotten statue on the fringes of Intramuros. And there is more to the following religious orders who placed the country bajo la campana:\nThe Order of St. Augustine (OSA)\nSt. Augustine (354-430) was a bishop in North Africa and a church scholar whose order was established by Pope Alexander IV in 1256. As the first missionaries to the Philippines, the Augustinians were awarded with a prime mission located in the middle of ancient Manila where today stands San Agustin Church --- the only surviving church of old Intramuros and the oldest extant stone church in the Philippines which today is the Augustinian’s provincial headquarters. From there, they started their missions in Tondo, Malate, Navotas, Malabon, Kalookan, Pasig, Paranaque, Cainta and eventually established the towns of the Spanish-era provinces of Pampanga, Cebu, Batangas, Negros and Ilocos making them the all time tops in terms of the most number of missions administered. As such, they also built the most churches where 4 have been declared as UNESCO World Heritage Sites because of their cultural value.\nThe Order of the Friars Minor (OFM)\nFifteen Franciscan friars followed the Augustinians in the Philippines on 24 June 1578. They established their mission on the northeast side of Intramuros where they evangelized in Santa Ana de Sapa, Paco, Sampaloc, San Juan del Monte, San Francisco del Monte, and Pandacan. They were responsible for administering 207 towns/parishes in Manila, Bulacan, Rizal, Laguna, Quezon Province, Isabela, Cavite, Batangas, Bataan, La Union, Ilocos Sur, Camarines Norte, Camarines Sur, Albay, Albay, Sorsogon, Burias Island, Marinduque, Mindoro, Samar, and Leyte. In 1580, the Franciscan missionary Fr. Juan Clemente established a hospital for indigent patients that eventually became the San Juan de Dios Hospital. The Franciscans also opened the first leprosarium in the Far East in the 1600s which is now known as today’s San Lazaro Hospital. The Capuchins, a Franciscan branch, also started doing missionary work in the Philippines in 1890. St. Francis of Assisi (1181-1226) founded the Friars Minor in 1209.\nOne of the early churches built by the Franciscans at around 1590 is that of San Pedro Bautista in San Francisco del Monte in today’s Quezon City. This was razed by fire in 1593, rebuilt until around 1599, burned down again during the 1639 Chinese uprising, and rebuilt again probably between 1684 and 1699. Fr. Sebastian de Totanes (OFM) replaced this with a new church that was started to be built in 1739 which fell down during the 1824 earthquake, was immediately rebuilt by Fr. Vicente Ingles (OFM), and repaired in 1912. It is now the provincial headquarters of the Franciscans who moved there after the war. The remains of San Pedro Bautista and other Franciscan martyrs in Japan and the Far East were interred in the church. It has been extensively renovated in 1971 and only the façade of the 1684-1699 structure which is now the main altar remained. Likewise, the Franciscan’s Capuchin branch also moved to Quezon City after the war where they built the present Lourdes church.\nThe Society of Jesus (SJ)\nA soldier, St. Ignatius of Loyola (1491-1556), established the Compania de Jesus in 1534. The Jesuits came to the Philippines on 17 September 1581. They established their first mission in Ermita’s southern seaside before moving to the eastern wall of Intramuros. Among their missions are Santa Cruz, Quiapo and the Japanese ghetto of San Miguel. The Jesuits are renowned as educators, industrialists, and agriculturists. Their Hacienda de Mayhaligue in Manila is said to be where the plow-and-carabao was first used in the Philippines and new crops like cabbage, lettuce, corn, tomato, potato and other imports were tried. The Jesuits were expelled from the Philippines in 1778 by a decree of King Carlos III but were restored in 1859. The Jesuit’s fabled San Ignacio church was totally demolished during the war. They have since moved to Quezon City’s Loyola Heights in what is now Ateneo de Manila University.\nThe Order of Preachers (OP)\nThe Dominicans can be actually considered as cousins of the Augustinians whose rule was the basis of the order that was organized by St. Dominic (1170-1221) in 1215. The first 15 Dominican missionaries arrived in the Philippines via Cavite in 21 July 1587 before moving to the northern side of Intramuros where they established their mission of Sto. Domingo de Manila and ministered in the Parian district (i.e. Chinese enclaves) of Binondo. The Dominican Fr. Diego de Santa Maria established a school for orphan boys that became the Colegio de San Juan de Letran. Later in 1611, a boarding house for indigent students was also established that was the forerunner of the present day University of Santo Tomas.\nToday’s Dominican provincial headquarters is the imposing Santo Domingo Church along Quezon Avenue in the city of the same name. It was built in 1954 but it traces its lineage to 1588 when the first Dominican church was built in Intramuros. This was destroyed in the earthquake of 1589 and replaced by Fr. Alonso Jimenez’s (OP) stone church in 1592 (where the La Virgen La Naval was enshrined a year later) which, in turn, was razed by fire in 1603. The church was rebuilt again in 1613, damaged by an earthquake in 1645, repaired but was finally destroyed during the earthquake of 1863. The last Intramuros-era building of neo-gothic design was built in 1867 under the supervision of Arch. Felix Roxas and was demolished by Japanese bombardment in 1941. The 1954 church was designed by Jose. Ma. Zaragoza and features the murals of Carlos “Botong” Francisco on St. Dominic and Antonio Llamas on the 4 evangelists, and the stained glasses of Galo Ocampo.\nThe Order of the Augustinian Recollects (OAR)\nOn May of 1606, 10 Recollect missionaries and 4 lay brothers arrived in Cebu. They then moved to Manila where they established their mission in Bagumbayan before moving to the eastern walls of Intramuros. Although the Recollects were credited with developing the Negros sugar industry, they are actually renowned for their evangelization of the jungle missions of Zambales, Tarlac, Mindoro, Palawan, and Mindanao. The Recollects were founded in 1589 as an offshoot of the Augustinian reform movement. They are also known as the Discalced Augustinians because they don’t wear shoes.\nOn 11 October 1992, Pope John Paul II canonized the Recollect Fr. Ezekiel Moreno as a saint of the Roman Catholic Church. Unknown to many, St. Ezekiel spent the first 14 years of his missionary life in the Philippines where he administered the faith in Calapan (Mindoro), in Palawan where he founded the towns of Aborlan and Inagawan, in Las Pinas, Sto. Tomas (Batangas), and Bacoor and Imus in Cavite before moving to South America. He died in 1906.\nThese missionary orders significantly contributed in the colonial government’s subjugation of the Indios by opening up unexplored areas through their missionary work and eventually establishing towns that eased the entry of colonial government administration. By 1595 when Manila was elevated as an archdiocese, the missionary orders were firmly entrenched as the ecclesiastical administrators of the Philippines through the Diocese of Nueva Segovia in the northern provinces of Ilocos and Cagayan, the Diocese of Nueva Caceres in Bikol, and the Diocese of Cebu in southern Philippines. These missionaries also facilitated the emergence of the Filipino book culture with the introduction of the printing press first in 1593 by Fr. Domingo de Nieva (OP) and Keng Yong who printed Fr. Juan de Plasencia’s* Doctrina Christiana which said to be the first book to be printed in the Philippines. The first movable type press was developed by Fr. Francisco Blancas (OP) and Juan de Vera which is the origin of the Imprenta de Santo Tomas where the first Filipino printer, Tomas Pinpin, learned his craft. The Augustinians also imported their press from Japan where the first Pampango books were printed. The Jesuits later had their own printing press in 1639 and the Franciscans in 1692.\nAt the twilight of the Spanish colonial rule in the Philippines, the friars were immortalized by Dr. Jose Rizal as the abusive Padre Damaso and they have been mostly viewed as such since then. In fairness to them, it was the friars who campaigned for the establishment of one of the only 3 colonial Real Audiencia or supreme courts in Manila (the 2 others were in Lima and Mexico) to temper colonial abuses on the Indios. And among the works of the great Fr. Juan de Plasencia is the Los Costumbres de los Tagalogs that was considered as the first civil code of the Philippines because all Spanish provincial governors then were required to read it so they may govern in a way that is familiar with the Indios.\n*Fr. Juan de Plasencia was listed as an Augustinian by Nick Joaquin, and as a Franciscan by Fr. Jose Femilou Gutay (OFM).\nSOURCES: Nick Joaquin’s “Manila, My Manila”, Fr.

{"question":"How did historical documentation methods differ between regions, and what early sea travel evidence exists?","answer":"Historical documentation methods varied significantly by region - some used the Hijrah dating system common in Arabic historiography, while others relied on individual ages or reign periods to build chronologies. As for early sea travel evidence, archaeological findings show humans reached Borneo by sea from the Asian mainland at least 120,000 years ago, and Australia and New Guinea were populated by sea travelers around 50,000 years ago. The earliest representation of a ship under sail was found in Kuwait, dating to the late 5th millennium BC.","context":["In previous articles, I looked at a number of textual traditions from Southeast Asia that have strong connections to the Indian Ocean world, while also exhibiting distinctively local outlooks: the Javanese chronogram tradition, and the works of the Malay Sufi poet Hamzah of Barus.\nIn this article, I examine a historical text written in northern Sumatra in the mid-17th century, which illustrates some of the complexities of cultural influence at global and local scales. My aim is to illustrate a concrete model for how these cultural factors interacted to shape the way that history was written. I’m interested in the question: what did it mean to write history in the Indian Ocean world?\nThe Garden of Kings\nThe text is called The Garden of Kings. Its full title in Arabic is Bustan al-salatin fi dhikr al-awwalin wa ‘l-akhirin (The Garden of Kings on the recollection of the past and the future). It is a 7-volume work commissioned by Sultan Iskandar Thani, the ruler of Aceh between 1637 and 1641. It belongs to a genre called “Mirror for Princes”, a term for any sort of writing whose primary aim is to edify and educate a ruler.\nThe author of The Garden of Kings was Nur al-Din al-Raniri, a Gujarati-born Muslim of Hadrami descent who had migrated to Aceh in 1637. Raniri briefly served as the leading cleric of the Sultan’s court, in which capacity he composed this text. One of the better-known incidents during Raniri’s tenure was his campaign to eliminate the influence of the wahdat al-wujud doctrine, which he considered heretical. Raniri therefore set himself against the theological legacy left in the preceding decades by Hamzah and by the previous shaykh at the Acehnese court, Syams al-Din.\nFor a historical point of view, the most useful part of The Garden of Kings is the second volume. It contains a universal history, which is a catch-all term for historical works that attempt to integrate many different historical narratives into a complete history of the world.\nRaniri’s history begins with the stories of the Prophets as told in the Qur’an and the Hadith, as is standard for universal histories written in a Muslim context. The Garden of Kings, Vol. 2 then goes on to dedicate subsequent chapters to the histories of various kingdoms and dynasties, both pre- and post-Islamic.\n|Greece, Rome, Byzantium||3|\nThe form of universal history\nRaniri’s universal history may have been structured in this way in order to show how the Malay-speakers, especially the Acehnese who were his patrons, represented the culmination of Islamic history. Scholars such as Jelani Harun have noted this teleological aspect of the text, and argued that the historian aimed to “connect the Malay people … and the peoples of the world as a whole”.\nThe text uses extensive genealogical networks to tie the various dynasties together. For example, the Persian dynasty described in chapter 2 and the Malay dynasties of chapter 12 are connected by their common descent from Iskandar Zulkarnain (a legendary figure from the Qur’an based on Alexander the Great). Raniri seems to have selected those histories that could plausibly be linked to the eventual emergence of Islamic kingdoms in the Malay world, such as Melaka, Pahang, and ultimately, Aceh.\nThe chapter structure of The Garden of Kings, Vol. 2 suggests that it is a combination of very different kinds of source material. Certain chapters use the Hijrah dating system common to Arabic-language historiography; for example, “Shaykh Syams al-Din al-Samatrani passed away on Monday, the 12th day of Rejab, in the year 1039 of the Hijrah era” (equivalent to 25 February 1630). Other chapters use only the age of individuals to build a chronology; for example, “The Flood occurred when the Prophet Noah was 1200 years old”. Still other chapters have no dating whatsoever, but simply categorise events into the periods of reign of different rulers.\nWe find that Raniri rarely specifies what his sources are, but often gives the vague disclaimer: “according to those who have preserved this history”. This shows a divergence from the classical Arabic tradition of historical writing, which often makes use of chains of transmission (isnad) to verify different accounts of the past. Because of his lack of explicit citation, it would take some committed detective work to scour the historical literatures in Arabic, Persian and Indian languages, identifying the original accounts that Raniri has drawn upon, if they still exist.\nOne important source that Raniri does cite by name is The Chains of Kings (called Sulalat al-Salatin in Arabic but better known by an alternative Malay title Sejarah Melayu). This is a Malay text that records the background and history of the Melaka court and its successor states in Johor and Pahang. It was compiled in Johor in 1612 from older materials, under the direction of the chief minister Tun Sri Lanang.\nRaniri’s chapter 12 is a summary of The Chains of Kings, with some extra genealogical data at the beginning and end. He does not question the validity or trustworthiness of this Malay source, but simply integrates its main points into his own narrative. Raniri’s uncritical handling of this source might lead us to speculate that he was similarly credulous of his other sources.\nWe can see that at a few points in his text, Raniri has attempted to synchronise the different narratives by finding a genealogical link or establishing a coincidence of events. For example, he links the end of chapter 3 (Byzantine history) to the middle of chapter 8 (the Prophet Muhammad’s biography) with this statement: “When Heraclius had been on the throne for 13 years, the Prophet Muhammad moved from Mecca to Medina.”\nThe challenge of interpretation\nI argue that The Garden of Kings, Vol. 2 is a composite text of heterogeneous parts that retain their individual styles and structures. The text was produced by a specific interaction between global textual norms and local textual conditions.\nThe global norms that Raniri tried to adhere to were those of the Islamic universal history genre. He drew on diverse sources to integrate the histories of regions from all over the Indian Ocean world, in order to tell the story of the world’s Islamic community. A side effect of Raniri’s inclusive approach was that he tended to avoid critical judgement of his sources, which makes it hard to discern his original contribution to our knowledge of history.\nThe diversity of local textual conditions shaped the heterogeneous structure of The Garden of Kings, Vol. 2. Different sorts of historical records were found in the different regions he studied: some used the Hijrah era, while other used genealogies to organise historical events. This led to Raniri’s final product looking like a chronological hodge-podge, with only the most tenuous links connecting the various timelines together.\nThese features don’t reduce the value of Raniri’s work. Rather, they mean that we need to take special care and put more effort into reading the historical sources of the Indian Ocean world. Our first step is to properly situate The Garden of Kings in the textual networks of the region, in order to better understand what sources Raniri may have used, and to what extent his originality as a historian comes into play. It’s only through this kind of detailed comparison of texts that we can answer the question of what it meant to write history in the Indian Ocean world in this period.","Maritime History and Facts - Sea and Ships\nMaritime history deals with the study of human activity at sea. It includes fishing, whaling, international maritime law, naval history, the history of\nships, ship design, shipbuilding, history of navigation, history of the various maritime-related sciences and generally humankind's various relationships\nto the oceans, seas, and major waterways of the globe.\nThere is archaeological evidence, at least 120,000 years old, that humans arrived on Borneo by sea from the Asian mainland. According to some theories,\nAustralia and New Guinea were populated some 50,000 ago, again by people that came by sea. The earliest representation of a ship under sail comes from a\npainted disc that was found in Kuwait and is believed that it was made in the late 5th millennium BC. The first boats are presumed to have been dugout\ncanoes which were used for coastal fishing and travel.

Although it was known that magnetic needle can be used for navigation, Chinese started\nusing magnetic needle submersed in a bowl of water - a compass - from 1117 AD. Europe started using compass at sea from 1190 AD. Before that Polynesians\nand the Northern European Vikings developed oceangoing vessels and used them without any instruments.

{"question":"What are the key differences between triggering actions in Zapier versus Microsoft Flow when it comes to email-based automation?","answer":"Zapier and Microsoft Flow handle email-based automation triggers differently. In Zapier, you get a unique email address for each zap, and when emails are sent to that address, they can trigger actions based on subject line and body text filters. The process doesn't require email verification when using Postbox. In contrast, Microsoft Flow operates through connectors that serve as proxies for services, requiring authentication before use. Flow's email triggers are part of a broader system where every automation starts with a trigger (such as receiving an email) and can connect to multiple services through its 200+ connectors. Both systems can perform actions like sending notifications or creating records, but Flow emphasizes integration between multiple services while Zapier focuses on direct email-to-action connections.","context":["Create a Zapier Zap from an Email\nPostbox's Quick Post feature enables you to quickly set up and use send-to-service email addresses. Best of all, you can send content to the service in the background, without having to open up a compose window.\nWith Zapier, you can send emails directly to Zapier to trigger a zap using your unique Zapier email address. Receive a SMS notification with customer inquiries, log emails in a spreadsheet, create new contacts from emails, or run any Zapier Zap to boost your productivity. Note: Free accounts can set up five total zaps and are limited to zaps with one trigger and one action. Upgraded plans can use multi-step zaps and have a higher zap count.\nFind your Zapier email address\nYour Zapier email address is a unique address you can use to send emails to Zapier and looks something like this: firstname.lastname@example.org. A unique Zapier email address can be set up for each zap. To select your Zapier email address, within Zapier go to the \"What Do you Want to Automate Today?\" box. Select the Email by Zapier app as the trigger app. Pick the \"New Inbound Email\" as the zap trigger in the dropdown menu. Select the action app, or the action you want the new inbound email to trigger, e.g., select the SMS by Zapier app to send an SMS after receiving emails.\nClick the \"Make a Zap!\" button. In the next text box, create an email address that is unique to that zap. Copy this email address to your clipboard.\nIf you were using Gmail to auto-forward emails to Zapier, at this point you would need to verify the Zapier email address, which can be complicated and frustrating to do for each zap. With Postbox, there is no need to verify the address – making the whole process easier!\nNext, you can create custom filters to trigger zaps using the email subject and/or keywords in the body text. After creating filters, set the actions you want Zapier to take within the action app, e.g. set up the SMS by Zapier app to include the full email in the SMS (the exact actions in this step will depend on the action app you have selected). Any incoming email to that unique email address with the custom filter keywords will now trigger the zap.\nCreate your Quick Post\nIn Postbox, navigate to Preferences or Options > Advanced > Quick Post and then click the + button to create a new Quick Post.\nCreate a name for the Quick Post, then enter your Zapier email address.\nIn the Direct Post, you can add keywords at the beginning or end of your subject line, corresponding to the subject line filters set up in Zapier, to specify which zap you would like to trigger.\nEmail Subject: [Subject corresponding to set filter in Zapier]\nEmail Body Text Contains: [Keywords corresponding to set filter in Zapier]\nSend an SMS to your phone when a new course signup comes in:\n- Email Subject: New Course Signup\nLog emails about a selected person into a spreadsheet:\n- Email Body Text Contains: John Smith\nSpecify how the message should be sent\nSend As Attachment is usually the best way to go since you're forwarding the original email. Services can then do the right thing with regards to images as attachments, for instance.\nSend should be used when the service doesn't know how to process .eml files as attachments, like Trello or Slack. However, it does have some limitations. For example, images embedded into the message body as an IMAP URL won't show in the destination.\nSend via Compose Window will bring up the Compose Window, which you can then edit before sending. This option is also the best one to use for images embedded into the message body as an IMAP URL.\nAutomatic email filtering or forwarding\nYou can also set up Postbox's email filters to automatically trigger a Quick Post when you receive an email from a specific sender or with a particular subject.\nFor example, you can configure Postbox to quick post any emails sent from \"Google Analytics' with \"weekly report\" in the subject line to your company's \"Reports\" notebook.\nTo set this up, go to Postbox's Tools menu > Message Filters > New, set your filter criteria, then for the action select Quick Post and then your desired Quick Post.\nBut note that messages are always sent As Attachment when using a filter action because, by their nature, filter actions run in the background. So be sure to select \"Send as Attachment\" within the editor panel for this Quick Post.","Automating business process using Kaizala Flow connector\nIntroduction to Microsoft Flow\nMicrosoft Flow is a service that helps you create automated workflows between your favorite apps and services to synchronize files, get notifications, collect data, and more.

In some sense, you could just build a flow chart that would run the logic behind the scenes – that simple!\nFlow abstracts out services as connectors which serve as a proxy / wrapper around the underlying service. Flow communicates with the connector(s) and enables you to pass output from one connector to another. This allows you to build a Flow integrating with multiple services. A connector could have triggers and actions. Triggers are the event that trigger a flow. Every flow starts with a trigger. Example of a trigger: When an email is received. Actions are the functionalities that the services exposes. Example of an action: Send an email. When you add a connector on Flow, if the connector requires an underlying account for accessing the service / functionality – you will need to authenticate / configure the account before you can use the connector.

{"question":"What are the key dental hygiene practices recommended during the COVID-19 pandemic, and how does this crisis impact children's emotional well-being in terms of trauma-related symptoms?","answer":"During the COVID-19 pandemic, essential dental hygiene practices include never sharing toothbrushes to prevent virus transmission, keeping toilet lids closed when flushing to avoid spray contamination, changing toothbrushes every three months, maintaining clean bathrooms, and continuing basic oral care routines like brushing with fluoride toothpaste twice daily. Regarding children's emotional impact, the pandemic has significantly affected mental health, with 83% of children reporting increased anxiety in a Young Minds survey. Other trauma-related symptoms include sleep problems, panic attacks, and increasing thoughts of self-harm. This collective trauma experience is characterized by lack of predictability, immobility, fear, powerlessness, and loss of safety, communication, and purpose.","context":["COVID-19: Looking after yourselves and others through better oral hygiene\nMaintaining great personal hygiene has never been more important, given the current pandemic situation that many of us across the world find ourselves in.\nAdvice around how to do this is something that we all should take note of. Especially, regular handwashing with soap for at least 20 seconds or using hand sanitizer gel when this is not possible.\nIt is important to remember that being as hygienic as possible doesn’t just help protect you, but it also protects those around you.\nThe Oral Health Foundation has provided the following advice to help avoid catching or spreading the coronavirus (COVID-19).\nDo not share a toothbrush\nYou should never share your toothbrush with anybody else, no matter how close you are to them.\nThis is one way that viruses and blood-borne diseases can be caught from other people.\nYou should make sure that toothbrush heads are also kept apart from each other wherever you and the rest of your household store your toothbrushes.\nKeep the toilet lid closed before you flush\nIf you store your toothbrush anywhere near your toilet, every time someone flushes, some of the toilet sprays will fly out and land on your toothbrush.\nThere has already been research conducted that suggests that the virus can be spread via faecal matter (poo).\nMake sure you close the lid before you flush and keep your brush at a safe distance away from the toilet.\nChange your toothbrush regularly\nIt’s important to change your toothbrush, or brush head, at least every three months. Perhaps even earlier if the bristles become frayed.\nThis helps to ensure you are brushing your teeth effectively. A worn brush can’t do the job it needs to.\nChanging your brush regularly also helps prevent the spread of bacteria.\nClean your bathroom regularly\nMany of us store our toothbrushes, towels, flannels and other intimate items in our bathrooms.\nDue to this reason, it is important to keep the bathroom clean at all times to ensure that there is no spreading of germs and viruses.\nVisiting the dentist\nIt is important to maintain regular visits to your dental team. It’s best to always call ahead before any appointments, especially during this period of uncertainty. You can ask about any special check-in procedures your dental office may have, or if they have any paperwork you can complete online before your visit.\nBe prepared for your appointment to either be delayed or canceled. This is for the safety of both staff and patients. Emergency treatment may still be available but other, more routine procedures, may be postponed for the foreseeable future. Communicate with your dentist about your needs to make sure you receive essential care, without putting yourself or others at unnecessary risk.\nDon’t forget the basics\nOur oral health should always be a priority. In addition to visiting your local dental team when possible, don’t forget the simple day-to-day habits that will help you keep a healthy mouth.\nBrush daily with a fluoride toothpaste last thing at night and at least one other time during the day.\nCut down on how much and how often you have sugary foods and drinks and drink plenty of water.\nConsider using a mouthwash and clean between your teeth every day with interdental brushes or floss.\nBushel, George. “COVID-19: our guide to looking after yourselves and others through better oral hygiene”.

Some evidence suggests that more children will have been placed at risk during this period, given higher incidence of domestic violence. For example, calls to the Domestic Abuse Helpline rose by 49% the week after ‘Lockdown’, and killings in the home have doubled. Families continue to face pressures which might exacerbate relational difficulties. Irritability is high, and resilience maybe low. Alongside this, families are living with the potential threat of the virus, with some having experienced family losses themselves, alongside financial challenges. At the start of the pandemic in March 2020, a Young Minds survey revealed that ‘Lockdown’ had had a profound impact on children with existing mental health conditions, with feelings of increasing anxiety reported by 83% of over 2000 children interviewed. Other symptoms noted were sleep problems, panic attacks and increasing thoughts around self-harm (Young Minds Survey, March 2020). In response, Emma Thomas, Chief Executive of Young Minds, said:\n“The coronavirus pandemic is a human tragedy that will continue to alter the lives of everyone in our society, and the results of this survey show just how big an impact this has had, and will continue to have, on the mental health of young people”.\nIt stands to reason then, that schools will need to equip themselves with knowledge and skills in the area of trauma-informed practice more than ever before, and that the plight of those children who have already experienced traumatic early histories must be the key focus for school leaders and teachers. However, until children are ‘back to school’, much remains unknown as to the emotional and psychological impact of COVID-19 on children and young people as a whole. A few key considerations for school leaders and teachers are discussed here to support their preparations and planning;\n1. Explore emotional health and well-being\nSome trauma specialists have gone as far to say that society as a whole is undergoing ‘collective trauma’ as a result of the pandemic, (e.g. Bomber 2020). In Louise Bomber’s webinars, she describes the sustained presence of the coronavirus as the experience of a collective threat. As a result, our nervous systems are likely to be on alert, with a higher preponderance for low level fight/flight reactions to environmental stressors etc. Bomber makes the useful link between the 7 preconditions of trauma (Van der Kolk 2014), and our experiences of COVID-19 and ‘Lockdown’, which will apply to teachers, parents and children alike;\n- Lack of predictability\n- Immobility, fear and powerlessness,\n- Loss of communication and connection\n- Loss of safety/time\n- Loss of safety\n- Loss of purpose\nWhilst mental health risk factors are likely to have increased for our children during the period of ‘Lockdown’, early behaviour theorists remind us that behaviour is a function of both our personality traits and environmental influences/resources (Lewin 1935). Whilst one person might develop symptoms of depression or anxiety following a traumatic event, another person might not report any symptoms at all for example. Therefore, how children attribute meaning to events is important to consider when determining the psychological impact of collective threat over time. Moreover, and according to cognitive behavioural science, it is the interaction between a person’s beliefs, feelings and thoughts in relation to a traumatic event that leads to either adaptive or maladaptive coping mechanisms, not the event itself. It seems useful then for schools to check the ‘emotional temperature’ not just of the vulnerable, but for all children returning to school. Some useful resources to consider are;\n- Back to school wellbeing questionnaire, ELSA Support; https://www.elsa-support.co.uk/back-to-school-wellbeing-questionnaire/?fbclid=IwAR1Yu8Fn79qPPSB_1h9oXYjH1sPRmkRwsvx8Vbma1QI4bntGqsppLSEZBOY (Early Years and Key Stage 1)\n- Pupil Attitudes to Self and School (PASS), GL Assessment; https://www.gl-assessment.co.uk/products/pupil-attitudes-to-self-and-school-pass/ (Key Stage 2/3/4)\n- Emotional Literacy Assessment and Intervention, Southampton City Council (Faupal 2003) (Key Stage 2/3/4)\n2. Consider the System Around the Child\nWhilst assessment of children’s emotional needs prior to their full return will be advantageous, the likelihood of schools being able to gather accurate whole-school data is unlikely. We also know that for some, their difficulties may emerge over time as the school structures slot back into place, because behaviour is understood as a response to our environment. According to system theorists (e.g. Bertalanaffy 1968), attempts to study ‘one part’ of the system in isolation will provide an incomplete picture, because the parts are interconnected and ‘greater than the whole’. In their ‘psychosocial system’ (above), Miller and Leyden (1999) demonstrate that there are a set of recursive interactions primarily between student, teacher and parents which can be thought to be ‘surrounding’ pupil behaviour. In essence then, whilst the primary goal maybe to ‘support children’s mental health’ upon the return to school, ignoring the impact of parents/staff wellbeing on children’s presentation should be avoided.\na) Support Parents and Carers\nSocial psychology studies indicate that children’s behaviour is largely influenced by what they see role models doing (Bandura 1977), therefore we can probably expect that for those parents who feel anxious, their children will too, and the same goes for other strongly felt emotions. In times of national crisis, evidence also suggests that different segments of society are likely to arrive at different conclusions about what ‘appropriate actions’ they should take. Indeed, when people’s psychological needs are frustrated (e.g. potentially as a result of increasing isolation and limited self-control) alternative narratives such as conspiracy theories can become attractive (McCauley & Jacques 1979). The polarisation of views will mean that for school leaders trying to drive ‘collective action’ there is likely to a be a continuum of responsiveness, both at the child and parent level. Absenteeism, in-action or despondency are likely reactions of some families and communities, yet there will be high levels of stress, anxiety and maladaptive coping in others.\nWhilst engaging parents is nothing new for schools, (and is already part of their planning for the school return), there appears to be stronger reasons for generating conversations about their wellbeing right now, if we want to effectively plan for children’s emotional recovery moving forwards. Some ideas to support school leaders are;\nThe more personalised the communication channels with parents, the more likely there will be connection and concordance according to behavioural/social psychology research. Nudging statements e.g. ‘the overwhelming majority of people in our community people feel that…’ tend to create behaviour shifts at times of crisis, more than coercive measures such as legally imposed or directive policies (e.g. Van Bavel et al 2020).\nFocus on the majority;\nConformity research tells us that people are more likely to cooperate when they believe others are (Asch 1961). People also tend to be highly reactive to choices made by trusted others. Social media might therefore play an active role for schools in supporting shifts in expectations; it could be a place to demonstrate cooperation and resilience in your school community, rather than a forum to deliver information only.\nSupporting parents and carers with their emotional wellbeing at this crucial time will be money well spent. Build into your planning the idea of parent workshops around stress/anxiety management, or parent ‘drop ins’ to support any queries as they arise. Use school psychologists and counsellors in a consultative capacity to help support the emotional needs of parents/carers and link with family liaison/charitable organisations where appropriate. Whilst many parents might not take up the offer, they will be comforted by the presence of a ‘listening organisation’ at times of uncertainty.\nb) Support and Prepare Staff\nAs children return to school, the teacher’s sense of safety and wellbeing can not be under-estimated. Yet their mental health will have also been affected by the uncertainties and changes thrust upon them, and they are likely to be at different stages of the cycle of change themselves (e.g. Kubler-Ross 1969). Drawing upon attachment theory (Bowlby 1969, 1988), Heather Geddes (2006) describes how schools can act as a ‘secure base’ for children, offering the protective factors which might otherwise be absent at home. Upon returning to school therefore, children will benefit most from adults who can demonstrate the characteristics of a ‘secure adult’ e.g. attuned, consistent, available, predictable, sensitive, nurturing and responsive. The ability of teachers, support staff, mid-day-supervisors etc to be able ‘relate’ and connect is imperative to help children develop a sense of belonging and re-connection with the school community. It is from this point that children can explore and learn confidently.\nIt goes without saying then, that where staff feel anxious or stressed, or have unmet emotional needs themselves, they may convey a lack of emotional availability to those around them. For children who may already be hypervigilant to adult emotions, (e.g. for their own survival), their sense of psychological threat may therefore become even more heightened. As Van der Kolk (2014) argues, the vulnerable will show their story. If children are not feeling safe, they will give meaning to situations or expressions based upon their previous experiences. For example, when feeling heightened levels of fear, children may interpret a sound, a face, a phrase as threatening. More broadly, the common difficulties expressed by traumatised children are described by Hughes, Golding and Hudson (2019) and include;\n- A mistrust of adults, e.g. to keep them safe\n- A limited sense of self\n- Being easily confused, easily led, disorganised, and with no direction\n- Showing a focus on getting their needs met, and limited engagement with little else\n- A lack of curiosity in others and the world around them (focus is to stay safe)\n- A lack of self- awareness as to their own strengths and needs\n- Responding to stress/challenge in unpredictable or impulsive ways\n- Likely to lack skills to facilitate their own development\nNeedless to say, if children’s emotional needs remain unmet, the impact on teaching and learning will be significant. As Hughes et al 2019 explain; ‘when an individual feels under threat, they are not concerned with learning about the world or developing the self- because the focus is on survival in a habitually defensive state’. Creating an emotionally attuned and responsive staff team is therefore crucial to supporting children’s recovery in the short-medium term. Some key thoughts for school leaders might be;\nRe-clarify support systems for staff;\nIt is important to check the emotional temperature of staff teams too, many of whom have been working since ‘Lockdown’ and/or managing their own family challenges/stresses. Teachers need a space to have their own personal/professional journeys recognised, to develop self awareness as to the impact these changes have had on them, and a chance to explore their coping strategies for managing stress/anxiety moving forwards. When staff teams are back together in some physical capacity, school leaders may want to use whole team sessions to map the journey so far, shape a new future together, and identify strengths in the school system moving forwards. This will indirectly help school leaders to develop a community of staff who are ‘in this together’, an effective leadership approach at times of crisis and uncertainty. Several problem solving tools can assist whole school planning (see Inclusive Solutions). Orange Psychology has also prepared some Collective Recovery Workshops to assist schools in this area (see Workshop 1/2).\nAvoid focusing on ‘catch up’ too soon;\nMany theorists in the area of trauma-research are warning that children will not be ready to pick up where they left off cognitively or academically. Yet we know the pressure for performance in schools has not abated. The neuroscience of trauma imaging tells us thought, that the brain needs time to repair from anxiety and stress (Van Der Kolk 2014), through relationship/connection and regulation (Dobson & Perry 2010). Children cannot move to higher parts of brain functions (e.g. rationality and reasoning) before these stages are supported. Schools will need to think through providing a curriculum which is therefore focused on recovery, which embodies the principles of relationship and regulation before attempting to reintroduce the pace of the curriculum as it previously was (e.g. Barry Carpenter 2020).\nFocus training around Trauma Informed Practice;\nDuring the transitional of children returning to school, it seems ever critical to equip staff with greater knowledge, skills and confidence in the area of trauma informed practice. There are a variety of places to seek training in this area nationally (e.g. Touchbase), but is also a focus of many local psychology/therapeutic services including our own ‘Collective Recovery Workshops’ offered to schools (e.g. Collective Recovery Workshop 2/3)\nIn summary, whilst we do not yet fully know the emotional impact of COVID-19 on children, we have some clues based on social indicators and our understanding of the impact of trauma in childhood. Whilst one size won’t fit all and not all children will be ‘traumatised’, we still need to respect each child and family’s experiences. We need to provide a listening space for the system around the child, and to provide connection and co-regulation for those most at risk. As Louse Bomber (2020) emphasises, we must go slowly.. there is no rush. Time and sensitivity will be needed to understand and notice how children are responding upon their return, with informed and responsive teaching staff who have skills to help children to manage their feelings safely.\nAsch, S.

{"question":"How do the bond angles differ between methane (CH4) and ethene (C2H4)?","answer":"In methane (CH4), the H-C-H bond angles are 109.5 degrees due to its tetrahedral geometry resulting from sp3 hybridization. In contrast, ethene (C2H4) has bond angles of approximately 120 degrees because its carbons are sp2 hybridized and adopt a trigonal planar geometry.","context":["Do you recognize this plant?\nIf we were walking on the beach, the plants shown above would look very different. They would be short and sticking out of the sand. When we see them this way, we do not immediately recognize them as beach plants. Often we need to look at the world around us in different ways to understand things better.\nHybrid Orbitals – sp 3\nsp 3 Hybridization\nUnfortunately, overlap of existing atomic orbitals ( s , p , etc.) is not sufficient to explain some of the bonding and molecular geometries that are observed. Consider the element carbon and the methane (CH 4 ) molecule. A carbon atom has the electron configuration of 1s 2 2s 2 2p 2 , meaning that it has two unpaired electrons in its 2p orbitals, as shown in the Figure below .\nOrbital configuration for carbon atom.\nAccording to the description of valence bond theory so far, carbon would be expected to form only two bonds, corresponding to its two unpaired electrons. However, methane is a common and stable molecule, with four equivalent C−H bonds. To account for this, one of the 2s electrons is promoted to the empty 2p orbital (see Figure below ).\nPromotion of carbon s electron to empty p orbital.\nNow, four bonds are possible. The promotion of the electron “costs” a small amount of energy, but recall that the process of bond formation is accompanied by a decrease in energy. The two extra bonds that can now be formed results in a lower overall energy and thus greater stability to the CH 4 molecule. Carbon normally forms four bonds in most of its compounds.\nThe number of bonds is now correct, but the geometry is wrong. The three p orbitals (p x , p y , p z ) are oriented at 90 o relative to one another. However, as was seen from VSEPR theory, the observed H−C−H bond angle in the tetrahedral CH 4 molecule is actually 109.5 o . Therefore, the methane molecule cannot be adequately represented by simple overlap of the 2s and 2p orbitals of carbon with the 1s orbitals of each hydrogen atom.\nTo explain the bonding in methane, it is necessary to introduce the concept of hybridization and hybrid atomic orbitals. Hybridization is the mixing of the atomic orbitals in an atom to produce a set of hybrid orbitals. When hybridization occurs, it must do so as a result of the mixing of nonequivalent orbitals. In other words, s and p orbitals can hybridize but p orbitals cannot hybridize with other p orbitals. Hybrid orbitals are the atomic orbitals obtained when two or more nonequivalent orbitals form the same atom combine in preparation for bond formation. In the current case of carbon, the single 2s orbital hybridizes with the three 2p orbitals to form a set of four hybrid orbitals, called sp 3 hybrids (see Figure below ).\nCarbon sp 3 hybrid orbitals.\nThe sp 3 hybrids are all equivalent to one another. Spatially, the hybrid orbitals point towards the four corners of a tetrahedron (see Figure below ).\nThe process of sp 3 hybridization is the mixing of an s orbital with a set of three p orbitals to form a set of four sp 3 hybrid orbitals. Each large lobe of the hybrid orbitals points to one corner of a tetrahedron. The four lobes of each of the sp 3 hybrid orbitals then overlap with the normal unhybridized 1s orbitals of each hydrogen atoms to form the tetrahedral methane molecule.\n- Electrons hybridize in order to form covalent bonds.\n- Nonequivalent orbitals mix to form hybrid orbitals.\nUse the link below to answer the following questions. Read only the sections on ammonia and water hybridization.\n- What are the bond angles in ammonia and in water?\n- What contributes to these unexpected bond angles?\n- What happens to the lone pair electrons in ammonia when hybridization occurs?\n- Does the same thing happen with water?\n- Why is carbon expected to form only two covalent bonds?\n- How many covalent bonds does carbon actually form?\n- What needs to happen to allow carbon to form four bonds?","If you like us, please share us on social media.\nThe latest UCD Hyperlibrary newsletter is now complete, check it out.\nC2H4, also known as ethylene or ethene, is a gaseous material created synthetically through steam cracking. In nature, it is released in trace amounts by plants to signal their fruits to ripen. Ethene consists of two sp2-hybridized carbon atoms, which are sigma bonded to each other and to two hydrogen atoms each. The remaining unhybridized p orbitals on the carbon form a pi bond, which gives ethene its reactivity.\nIn 1916 G. N. Lewis proposed that a chemical bond is formed by the valence electrons of atoms which would prove fundamental in the valence bond theory. We all remember our first alkene discussed in Organic Chemistry and it was usually C2H4. This is becuase ethene is the smallest alkene and how it is also planar. The Valence Bond theory will show us how the bonds in C2H4 come together. Two things that will help us utilize the Valence Bond Theory effectively are familiarity with Lewis Structures and VSEPR theory.\nA key component of using Valence Bond Theory correctly is being able to use the Lewis dot diagram correctly. Ethene has a double bond between the carbons and single bonds between each hydrogen and carbon: each bond is represented by a pair of dots, which represent electrons. Each carbon requires a full octet and each hydrogen requires a pair of electrons. The correct Lewis structure for ethene is shown below:\nFor more information on how to use Lewis Dot Structures refer to http://chemwiki.ucdavis.edu/Wikitexts/UCD_Chem_124A%3a_Kauzlarich/ChemWiki_Module_Topics/Lewis_Structures.\nValence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) Theory is used to predict the bond angles and spatial positions of the carbon and hydrogen atoms of ethene and to determine the bond order of the carbon atoms (the number of bonds formed between them). Each carbon atom is of the general arrangement AX3, where A is the central atom surrounded by three other atoms (denoted by X); compounds of this form adopt trigonal planar geometry, forming 120 degree bond angles. In order for the unhybridized p orbitals to successfully overlap, the CH2 must be coplanar: therefore, C2H4 is a planar molecule and each bond angle is about 120 degrees. The diagram below shows the bond lengths and hydrogen-carbon-carbon bond angles of ethene:\nAccording to valence bond theory, two atoms form a covalent bond through the overlap of individual half-filled valence atomic orbitals, each containing one unpaired electron. In ethene, each hydrogen atom has one unpaired electron and each carbon is sp2 hybridized with one electron each sp2 orbital. The fourth electron is in the p orbital that will form the pi bond. The bond order for ethene is simply the number of bonds between each atom: the carbon-carbon bond has a bond order of two, and each carbon-hydrogen bond has a bond order of one.

Christopher Hutchison, Company Senior Medic, Company A, 1st Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment has been named U.S. Army Special Operations Command Medic of the Year.\nThis is the fourth year in a row that a Combat Medic from the 75th Ranger Regiment has been awarded this prestigious honor.\n\"It is so surreal. I don't think I did anything at all to deserve this award,\" said Hutchison. \"It's humbling to even be considered for such a significant award.\"\nHutchison has provided medical coverage on more than 275 combat missions and has demonstrated excellence on every single one of them, according to his nomination letter.\n\"Hutch has always been assertive with training and his combat medic skills,\" said Cpt. Andrew Fisher, Battalion Physician Assistant, 1st Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment. \"He takes the extra time to ensure his subordinate medics are trained to the best of their ability.\"\nDuring a recent combat deployment to Afghanistan, Hutchison was on the objective when an Afghan Soldier, suffered a gunshot wound to the chest. Hutchison was the second medic to arrive and quickly took the lead.\n\"Staff Sgt. Hutchison directed the application of occlusive dressings and a saline lock; provided instructions to set up a litter and hypothermia prevention dressings, provided adequate pain management and turned over all required medical documentation before loading him onto a rotary wing casualty evacuation platform,\" said Fisher.\n\"I was just doing my job,\" said Hutchison. \"I was on target with junior medics and they are so well trained that I didn't have to micro manage the care they were providing.\"\nAfter evacuating the Afghan Soldier, Hutchison encountered one local national who was wounded and one was very seriously wounded with gunshot wounds to the chest and pelvis.\n\"After quickly assessing and treating the patient for life-threatening wounds, Staff Sgt. Hutchison recognized the need for additional treatment and resuscitation,\" said Fisher. \"He recognized the patient was bleeding internally, and treated him with one dose of Traexamic Acid and the patient responded immediately to the lifesaving measure.\"\nHutchison was the first combat medic to administer TXA, which is a clotting agent that until recently had been authorized for use in the pre-hospital environment by special operation forces medics.\n\"The patient was evacuated to the nearest medical treatment facility, where he underwent multiple surgeries and made a complete recovery,\" said Fisher. \"Staff Sgt. Hutchison received accolades from the medical providers for his assertive and accurate treatments.\"\nRanger combat medics are first and foremost, Rangers first as Hutchison demonstrated during a combat mission in Kandahar Providence, Afghanistan.\nAfter a combat engagement which involved an aerial gun run with an AC-130 Gunship, a small element from the Ranger platoon was tasked with the clearance of the known enemy fighting position. Hutchison was traveling behind the lead team as they were engaged by multiple enemy combatants from fortified positions.\n\"We were surprised that after the gunship engagement, the enemy was still alive and maneuvering on us,\" said Hutchison. \"We were pinned down for just a few minutes until we reengaged the enemy combatants.\"\nHutchison identified the lead team was fixed by enemy fire and ran, under fire, to the team's right flank. He was within 15 meters of an enemy machine gun position, and rounds were impacting all around him. Hutchison repeatedly exposed himself to machine gun fire in order to suppress the enemy position with small arms and fragmentation grenades.\n\"His decisive action allowed the remainder of the team to prepare for a flanking maneuver,\" said Fisher. \"His clear and accurate reporting to the Squad Leader on the enemy positions, painted a concise picture on the composition and disposition of the enemy on the ridgeline.\"\nWhen the decision was made to fall back to allow for another aerial gun run, Hutchison increased his fire suppression and maneuvered to cover the remainder of the squad's withdrawal. Throughout the movement down the mountain, Hutchison provided covering fire as the squad moved from position to position.\n\"You don't think,\" said Hutchison. \"You react to the battle drill – the guy was shooting at us from 15 feet away and you absolutely rely on your training; straight up Infantry Ranger tactics.\"\nOnce out of small arms range, Hutchison moved throughout the Platoon's positions, ensuring no Rangers were wounded by enemy fire; for these actions, he was awarded the Joint Service Commendation Medal for Valor.\n\"Staff Sgt. Hutchison is a devoted and extraordinary Ranger Medic,\" said Fisher. \"He possesses all the moral qualities and maturity needed to excel both personally and professionally. He is an immeasurable asset to our organization and his moral compass and discipline are beyond reproach.\"\n\"He is constantly looking for new and innovative ways to bring better lifesaving measures to the battlefield,\" said Fisher. \"His skills are second to none and his competence sets him apart from other medics as he was chosen as a junior NCO to become a company senior medic.\"\nHutchison was presented with an Army Commendation Medal at an awards ceremony held Jan. 18 at Hunter Army Airfield, Ga.\nHutchison's military training includes Basic Combat Training, Advanced Individual Training—Combat Medic Course, Basic Airborne Course, Ranger Assessment and Selection Program, Special Operations Combat Medical Skills Course, Advanced Cardiac Life Support, Warrior Leader Course, U.S. Army Ranger Course and the Jumpmaster Course.\nThe Combat Medic Course is taught at Fort Sam Houston, Texas and provided Hutchison with his Emergency Medical Technician-Basic Certification and qualified him as a combat medic.\nHutchison also attended the Special Operations Combat Medic Course at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. The intensive six month course teaches extensive training in anatomy and physiology, kinetics of trauma, advanced trauma skills and procedures, Trauma Combat Casualty Care and combat trauma management.\nHutchison completed a emergency room/EMT rotation at Tampa General Hospital and Tampa Fire and Rescue in Tampa, Fla. Upon graduation, he received a certification in Advanced Tactical Practitioner. He also completed two rotations at the Grady Trauma Center, Atlanta, Ga.\nHutchison has deployed five times in support of Operation Enduring Freedom for a total of 19 months deployed.\nHis decorations include the Ranger Tab, Combat Medical Badge, and Parachutist Badge.\nHe has also been awarded the Bronze Star Medal, the Joint Services Commendation medal for Valor (two awards), Army Commendation Medal, Joint Service Achievement Medal, Army Achievement Medal (two awards), Army Good Conduct Medal, National Defense Service Medal, Afghanistan Campaign Medal with Combat Star, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, Army Service Ribbon, Overseas Service Ribbon, and the NATO Medal.\nHutchison, a native of Idaho Falls, Idaho, is married with two children.

{"question":"How do the stability requirements compare between Daphnia-algae systems in lakes and small-polyp stony corals in oceans?","answer":"Both systems require specific stable conditions, but in different ways. Daphnia-algae systems show stability over a wide range of nutrient levels in lakes where Daphnia predators are not important. In contrast, small-polyp stony corals require very precise environmental conditions to remain stable - they need temperatures between 72-78°F, moderate to intense sunlight, water alkalinity between 8-12 dKH, and pH levels between 8.1-8.4 with minimal fluctuations (only 0.3 variation tolerated).","context":["Areas of Research\n- Population and Community Ecology\nVirtually all of my research is related to the broad question: How are populations regulated in abundance? The question extends naturally, however, to the dynamics of communities. I'm especially interested in the mechanisms that maintain the stability of interacting consumer and resource populations when the consumer keeps the resource population far below the level set by its resources. Since all organisms are involved in such interactions, as either consumers (e.g. predators) or resources (e.g. herbivores), or both, the problem is general. My aims are to understand the mechanisms in particular systems, to test that understanding, both experimentally and by developing testable models of the dynamics of these particular systems, and to develop general theory for consumer-resource interactions. My work, reflecting these interests, falls into three areas: developing models of particular systems, doing experiments to understand these systems and test these models, and developing more general theory.\nI work on 2 experimental systems. (1) California red scale (which actually comes from Asia) is an insect pest of citrus (e.g. oranges and lemons). It is controlled in many parts of the world by a \"natural enemy,\" the parasitoid (insect parasite) Aphytis. A female Aphytis is shown doing her lethal work in the accompanying photo. This parasitoid is one of the most successful and famous biological control agents ever introduced by entomologists to control an insect pest. It has been able to suppress scale populations to very low and remarkably constant densities for many generations. Yet simple models of parasitoid-host interactions predict such systems should be dynamically very unstable. What is missing in these models (and in our understanding of this and many other interactions) that explains this remarkable stability? My colleagues (especially Dr. Sue Swarbrick) and I have been trying to answer this question for about 10 years. We have rejected all the standard explanations via experiments in the field and lab, and models. Most recently (Murdoch et al. 1996, American Naturalist) we showed that stability does not arise from metapopulation dynamics. It appears the answer may lie in the details of the size-related interactions, in a sort of cannibalism that occurs in Aphytis, in small-scale spatial heterogeneity, or mixtures of these mechanisms. The population dynamics model is developed from the \"bottom up\" on our understanding of individual behavior and physiology. We are currently developing a detailed model and are planning a large-scale field experiment to test these ideas. A recently completed model of the system (Murdoch et al. in press, American Naturalist) is able to explain one of the most famous examples of competitive displacement ever recorded - one Aphytis species displaced another over a broad area of southern California. Our model explains the displacement, its amazing speed (about 3 generations), and the consequent observed improvement in biological control of the scale pest.\n(2) The second experimental system consists of the freshwater zooplankter, Daphnia, and its food supply, single-celled algae. In lakes where Daphnia predators are not important, the zooplankter suppresses the algae far below the limits set by nutrients, and Ed McCauley of the University of Calgary, Canada, and I have shown that such systems are stable over a wide range of nutrient levels. This system is an especially well-known example of the \"paradox of enrichment,\" and so explaining its stability would be especially satisfying. My colleagues and I have developed and published well-parameterized models of this system, based on extensive experiments and data on the energetics of individuals (\"individual-based models\"). This work involves international collaboration with scientists in Canada, UK and The Netherlands.\nFresh water ecologists have for years been arguing about the processes that explain the observed patterns of abundance in algae and zooplankton as one moves from nutrient-poor to nutrient-rich lakes. Previous workers, however, have focused on the fact that explanations need also to be consistent with the observed stability of these systems. We have recently used a stripped down version of our model to test (and reject) the major existing hypothesis by requiring them to account simultaneously for both stability and the pattern of abundance. We currently have a large series of experiments and modeling efforts underway in this system. Their aim is to develop models at all levels (individual growth and population dynamics in lab, microcosm and field) that will account for experimental observations while being derived entirely independently from experiments on individuals and their physiology.\nFinally, with my colleagues Dr. Cherie Briggs, Profs Roger Nisbet and Allan Stewart-Oaten, I have been developing general theory for the dynamics of insect parasitoids and hosts and predators and prey. These investigate the effects of spatial aggregation by predators and of the behavior of parasitoids whose responses to hosts depend on both the qualities of the host and the state of the predator. The latter provides a vehicle for exploring the dynamical consequences of behavior predicted form evolutionary considerations. Some of these models also have potential for being useful in selecting successful biological control agents.","Small-polyp stony (SPS) corals are among the most diverse and well-known types of corals found in the world’s oceans – they include many specific kinds of corals from the genera Pocillopora, Montipora and Stylophora. Their skeleton is slowly secreted by the epidermis found at the base of each polyp, and as in the case of LPS (large polyp stony) corals, some varieties can grow much faster than others. The beauty and diversity of SPS corals is maintained in stable habitats, where factors such as temperature, alkalinity and water PH are kept between specific values.\nLarge-Polyp Stony Corals vs. Small-Polyp Corals – The “Great” Divide\nAlthough there is a difference between small-polyp stony corals and LPS corals, there isn’t an actual, concrete distinction between the two. Rather, the transition is smooth, as there are many SPS coral species that have larger polyps, and can often be compared with LPS species. The general difference, however, has to do with the greater fragility and more specific habitat conditions that small-polyp corals may require in order to survive and propagate. In contrast with large-polyp stony corals, they cannot be found at depths where sunlight can’t reach them too easily, nor in waters that are too polluted, murky or cold.\nThe Beauty and Fragility of Small-Polyp Stony Corals\nThere are many beautiful SPS species that are commonly sought out by divers in tropical regions. These include anything from stunning “flowery” patterns like the ones found on Sunset Montipora, and the vibrant purple stem-shaped polyps of the Booberry Acropora, to incredibly exotic, intricate shapes and multicolored textures, such as in the case of the Bisma Worm Rock. Despite their beauty, SPS corals are quite fragile, being commonly attacked by creatures such as nudibranchs and various insects or flatworms that mainly attack Acropora corals. Also, they require specific habitat conditions, such as a temperature between 72 and 78 F, and moderate to intense sunlight.\nThe Preferred Habitats of these Stony Corals\nAside from stable temperature and lighting conditions that can usually only be found in the tropics, small-polyp corals also require several other important factors to be just right, before they can survive. The water alkalinity, for example, has to be between 8-12 dKH, while PH fluctuations of only 0.3 (ideal ranges are somewhere between 8.1 and 8.4) can be tolerated, before the corals begin to find it difficult to maintain their life cycles in the long run. Preferred habitats exist in areas like the islands of the Indian and Pacific Oceans, including places like Fiji, the Maldives, Hawaii or Papua New Guinea.\nPopular Small-Polyp Stony Coral Varieties\nThe most well-known varieties of SPS corals include primarily members of Acroporidae, including the Montipora and Acropora genera. These corals are most fascinating, not only due to their remarkable natural beauty and diversity, but also because they are the dominant reef building hard coral species of the world’s oceans. Although their diversity makes them extremely prevalent, like most small-polyp stony corals, these species still require specific conditions in order to thrive and survive, which is part of the reason why they are rarely able to live in deeper waters."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:f8295ee7-e9e6-4eae-be0e-ff75df1ac76e>","<urn:uuid:0188cd88-89b3-4ca7-996c-d2270ed15854>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Can you explain how the historic 1964 Tokyo Olympics and Super Bowl rings influenced the NFL's All-Pro typeface design?","answer":"The All-Pro typeface design drew inspiration from the 1964 Tokyo Olympics type and poster work, as well as specific Super Bowl rings. Particularly, Super Bowl rings from Super Bowls 10, 12, 16, 17, and 29 were typographic favorites that informed how the typeface's skeleton would be adapted. This historical influence was incorporated while creating a contemporary voice for NFL's digital media design language, resulting in a typeface that maintains strength and flexibility while avoiding being overly sporty or fashionable.","context":["NFL All-Pro Display\nThe NFL Design team, in collaboration with Neil Summerour of Positype, have just completed an extended family of typefaces specifically designed to improved the aesthetic and accessibility on screens of all sizes. This work took design elements from the NFL’s Shield logo, classic typographic principles, and advances in font rendering technologies to create a contemporary family of typefaces that complement and extend the existing NFL brand. The All-Pro family will begin rolling out on NFL digital properties and content over the off-season, and will be widely adopted for the NFL’s 100th season beginning this fall.\nWhy create a new type family?\nProblems had begun to emerge in the early 2010’s when embedded fonts became standard on the web. The NFL’s existing family of typefaces, Endzone, was designed for corporate branding and consumer products, not digital screens. Endzone proved to be functional in some cases, but the product designers were too often forced to license other typefaces for digital products. These decisions came with operational, branding, and budget implications that became increasingly challenging to manage. Things really became untenable as the diversity of digital screens and products exploded during the middle of the decade. The NFL needed something new.\nIt was important to begin with the recognition that this was NOT part of a rebranding of the National Football League. One of the strongest and most recognizable brands in the world, the NFL is iconic and what was to be created had to live next to and compliment the Shield, the existing type families, a number of event and initiative marks, and the 32 team brands. Most importantly, the output needed to solve the issues of accessibility, legibility, consistency, and file weight that were the impetus for the project.\nThe All-Pro family delivers on all of those goals. It is a consistent and focused system that remains horizontally efficient and vertically compact without compromising warmth. The typefaces avoid cliché trappings of letterform clipping and truncation, trendy visual motifs, and naive letter construction that ultimately age all too quickly and fall out of fashion. Instead, All-Pro relies on well-drawn, crisp letterforms and thoughtful aesthetic choices that strike a perfect balance between familiarity, fashion, and function.\nTrading in the neutral for a more sturdy and athletic feel – All-Pro Display attempts to convey the dynamic nature of NFL football without becoming overly powerful or aggressive. All-Pro Display speaks football in its compact frame and squared sides. Competing radii on the exterior and interior outlines of the letterforms become easily recognizable as NFL while avoiding similarities that might bring to mind any one team within the league.\n“We looked to the 1964 Tokyo Olympics type and poster work… I know this one well and spent a lot of time finding images of Super Bowl rings. Super Bowl rings for SB 10, 12, 16, 17, and 29 were my typographic favorites and they informed a lot of how I would adapt the skeleton. ” - Neil Summerour\nTo better accommodate an extremely robust graphics system for content and programming, Summerour worked with Dane Storrusten, Sr. Creative Director for NFL Media Brand and Graphics, to expand the Display family to include three separate widths. For Neil, it was about going beyond the brief and anticipating potential typographic situations.\n“All-Pro Display’s primary duty is to be the contemporary voice of our NFL digital media design language, a huge effort we undertook in 2018 to optimize content for OTT, mobile news feeds, social media–and ultimately unify the digital content and network brands. The original display typeface, we defined, was a major anchor for the design system and truly is the personality of our digital brand. Neil and I hinged on details for the new face, we wanted a design that had strength, flexibility and distinct, ownable characteristics without being too “sporty” or overly fashionable. There’s a finite, but clear line and Neil absolutely nailed it.” - Dane Storrusten, Sr. Creative Director, NFL Digital Content.\nDelivered in: 3 widths, 6 weights and matching italics."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"english_native_fluent"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:a70b527f-4099-4f4e-8d17-d548981f3c58>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Do both health reminders and telehealth platforms focus on HIPAA compliance?","answer":"Yes, both health reminders and telehealth platforms emphasize HIPAA compliance. Health reminder solutions consolidate outbound digital communication channels into one HIPAA-compliant platform, while telehealth platforms must adhere to HIPAA guidelines which require secure communication systems, protection of electronic protected health information (ePHI), and limiting access to only authorized users.","context":["When it comes to involving patients in their own healthcare journey, technology and data provide an extra level of value. Understanding how your patients are engaging with your organization, how they are relying on your services, and how to best communicate with them is paramount. Value-based organizations are being relied upon to help keep patients with chronic diseases compliant, keep pre-diabetic patients healthy and out of the hospital, and keep entire demographics flu-free during peak seasons. This develops value-based relationships between health systems and patients that are built on mutual trust and credibility.\nKey Elements of Patient Engagement:\nMany patient engagement strategies include 4 main pillars: retain, stratify, reform, and connect. These are all dependent on data - securely messaging patients via a HIPAA-compliant platform, stratifying them based on demographic or socio-economic data, providing educational content pre-procedure, and sending them test results and follow-ups in a timely manner.\n1. Streamline Healthcare Reminders & Engagement\nThanks to this continuous shift from volume to value, hospitals and physician practices are now tasked with providing 1:1 communication and reminders to their patients. Health Reminder solutions consolidate all outbound digital communication channels into one HIPAA-compliant platform for maximum reach and efficiency. Through automated emails, texts, and phone messages, outbound communication channels are seamlessly combined to decrease revenue leakage and increase patient responses. Health Reminders also impact internal responses such as rescheduling appointments, compliance monitoring, and proactive issue resolution.\nHealth Reminders provide healthcare leaders with a methodology to better understand patient populations. Teams can accurately stratify patients and track where individuals are at through their entire care journey with the help of key messaging components and integrated technology applications. Stakeholders can track email open rates, clicks, and unsubscribe rates to measure how patients are interacting and engaging with messages.\nThese messages can include medication alerts, appointment reminders, or pre-procedure updates. With campaign management solutions, emails, texts, and voice calls are all customized for individual patients, ensuring the highest level of value and care. The holistic patient profiles help stratify patients and enable organizations to engage in a timely manner.\nHealth Reminders also enable teams to communicate with large patient populations or individual patient audiences with minimal manual work, increasing response rates and employee efficiency.\n2. Increase Care Coordination Efforts\nWith the rise of quality-based patient care and the decline of reimbursement rates, healthcare providers are left wondering how to provide quality care for patients outside the four walls of a hospital. Care Coordination solutions help hospitals, health systems, and physician practices care for, engage with, and better serve large patient populations. This includes both understanding your patients and how to better interact with them and how your employees are spending their time for maximum efficiency. Tracking patient interactions, internal case resolution, and value-based reimbursements are the keys to successful Care Coordination.\nCare Coordination teams can create cases based on patient encounters, with next steps based on who else should be involved (nurses, wellness coaches, therapists, etc.). These cases leverage comprehensive patient profiles that seamlessly bubble up high-risk patients that need attention. The profiles integrate data from hospitals, home health solutions, as well as skilled nursing facilities for a holistic view of all outpatient activities.\n3. Optimize Bundled Payment Strategies\nToday, healthcare organizations and post acute care facilities are being tasked to decrease patient length of stay, effectively keeping patients healthier and out of care treatment facilities. This means tracking the overall cost per patient, per treatment, and per length of stay in a single platform. Holistic patient profiles house all types of patient information, from key contacts to length of stay. These profiles are accessible across departments - and even different locations - so all stakeholders are aware of critical changes, issues, and results. Any ‘red flags’ can be tracked and cataloged for accountable follow-up, ensuring patients are receiving value-based care 100% of the time.\nIntegrating these powerful patient profiles with various other data sources allows for the visualization of key quality, patient, and logistic metrics. Executives can view patient metrics at specific locations, by certain CPT codes, or even drill down view individual patient information to promote action and accountability at every care level. Users can then leverage these profiles to create reports for payors to showcase where value was optimized and where quality measures were met.\nLearn more about increasing revenue and value with our newest ebook, “5 Ways to Increase Revenue and Optimize Value in Your Health System\".","Telehealth has radically reshaped healthcare delivery. Advancements in technology, the shift to value-based and preventive care and promoting greater accessibility, safety and continuity of care continue to push its global proliferation.\nIn today’s healthcare industry, telehealth has become a must-have, enabling digital therapeutics, software as a medical device solutions, remote therapeutic monitoring, companion applications and much more.\nIn this guide, we answer telehealth fundamentals to help you best understand the technology, telehealth trends and how to leverage it to create breakthrough MedTech and digital healthcare solutions.\nYour telehealth questions answered\nDepending on how you look at it, telehealth itself has been around since the 1920s (ships used radios to get medical advice) or the late 1950s/early 60s (remote psychiatric consultations). Modern telehealth emerged in the last few decades and has quickly become a powerful alternative for greatly increasing healthcare accessibility.\nWhat is telehealth?\nTelehealth (also referred to as telemedicine) has a broad definition. In the US, it’s up to each state to define exactly what constitutes telehealth. The WHO defines telehealth as the “delivery of health care services, where patients and providers are separated by distance. Telehealth uses ICT [Information and Communications Technology] for the exchange of information for the diagnosis and treatment of diseases and injuries, research and evaluation, and for the continuing education of health professionals.”\nIn its broader interpretation, telehealth includes medical devices and procedures that patients use or perform at home. Thus, blood sugar testing kits, at-home blood pressure cuffs, Fitbits and other fitness wearables, portable heart monitors, and other fairly common devices are part of the telehealth ecosystem.\nTelehealth in healthcare: how is it used?\nTelehealth is modernizing healthcare in many ways, the first of which is increasing accessibility. The Rural Health Information Hub states that “Telehealth allows specialists and subspecialists to visit rural patients virtually, improving access as well as making a wider range of healthcare services available to rural communities via telemedicine, including radiology, psychiatry, ophthalmology, cardiology, oncology and obstetrics.”\nProviding virtualized healthcare to remote communities is one of the best-known telehealth applications. Additional use cases include:\n- Virtual minor urgent care. Virtual urgent care services allow qualified medical personnel to treat minor complaints, including providing appropriate prescriptions.\n- Post-hospital and post-surgical follow-ups. Care providers use texts, phone calls, and videoconferencing to stay in contact with patients after they are discharged from the hospital. This ensures patients understand and carry out recovery/treatment plans. Telehealth platforms automate much of the communication process, including sending reminders to patients. This can prevent misunderstandings related to healthcare instructions and result in better patient outcomes.\n- Online prescription renewal. Online prescription renewal and medication management save immense time for patients and providers.\nRemote patient monitoring – using sensors that track movement, wearable devices that monitor key health metrics, and videoconferencing to talk with the patient – is one of the most promising telemedicine applications. It has been associated with better patient outcomes, reducing ER visits and hospital readmissions, promoting better patient care, improved compliance with medical guidance, and ensuring better communication between care providers themselves.\nRemote patient monitoring is also becoming an important way to provide home care to people who need ongoing assistance. It allows family, non-medical caregivers, and the medical team to keep in contact, respond promptly (i.e. when a fall triggers a wearable device to send help), and better manage the patient’s care routine.\nWho benefits from telehealth?\nTelehealth solutions benefit all healthcare stakeholders: patients, caregivers, HCPs, administrators, systems and organizations.\nPatients. Few people enjoy going to the doctor’s office: waits are long, appointments often conflict with work or other activities, and travel time can be a pain. Whether it’s a case of white coat syndrome (anxiety-induced high blood pressure) or simple inconvenience, people often put off getting care. And this can take a toll on their health.\nTelehealth services, on the other hand, eliminate all of the travel and much of the anxiety around getting medical care. Virtual visits are more convenient, more comfortable, and may even be more affordable. Barriers to care are removed or lowered, and patients are more likely to report better quality of care.\nAnother way patients benefit from telehealth is access to a wider group of medical practitioners and specialists. Geographic limitations can be easily overcome via virtual appointments.\nCaregivers (healthcare providers and care teams). There’s a shortage of medical providers; as the population grows and ages, this shortage will become more critical. Telemedicine allows providers to adopt a more flexible work schedule and interact with more people in less time. It eliminates a lot of the geographic limitations that physicians face, giving them access to a wider audience. It can reduce practice overhead, and there’s some evidence linking telehealth to greater provider satisfaction.\nMedical office staff and administrators also benefit from telehealth. The platforms centralize information storage, making it easier to manage and share medical records. Also, telemedicine can act as an alternative revenue source, supplementing what in-person visits provide. There may also be fewer complaints about wait times.\nTelehealth regulatory compliance: is telehealth secure and HIPAA compliant?\nMuch of telehealth’s actual security depends on the physician or administrator’s choice of telehealth platform and communication method. The telehealth industry is evolving, and so are its security and privacy laws.\nOf course, telehealth platforms and solutions are required to have security measures. For example, the American Academy of Asthma and Immunology lays down these requirements:\n“Medical professionals who wish to comply with the HIPAA guidelines on telemedicine must adhere to rigorous standards for such communications to be deemed compliant.\nA medical professional or a healthcare organization creating ePHI [electronic protected health information] that is stored by a third party must have a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) with the party storing the data. The BAA must include methods used by the third party to ensure the protection of the data and provisions for regular auditing of the data’s security.”\nHIPAA’s own guidelines on telemedicine include:\n- “Only authorized users should have access to ePHI.\n- A system of secure communication should be implemented to protect the integrity of ePHI.\n- A system of monitoring communications containing ePHI should be implemented to prevent accidental or malicious breaches.”\nThe same source states that physicians are encouraged to use secure messaging instead of relying on emails, text messages, etc. And while video conferencing services like Zoom and Skype are permissible, open communication sources like Facebook Live and Twitch are not.\nWhat does it take to develop a secure telehealth platform?\nRead the top 6 essentials for secure telehealth platform development!\nDoes telehealth improve patient engagement?\nTelehealth services, while gaining traction, are still in the growth phase. Not everyone has had the chance to use it. But as the following stats show, there seems to be a generally positive response:\n- 77% want access to telehealth.\n- Interestingly, for Cleveland Clinic patients who have used telehealth services, this number rises to 98%.\n- 50% would be willing to switch from in-office visits to virtual visits.\n- 75% were satisfied with their virtual care experience.\nRemote monitoring is associated with several patient engagement improvements, including taking medication as directed and sticking with at-home care recommendations. So yes, there is a link between patient engagement and telehealth services.\nA key driver in patient engagement with telehealth appears to be its convenience: no more long drives and long waits for a 15-minute consultation with a specialist. Telemedicine also improves care and access, as already discussed; this naturally causes engagement to increase.\nHowever, some drawbacks need to be addressed. For example, older populations may struggle with telehealth technology. Overcoming this barrier depends on service design, building apps, online portals, websites and devices so they are easy to use. A well-considered digital product can reduce the frustration and resulting lack of engagement that some people experience when first using telemedicine.\nWhat are the most prevalent current and evolving telehealth trends?\nTelehealth will continue evolving across numerous modalities. Some of the fastest-growing applications include:\n- Virtual reality and augmented reality: As technology advances, virtual and augmented reality will become more prevalent in telehealth, allowing for more immersive and interactive virtual consultations and remote therapy sessions.\n- Artificial intelligence and machine learning: AI and machine learning will enable telehealth providers to analyze large amounts of patient data, make more accurate diagnoses, and assist with patient monitoring and treatment planning.\n- Remote monitoring: The use of wearables and other connected devices will enable patients to continuously monitor and share their vital signs and health data with healthcare providers, allowing for more proactive and personalized care.\n- Interoperability and standardization: As telehealth becomes more widely adopted, there will be an increasing need for interoperability and standardization to ensure seamless communication and data sharing between telehealth platforms and electronic health records.\n- Software as a Medical Device (SaMD): The rise of SaMD in telehealth allows for remote monitoring and diagnostic tools, such as companion apps, to collect and analyze patient data. This trend is expected to continue growing as it enables more convenient and efficient care and the ability to monitor patients with chronic conditions remotely. SaMD also empowers physicians to make more informed decisions and improve treatment outcomes.\nWhat are some key considerations for telehealth software development?\nDeveloping telehealth software can be very complex, which is why we recommend companies to partners who specialize in telehealth software development.\nYour partner will help you navigate the following challenges and find the best approach to match your goals:\n- Regulatory compliance: all software development must adhere to relevant telehealth regulations and guidelines for healthcare software, such as HIPAA and FDA guidelines for medical devices. Learn about Star regulatory consulting services.\n- User experience: The software should be intuitive and easy to use for both patients and providers to ensure its adoption and effectiveness in delivering care.\n- Security and data privacy: Telehealth software must have robust security measures in place to protect sensitive patient information and ensure compliance with data privacy regulations.\n- Business model: Creating an excellent telehealth solution is only part of the equation. You need to understand how to drive sustainable revenue from it by exploring different revenue, partnership and collaboration arrangements.\nWhat is the future of the telehealth industry?\nTelehealth’s future is very bright. With widespread telehealth adoption, the global market for remote care services was estimated at $83.5B in 2022 and is expected to reach $101.2B in 2023. Now that people have had a taste of telehealth, they’re quite willing to continue using this convenient care option.\nWe can also expect to see continued growth and improvements around devices, communication pathways, telemedicine services, and telehealth platforms. Look for them to become increasingly intuitive and user-friendly. As this happens, we can expect to see a related increase in users. After all, good design is a surefire way to improve engagement.\nWe’ll also see insurance companies and legislatures come to grips with telehealth. In the US, most major insurances cover some form of telehealth service, and all 50 states have regulations on the books regarding telemedicine. Expect the delineation and regulation to get progressively more detailed in the coming months and years.\nWhat does this mean for pharmaceutical companies, medical device manufacturers, providers, systems and the entire healthcare industry?
