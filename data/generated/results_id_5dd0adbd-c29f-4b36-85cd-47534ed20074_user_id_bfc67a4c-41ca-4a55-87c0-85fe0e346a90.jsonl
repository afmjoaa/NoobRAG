{"question":"Hi, I'm comparing two investment approaches for my savings. Could you please explain the key differences between simple and compound interest, particularly in terms of how they affect borrowers and lenders?","answer":"Simple interest and compound interest have several key differences. Simple interest is calculated only on the principal amount and remains uniform throughout the period, while compound interest is calculated on both the principal and accumulated interest from previous periods. This leads to compound interest generating higher returns compared to simple interest. From a practical perspective, simple interest benefits borrowers since they pay interest only on the initial principal, while compound interest benefits lenders since they earn interest on accumulated interest. For example, a $100,000 investment earning 5% would give you $50,000 in simple interest over 10 years, but $62,889.46 with annually compounded interest, or $66,015.21 with daily compounding, demonstrating how compound interest leads to substantially higher returns.","context":["A key component of successful investing is understanding the “magic” of compound interest. Of course, there’s nothing magical about it: just a mathematical compound interest formula that determines how much — and how quickly — your money will grow. Here’s everything you need to know about compound interest, as well as how to use a compound interest calculator to help you select the best investments to achieve your financial goals.\nHow Compound Interest Works\nMost people are familiar with the concept of earning interest on savings: a bank or other financial institution pays you at a specified rate for the privilege of accessing your money. What’s special about compound interest is that you don’t only earn money on your initial deposits or principal, but also on any interest you’ve already accumulated.\nIn other words, you earn interest on your interest, which can snowball over time. How quickly that snowball grows depends on the rate of interest and the compounding interval (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, semi-annually or annually).\nA good point of reference is the rule of 72, which tells you how many years it takes to double your investment when interest is compounded annually. Simply divide 72 by the interest rate to get the answer in years. So, for example, with an annual interest rate of 6%, it would take 12 years to double your investment.\nSimple Interest vs. Compound Interest\nUnlike compound interest, simple interest is calculated and paid on the principal investment and deposits only. The interest you earn is not automatically added to your principal amount, and so you do not achieve any of the benefits of compounding.\nIn our example above, you would earn a total of just $24,840 in simple interest at the end of the 10-year period, a substantial difference of $4,346 compared with annual compound interest earnings.\nTaking Advantage of Compound Interest\nThere are several ways to maximize the effects of compound interest:\n- Start investing early. The sooner you begin to earn money on your investments, the more time you will have to let those earnings compound and grow.\n- Invest for the long term. Holding on to your investments for as long as you can will also allow as much time as possible for the compounding effect.\n- Make regular contributions. Instead of waiting until the end of the year to invest, contribute throughout the year to start earning interest right away — and so those interest payments can begin compounding.\n- Think about your interest rate/rate of return. If you aren’t earning much in interest or if high management fees are cutting into your investments’ rate of return, you won’t enjoy the same benefits of compounding as you would with a higher rate.\nCompound Interest Formula\nIt’s easiest to use an online compound interest calculator, but if you’re a math whiz, you can calculate it yourself:\nA = P ( 1 + r / n ) ^nt\nA = value after t periods\nP = principal amount (initial investment)\nr = annual nominal interest rate (not reflecting the compounding)\nn = number of times the interest is compounded per year\nt = number of years the money is borrowed for\nThis is one way to figure out the results of the annual compound interest.\nCompound Interest Calculator\nRather than using pen and paper, you can use a compound interest calculator to help you find out how your investment will grow over time. Compound interest calculators allow you to input values for the initial investment, regular contributions, interest rate, compounding intervals and the number of years invested to see how various circumstances will affect your outcome.\nSay, for example, you were to make an initial deposit of $15,000 and then contribute $400 per month ($4,800 per year) at an annual interest rate of 6% compounded annually. Using a compound interest calculator, you would find that after 10 years your savings will have grown to $92,186.74, including $63,000 in deposits, and $29,186.74 in total interest income, as shown in the table below.\n|Interest compounded monthly at 6%|\nComparing Investments with a Compound Interest Calculator\nBy using a compound interest formula calculator, you can easily compare different investments based on the expected rate of interest, how frequently the returns are compounded, and your time horizon.\nHere’s an example:\n|Investment #1||Investment #2||Investment #3||Investment #4|\n|Annual interest rate||5%||5%||5%||6%|\n|Number of years to grow||35||35||40||35|\nIn each case, just one element varies from Investment #1, yet the final balance is different every time. Clearly, changing just one variable — such as the compounding interval, interest rate or the number of years an investment is held — will impact your final balance.\nUsing a compound interest calculator will help you evaluate which investment will give you the best returns.\nAnother way to take advantage of compound interest is to choose the most frequent compounding interval offered.\nInterest can be compounded annually, as shown in the table above, or on shorter intervals including semi-annually, quarterly, monthly, weekly. You can even use a daily compound interest formula. The shorter the interval, the larger the resulting balance.\nIf we revisit our example, here’s how the same investment ($15,000 initial deposit and $400 contributed monthly) would add up after 10 years, with the same annual interest rate of 6% but at different compounding intervals:\n|INTERVAL||COMPOUND INTEREST FORMULA||FINAL BALANCE||TOTAL |\n|Annually||Compounded once per year at 6%||$92,186.74||$29,186.74|\n|Semi-annually||Compounded every 6 months at 3%|\n(6% a year divided by 2)\n|Quarterly||Compounded every 3 months at 1.5%|\n(6% a year divided by 4)\n|Monthly||Compounded every month at 0.5%|\n(6% a year divided by 12)\n|Daily||Compounded each day at 0.0164%|\n(6% a year divided by 365)\nAs illustrated, when the compounding interval is shorter, you earn more interest and therefore end up with a larger balance, even when the total deposits ($63,000) and annual interest rate (6%) are the same.\nCompound interest can significantly boost investment returns over the long term, especially when dealing with larger sums. A $100,000 investment earning 5% simple interest, for example, would give you $50,000 in interest over 10 years; $62,889.46 over the same period when interest is compounded annually; or $66,015.21 when interest is compounded daily. Understanding how the compounding interval and rate of interest affect your returns will help you choose the right investments for your financial needs.","A significant part of a common man’s life in today’s world revolves around receiving or paying interest. Not only are businessmen greatly involved in this but also other people, for instance, who take loans from Banks or other Financial Institutions. So, interest refers to the cost of borrowing money.\nTo be able to determine what is in the best interest of any person receiving or paying any kind of interest, one needs to have a knowledge of the different types of interests that are there and how they are the different from each other.\nSimple vs Compound Interest\nThe difference between Simple and Compound Interest is that Simple Interest is simply calculated on the basis of the principal amount. In other words, Interest on the principal amount for the entire time period is called simple interest. Compound Interest, on the other hand, is calculated on the basis of the principal amount along with interest on the accumulated interest from periods.\nComparison Table Between Simple and Compound Interest (in Tabular Form)\n|Parameter of Comparison||Simple Interest||Compound Interest|\n|Definition||It is the interest paid on only the principal amount of a loan or an account.||It is the interest computed on the principal amount which includes all the accumulated interests of the previous period on a loan or an account.|\n|Change in Principal||The principal does not change in case of simple interest.||The principal undergoes a continuous change during the entire borrowing period.|\n|Base of calculating Interest||Interest is strictly calculated on the initial principal.||Interest is calculated on the initial principal for the first period and thereafter on a summation of the initial principal and accumulate interest.|\n|Growth||The growth remains uniform and steady.||The growth sees a substantial increase.|\n|Returns||The returns are constant and comparatively low.||The returns are dynamic and comparatively higher than simple interest.|\n|Formula||Amount=P*(1+RT), where P= Principal, R= Rate of Interest and T= Time Period||Amount=P*(1+R)^N, where P= Principal, R= Rate of Return, N= Number of Periods|\nWhat is Simple Interest?\nSimple interest is the interest that is charged in the form of a percentage of the initial principal amount, in case of a Loan, Fixed deposit, Savings Account, etc, for the whole period, generally taken to be broken up in one year each.\nSimple interest is the easiest and the fastest method to calculate the interest on a particular amount. It does not include interest calculated on previous accumulate interest and only has the initial principal as the basis.\nIt has better use while taking a loan as the borrower will only have to pay a fixed amount as interest, while it may not be able to create wealth, i.e., earn enough for savings or investments.\nIn other words, it is greatly beneficial for the borrower but the lender is at a loss as the borrower needs to pay less and therefore the lender earns less.\nIt is calculated by multiplying the Principal amount with the rate of interest and the time period and dividing the entire amount by 100.\nWhat is Compound Interest?\nCompound interest is interest calculated on the initial principal, including interest in the accumulated interests from previous time periods.\nThe rate of compound interest generated directly depends on the number of compounding periods. In other words, the higher the compounding period, the higher is the compound interest accrued.\nIt is a complicated method of calculating interest on a specific amount since it also takes into consideration the previously accrued interest in addition to the principal amount.\nIt has an opposite effect from that of simple interest in the sense that it is more beneficial for the lender than the borrower. This is because the borrower has to pay more interest due to the addition of interest on previously accumulated interests and hence the lender earns more.\nIt is calculated by multiplying the principal with one plus the rate of interest, raised to the power of the number of periods. Finally, the principal amount is deducted to figure out the interest for the specific period.\nMain Differences Between Simple and Compound Interest\nIt is believed that to understand the difference between technical-sounding terms like Simple Interest and Compound Interest is difficult and that it suits only the analysts and businessmen, however, that is not so. These differences are simple to configure and easier to understand by any person.\n- When the interest is charged on the initial principal amount for the entire term, it is known as Simple Interest, whereas, when this interest also includes the interest on the accumulated interests of previous periods, it comes to be known as Compound Interest.\n- Compound Interest gives a higher return as compared to the Simple Interest, precisely because of the inclusion of the previous periods’ profits.\n- The principal does not undergo any change in case of Simple Interest but the principal keeps on changing in the case of Compound Interest since it includes interest on interests of previous periods.\n- With respect to the calculation of Simple and Compound Interest, Simple interest is comparatively easy to calculate than its Compound counterpart.\n- Last, but not the least, both of them have opposite effects on the borrowers and the lenders. Borrowers are benefitted by Simple Interest whereas the lenders are benefitted by Compound Interest. Simple interest leads to a downfall in the earnings of the lenders. Compound Interest, on the other hand, increases their earning but also increases the burden on the borrowers.\nInterest is that significant part of our life which we will have to come across definitely at some point and thus, rather than running away from its complexities, it will be more beneficial to understand it in its simpler sense.\nUnderstanding the working and the differences between simple and compound interest and how and whom they benefit is not really very complicated, provided a sincere effort is made.\nTherefore, consider every investing or borrowing activity very carefully and understand and comprehend the benefits that will accrue to you with respect to the interest policy followed to make the best of everything.\nTable of Contents"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:1b1dd3a0-d4a5-4bd9-894a-39b4e4af6be4>","<urn:uuid:d4e8eb97-e9b1-4fab-8682-578aa9e64a35>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the best practices for cleaning duplicate data entries, and how does this relate to ensuring responsible AI development?","answer":"For cleaning duplicate data entries, Excel provides two key features: Conditional Formatting to identify duplicates and Remove Duplicates to delete them. The process involves using Conditional Formatting to highlight duplicates in red, reviewing them, and then using the Remove Duplicates feature from the Data Tools section to remove unwanted duplicates. This data cleaning is crucial because duplicate data points can lead to miscalculations and misunderstanding of the data. In terms of responsible AI development, ensuring clean and accurate data is essential as AI systems need to be transparent, explainable, and accountable for their decisions. Developers must ensure AI systems can provide clear explanations for their outcomes and be held accountable for any unintended harm or errors, while also implementing robust cybersecurity measures to protect against potential attacks and unauthorized access.","context":["Collecting, analyzing, and reporting with data can be daunting. The person that SAGE Publishing — the parent of MethodSpace — turns to when it has questions is Diana Aleman – editor extraordinaire for SAGE Stats and U.S. Political Stats. And now she is bringing her trials, tribulations, and expertise with data to you in a monthly blog, Tips with Diana. Stay tuned for Diana’s experiences, tips, and tricks with finding, analyzing and visualizing data. View Diana’s blog HERE.\nThere may be more than a few data points to double-check as you review and clean a data file. These can include blank values, outlier data points, data label misspellings, and so on. Duplicate data points are probably one of the most difficult to spot unless you’re lucky. Duplicates are exactly what they sound like: exact copies of the same data point. For instance, if I am looking at a data set on the number of hamsters across the United States and I see that Wisconsin has two data points, both of which are 50,000 (totally fabricated!), then I can infer that the data set has mistakenly included two duplicate values for Wisconsin.\nSo why does this matter? It matters because duplicate data points may inadvertently lead to miscalculation or misunderstanding of the data. The appearance of duplicates does not necessarily mean the entire data set is completely wrong – only that the data set may require a closer eye and some additional clean-up work as do most data sets. Thankfully, Excel offers two handy features that simplify the identification and removal of duplicate data points from a file!\nIt usually takes finding one set of duplicate data points for me to determine that Conditional Formatting should be applied to identify if any additional duplicates are present in a data file. The Conditional Formatting feature programmatically identifies duplicates in an entire data set. Without this feature I would be forced to manually check each data point. That may not be a big deal for a data set with about 50 rows of data, but it can be an incredibly inefficient process for a data set that contains, say, over 50,000 rows of data.\nUsing Conditional Formatting:\n- Select the entire data set. Actually, you don’t have to select the entire data set; you may want to identify duplicate values in a particular column or row. If you want to identify duplicates across the entire data set, then select the entire set.\n- Navigate to the Home tab and select the Conditional Formatting button.\n- In the Conditional Formatting menu, select Highlight Cells Rules.\n- In the menu that pops up, select Duplicate Values.\n- A window will appear detailing how Excel will highlight the duplicate values it identifies. The default setting is light red highlighting with red font, which works very well.\n- Voilà. All duplicate values should now be highlighted in red!\nAfter reviewing the highlighted duplicates, you can determine whether all the duplicates should be removed or not. To remove all duplicate values, you can use the Remove Duplicates feature to, well, remove the duplicates!\nUsing the Remove Duplicates feature:\n- Select the data set that contains duplicates.\n- Navigate to the Data tab in the tool bar.\n- In the Data Tools section of the Data tab, select Remove Duplicates.\n- One of two windows will appear:\n- If you selected the entire data set, then an option will appear asking you to specify which columns you wish to delete duplicates from; if you want duplicates removed from the entire data set, then leave all the columns selected.\n- If you selected a specific column, then a warning will appear to confirm that you want to limit removal to the column selected; if yes, then be sure to select “Continue with current selection”. If you decide to expand it to the entire data set, then choose “Expand the selection”.\nAll the duplicates should now be removed!","1. The Impact of AI in our Society\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has become an integral part of our daily lives. From voice assistants to autonomous vehicles, AI technology has the potential to transform various industries and enhance efficiency. However, as AI continues to advance, it is crucial to consider the ethical implications associated with its development and utilization.\nOne major concern is the potential bias embedded in AI algorithms. AI systems are often trained on large datasets that reflect the biases and prejudices present in society. This can lead to discrimination and unfair decision-making, as AI systems may inadvertently perpetuate existing social inequalities. It is essential for developers to address these biases and ensure that AI systems are designed to be inclusive and unbiased.\nAdditionally, the impact of AI on the job market cannot be overlooked. As AI technology automates certain tasks, there is a risk of job displacement for many individuals. It is crucial to prioritize re-education and training programs to equip workers with the skills needed for the future job market. Ethical considerations should be given to the potential social and economic disruptions caused by AI.\n2. Privacy and Data Protection\nThe development of AI relies heavily on data, often collected from individuals. As AI systems gather and analyze vast amounts of personal information, it raises concerns about privacy and data protection. Stricter regulations should be implemented to safeguard individuals’ data and ensure transparency in how it is collected, stored, and used.\nFurthermore, AI systems that process personal data may generate new insights and predictions about individuals. This raises concerns about the potential misuse of personal information and the potential for discrimination. It is crucial for developers to prioritize privacy by design, implementing measures such as data encryption and anonymization to protect individuals’ identities and prevent unauthorized access.\n3. Responsible AI Development\nResponsible AI development requires developers to consider the potential risks and unintended consequences of their creations. AI systems should be transparent, explainable, and accountable for their decisions. This means that developers must ensure that AI systems can provide clear explanations for their outcomes and that they can be held accountable in cases of unintended harm or errors.\nAnother important aspect of responsible AI development is ensuring the safety and security of AI systems. With the increasing integration of AI into critical infrastructure such as healthcare and transportation, any vulnerabilities in AI systems can have severe consequences. Developers must prioritize robust cybersecurity measures to protect against potential attacks and unauthorized access.\n4. Social Impact of AI\nAI technology has the potential to shape our society in profound ways. It is essential to consider the ethical implications of AI in areas such as surveillance, weaponization, and autonomous decision-making. The use of AI in surveillance raises concerns about privacy and civil liberties, with the potential for mass surveillance and constant monitoring. Development and deployment of AI-powered weapons raise questions about the ethics of autonomous killing.\nMoreover, the use of AI in decision-making processes, such as determining creditworthiness or criminal sentencing, raises concerns about transparency and fairness. It is crucial to ensure that AI systems do not contribute to bias or discrimination and that there is transparency in how decisions are made.\n5. Collaboration and Ethical Guidelines\nAddressing ethical considerations in AI development requires collaboration among various stakeholders, including policymakers, researchers, ethicists, and technologists. It is important to establish ethical guidelines and frameworks to guide the development and deployment of AI systems. These guidelines should address issues such as algorithmic bias, privacy, and accountability.\nFurthermore, collaboration between academia, industry, and government is crucial to ensure that AI development is aligned with societal values and needs. Ongoing dialogue and interdisciplinary research can help navigate the ethical challenges posed by AI and mitigate potential risks.

{"question":"Could someone explain how charitable giving fits into Ayyám-i-Há versus Kwanzaa celebrations? 🤔","answer":"Both celebrations incorporate aspects of community service and giving, but in different ways. During Ayyám-i-Há, Bahá'ís are specifically encouraged to engage in charity and goodwill, often participating in humanitarian projects. In Kwanzaa, while charitable giving isn't explicitly emphasized, the principle of Ujima (Collective Work and Responsibility) promotes building and maintaining the community together, and Ujamaa (Cooperative Economics) emphasizes working together for mutual benefit. Both celebrations focus on fostering unity and community wellbeing, though through different approaches.","context":["| Kitáb-i-Aqdas · Kitáb-i-Íqán |\nIndex of Bahá'í Articles|\nAyyám-i-Há refers to a period of four or five intercalary days in the Bahá'í calendar, where Bahá'ís celebrate the Festival of Ayyám-i-Há. The four or five days occur in between the 18th and 19th months of the calendar from February 26 to March 1 and allow for the Bahá'í calendar to be synchronized with the solar year with regular years of 365 days, and leap years of 366 days.\nThe Báb, the founder of the Bábí Faith, instituted the Badí‘ calendar in the Persian Bayán with 19 months of 19 days each and a period of intercalary days to allow for the calendar to be solar. The introduction of intercalation marked an important break from Islam, as under the Islamic calendar the practice of intercalation had been specifically prohibited in the Qur'an. The Báb did not, however, specify where the intercalary days should go. Bahá'u'lláh, who claimed to be the one foretold by the Báb, confirmed and adopted the Badi calendar in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, his book of laws. He placed the intercalary days before the fasting month of `Alá, the nineteenth and last month, and gave the intercalary days the name \"Ayyám-i-Há\" or \"Days of H\".\nSymbolism and celebration\nThe nineteen months of the Bahá'í calendar are named after the attributes of God. Ayyám-i-Há, which means the \"Days of Há\" — Há is the Arabic letter corresponding to the English H — commemorates the transcendence of God over his attributes since its name \"Ha\" has been used a symbol of the essence of God in the Bahá'í holy writings. Under the Arabic abjad system, the letter Há has the numerical value of five, which is equal to the maximum number of days in Ayyam-i-Há.\nDuring the Festival of Ayyám-i-Há Bahá'ís are encouraged to celebrate God and his oneness by showing love, fellowship and unity. In many instances Bahá'ís give and accept gifts to show forth the love, and it is sometimes seen as a \"Bahá'í Christmas\" held two months after the Christian holiday. It is also a time of charity and goodwill and Bahá'ís often participate in various projects of a humanitarian nature.\n- ↑ Esslemont, J.E. (1980). Bahá'u'lláh and the New Era (5th ed. ed.).

People light a kinara (candle holder with seven candles) and give each other gifts. It takes place from December 26 to January 1 every year. It was created by Maulana Karenga and was first celebrated in 1966 - 1967. Non-African Americans also celebrate Kwanzaa. The holiday greeting is \"Joyous Kwanzaa\".\nHistory and naming of the holiday[change | edit source]\nKwanzaa is a celebration that started in the black nationalist movement of the 1960s. It was created as a way to help African Americans reconnect with their African cultural and historical heritage.\nDuring the early years of Kwanzaa, Karenga said that it was meant to be an alternative to Christmas, that Jesus was psychotic, and that Christianity was a white religion that black people should shun. However, as Kwanzaa became more popular, Karenga changed his position so that practicing Christians could also feel included. He stated in the 1997 Kwanzaa: A Celebration of Family, Community, and Culture, \"Kwanzaa was not created to give people an alternative to their own religion or religious holiday.\"\nMany Christian African Americans who celebrate Kwanzaa do so in addition to observing Christmas.\nPrinciples and symbols[change | edit source]\nKwanzaa celebrates what its founder called the seven principles of Kwanzaa, or Nguzo Saba (originally Nguzu Saba—the seven principles of blackness). Karenga said that this \"is a communitarian African philosophy,\" . It consists of what Karenga called \"the best of African thought and practice in constant exchange with the world.\" These seven principles comprise Kawaida, a Swahili term for tradition and reason. Each of the seven days of Kwanzaa is dedicated to one of the following principles, as follows:\n- Umoja (Unity): To strive for and to maintain unity in the family, community, nation, and race.\n- Kujichagulia (Self-Determination): To define ourselves, name ourselves, create for ourselves, and speak for ourselves.\n- Ujima (Collective Work and Responsibility): To build and maintain our community together. To make our brothers' and sisters' problems our problems, and to solve them together.\n- Ujamaa (Cooperative Economics): To build and maintain our own stores, shops, and other businesses and to profit from them together.\n- Nia (Purpose): To make our collective goal the building and developing of our community. This in order to restore our people to their traditional greatness.\n- Kuumba (Creativity): To do always as much as we can, in the way we can. This so that we can leave our community more beautiful and better than we inherited it.\n- Imani (Faith): To believe with all our heart in our people, our parents, our teachers, our leaders, and the righteousness and victory of our struggle.\nKwanzaa symbols include a decorative mat on which other symbols are placed, corn and other crops, a candle holder with seven candles, called a kinara, a communal cup for pouring libations, gifts, a poster of the seven principles, and a black, red, and green flag. The symbols were designed to convey the seven principles.\nDuring Kwanzaa, families also decorate their households with objects of art. They use colorful African cloth such as kente, especially the wearing of kaftans by women. Fresh fruits that represent African idealism are also used. It is normal to include children in Kwanzaa ceremonies and to give respect and gratitude to ancestors. Libations are shared, generally with a common chalice (a shared cup), Kikombe cha Umoja, passed around to all people present. A Kwanzaa ceremony may include drumming and musical selections, libations, a reading of the African Pledge and the Principles of Blackness, reflection on the Pan-African colors, a discussion of the African principle of the day or a chapter in African history, a candle-lighting ritual, artistic performance, and, finally, a feast (Karamu). The greeting for each day of Kwanzaa is Habari Gani? which is Swahili for \"What's the News?\"\nCultural exhibitions include the Spirit of Kwanzaa, an annual celebration held at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts featuring interpretive dance, African dance, song and poetry.\nRelated pages[change | edit source]\n- The Black Candle (2009) – a documentary film about Kwanzaa, narrated by Maya Angelou\n- Dashiki – A shirt or suit worn during Kwanzaa celebrations\n- Kaftan (boubou) – A dress worn by women during Kwanzaa celebrations\n- Kufi – A cap worn during Kwanzaa celebrations\nFurther reading[change | edit source]\n- A program to raise the faith level in African-American children through Scripture, Kwanzaa principles, and culture, Janette Elizabeth Chandler Kotey, DMin, Oral Roberts University,1999\n- The US Organization: African American cultural nationalism in the era of Black Power, 1965 to the 1970s, Scot D.

{"question":"Could you please compare how Farm Sanctuary and Heermance Farm help restaurants, such as their approaches to animal and vegetable products?","answer":"Heermance Farm and Farm Sanctuary take opposite approaches to supporting restaurants. Heermance Farm actively supplies NYC restaurants like Daniel Restaurant and Le Pavillon with specialty vegetables, including exotic crops like galangal and Thai ginger, focusing on cultivating high-quality produce year-round in their greenhouses. In contrast, Farm Sanctuary works to discourage the use of animal products in restaurants by advocating against factory farming and promoting plant-based food choices. While Heermance Farm collaborates with chefs to grow innovative produce, Farm Sanctuary rescues farm animals and advocates for consumers to make more conscientious food choices that don't involve animal products.","context":["In the Hudson River Valley, there lives a farm loved by New York City chefs, growing produce not typically considered local. Heermance Farm cultivates crops like galangal, Thai ginger, Tulsi basil and salsify, working with chefs to continually add new produce to their repertoire.\n“Because we grow for chefs, we’re able to sort of be daring, and together we wanted to challenge ourselves to discover what was being overlooked,” says Farm Manager Kevin Ferry. “We’re very good at coloring outside of the lines, so we invite chef collaborators to the canvas. Every year or season these chefs are defining new trends in culinary expression, and we are always willing to explore.”\nEdible Manhattan caught up with Ferry to discuss what’s they’re currently cultivating, hydroponic farming and where you can try Heermance’s produce in NYC.\nWhat specialty vegetables are you growing right now?\nRight now, our greenhouses are full of specialty crops, from Malabar spinach and galangal to turmeric and lemongrass. But I’m really excited this year about a new set of epicurean rarities we’re growing that fell out of standard growing practices over many generations—crops like crosnes (pronounced croans), skirret and salsify, which were once medieval staples or even traveled on the old exploring trade routes from east Asia and adopted into French country gardens. We’re planning to save those seeds and propagate them, too.\nWe’re on the heels of the warmer summer months, so while we’re distributing the last of our winter storage crops, we’re seeding constantly. We’re really looking forward to seeing the results of this one squash trial seed we ordered from Dan Barber’s seed company Row 7. His seeds have been a real pleasure to grow because, as a chef, he’s looking for a squash that can be consumed at different stages of its growth, prepared with skin on, etc.\nHas Heermance always supplied produce to NYC restaurants? Did you notice more demand when you began offering specialty produce?\nIt’s sort of the other way around; we’ve always considered the specialty crops to be our main focus. The nice thing is that chefs are shopping for their staples, too, so they might come to Heermance for edible flowers or shiso, but they also wind up wanting our fingerling potatoes and other essentials.\nWhat are the top veggies Heermance sells to NYC chefs?\nIt depends on the time of year. Heirloom tomatoes are the queens of summer. But in the spring, everyone loves carrots‑little, tender baby carrots are vibrant and versatile. Also, broccoli and an array of Asian cabbages and greens. We actually grow all year long in our greenhouses, so in February, chefs want anything green because it’s hard to come by anything green locally in this region during those frigid weeks. This past winter the demand for fresh baby lettuce heads was higher than we’ve ever seen.\nIn terms of flavor or the quality of restaurant dishes, how does buying specialty vegetables locally impact dishes versus getting that produce imported from their countries of origin?\nThere’s no comparison. All it takes is one bite into a flavorless, watery beefsteak tomato that lost half its vitamins traveling across the country to know the value in ripe, local produce. Of course, there are things chefs can do to improve the taste, like roasting tomatoes to bring out the sugar, but it’s not the same.\nI would say the difference starts with the smell and then the feel. When you walk into our greenhouses and really take a full deep breath and pick fresh, aromatic Tulsi basil in March, it’s like seeing in color for the first time, like that scene in the Wizard of Oz. It’s like entering paradise, and we’re able to send part of that special place to our restaurants. I love it.\nHow many pounds of veggies do you guys sell to NYC chefs on a weekly basis?\nThat changes per season. In the winter, we’re selling a lot of kale, winter squash, heirloom potatoes, bok choy, lettuce and things that are just lighter. Most of our produce are in fresh pick units like pieces, cases or bunches or even edible flowers and microgreens in small boxes.\nWhat about the Hudson River Valley is good for growing these exotic vegetables?\nGrowing vegetables in general is something that the beautifully rich soils of the Hudson River Valley accommodate so well. But when I think of exotic vegetables, I think of ones that are grown in warmer climates. We’re USDA Zone 5b, and that’s only going to get warmer, but our outdoor growing season isn’t long enough to support something like a field of artichokes (although we do grow a few every year). So we grow our “exotic” vegetables in our greenhouses all year long, but our fields are always full of heirloom vegetables during the warmer months.\nHeermance Farm practices hydroponic farming. What does that mean, and what effect does it have on your produce?\nOne of our greenhouses is hydroponic, and a lot of people have this idea that hydroponics occurs in a sci-fi lab, but it’s actually a very natural environment full of life, the roots just don’t touch soil. We blend nutritious tea out of compost where our wriggler worms are thriving, we’ve used seaweed and molasses, which are rich in trace minerals and macro nutrients, respectively. We take hydroponics at its literal Greek translation which is “working water.” Based on the cultivar, we add a specific mixture of fertilizer nutrients.\nRight now, we’re harvesting hydroponic zucchini, broccoli, Romanesco, bok choy and lots of other things. We’re able to control the levels of nutrition the plants are receiving, so instead of undergoing a rainy period in the field where the plant is taking up a lot of water and not necessarily a ton of nutrients because they’re being lost in the runoff, we’re able to maintain a steady supply of nutrition that creates a more consistently nourished, and therefore more flavorful, vegetable.\nIn what restaurants in NYC can our readers taste your produce?\nWe’ve been really lucky to have developed a nice relationship with Daniel Boulud’s Dinex Restaurant Group, so you can find our produce at Daniel Restaurant, as well as Le Pavillon near Grand Central Station. We recently started selling to the Russian Tea Room, which is such an iconic place. We also sell frequently to Gotham on 12th Street and Frevo in Greenwich Village.\nFeature photo courtesy of Heermance Farms.","Gene Baur to discuss factory farming, animal welfare and revolutionizing the food industry\nGene Baur has devoted his life to helping animals, but in the beginning he was just a kid who loved his cat, Tiger.\nIt took Baur little more than a decade to realize that truly loving animals meant not looking at them as mere resources for human consumption.\nBaur turned his conviction into action in 1986 when he founded Farm Sanctuary, the nation’s leading farm animal rescue and protection organization. Farm Sanctuary has saved thousands of animals, which are cared for on one of Farm Sanctuary’s three farms in Watkins Glen, NY, Northern California (Orland); and the Los Angeles area.\nBaur’s message of animals as friends not food is well-respected across the world. Time Magazine called him “the conscience of the food movement,” and he has testified in front of local, state and federal legislative bodies on behalf of animal welfare and to expose factory farming cruelties.\nBaur will bring his plight to Greenville Tuesday during an appearance at Furman University’s Trone Student Center, but first he took a moment to answer some questions by e-mail for The News.\nQ Tell me about the first animal you rescued. Where was it, how did you become aware of the animal? How did you do the rescue?\nA Hilda was the first farm animal I rescued. I was visiting farms, stockyards and slaughterhouses to document conditions and came across a pile of dead animals, covered in maggots, behind Lancaster Stockyards in Pennsylvania. As I approached the carcasses, I noticed one of the sheep lift her head. Shockingly, she was alive. I took her off the dead pile and brought her to a veterinarian thinking she’d have to be euthanized. But, she started perking up, and recovered. We named her Hilda and she lived with us at Farm Sanctuary for more than 10 years.\nQ Looking around you at the state of animal welfare and our food system, do you feel hopeful or sad most days?\nI feel both emotions acutely, and I make a conscious effort to focus on hope and positive developments. I believe doing so helps to build positive momentum. Awareness is increasing about problems with our factory farming system, and change is underway.\nQ What keeps you positive in the face of more incidents of factory farming, issues with our food system and safety and health issues related to our farming?\nA I am inspired when I visit Farm Sanctuary and to see farm animals who have been rescued from cruelty, and I’m also encouraged when I meet people whose lives and health have improved after switching to a plant based diet. There are so many good things happening, and I’m able to deal with the horrors of factory farming by thinking about and dwelling in the positive.\nQ Is there a balance you see that could be achieved between consuming meat and animal welfare?\nA I don’t believe the words “humane” and “slaughter” fit well together. Most animals raised for food suffer in miserable conditions, and while a very small number may be treated less badly, animals exploited for meat, milk and eggs are seen primarily as saleable commodities, and their welfare is not a high priority.\nQ What sort of legislation would you like to see passed on the state or national level next? Is there one issue you're particularly focused on right now?\nA I support state and federal legislation that prohibits the most extreme systems used to confine farm animals (eg. veal crates, gestation crates, battery cages), along with other efforts to make a bad system less bad.\nHowever, I believe the most significant changes will occur in the marketplace as better informed consumers make more conscientious food choices, which are aligned with their values and interests. When consumers stop buying food that is produced in a way that is an affront to their humanity, and when they start buying healthy plant foods instead of processed and factory farmed animals foods that make them sick, we’ll see a revolution in our food system.\nQ Can you offer one piece of advice for meat eaters, vegetarians and vegans alike about being responsible consumers?\nA It’s important to recognize that our food choices have profound impacts on our health, as well as on the well-being of other animals and the environment. We should understand the consequences of our food choices, and then act in a way that is aligned with our values and interests.\nRather than looking the other way and saying “I don’t want to know” when the issue of factory farming comes up, consumers should think about what they are buying and make food choices that they feel good about. We should eat food that nourishes our bodies, and we should support an agriculture system that doesn’t squander scarce resources and destroy our environment.\nWhat Gene Baur, president of Farm Sanctuary\nWhen 7 - 8 p.m.\nWhere Watkins Room at Furman University’s Trone Student Center\nFor more information visit www.farmsancturay.org"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:0aa6fae2-8315-4344-88a2-77de9e8bccb7>","<urn:uuid:b2818297-f8b2-4f8c-b3e8-d439ba87866c>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Hello, how to calculate total import costs when shopping from USA to Canada?","answer":"To calculate total import costs, you need to account for several components: 1) Shipping charges based on weight, size, distance, and quantity 2) Customs duties (though most items manufactured in US/Mexico are duty-free under NAFTA) 3) 5% GST calculated after duties 4) Provincial sales tax which varies by province 5) Customs broker fees (Canada Post charges $9.95 per package, while other couriers like FedEx/UPS may charge higher).

However, many sites will apply a flat rate shipping fee to Canada, so it's best to check the site's international shipping policies before placing your order.\nDon't forget to factor in exchange rates on shipping fees and remember, shipping costs aren't the total costs you'll need to pay to get your package across the border. Be prepared to pay for Canadian customs duties, taxes and customs brokers fees.\nCanada Customs DutiesThanks to NAFTA, Canadians do not pay duty on most items manufactured in America or Mexico. However, buying an item from a US site does not mean it was manufactured there. Keep in mind, that items may have been imported into the US, which means you will need to pay duty when it comes to Canada.\nThe duty you pay on goods will depend on the type of product, what it's made of and where it was made. So what should you expect to pay? Use this handy duty calculator, - it will give you an idea of what to expect, though please note that it won't be accurate to the penny!\nCanadian TaxesThe majority of everything you import into Canada is subject to 5% GST. This will be calculated after custom duties have been applied.\nAdditionally, you will also need to pay your provincial sales tax, which varies depending on the province in which you reside. For those who live in provinces with a Harmonized Sales Tax, you will be charged HST rather than GST and your provincial sales tax.\n|PROVINCE||TAX TYPE||PROVINCIAL TAX (%)||TOTAL TAX (%)|\n|Manitoba||GST + PST||8||13|\n|Newfoundland and Labrador||HST||8||13|\n|Prince Edward Island||GST + PST||10.5 effective, 10 nominal||15.5 effective, 15 nominal|\n|Quebec||GST + HST||9.975||14.975|\n|Saskatchewan||GST + HST||5||10|\nCustoms Brokers FeesCustoms brokers fees can catch you off guard, so be prepared. Couriers and shipping services like FedEx and UPS use customs brokers to send packages through Canadian customs at the border. These fees then get passed along to you.\nCanada Post will generally charge a $9.95 handling fee per package that has been assessed with import duties and taxes. If the item you purchased is duty-free or tax exempt, this fee will likely be waived.\nBrokers fees for courier companies such as Purolator or DHL tend to be much higher than what Canada Post charges. These companies can add it on top of the cost for the courier service you selected. When selecting shipping to Canada, always check whether the customs brokers fees are included. If it not listed, you can call the site's member service line or you can always check the courier company's site.\nPotential Additional CostsShould you need to return your purchase, you may incur return fees.

{"question":"What were the different sizes of club topsail equipment used on the Reliance?","answer":"The Reliance had three sizes of club topsail sails with corresponding equipment: three club topsail yards measuring 68 feet, 58 feet, and 48 feet long, and three club topsail clubs measuring 57 feet 6 inches, 50 feet, and 41 feet 6 inches long.","context":["Several bloggers have asked (off-line) for more structure to our posting of pictures, which also coincides with our project documentation requirement. So, I thought I would organize the discussion by spar. We can offer our observations about the engineering of the RELIANCE from the novice standpoint, but I’ll leave the real insight to engineer bloggers amongst our group.\nThere were three sizes of club topsail sails in addition to a gaff topsail. To support the sail there were three club topsail yards (68’, 58’ and 48’ long) and at three club topsail clubs (57’6”, 50’ and 41’6” long). We started with fabrication of the club on our spar bench.\nThis bench has two sides: one for layout of the pieces and one for glue-up and varnishing. The bench is long enough to layout our longest spar – the boom (112’ long). On the glue-up side we added and shimmed a perfectly flat board so that we can space out temporary “keel-blocks” on station marks to get the correct taper for each spar.\nWe are attempting to fabricate prototypically correct spars with the same types of wood, scale dimensions for length, width, and depth, hollow where appropriate, the same number of internal bulkheads, and etc.\n#1 Club Topsail Club:\nThis is a hollow spar, tapered at both ends and rectangular in cross section as shown in the sketch below. Hollow spars offer strength and flexibility at minimum weight; attributes important to Capt. Nat and ourselves.\n– The scale spars lengths and centerlines were laid out on our layout table, stations marked along the length at perpendicular angles and distances measured off the stations (stations being points where the widths are measured in the drawings) on each side of the centerline to get the proper widths. Long battens were then used to fair the curves for the tapers. When satisfied with these drawings, the measures were transferred to our 4 rough-cut pieces (cut slightly longer and wider than required, but to correct thickness).\n– We were then able cut out and shape perfectly book-matched sides and top/ bottoms.\n– Since the sides were the “outside” dimensions, a side was laid on the keel-blocks. The walls are so thin, it fell into shape on the blocks and no clamping was required.\n– Rectangular blocks were temporarily glued to the sides to create 90 degree angles for gluing the top to the side. The top was then clamped in place.\n– While drying, bulkheads were glued in place at designated bulkhead points , which in many places differ from the stations\n– After the glue for bulkheads and top had dried the temporary blocks were removed and the bottom glued in-place\n– Liner and scotchmen were glued and fastened in position, and then the last side was glued in-place.\n– Final sanding was accomplished with a long-board to remove any imperfections, and then the spar was sealed with shellac and multiple coats of varnish.\nWhen adding the liners and scotchmen we noted that the “as-raced” configuration differed from “as-designed.” Photos of RELIANCE during the America’s Cup races show a third liner and presumably a scotchman. This is further confirmed in the sail plan drawings. Since we are trying to build our RELIANCE in the “as-raced” configuration we elected to add the third position."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:ac3b248c-339f-4e87-9c1c-75d520362260>"],"error":null}

This includes many data acquisition devices such as plug-in boards or serial communication systems which use a computer as a real time data recording system. Most instrument manufacturers, however, consider a datalogger a stand alone device that can read various types of electrical signals and store the data in internal memory for later download to a computer.\nThe advantage of data loggers is that they can operate independently of a computer, unlike many other types of data acquisition devices. Data loggers are available in various shapes and sizes...\nTemperature can be measured via a diverse array of sensors. All of them infer temperature by sensing some change in a physical characteristic. Six types with which the engineer is likely to come into contact are: thermocouples, resistive temperature devices (RTDs and thermistors), infrared radiators, bimetallic devices, liquid expansion devices, and change-of-state devices.\nChoose the right temperature measurement instrument for your application...\n* Fields marked with an asterisk are required","Technology is exciting. We’re more connected than ever before, and things we thought impossible not long ago have become part of everyday reality.\nBut with all that Internet of Things (IoT) excitement also comes potential risk.\nBelow, we’ll take a look at IoT security and how you can protect your devices and yourself.\nWhat are IoT devices?\nIoT devices are any item that has the ability to connect to and share data with a network or another item. It might sound high-tech, but you likely have more than one IoT device in sight right now. You’re probably even using an IoT device to read this content (unless you’ve printed this on paper). According to some estimates, there are nearly 27 billion IoT devices in the world.\nWhat are some examples of IoT devices? Smartphones, computers, tablets, smart thermostats, connected irrigation, smart cars, video cameras, drones, jet engines, connected light bulbs … the list goes on and on.\nCan there be IoT security issues?\nBecause IoT devices connect with others and transmit data back and forth, this also makes them prone to potential digital security threats.\nPotential IoT security threats\nWondering why IoT security is important? Take a look at potential risks to get an idea:\n- Outbound spam – Ever get a weird Facebook message or email, seemingly from someone you know? It could be spam. Unprotected devices make you prone to spam “takeovers,” which send out messages on your behalf. Back in 2014, for example, a connected refrigerator was hacked and started sending spam via email.\n- Botnets – An IoT botnet is a network of devices that have been hacked and connected to one another. Hackers do this to share data between devices without the owners knowing. They administer distributed-denial-of-server (DDoS) attacks, which is what hackers do to attack and take out servers. A 21-year-old from Washington, along with two co-conspirators, created the notorious Satori botnet which launched several DDoS attacks throughout 2017 and 2018.\n- Data leaks – With so much data being shared, this opens the possibility of that information being compromised. This includes passwords, personal information and even your physical location. (Luckily, there ways you can protect your online identity from these types of threats.)\n- Home “intrusions” – According to one report, more than 40% of homes have at least one device that’s vulnerable to hackers. If hackers get into one device, they can access every other device sharing the same network. This gives them access to information you’d want to keep private, like your IP address, which can reveal your physical address. They can also spy on your internet activity, getting potential access to credit card and other sensitive information.\n- Vehicle takeover – Connected cars are more prone to auto theft. Hackers can control your car, see your driving habits and monitor your internet activity. Two hackers, for example, developed a way to hack into a connected Jeep and virtually drive it off the road.\nBeyond hackers, companies that make IoT devices can also sneak in user permissions and agreements to sharing data with marketers and advertisers. While this might not technically be an IoT security risk, it can be considered a breach of privacy. Not to mention creepy!\nSo, how secure are IoT devices?\nIt really depends, both on the device and how you use it.\nAre there some IoT security tips?\nLuckily, there are IoT security measures you can take to beef up your protection:\n- Use strong passwords – “123456” is the most common password in the world. If you use that, you’re an easy target for any individual. It is your first line of defense, after all. Create strong, unique passwords, with a combination of letters, numbers and special characters (when allowed), to mitigate your vulnerability.\n- Install security software – Security apps and software programs can protect your devices from harmful malware, ransomware, viruses and other online threats.\n- Set your privacy and data preferences – Many devices have their own unique IoT security settings you can adjust to make sure you’re protecting yourself. Only share the data that seems necessary, and deny overreaching permissions.\n- Change your IP address – You can browse via a virtual private network (VPN) which will disguise your device location by changing your IP address. Instead of browsing on a vulnerable public network, this makes it more difficult for hackers to know where you are and access your tech.\n- Mind your devices – It may seem silly and minor, but something as simple as leaving your phone unattended at the pool or coffee bar can be a risk. It makes you susceptible to curious minds around you — potentially with bad intentions."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"format_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:328f2bc1-11f6-4790-ad91-91224fbd9430>","<urn:uuid:85210e56-60b9-4b21-9fbe-bc100fa66b91>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I need insights on spotting discrimination. What are the key warning signs when comparing algorithmic bias versus medical cognitive errors?","answer":"The key warning signs differ for each type. Algorithmic bias often becomes visible through parallel cases showing systematic discrimination, as demonstrated in the Apple Card incident where women consistently received lower credit limits than men with similar or worse credit scores. Medical cognitive errors typically manifest through misdiagnosis patterns, particularly when clinicians rely on Type 1 quick thinking rather than Type 2 analytical reasoning - for example, wrongly assuming a patient is intoxicated when they actually have a stroke, due to availability bias from recent similar cases. While algorithmic bias can be harder to detect without comparative cases, cognitive errors in medicine can be identified through metacognition and reflective practice, though both types of bias require active monitoring and corrective policies.","context":["A key promise of algorithms, supported by artificial intelligence, is that they take some of the guessing and subjectivity out of decision making. They apply the same rules every time, without emotion, so the outcomes they produce arguably should be fairer, more accurate, or more relevant. But those claims ignore a basic foundation for even the highest tech applications available today: The algorithms are still being written by humans, whose inherent, unconscious biases influence every line of code they write.\nIn this sense, algorithms themselves appear inherently biased, but identifying, confirming, and addressing this bias is particularly difficult. A recently reported example makes that difficulty clear: A married couple, with the same shared household assets and debts, each applied for an Apple Card when the new product was introduced. Although the wife had earned a higher credit rating over time, the credit limit she was offered, according to the algorithm that the bank used to generate its decision, was more than 20 times less than the limit granted her husband, with his somewhat lower credit score. According to their accounts of the situation on Twitter, calls to Apple and to Goldman Sachs, the bank that underwrites the credit accounts, resulted in customer service representatives who repeatedly claimed that because the algorithm assigned the credit limit, there was nothing they could do.\nAfter the social media account went viral, an Apple spokesperson released an assurance that credit decisions were not based on gender, race, or other such categorizations—which would be illegal. But government agencies also have announced that they are investigating the matter. In addition, other consumers shared their similar experiences, including even Steve Wozniak, one of the original founders of Apple, who received a 10 times higher credit limit than his wife.\nThese incidents may seem comparatively minor; it is not as if the applicants were refused credit, nor were these wealthy consumers at risk of suffering lasting damage to their buying capabilities or creditworthiness. But their shared experiences offer evidence that biases are widespread and therefore influencing a range of marketing offers. Even if the discrimination created by the algorithmic biases is unintentional, its can mean that certain segments of consumers are prevented from accessing appealing purchasing and employment options. If for example an algorithm determines that it should not show real estate ads to a potential buyer, due to that person’s individual characteristics, it represents a form of discrimination that is both unethical and contrary to societal norms.\nFurthermore, if they are not married to someone receiving a parallel offer at the same time, consumers are unlikely to know if they are victims of such bias. Although it may be impossible to eliminate all such biases, the goal needs to be to recognize its existence, have policies in place to minimize and remediate it, and continue seeking solutions to reduce its effects overall.\n- Why did the women in these examples receive lower credit limits, despite their excellent credit ratings? That is, what kind of bias is at play, and why does it exist?\n- Are biases ever acceptable, such as when targeting different customers using different prices for the same product, in an attempt to segment the market?\nSource: Neil Vigdor, “Apple Card Investigated After Gender Discrimination Claims,” The New York Times, November 11, 2019; Jaime Condliffe, “The Week in Tech: Algorithmic Bias Is Bad. Uncovering It Is Good,” The New York Times, November 15, 2019","If Only Thinking Made It So\nCognitive errors challenge clinicians and technologists alike. Being aware of the types of mistakes that can occur is the first step toward fixing them.\nBy John Halamka, M.D., president, Mayo Clinic Platform, and Paul Cerrato, senior research analyst and communications specialist, Mayo Clinic Platform\n“One of the great challenges in life is knowing enough to think you’re right, but not enough to know you’re wrong.” When the astronomer Neil deGrasse Tyson penned those words, he probably wasn’t thinking about the cognitive errors that sometimes affect health care workers. But they certainly apply: Imagine working in hospital emergency seeing several patients walk in disheveled, with slurred speech and difficulty walking a straight line. Alcohol intoxication is one of the first things that would come to mind, which is often confirmed by a blood test. So naturally, when your next patient presents with slurred speech and rumbled clothing, your mind immediately turns to your last intoxicated case. And if you’re already overwhelmed with a room full of patients with more urgent needs, it’s easy to put this patient into the same “bucket” when in fact a more thorough evaluation might reveal a stroke, which can also present with slurred speech and altered gait.\nThat common mistake, called availability bias, is one of many cognitive errors that occasionally we all fall victim to. Nicola Cooper, a professor at University of Nottingham School of Medicine, explains: “Availability bias is when things are at the forefront of your mind because you have seen several cases recently or have been studying the condition in particular.” Unfortunately, it is only one of several reasoning mistakes clinicians and technologists are prone to. Cooper also includes overconfidence bias in her list of cognitive errors, which brings to mind Tyson’ comment about knowing enough to think you’re right, but not enough to know you’re wrong. It emphasizes the need to avoid relying too heavily on our past experience and opinions but instead concentrate on gathering all the available evidence before reaching a tentative diagnosis. Collecting all the relevant evidence can be time consuming, which is one reason clinicians rely on heuristics, disease scripts, and a variety of shortcuts to reach a conclusion when pressed for time.\nDuring the diagnostic process, clinicians are inclined to fast Type 1 thinking. As we explain in Reinventing Clinical Decision Support,Type 1 thinking is used by most experienced clinicians because it’s an essential part of the pattern recognition process. This intuitive mode employs heuristics and inductive shortcuts to help them arrive at quick conclusions about what’s causing a patient’s collection of signs and symptoms. It serves them very well when the pattern is consistent with a common disease entity. Recognizing the typical signs and symptoms of an acute myocardial infarction, for example, allows clinicians to quickly take action to address the underlying pathology. There are hundreds of such disease scripts that physicians and nurses have committed to memory and that immediately come to mind in a busy clinical setting.\nOf course, this intuitive approach can be affected by a clinician’s impressions of a patient’s demeanor, how the patient appeared in the past, the clinician’s biases toward “troublesome” patient types, as well as distractions in the work environment. Pat Croskerry, M.D., Ph.D., professor, Department of Emergency Medicine, Faculty of Medicine and Division of Medical Education, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, points out: “The system is fast, frugal, requires little effort, and frequently gets the right answer. But occasionally it fails, sometimes catastrophically. Predictably, it misses the patient who presents atypically, or when the pattern is mistaken for something else.”\nType 2 reasoning, on the other hand, is particularly effective in scenarios in which the patient’s presentation follows no obvious disease script, when patients present with an atypical pattern, and when there is no unique pathognomonic signpost to clinch the diagnosis. It usually starts with a hypothesis that is then subjected to analysis with the help of critical thinking, logic, multiple branching, and evidence-based decision trees and rules. This analytic approach also requires an introspective mindset that is sometimes referred to as metacognition, or “ability to step back and reflect on what is going on in a clinical situation.”\nThis skill set also lets clinicians run through a list of common cognitive errors that can easily send them in the wrong direction. But because Type 2 reasoning is a much slower process, it is often a challenge to implement, especially in high-stress, high-volume settings. For the slow reflective Type 2 mode to be most effective, it requires a well-rested clinician who is not being distracted, does not have an unreasonable heavy workload, and has had adequate sleep to fully use his or her analytical skills and memory. Too few work environments satisfy these prerequisites.\nTechnologists are likewise prone to cognitive errors and biases. In a recent paper we published in BMJ Health and Care Informatics, for instance, we discuss the problem of algorithmic bias. The bias can occur when training an algorithm on faulty data set, which sometimes discriminate against Black patients, women, and those in lower socioeconomics groups. An algorithm used to help diagnose myocardial infarction that is derived from the experience of male physicians who routinely ignore the atypical signs and symptoms that can develop in female MI patients is not going to be a very useful tool.\nSimilarly, developers need to be aware of the risk of data shift, another common problem that can distort an algorithm’s usefulness. In plain English, data shift is what happens when the data collected during the development of an algorithm changes over time and is different from the data when the algorithm is eventually implemented. For example, the patient demographics used to create a model may no longer represent the patient population when the algorithm is put into clinical use.\nWhile the list of cognitive errors is long, understanding how they can occur and having the humility to recognize them improves patient care—and separates the novice from the expert.\nBy John Halamka and Paul Cerrato — Shared decision-making doesn't mean encouraging patients to take the path of least resistance. Prescribing lifestyle changes may not put a smile on their faces, but the long-term benefits often outweigh the risks of lifelong dependence on prescription medication.\nBy John Halamka and Paul Cerrato — New digital tools are a two-edged sword that come with a unique set of benefits and risks. We need a regulatory framework to manage them responsibly.\nBy John Halamka and Paul Cerrato — With over 10,000 mental health apps available, it’s difficult to know which ones will actually have a therapeutic impact. Fortunately, enough high-quality evidence is available to help clinicians and patients make an informed choice."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:f0c30a84-8f4e-4081-a807-67db4f9f2a99>","<urn:uuid:947c06d5-732a-41ce-9f7a-a686b86ffc56>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I'm struggling with my lawn in Georgia - how does shade tolerance compare between St. Augustine and Fescue grasses?","answer":"Both St. Augustine and Fescue are among the most shade-tolerant grass types, but their suitability depends on location. Fescue is the most shade-tolerant grass adapted to the Atlanta area and north Georgia. For St. Augustine, specific cultivars like Palmetto, Mercedes, and Raleigh have suitable shade tolerance. In fact, St. Augustine ranks as the third most shade-tolerant grass species overall, while Fescue varieties (both Red and Tall) rank as the top two most shade-tolerant grasses. When growing either type in shade, they should be cut 1/2 to 1 inch higher than grass in full sunlight to allow more leaf area for light interception.","context":["Lawn – Growing in Shade\nOK. I admit it. I have given up. I came to the conclusion that grass just would not grow in the corner of my lawn near the ornamental cherry trees. The shade there is so dense that my grass, no matter how lush in April, thinned out to bare soil for five years running. This spring I planted hydrangea, white impatiens, golden hosta and variegated ivy there and the spot looks better than it ever has.\nTrees and shade look nice in the landscape. However, it is difficult to grow grass under trees because not only the quantity but also the quality of the light changes in the shade. In full sun, light is in the “near red” range of wavelengths. In the shade it shifts to the “far red,” which is less effective for photosynthesis. The result is a reduction in the food needed for turf growth. Leaves and stems of grass plants are thinner in shade. Moisture from dew under trees takes longer to evaporate. The additional moisture may contribute to an increase in disease.\nWith the deck stacked against it, it is remarkable that any grass grows under trees. If you let experience, rather than me, be your teacher, these tips will help you grow grass in the shade. Go to How Much Light Does a Lawn Need before you read further.\nCHOOSE RIGHT GRASS Under high pine tree shade, bermudagrass and zoysiagrass can grow successfully. Beneath the shade of a dogwood or an oak, both fail miserably. Use turfgrasses adapted to your area of Georgia. Fine and tall fescue are adapted to north Georgia. Dependent on the variety; zoysiagrass, centipedegrass, and bermudagrass can be grown throughout the state.\nCool season grasses –Fescue is the most shade-tolerant grass that is adapted to the Atlanta area but there is little difference between the various named fescue seed brands. Fine fescues may survive in some situations. When establishing cool-season grasses, it is best to seed or sod early enough in the fall so there is sufficient time for the turfgrass to mature before leaves cover the ground. During the fall remove leaves by raking, blowing or bagging when mowing to prevent smothering of the grass. Cool-season turfgrasses will grow long after deciduous trees have dropped their leaves.\nWarm season grasses – In general bermudagrass is intolerant to shade. Two newer cultivars, TifGrand and Celebration have shown good persistence under shade conditions. These cultivars may be options in environments where the grass receives 6 hours or better of filtered to intermittent shade. Likewise, centipedegrass needs the same light conditions as these two bermudagrass cultivars.\nSome St. Augustinegrass cultivars have suitable tolerance to shade. Examples include Palmetto, Mercedes, and Raleigh.\nSimilarly, some zoysiagrass cultivars are tolerant to limited light environments. Zoysiagrass cultivars that have good tolerance to shade include El Toro, JaMur, Zeon, and Zorro. These species have performed well under a heavy hardwood shade for 5 years. Cavalier has also been reported to have good shade tolerance while the older cultivar, Meyer, has fair tolerance.\nPRUNE TREES Selective pruning and thinning of limbs within the tree canopy will allow better sunlight penetration. Single tall trees should have all limbs removed below 10 feet. Rake and remove leaves or needles before they accumulate.\nMOW HIGHER Grass in the shade should be cut approximately 1/2 to 1 inch higher than the grass growing in full sunlight. This will allow more leaf area to intercept the limited amount of sunlight. Avoid scalping turf in the spring. Decline of turf in shade often begins after a single episode of scalping.\nWATER MORE Tree roots compete with the turfgrass for available soil moisture. In addition, the distribution of moisture from rainfall is poor under a tree canopy. The tree leaves block or deflect the rainfall. This yields an uneven soil moisture pattern. As a rule of thumb, turfgrass in shade needs 1 inch or more of water per week. In the absence of rainfall, wet the soil to a 6-inch depth. This may take 2 to 3 hours for one irrigation application.\nMINIMIZE TRAFFIC During the summer months, minimize the traffic and activities in the shaded grass areas. This will reduce the wear stress on the turf. If the grass is in a path where traffic can not be avoided, place stepping stones or pine bark to mark the trail.\nLIMIT FERTILIZER Grass grown in the shade should receive half the fertilizer than that in the sun. Follow the fertilizer schedule at my Lawn Care Calendars page\nLIMIT WEEDKILLERS Use broadleaf weed controls sparingly on shaded lawns. Spot-spray special weeds like wild violet. Crabgrass controls are not necessary in a shade environment since crabgrass needs a high light intensity to germinate.\nUSE GROUNDCOVER OR MULCH In areas where even fescue fails, think about using light-colored groundcovers like I did. A layer of pinestraw or pine chips looks much better than bare dirt. As one of my gardener buddies says, “Nature always bats last!”\nsee also Using Mondo Grass for a Lawn","02 Nov Growing Grass in Shaded Areas\nGrowing Grass in Shaded Areas\nGrowing grass in shady conditions is a common challenge for many homeowners. It is common knowledge that grass cannot be grown in total shade (like all plants, grass requires sunlight to photosynthesize), but the questions “how much shade is too much?” or “what is the least amount of sunlight required to grow a healthy lawn?” are asked very frequently.\nThe short and simple answer to this question is that in order to survive, a lawn using certain shade tolerant varieties will need at least four hours of direct sunlight, preferably from 10 am to 2 pm. To thrive, a lawn needs even more sunlight. For lawns that receive less than four hours of direct sunlight, an alternative groundcover should be considered.\nManaging Shady Landscapes\nThe three major factors to consider when managing shady landscapes are 1) the kind of shade challenge the lawn is facing, 2) the shade tolerant grass options available in the region, and 3) fungal disease in shady landscapes.\nDifferent Kinds of Shade & Changing Shade\nNot all shade is equal, and not all shade is permanent. Filtered sunlight (partial shade) from a tree is preferable to zero sunlight (complete shade) from a building or other large, permanent structure. Trees may be thinned or removed while buildings cannot be altered to accommodate the needs of a lawn. It is important to consider that as a landscape matures and trees grow larger canopies, previously healthy lawns may decline with diminished sunlight. After taking the steps of understanding and managing (if possible) the source of shade, the next factor to consider is the shade tolerant grass options available in your specific region.\nComparative Shade Tolerance of Different Grass Species and Cultivars\nListed below are eleven grass species listed from most to least shade tolerant.\n- Fescue, Red\n- Tall Fescue\n- St Augustinegrass\n- Seashore Paspalum\n- Kentucky Bluegrass\n- Perennial Ryegrass\n- Bermudagrass, Common\nThe shade tolerant grass species available for use will depend on where you live. In the cool season areas, fescues are the most shade tolerant. In warm season areas, St. Augustinegrass is the most shade tolerant, followed by zoysiagrass. To learn more about cold and warm season grasses and the difference between the two, view THIS POST.\nComparative Shade Tolerance of Different Cultivars\nA cultivar is a specific kind of grass within a species. For example, Floratam and Palmetto® are both St. Augustinegrasses, but different cultivars. While both are shade tolerant, Palmetto has shown to be one of the most shade tolerant cultivars among all St. Augustinegrass.\nWithin zoysiagrasses, a general guideline to remember is the finer the leaf blade, the more shade tolerant the cultivar. For example, EMPIRE Turf®,a medium textured zoysiagrass grown in warm season areas, has moderate shade tolerance, while both InnovationTM and GeoTM, two finer textured zoysaigrasses grown in the transition zone, have greater shade tolerance.\nWhichever grass you choose, a tip for maintaining shade-tolerant varieties is to mow a bit higher than the recommended mowing height. The extra height will provide a greater surface area for the grass to photosynthesize the reduced sunlight it receives in shady conditions.\nA Word About Disease\nAny turfgrass grown in wet, shady environments is prone to fungal disease. Shade tolerant grasses often struggle or die from disease pressure, not necessarily from lack of sunlight. When selecting a shade tolerant grass to grow in a shady landscape, be sure to budget for several applications of systemic fungicide per year. Additionally, note that to avoid disease it is best to water less in shaded areas compared to areas that receive full sun.\nA New Shade Tolerant, Disease Resistant St. Augustinegrass\nIn October 2018, the University of Florida released CitraBlueTM, a new St. Augustinegrass with a dark blue-green leaf blade that exhibits greater shade tolerance and disease resistance compared to Floratam. CitraBlue will be available in small quantities in Florida in late 2019 and more widely available throughout the warm season areas in the United States in 2020."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"content_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:5602fd49-4529-4678-8e9d-4f83d73bd47e>","<urn:uuid:60b62417-900a-4ab6-928f-4e664b3791e2>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do water balance models and spring drying trends compare in predicting future water availability?","answer":"Water balance models and spring drying trends both predict concerning changes in future water availability but work differently. Water balance models like IAEA's isotope-enabled model describe the water cycle through precipitation, evapotranspiration, stream flow and water storage changes, using isotopes for accurate calibration to predict water supplies 100+ years ahead. Meanwhile, research on spring drying trends in the U.S. Southwest uses regional and global simulations to calculate water availability by subtracting evapotranspiration from precipitation, revealing consistent patterns of spring drying and seasonal wet/dry pattern migration that will affect future water resources. Both approaches indicate that climate change will significantly impact water availability through increased evapotranspiration and changes in precipitation patterns.","context":["How will climate change influence water supplies a hundred years from now? To answer questions like this, water scientists use scientific models. Among these is the IAEA’s isotope-enabled water balance model, which can help experts accurately and reliably predict the impact of climate change on water resources far into the future. The information they collect can support decision makers in developing sustainable water use policies for generations to come.\nThis is one of the topics that water experts will discuss during the IAEA’s International Symposium on Isotope Hydrology, taking place on from 20 to 24 May in Vienna, Austria.\nModels draw on existing data and are used to study and understand ideas, objects and processes that are difficult to observe directly. This includes making predictions, such as forecasting next week’s weather conditions or estimating unemployment rates over the next five years. While models present a more general and simplified version of the real world, each aspect of a model is calibrated to provide an accurate reflection of how the real world works.\nWater balance models describe the water cycle in terms of precipitation, evapotranspiration, stream flow and changes in water storage. Unlike many traditional water balance models, the IAEA’s model uses isotopes to calibrate the model and verify its accuracy because isotopes are distinct and consistent in their behaviour. With a well-calibrated and verified water balance model, scientists can get an accurate estimate of what to expect in the future, such as the impact of climate change on water resources a hundred years or more from now.\nPrecise long-term predictions\nFor any country and climate, precision in these long-term water studies is important because an over or underestimation of future water supplies can have detrimental effects, said Dessie Nedaw Habtemariam, Associate Professor at Addis Ababa University in Ethiopia.\n“If we misestimate how fast water is replenished, for example, and our estimate is too high, and then communicate these results to the decision makers, they could implement policies that result in groundwater being extracted faster than it can be recharged,” Habtemariam said. Groundwater — water in the layer of permeable rock under the earth’s surface — is a primary source of fresh water for the majority of Ethiopia’s population. “This would lead to a sharp decline in available groundwater supplies, which could mean an abandonment of boreholes and may even lead to drinking water shortages.”\nUnderestimation, on the other hand, could lead to unnecessarily stringent water policies or influence development decisions, such as hampering urban expansion due to a lack of water resources.\nFor these long-term studies of over 100 years or more, getting accurate results using other water balance models has been a major challenge, said Tricia Stadnyk, Associate Professor of water resources engineering at the University of Manitoba in Canada. “Many water balance models do a very good job at simulating the flow of water in streams, rivers and other water bodies, but are very bad at getting the amount of evapotranspiration right,” she said, referring to the process of evaporation of water from land and the movement of water from plants to the atmosphere. “For climate change predictions, this is a huge problem because one of the big things we look at is evapotranspiration.”\nAs temperatures become more extreme due to climate change, the rate of evapotranspiration does too. The more evapotranspiration, the less water on the earth’s surface, and vice versa. This, in turn, influences the entire annual water cycle and can lead to unpredictable extremes that swing from too little water, causing drought, to too much water, causing floods.\nNo climate is immune to these changes. They can affect a climate like Canada’s, where more than 60% of the land mass is some form of permafrost — frozen ground — and there are four distinct seasons, or one like Ethiopia’s, where much of the country is tropical and the temperature remains more or less constant throughout the year.\nThese diverse conditions can be captured by adjusting the model, which makes it globally applicable. Scientists from several countries are working with the IAEA to receive training and support in using the IAEA’s isotope-enabled water balance model and other models for improving water resource management. In Ethiopia, for example, a three-year technical cooperation project is being launched to study the upper Awash Basin — a large groundwater reservoir supplying fresh water to more than 2.6 million people. Other countries, like Canada, are setting up or have set up isotope sampling networks to improve accuracy when using models such as the IAEA’s.\nThe IAEA’s isotope-enabled water balance model\nScientists use the IAEA’s isotope-enabled water balance model to simulate and estimate the long-term influence of climate change on the movement and availability of water throughout the water cycle — from the air, to the earth’s surface, into the ground, and repeat. The model integrates isotope mass balance for each water balance component on a monthly step to improve its calibration and validation process.\nFirst introduced in 2015, the model’s user-friendly, open-source software includes pre-processing, modelling and analysis tools to make it easier to plug in data and visualize and analyze results. It is designed to work with a variety of local and global datasets related to, among others, climate, vegetation, precipitation, water flow, topography and soil. The isotopic data used for calibrating the model and validating its results generally draws on locally collected data, as well as data from global repositories, such as the IAEA’s Global Network of Isotopes in Precipitations (GNIP) and the Global Network of Isotopes in Rivers (GNIR).","Atmospheric Sciences & Global Change\nWater Woes Projected in U.S. Southwest\nRegional water availability reductions ahead according to research that reveals spring drying trends\nA dry irrigation canal illustrates one challenge presented by large shifts in spring wet and dry periods across the U.S. Southwest—reductions in water availability. Authors of this study found that the intensity of the water cycle, due to more atmospheric moisture held captive in a warming climate, leads to changes in water availability with regional impacts and implications for society’s resilience to climate change. Enlarge Image.\nResults: New research from scientists at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory identified a trajectory of spring drying that will alter water availability across the U.S. Southwest. To describe the net change in water, they calculated the water gained through precipitation and subtracted the water lost through evaporation and transpiration in an ensemble of regional and global simulations. Their findings indicate future challenges for regional water resource managers and agricultural production.\n\"Our research identified a prominent spring drying trend over the U.S. Southwest and a seasonal migration of the wet and dry patterns,\" said Dr. Yang Gao, post-doctoral researcher and atmospheric scientist at PNNL. \"These signals are strong and consistent across regional and global climate projections.\"\nWhy It Matters: Water in the soil, streams, and groundwater is critical for Earth ecosystems and food and energy production, so understanding and projecting how water availability is going to change in the future is a major science challenge with important societal implications. While global precipitation is projected to increase in a warmer climate, water availability is a measure determined by regional precipitation and the amount of moisture that either evaporates or is taken up by plants, called transpiration. Together, precipitation and evapotranspiration vary greatly over a region, and their changes are due to complex alterations in atmospheric circulation, soil moisture, and many other processes. The new research underscores the importance of evaluating changes in regional North American water availability and propels efforts to evaluate their implications for climate impacts and adaptation.\n\"Increasing greenhouse gases cause the atmosphere to hold more moisture in a warmer climate, intensifying Earth's water cycle,\" said Dr. Ruby Leung, PNNL Laboratory Fellow, atmospheric scientist and corresponding author on the study. \"Changes in the water cycle have significant implications for water availability that challenge regional resilience to climate change.\"\nMethods: The PNNL research team calculated changes in water availability from a multi-model ensemble of climate simulations for the present (1975-2004) and the future (2070-2099) produced by a single regional climate model and 20 global climate models used in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5). Through both model agreement and statistical significance they identified robust changes across the models. They investigated the relationships between seasonal large-scale circulation and water availability changes using regression analysis to evaluate the contributions of dynamical changes, in addition to increased moisture availability, to changes in precipitation minus evapotranspiration (P-E). Lastly, they depicted seasonal P-E changes by the seasonal timing of the dominant wet/dry trends derived from the regional and global model projections to highlight their robust features over North America.\nTheir research shows that seasonal changes in the large-scale circulation and increased atmospheric moisture due to warmer temperatures lead to wet/dry trends that are dominated by two distinct and opposite north-south and east-west patterns.\nWhat's Next? The multi-model ensemble of regional and global climate simulations will be further analyzed to evaluate changes in extreme events such as heat waves and cold air outbreaks, heavy precipitation, and other climatic features important for understanding societal vulnerability to climate change in the United States.\nSponsors: The U.S. Department of Energy Biological and Environmental Research supported this research as part of the Regional and Global Climate Modeling Program and Integrated Assessment Research Program. The regional climate simulations used in the analysis received support from the PNNL Platform for Regional Integrated Modeling and Analysis (PRIMA) initiative, a PNNL Laboratory Directed Research and Development program.\nResearch Area: Climate and Earth Systems Science\nReference: Gao Y, LR Leung, J Lu, Y Liu, M Huang, and Y Qian. 2014. \"Robust Spring Drying in the Southwestern U.S. and Seasonal Migration of Wet/Dry Patterns in a Warmer Climate.\" Geophysical Research Letters 41(5):1745-1751.

Each commentary will focus on explaining and understanding a separate principle along with its application to daily living.\nTaoist teachings function as a guide to daily living. Their purpose is to assist us in experiencing our essential nature as inseparable from that of the cosmos, to be part of the flow of life. Gaining knowledge of the main principles of Taoist thought allows us to cultivate and strengthen our own process of self-exploration, growth, and transformation, and to connect us deeply to our inner nature and to the world around us. In this way we enter the Circle of Tao.\nYin and Yang\nAn important first step toward attaining this experience of interconnectedness is by learning to recognize and align ourselves with the movement of life itself. This is achieved through an understanding of yin and yang. This principle lies at the very root of the Taoist tradition and describes the underlying unity of life through the interplay of two primal forces.\nYin and yang are the two essential and interdependent energies of life. Though opposite in nature, they are not experienced as diametrically opposed, but rather as complementary and relative to one another. They arise from a common source, the Tao. Yang is characterized as creative, assertive, positive, and light, while yin is receptive, yielding, negative, and dark. It is important to note that these attributes are only descriptive and do not carry any moral value.\nIt is yin and yang make the world go round! Our entire physical reality is based on the interplay of these two energies. Whether it is the structure of DNA, with its positive and negative strands, the transmission of neurons in our brains, from a positively charged sender to a negatively charged receptor, the existence of the earth’s magnetic fields which regulate the ebb and flow of the ocean tides, or the makeup of electricity with its positive and negative currents - all of these processes take place because of these two opposing energies. Their interaction creates all manifestation. It is through them that the Tao reveals itself.\nThe original meaning of the term “yin-yang” signified the dark (yin) and light (yang) sides of a mountain. Early in the day, the sun would illuminate one part of the mountain while the other side would remain dark. As the sun moved across the sky it gradually began to light the opposite side while the earlier sunlit face became dark. Light and dark were not static but interacted with one another, defined one another, and actually assumed each other’s roles in the process of change. This describes the interplay of yin and yang.\nThis image is named the Tai Chi Tu, or Supreme Ultimate Map. It is also sometimes referred to as the “yin-yang symbol”. You can see in this figure that the two energies are depicted as equally proportional, symbolizing a harmonious balance between the two. The small dot signifies that as each energy reaches its fullest expression it already carries the seed of its opposite. And the curved line suggests a flowing dynamic between the two - they are constantly changing, literally flowing into each other and becoming each other. (Remember the sunny and dark sides of the mountain.)\nAll is Tao. All opposites are in actuality part of one whole, giving rise to one another. Neither is excluded, neither one is superior to the other. There is a constant, natural flow between them. Lao Tzu, the immortal Taoist sage, reminds us that one polarity cannot exist without the other. If there is no “light”, there is no “dark”, no “up” without a “down”. He writes, \"Under heaven all can see beauty as beauty only because there is ugliness. All can know good as good only because there is evil.\" Then, more provocatively, he asks: \"Is there a difference between yes and no?\" “Is there a difference between good and evil?\"\nChuang Tzu, another legendary Taoist sage, states that depending on your point of view, \"Everything can be a 'that'; everything can be a 'this.' Therefore, 'that' comes from 'this' and 'this' comes from 'that' - which means 'that' and 'this' give birth to one another. When there is no more separation between 'that' and 'this', it is called being one with the Tao.”\nAll opposites - thoughts, views, opinions, interpretations, phenomena - all spring from a common source. Life is both yin and yang, it contains “good” and “evil”. It is how we respond to these energies that determines the quality of our lives.\n§ Are you willing to explore and try to understand another’s viewpoint that is opposed to yours? Can you find the dot of yang in the sea of yin?\n- Lao Tzu writes that “evil” will change through the influence of its opposite.\nWhat is your relationship to evil? Do you help create it by standing in direct opposition to it? Can you see it as part of the whole?\n- Have you ever had an “evil” thought? What might you learn from that?\nAnother aspect of yin and yang is the concept of change. The “Supreme Ultimate Map” charts out how life manifests through the interaction of yin and yang. First, there is continuous change. Secondly, as these two forces constantly interact, the process of change moves through recognizable, cyclical patterns, like the alternating of day and night or the turning of the seasons. When one energy becomes full and complete, the other begins to grow and ascend. \"That which shrinks must first expand. That which fails must first be strong.\" Lao Tzu tells us that life is a process. For all things there is a natural expansion and contraction, on both the most minute and grandest levels. It is the breathing pattern of life itself.\nTaoist texts speak of “living life in the round”. The “round” refers to the circle which encompasses the yin and yang energies. “Living life in the round” means being comfortable with the flow of energy as it passes through one phase and then the other. Knowledge of the cyclical process of events liberates us from an unbalanced view of the world.\n- Going with the flow implies that there is a larger life current with which we can align ourselves. Can you sense that energy, when it changes direction, the turning of the tide?\n- All things change and change is constant. Are you comfortable with change?\n- By recognizing patterns and stages of change we can practice appropriate timing. There is a time to act and a time to be still, a time to intercede and a time to yield.\nBalance and Equality\nBalance is central to yin and yang. The Tai Chi Tu presents these energies in a balanced state. Yet we also see that any point on the circle is balanced by a point on the other side. One can find and maintain balance anywhere within the process of change. By learning to keenly perceive these two energies we learn the skill of being in balance in any given situation.\nThe ancient Chinese martial art, Tai Chi Chuan, or Supreme Ultimate Boxing, takes its name from the Tai Chi Tu precisely because it embodies many of the principles depicted by this symbol, primarily that of balance. Practitioners of Tai Chi learn to relax, to be one with their experience (the Tao), to flow smoothly with the changing postures, and to maintain balance in a variety of positions, including standing on one leg!\n- We are all aware of the importance of balance in our lives. Our language expresses this awareness through such terms as balanced diet, a balanced or even-handed approach, and, of course, a balanced checkbook.\n- Are there areas of imbalance in your life? Do you work too much? Do you have enough quiet time or enough exercise? Do you feel emotionally balanced?\nWhat implications does all of this have for us on a personal level? How can we apply the concept of yin and yang in our daily lives? If we want to enter the circle of Tao, to live life in the round, we have to be willing to flow with what comes along. If our awareness is sufficiently attuned to the patterns of change we have the potential to be a harmonizing force. If we are unaware, then at best we are swept along by the current, often fighting it in a futile manner.\nCultivate an awareness of things as they truly are, interconnected, part of a larger whole.\nOur conventional view of the world as irreconcilable opposites is based on a perception of the universe as separate objects.\nOur two sages advise us to move beyond these apparent contradictions. All is Tao! Both yin and yang are Tao. Good luck is Tao, bad luck is Tao. Rather than rigidly choosing one side against the other, we are urged to perceive the two sides in their relatedness, to experience how one creates the other. In so doing we reconcile or harmonize these opposites, we “blunt the sharpness and untangle the knot,\" as Lao Tzu states. We become part of nature's constant movement toward a state of balance.\nThere are “two sides to every story”. Listening to both sides and making an effort to appreciate them allows us to be empathic, to understand another’s experience, to stand in their shoes. Then we see that while there are two “sides”, yin and yang, there is one “story” - Tao. Nothing has an absolute or totally separate identity.\nRecognize change in its various stages. Learn how to flow with change.\nWhen we become attuned to cycles and patterns of change our actions become more skillful, more in step with these phases. We can recognize and deal with problems in their early stages. Our natural wisdom lets us know when to intervene and when to let things play out.\nMuch of our struggle in life arises either out of our failure to acknowledge change or out of our resistance to it. By flowing with the ongoing patterns of change we harmonize with them. We learn to not cling to our own values and interpretations.\nBy not holding tightly to one polarity or the other we experience how “bad” luck can become “good” luck while crisis can contain the opportunity for growth. Choosing to cooperate with the unity of opposites means accepting all facets of our existence, \"good\" and \"bad,\" as the natural flow of the Tao.\nBe an agent of balance, partake in the reconciling of opposites\nNature contains all opposites. They exist as part of the natural order, the ever-changing, ongoing process of life. In nature, however, unlike our human realm, there are no value distinctions, no moral judgments that make this or that phenomenon good or bad, desirable or undesirable. While value distinctions often cause the very ills they are supposed to cure, natural opposites enhance and complement one another.\nRather than trying to win or be “right” at the expense of another, we may regard another’s experience or opinion as different without making it categorically “wrong”. This allows balance to be achieved.\nWe do live in a world of “yes” and “no”, “light” and “dark”, and “good” and “evil”. There are times when we feel deeply that we are “right”, and that we must assert our position or vision. And there will be occasions when we will be aligned with the ascendant, or harmonizing energy. Yet, even then, if we can remember our connection to the whole, remember that we are, in some way, part of “the other side”, resolution will be more harmonious and will lead to a true balance, an outcome that benefits all.\nA skilled mediator enacts this principle by looking beyond “right and wrong” and seeking what is common and beneficial to all sides in a dispute. This is reconciling opposites, finding the common ground of the Tao.\n“What goes up must come down.\" \"Every cloud has a silver lining.\" Our own language echoes the wisdom found within the concept of yin and yang and encourages us to embrace these opposites, to see them as relative and changing, and to remember that ultimately all is Tao.\nBy following the path of acceptance and responsiveness to change we can become, in the words of Chuang Tzu, true women and men of Tao. “The true person of Tao,” he writes, \"is not always looking for right and wrong, not always deciding 'yes' or 'no'. The true person has no mind to fight Tao and does not try by her own contriving to help Tao along. All that comes out of her comes quiet, like the four seasons.\""],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"sensitive"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:66f66fe0-a126-48c2-9837-661871ed0d7a>","<urn:uuid:07664512-9f03-4075-9d25-e48b6c98b132>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do diagnostic approaches compare between distal median nerve dysfunction and ulnar nerve entrapment?","answer":"Both conditions require different diagnostic approaches. For distal median nerve dysfunction, diagnosis involves a physical examination checking for decreased sensation in the thumb side of the hand and thumb weakness, along with specific tests like EMG, nerve conduction studies, and various blood tests, x-rays, and imaging scans based on suspected causes. For ulnar nerve entrapment, diagnosis involves assessing hand muscle strength through the 'card test' checking for Froment's or Jeanne's sign, percussion over nerve points (Tinel's sign), and identifying compression locations. Diagnostic imaging (ultrasound or MRI) can be used to observe nerve damage or muscle changes, and nerve conduction studies may be utilized, although early-stage compression might not show up in these tests.","context":["Distal median nerve dysfunction\nDistal median nerve dysfunction is a form of peripheral neuropathy that affects the movement of or sensation in the hands.\nA common type of distal median nerve dysfunction is carpal tunnel syndrome.\nNeuropathy - distal median nerve\nDysfunction of one nerve group, such as the distal median nerve, is called a mononeuropathy. Mononeuropathy means there is a local cause of the nerve damage, although occasionally body-wide (systemic) disorders may cause isolated nerve damage.\nDistal median nerve dysfunction occurs when the nerve is inflamed, trapped, or injured by trauma. The most common reason is trapping (entrapment), which puts pressure on the nerve where it passes through a narrow area. Wrist fractures may injure the median nerve directly or may increase the risk for trapping a nerve later on.\nInflammation of the tendons (tendonitis) or joints (arthritis) can also cause nerve compression. Some repetitive movements increase the chance of developing carpal tunnel entrapment.\nConditions that affect connective tissue or cause deposits to form in tissue can block blood flow and lead to nerve compression. Such conditions include:\nIn some cases, no cause can be identified. Diabetes can make this condition worse.\n- Pain in the wrist or hand that may be severe and wake you up at night, and that may be felt in other areas, such as the upper arm (this is called referred pain)\n- Sensation changes in the thumb and pointer (index), middle, and part of the ring fingers, such as a burning feeling, decreased sensation, numbness, and tingling\n- Weakness of the hand that causes you to drop things or have difficulty grasping objects or buttoning a shirt\nExams and Tests\nYour doctor will examine your wrist and ask questions about your medical history. The examination may show decreased sensation in the thumb side of the hand. This is called the \"radial\" side. There may be weakness of the thumb and difficulty using it to pinch.\nTests that reveal distal median nerve dysfunction may include:\nTests are guided by the suspected cause of the nerve dysfunction, which is based on your history, symptoms, and the way symptoms developed. They may include various blood tests, x-rays, imaging scans, or other tests and procedures.\nTreatment is aimed at correcting the underlying cause.\nIf the median nerve is affected by carpal tunnel syndrome, a wrist splint can reduce further injury to the nerve and help relieve symptoms. Wearing the splint at night will give the area a rest and allow inflammation to decrease. An injection into the wrist may help with symptoms, but it won't fix the underlying problem.\nIn some cases, no treatment is required and recovery happens on its own. Over-the-counter or prescription medication may be needed to control nerve pain (neuralgia).\nIf other nerves are also affected, it is necessary to look for an underlying medical problem that can affect nerves. Medical conditions such as diabetes and kidney disease can damage nerves. In these cases, treatment is directed at the medical condition.\nPhysical therapy exercises may help some peoplemaintain muscle strength. Orthopedic assistance may maximize the ability to use the hand. Such therapy may involve braces, splints, or other appliances. Vocational counseling, occupational therapy, occupational changes, job retraining, or other measures may be recommended.\nSome patients with carpal tunnel syndrome may need surgery. See: Carpal tunnel release\nIf the cause of the nerve dysfunction can be identified and successfully treated, there is a good chance of full recovery. In some cases, there may be partial or complete loss of movement or sensation. Nerve pain may be severe and persist for a prolonged period of time.\n- Deformity of the hand (rare)\n- Partial or complete loss of hand movement\n- Partial or complete loss of sensation in the fingers\n- Recurrent or unnoticed injury to the hand\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nCall your health care provider if you have symptoms of distal median nerve dysfunction. Early diagnosis and treatment increase the chance of curing or controlling symptoms.\nPrevention varies depending on the cause. In patients with underlying diabetes, controlling blood sugar may reduce the risk of developing nerve disorders.\nIn occupations that require repetitive wrist movements, a change in the way the job is performed may be necessary. Frequent breaks in activity, \"wrist rests\" on keyboards, and other measures may reduce the risk of distal median nerve dysfunction. When possible, avoid prolonged repetitive movement of the wrist.\nJarvik JG, Comstock BA, Kliot M, et al.

Entrapment of the ulnar nerve can theoretically occur at any place along the nerve’s pathway; however, impingement of a nerve occurs most commonly in the areas of joints, this is due to the narrow space the nerve occupies in these regions and the movement that occurs at these points. Entrapment of a nerve may involve constant, prolonged compression or repetitive compression (Wojewnik & Bindra, 2009).\nSpecifically, ulnar nerve entrapment occurs most commonly at the elbow, this is known as Cubital tunnel syndrome (Cutts, 2007). This is the second most occurring nerve entrapment syndrome in the human body (Cutts, 2007). Less commonly, the ulnar nerve can be compressed at the wrist, this is termed Ulnar tunnel syndrome or Guyon’s canal syndrome (Robertson & Saratsiotis, 2005).\nFor the purpose of this article, compression occurring in cervical spine will not be discussed, as this is medically termed a cervical radiculopathy (compression of the exiting nerve roots).\nThe ulnar nerve originates from the medial cord of the brachial plexus. The medial cord is predominantly made of nerve fibres from the C8 and T1 nerve roots (Robertson & Saratsiotis, 2005). The ulnar nerve navigates down the medial arm, just medial to the brachial artery, before it traverses through the intermuscular septum and passes into the posterior compartment of the arm. It then passes behind the medial epicondyle (cubital tunnel) at the elbow and then into the anterior forearm through the two heads of flexor carpi ulnaris (Robertson & Saratsiotis, 2005). It descends through the forearm between flexor digitorum superficialis and profundus, where it gives off a series of branches before passing over the ulnar side of the flexor retinaculum (carpal tunnel) and into the hand through Guyon’s canal, where it finally branches into a series of nerves within the hand (Landau & Campbell, 2013).\nANATOMICAL IMAGE OF THE ULNAR NERVE IN THE ARM\nThe ulnar nerve innervates a series of muscles within the forearm and hand. The movement of these muscles greatly varies depending on their location, however many play integral roles in coordinating wrist and hand movements such as gripping and finer dexterity tasks (Landau & Campbell, 2013). Additionally, the ulnar nerve, and its branches, provide sensation to the dorsal and palmar aspects of the medial hand, 5th digit and the medial aspect of the 4th digit (Robertson & Saratsiotis, 2005).\nWHAT ARE THE SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF ULNAR NERVE ENTRAPMENT?\nCommon symptoms of ulnar nerve entrapment include (Cutts, 2007; Robertson & Saratsiotis, 2005; Wojewnik & Bindra, 2009):\n- Tingling and/or numbness of the medial hand and/or little finger (5th digit) and the medial part of the ring finger\n- Pain within the above distribution\n- Clumsiness of the hand\n- Clawing of the hand\n- Wasting of the small muscles of the hand and/or ulnar sided muscles\nSymptoms involving sensory changes are more common in the early stages of the condition and as it prolongs motor changes may become apparent.\nThe symptoms of ulnar nerve entrapment can vary depending on the location at which compression occurs (Cutts, 2007). For example, compression occurring within the hand may present with either sensory or motor changes as the nerve may have branched into a cutaneous (sensory) or motor nerve, whereas at the elbow (in the cubital tunnel) the ulnar nerve is still comprised of both sensory and motor fibres, therefore more likely to present with a combination of symptoms. Other conditions such as diabetes mellitus can increase the risk of nerve compressive disorders (Cutts, 2007).\nDO I HAVE AN ULNAR NERVE ENTRAPMENT SYNDROME?\nThe diagnosis of ulnar nerve entrapment largely begins with the distribution of symptoms and presentation that is detailed in the above section. Clinicians examination will usually involve assessment of strength of the intrinsic muscles in the hand, specifically the ‘card test’ assessing for Froment’s or Jeanne’s sign. Identifying the location of compression can also be done clinically by percussing over the nerve, particularly at locations where the ulnar nerve is most superficial i.e. the wrist and elbow. A positive Tinel’s sign can be an indication of where the nerve is compressed.\nCauses for nerve compression may be intrinsic or extrinsic, or even a combination of both. Understanding the cause of compression is an important aspect of diagnostics. Extrinsic causes for nerve compression are varied and are often related to a behaviour or biomechanical aspect of performing a task. Some common behaviours that may lead to the development of ulnar nerve compression are (Cutts, 2007; Wojewnik & Bindra, 2009):\n- Resting on elbows/forearms/hands i.e. whilst typing, driving or cycling on handlebars\n- Sleeping with arm behind head\n- Intense exercise involving repetitive movement of the elbow i.e. bench press or bicep curls\n- Trauma to the medial elbow or medial palmar surface of the hand\nIntrinsic factors may include (Li, Lou, & Lu, 2018; Wojewnik & Bindra, 2009):\n- Anatomical variations, either at the cubital tunnel or Guyon’s canal\n- Ganglion cysts, either within the nerve or in relation to the compact space the nerve passes through\n- Fracture, both recent and old – may lead to anatomical deformity\n- Dislocation of the elbow\nImaging studies (ultrasound or MRI) can be utilised to define the presence of damage to a nerve (Landau & Campbell, 2013; Robertson & Saratsiotis, 2005; Wojewnik & Bindra, 2009). Changes to the nerve itself may be observed or where innervation of a muscle is compromised, the muscle in question can demonstrate changes. Imaging can also be useful in identifying intrinsic causes for ulnar nerve entrapment syndromes.\nAdditionally, nerve conduction studies can be useful in diagnosing ulnar nerve entrapment. However, a negative result does not always indicate that nerve compression is not present (Landau & Campbell, 2013). In the early stages of this condition, nerve damage may not have progressed to a stage that compromises the electrical conduction of the nerve.\nTREATMENT OF ULNAR NERVE ENTRAPMENT SYNDROMES\nBoth conservative and surgical treatments are utilised in cases of ulnar nerve entrapment. Selecting what is most appropriate is based largely on the severity of the condition as well as the likely cause. It is suggested that conservative treatment is most effective in cases where patients exhibit mild-moderate symptoms (Kooner, Cinats, Kwong, Matthewson, & Dhaliwal, 2019).\nConservative treatment options are varied, and their appropriateness depends on each case. Treatments can include (Cutts, 2007; Kooner et al., 2019; Robertson & Saratsiotis, 2005; Wojewnik & Bindra, 2009):\n- Activity and load modification\n- Biomechanical education and modification\n- Neural mobilisation techniques and exercises\n- Joint mobilisation\n- Soft tissue massage\n- Night-time splinting or bracing\n- Anti-inflammatory medication\nOne review study of conservative treatments indicated that activity/biomechanical modification, education and splinting were the most effective methods. However, unfortunately there is a paucity of high-quality evidence evaluating treatment options for this condition (Kooner et al., 2019). It is also recommended that conservative treatment be trialled for a period of 6-12 weeks in mild-moderate cases before surgical treatment is considered (Kooner et al., 2019).\nSurgical methods for the treatment of ulnar nerve entrapment also vary and are chosen based on a similar criterion to that of non-operative treatments. In cases where compression is mild and symptoms do not involve motor changes, simple open or endoscopic decompression is highly effective (Wojewnik & Bindra, 2009). Surgical interventions involving the re-structuring of the surrounding area appear to be more effective at decompressing the nerve (Adkinson, Zhong, Aliu, & Chung, 2015; Wojewnik & Bindra, 2009). For example, an epicondylectomy at the elbow can relieve compression within the cubital tunnel, though the risk of complications, such as a subluxing nerve post-surgery, is greater (Adkinson et al., 2015; Carlton & Khalid, 2018). Lastly, transposition surgery of the ulnar nerve may also be an option. This allows for thorough decompression and examination of the nerve, however there is a greater risk of compromising the blood supply to the nerve and potential nerve damage (Adkinson et al., 2015; Carlton & Khalid, 2018). Ultimately, success relates highly to degree of damage and symptoms prior to treatment, therefore early diagnosis and management where possible is imperative for good outcomes (Carlton & Khalid, 2018).\nNeuropathy of the ulnar nerve can occur for other reasons than compression. Other possible diagnosis for ulnar neuropathy include (Cutts, 2007; Robertson & Saratsiotis, 2005):\n- Repetitive subluxation of the ulnar nerve\n- Occlusion of the brachial artery – be aware of ulnar neuropathy symptoms post upper limb surgery\n- Alcohol related\nOther conditions that may present similarly to ulnar nerve entrapment syndromes include (Robertson & Saratsiotis, 2005; Wojewnik & Bindra, 2009):\n- Cervical radiculopathy – specifically of the C8/T1 nerve root\n- Thoracic outlet syndrome\n- Peripheral vascular disease\n- Double crush syndrome – other areas of compression in addition to the ulnar nerve\nAdkinson, J.

{"question":"What are the different ways viruses can be transmitted between organisms?","answer":"Viruses can be transmitted through several routes. One way is through direct contact with an infected organism, such as being bitten by a mosquito carrying the West Nile virus - this is known as a spillover event when viruses move between species. Another transmission method is indirect contact with infected individuals, particularly through respiratory droplets from coughing or sneezing. Additionally, viruses can spread through airborne transmission or surface contact, where people can become infected by touching surfaces where infectious viruses remain active for minutes to hours after landing.","context":["Genomics and Virology\nViruses are all around us. What are they and how can they affect human health?\nThe Big Picture\nViruses are bundles of genetic material wrapped in a protein coat that can infect living things. Viruses cause damage by hijacking a host cell's machinery to make copies of themselves, often disrupting normal cell function.\nViral vaccines can protect individuals from contracting and spreading common diseases caused by viruses, such as the flu, measles and COVID-19.\nWhat is a virus?\nViruses are tiny infectious particles that are halfway between living and nonliving organisms. They are so small (a millionth of a millimeter) that it would take hundreds to thousands of them to cover the end of a human hair. Each virus is composed of genetic material wrapped in a protein coat. Viruses that infect plants and animals also have a layer of fat molecules. Viruses cannot reproduce on their own. Instead, viruses replicate by infecting a host cell (such as humans, other animals, plants or bacteria), hijacking the host's biological machinery and turning the host cell into a virus-producing factory.\nWhat are viruses made of?\nMost viruses have the same basic structure:\na genetic information molecule in the form of nucleic acids such as DNA or RNA.\na protein layer, or coat, that surrounds and protects the nucleic acids.\nThe protein layer allows viruses to fuse with the outer layer of the cells they attack. The nucleic acid portion encodes genes to make proteins that are essential for the virus to function. These proteins direct viral replication and carry out other activities, such as evading host defenses.\nHow many viruses exist on Earth?\nResearchers estimate that 10 nonillion (10 followed by 30 zeroes) individual viruses exist on Earth. If all the 1030 viruses were organized in a single-file fashion, they would stretch for over 100 million light-years (a single light-year is 6 trillion miles) — which is four times the distance from Earth to the Canis Major Dwarf, our closest galaxy!\nBut only a tiny fraction of the viruses on Earth affect humans. Approximately 200 different viruses are known to cause disease in humans, including:\nAcquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)\nViral agent: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)\nViral agent: Poliovirus\nViral agents: Influenzavirus A, B, C or D\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)\nViral agent: SARS-CoV-2\nHow are viruses transmitted?\nViruses can be transmitted in many ways, including by:\nDirect contact with an infected organism, such as being bitten by a mosquito infected with the West Nile virus. When viruses (and other pathogens) move from one species to another, it is known as a spillover event.\nIndirect contact with someone who is infected, such as through respiratory droplets from a person who is coughing or sneezing.\nAirborne or surface transmission, such as touching a surface where infectious viruses are still located minutes to hours after they landed there, can also result in viral transmission.\nHow do viruses infect living organisms?\nViruses have proteins on their surface that typically latch onto a specific molecule on the surface of a host cell, called a receptor. The viral surface molecule can be likened to a specific key, while the host cell receptor is a lock. When the key meets the lock, it opens a door for the virus to enter the cell.\nViruses enter host cells as particles. Once a viral particle enters a host cell, its nucleic acid material interferes with the host cell's functions, essentially hijacking the proteins and other materials of the host cell to make more copies of the viral particles. One infected cell can release hundreds to thousands of new viral particles, with each of the new viral particles being capable of infecting another cell.\nOnce a virus successfully replicates itself, it leaves the host cell to infect other cells. Some viral infections cause no symptoms. However, when many viral particles infect an organism's cells at the same time, they may cause anything from uncomfortable symptoms to severe illness and even death.\nWhy don't all viruses cause human disease?\nThe exact reason why some viruses infect humans to cause disease and others do not remains a biological mystery. For example, humans usually die if infected by the rabies virus. But while human cells can be infected by circoviruses, they do not seem to cause disease. But circovirus infections in other mammals such as dogs and pigs can cause severe diseases.\nIf it is difficult for viruses to cause human disease, how are some able to do so?\nThere are a few major ways by which certain viruses can cause disease.\nViruses that encode information with RNA rather than DNA tend to have a higher rate of mutations. These mutations allow the viruses to be diverse in their genetic makeup, increasing the probability and pace by which they evade the human immune system.\nIn other cases, two different viruses interested in attacking the same host cell can swap regions of their nucleic acid and make a hybrid virus.\nSome viruses vastly benefit from staying inside their hosts for an extended period of time without being deadly. The lengthier the infection, the longer the virus has to adapt and spread to other hosts.\nFlu viruses can do both — mutate at a high rate and mix with other viruses.\nEach year, scientists measure and predict which versions of the influenza virus, or strains, will be prevalent around the world during the next flu season. Then, they produce an influenza vaccine that works against the new strains. These new strains usually acquire changes in their nucleic acid that make the viruses work differently in the host organism, such as by changing the viral protein coat slightly. That is why scientists must tailor vaccines to specific strains of viruses.\nHow does genomics help us understand viruses?\nGenomics is an interdisciplinary field that focuses on studying an organism's entire nucleic acid material (such as DNA or RNA), which is known as its genome. In 1977, researchers sequenced the first viral genome — phi X174, a virus that attacks bacteria.\nBut much progress has been made since then. For example, as of September 2021, there were 11,465 viral genome sequences available.\nIt is important to generate the complete genome sequence of viruses for several public health reasons. Knowing the viral sequence allows researchers to detect whether a virus is present in a host organism, and it provides clues for how a virus attacks and infects the host cell.\nViruses need to be able to use the functions of host cells to replicate themselves. Inhibiting some of the host cell's functions can potentially make viruses vulnerable. Researchers are studying genome sequences of both viruses and their hosts so as to target specific cell pathways that can be used for treatment.\nStudying viral genomes is key for understanding viral mutations and their evolution over time. Understanding viral genomes also helps researchers track outbreaks and consider how best to treat viral infections or vaccinate against a virus.\nHow can we reduce the spread of viruses?\nMasking, proper handwashing, use of hand sanitizers and social distancing reduce the spread of viruses of many viruses. Antiviral medications and vaccines can eliminate or reduce the severity of diseases caused by viruses.\nMedicines used to treat bacterial infections do not kill viruses.\nHow do viral vaccines work?\nPreviously, viral vaccines contained weakened or dead viruses, with both forms being incapable of causing disease. Now, scientists have an additional tool in their toolkit, producing vaccines using a virus's genome sequence. The viral genome has the information needed to create viral proteins, the active component of the vaccine to which the immune system responds. When injected, these DNA or RNA molecules are used by the host to produce specific viral proteins, and the immune system then recognizes the viral proteins as foreign, sparking a response from multiple types of white blood cells.\nOne such class of white blood cells, called B cells, produces a particular type of protein called an antibody. Antibodies bind to molecules on the surface of the virus and neutralize the virus to prevent it from replicating.\nOnce the human body successfully produces antibodies against a virus, its arsenal is ready for defense when the immune system comes in contact with the same virus in the future.\nWhy do some viruses affect certain people more negatively than others?\nThe exact reason why viruses affect people in different ways is under active study. Researchers attribute it to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. People with existing health conditions, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease or cancer, are more vulnerable to a severe viral infection.\nSome individuals also have specific genomic variants that can influence how a virus interacts with their body. For example, some relatively rare genomic variants make people susceptible to severe viral and other infections. On the flip side, some genomic variants protect specific individuals from viral infections. Researchers continue to study these mechanisms, including the relationship between the level of viral infection and specific genomic variants.\nDoes our body have viral DNA that doesn’t cause disease?\nYes. The human genome contains a considerable amount of DNA that previously existed in viruses. These viral sequences are remnants of past viral infections. Most of these sequences originally came from retroviruses, a type of virus that can insert one copy of its genome into the DNA of a host organism (such as a human). As the host cells make copies of its own genome, it copies the viral DNA as well. These sequences can pass from one generation to the next, becoming a permanent part of the human genome (like a fossil record).\nAt present, DNA from these retroviruses accounts for about 9% of the human genome, but most are thought to be incapable of producing new viral particles.\nLast updated: November 12, 2021"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:58828205-e370-4a88-8c53-4c44be012379>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do CO2 and floor pump systems compare in terms of portability and usage scenarios?","answer":"CO2 systems are portable and can be used for multiple purposes like tire filling, powering air tools, and operating ARB locking differentials. Floor pumps, while less portable, are essential home equipment for cyclists, allowing quick tire inflation using both hands and body weight. They come with specialized heads for different valve types (Shraeder and Presta) and are particularly effective for high-pressure applications.","context":["Using CO2 For Your Locker\nUse a CO2 tank to operate your ARB locking differentials!\nBy a huge margin, the number one question I get asked when people see my Jeep for the first time is: “what is that tank in the back”? The tank is, of course a compressed liquid CO2 tank. But it can be used for so much more than just filling your tires. Read on……\nFor those not familiar, 4-wheelers often use a portable CO2 tank to fill their tires after off-roading. Tire pressure is lowered while off-roading for better traction. A small air tank will not hold enough for even one set of tires because it is only about 100PSI. But a CO2 tank is liquid at 2000PSI (approximately); giving loads more volume as it exits the tank compared to air only. Another additional benefit is that the tank will operate air powered tools. I actually used my tank extensively to power an air nail gun when installing trim in my house. What I’ll explain here is yet another great use for that same bottle.\nARB’s are locking differentials which you can turn on or off using compressed air (90PSI). The typical installation of ARB’s includes solenoids, switches, a compressor, and possibly a small air tank. I didn’t want all of that complication, so I found out a much simpler (and less expensive way) to run my ARB’s using the compressed air out of my CO2 tank. I did the installation in a CJ7, but really the parts and installation could be adapted to any vehicle. Here we go!\nYou will need the following items, or something equivalent (I have also noted where I bought each item and the cost):\nThe basic layout:\nThe CO2 can fill tires OR run the ARB’s, but never both at the same time. There is a quick connect air fitting after the regulator so you can disconnect the pressure to the ARB’s, or hook up a coiled air hose to the tank and fill tires. This is where an adjustable regulator would be useful. I used a fixed 90PSI regulator, but if you had an adjustable regulator, you could increase the pressure to fill tires quicker (I like the simplicity and small size of fixed regulator). One note: if you run a pressure any higher than 99PSI static (not flowing) to the axles, the ARB seals could burst (according to ARB). Keep this in mind if you use an adjustable regulator. You do not need to buy a unique CO2 tank for this setup, you can just as easily use any of the CO2 systems out there on the Jeep market for tire filling, but to prevent damage, the ARB operating pressure should operate at 90PSI.\nFrom left to right:\nMounting the CO2 tank:\nI mounted the tank in the back using a fire extinguisher mount from my local fire prevention supply store (look in the yellow pages for your local one). It fits just right behind the rear seat. Remember that the tank must be top up (not laying flat on it’s side), because you want the CO2 gas to come out, not the liquid (that would be bad).\nThe fire extinguisher mount, which holds the tank, is bolted to the side of the fenderwell. Powertank has some super cool mounts for various mounting styles too. A 3 rd option are tuber mounts from the company Quickfist.\nConnecting the fittings at the tank:\nConnect all of the fittings as shown in the pictures. (Note: in the photo, the quick connect valve at the tank, and the regulator are already screwed together). The valve on top the CO2 tank should be closed unless you are wheeling; this way there will be no minor leaking of the CO2 while the jeep is parked. When you flip the pneumatic switch to either the front or the rear, air pressure (at 90PSI in this case) goes to the ARB, locking your axle 100%. It’s that simple. And when you turn the switch off, the switch vents the line from the ARB, releasing pressure to atmosphere and unlocking the differential (very handy on hard surfaces in 4wd when turning). When choosing your pneumatic switch, make sure you use the venting type (I have been told that there are different types). One huge advantage to this whole setup is the ability to use SAE size hose (more readily available in USA) instead of the metric ARB. That, and of course, no electricity, wiring, pumps, or permanent mount tanks are required.\nClose-up of the connections from tank to switches / air hose\nAir line connections and switch installation:\nThe Prestolok type fittings are treaded directly into the switches. These fittings are GREAT! You simply push the air hose into the hole and them make an airtight seal (the harder you pull, the tighter it stays in). To remove, pull back the collar, and pull on the air line in the opposite direction. These fittings replace the multiple part brass compression fittings I have had to use in the past (and which come with the ARB unit). I used the Prestolok at the axle and discarded the ARB compression fittings. Straight couplers can even be kept on board as a trail repair in the instance of a cut airline!\nThe Prestolok type airline fittings\nClose-up of the 2 pneumatic switches setup with all fitting mocked up prior to installation. On the top is the single air inlet, then air out from each switch to each axle.\nI used 3/16” air line from the tank to the switches. The air line runs along the floor from the tank into the back of the switches. I also used the 3/16” from the switches to the axles. This sounds small, but the ARB’s don’t need much air volume at all, mostly pressure. Be careful not to run too tight of a bend in the hose or it will kink (kind of like stepping on a water hose: -it will block the air flow). Tie the air lines out of the way under the vehicle as much as possible. If you have extended breathers, you can tie-wrap this air line right next to them for protection.\nSince I do not have a radio, there was a perfect open spot in my Tuffy console for switch placement. I made a small cardboard template, and mounted the hose and switches to the panel first. Then I fabricated a small panel out of 3/16” aluminum plate patterned off the cardboard. I used a small bit of silicone to hold the small panel in place in the console. The setup is the ultimate in simplicity and you retain independent control of the front and rear lockers.\nMockup of the switch panel made of cardboard\nRear side of the cardboard mockup panel with all connections made.\note the switch vent, which is made of sintered brass to vent air, but protect the switch from debris.\nFinal installed switch panel, mounted to the console with silicone.\nHere the two clear hoses coming from the switches in the console coming through a small hole in the floor heading out to each axle. A small bit of silicone was used to seal the hole.\nHere is another switch mounting example in a dashboard. This is a rock buggy dash (I took this picture at the SEMA show). This particular buggy used a tiny paint gun size tank since it only runs the ARB’s.\nSo how much CO2 will I use up?\nA 10lb CO2 refill will cost you about $12 at my local welding supply store (prices vary across the country). Remember to tell the store filling your tank that you want YOUR tank back (if you care), because many locations simply swap them out for a full one, and you are stuck with some old random tank.\nA few additional notes: Feel free to email me at firstname.lastname@example.org for questions or pictures you would like me to take for you. I received no free products or services from anyone when completing this write-up. EVERY Jeep is different (even one right behind the other coming off the assembly line), so keep that in mind that what did work for someone else might not exactly be the best solution for you (and the other way around). These articles are my opinion based on my experience. Don’t send me hate mail if you don’t agree. Do all of this work at your OWN risk. I am not responsible if you don’t know what you are doing and you hurt yourself in any way.","Specialized floor and frame pumps to mountain or road bikes, available models with adapter thread to different valves, with cartridge included, and made with aluminium or carbon. Choose your pump according to its max pressure, volume-per-stroke and color.\nSpecialized replacement for the twin valve head on Air tool floor pump in black.\nSpecialized Air tool Sport Twin Head floor pump in black and made of steel.\nSpecialized CPRO2 valve for Co2, with pressure gauge\nSpecialized Air tool Sport SwichHitter II pump in black steel.\nSpecialized Air tool MTB Mini pump in black aluminum color.\nIt is always advisable to have several types of pumps, both for home and to carry them in the pocket of the jersey, in a storage bag or the frame of your bike during races to save us from unexpected punctures and keep the tyres of your bike with a correct pressure to road with greater efficiency and performance. One of the main aspects that you must be taken into consideration is that you must differentiate between MTB and road pumps, being possible to find pumps to use them in both cases. To find the type of pump that best suits your needs, you can consider some of these features:\n↳ Floor pump: it is an accessory that can't be missing in every cyclist's house. Due to the larger size of its air chamber you can inflate the tyres more quickly. In addition, it allows to inflate the tyres that need high pressure and its vertical design allows to use both hands and all the weight of the body to help inflate them.\n↳ Portable pumps: these pumps with a very useful tool for those cyclists who road many days, as it can save you from any unforeseen event. Hand pumps are also very easy to transport because they can be stored safely and comfortably in the jersey pocket, in a storage bag or in the bicycle frame with a water bottle boss mount.\n↳ Type of head: the wheels have different valves, Shraeder and Presta, depending the type of bicycle. Presta valves are thinner and have a small threaded nut that allows the air to be sealed at high pressures. And Shraeder valves are larger and are the same as those of cars. Some of the pumps that you can find in this section have double heads compatible with both valves or have an adapter to use them in both cases.\n↳ CO2 cartridge: there are pumps that have carbon dioxide (CO2) cylinders inside its body that allow inflate the tyre with the necessary pressure to continue your road. These cylinders are a quick and practical solution to fix a tyre and can be easily replaced when consumed.\n↳ Max pressure: the maximum pressure output of a pump is measured in PSI (pounds per square inch), which is the amount of air that can be put into a tyre. The volume of air that a bicycle rim can hold must have a greater pressure to support the weight of the cyclist and prevent it from deforming during pedaling or hitting with obstacles. For this reason, road bikes can range from 90 to 180 PSI depending on the use to which the bicycle is intended. And, on the other hand, mountain bikes vary from 40 to 45 PSI."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:7fb2d546-c44a-41f9-895e-4abe21fcf3a8>","<urn:uuid:318a087c-fc62-42cd-ba88-acec80df22f5>"],"error":null}

{"question":"As a C++ developer, how can I ensure my program's behavior remains consistent when dealing with undefined behavior at different optimization levels?","answer":"You cannot ensure consistent behavior with undefined behavior (UB) at any optimization level. It's a misconception that UB only occurs at high optimization levels like -O2 or -O3, or that turning off optimizations with -O0 prevents UB. Even including debug symbols or running the program under a debugger doesn't eliminate UB. When a program contains UB, there are no guarantees about its behavior - it may appear to 'work fine', crash, corrupt memory, or produce entirely unexpected results, regardless of optimization settings.","context":["Falsehoods programmers believe about undefined behavior\n- Undefined behavior != implementation-defined behavior\n- All of the following assumptions are wrong\nUndefined behavior (UB) is a tricky concept in programming languages and compilers. I've heard many misconceptions about what the compiler guarantees in the presence of UB. This is unfortunate but not surprising!\nFor a primer on undefined behavior and why we can't just \"define all the behaviors,\" I highly recommend Chandler Carruth's talk \"Garbage In, Garbage Out: Arguing about Undefined Behavior with Nasal Demons.\"\nYou might also be familiar with my Compiler Adventures blog series on how compiler optimizations work. An upcoming episode is about implementing optimizations that take advantage of undefined behavior like dividing by zero, where we'll see UB \"from the other side.\"\nUndefined behavior != implementation-defined behavior\nUndefined behavior is also not the same as unspecified behavior, which is similar to implementation-defined behavior minus the requirement that the implementation document its choices and stick to them. Here we're focusing on undefined behavior, not unspecified behavior, so we'll lump unspecified behavior and implementation-defined behavior together.\nProgram behaviors fall into three buckets, not two:\n- Specification-defined: The programming language itself defines what happens. This is the vast majority of every program.\n- Implementation-defined: The exact behavior is defined by your compiler, operating system, or hardware. For example: how many bits exactly are in a char or int in C++ (the specification guarantees at least 8 bits for char and at least 16 bits for int). The rest is implementation-defined.\n- Undefined behavior: Anything is allowed to happen, and you might no longer have a computer left after it all happens. No outcome is a bug if caused by UB. For example: signed integer overflow in C, or using unsafe to create two &mut references to the same data in Rust (Wikipedia has an excellent list of examples if you'd like to see more).\nHere's the list of guarantees compilers make about the outcomes of undefined behavior:\nThat's the whole list. No, I didn't forget any items. Yes, seriously.\nIt is possible to analyze how UB affects a specific program when compiled by a specific compiler or executed on a specific target platform. For example, there exist exotic compilers, operating systems, and hardware that offer additional guarantees (like CHERI, with awesome powers around pointer safety) relative to most common platforms, which only guarantee OS-level process isolation. We aren't talking about those in this post.\nThe mindset for this post is this: \"If my program contains UB, and the compiler produced a binary that does X, is that a compiler bug?\"\nIt's not a compiler bug.\nAll of the following assumptions are wrong\nFalsehoods about when UB \"happens\"\n- Undefined behavior only \"happens\" at high optimization levels like -O2 or -O3.\n- If I turn off optimizations with a flag like -O0, then there's no UB.\n- If I include debug symbols in the build, there's no UB.\n- If I run the program under a debugger, there's no UB.\n- Okay there's still UB with all of these, but my code will \"do the right thing\" regardless.\n- It will either \"do the right thing\" or crash with a Segmentation Fault (SIGSEGV signal).\n- It will either \"do the right thing\" or crash somehow.\n- It will either \"do the right thing\" or crash or infinite-loop or deadlock.\n- At least it won't run some unrelated code from elsewhere in the program.\n- At least it won't run any unreachable code the program might contain.\nFalsehoods around the behavior of executing UB\n- If a line with UB previously \"did the right thing,\" then it will continue to \"do the right thing\" the next time we run the program.\n- The UB line will at least continue to \"do the right thing\" while the program is still running.\n- It's possible to determine if a previous line was UB and prevent it from causing problems.\n- At least the impact of the UB is limited to code which uses values produced from the UB.\n- At least the impact of the UB is limited to code which is in the same compilation unit as the line with UB.\n- Okay, but at least the impact of the UB is limited to code which runs after the line with UB. UB is explicitly allowed to alter the behavior of other code, even including operations preceding it! \"Alter\" here encompasses corrupting, undoing, or altogether preventing (as if it never happened) the outcomes of that other code. To learn more and see examples of UB causing \"time travel,\" check out this blog post.\n- Thanks to these two Reddit posts for suggesting better wording for these items. For the original text, see the Errata section at the end of this post.\nFalsehoods about the possible outcomes of UB\n- At least it won't corrupt the memory of the program.\n- At least it won't corrupt the memory of the program other than where the UB-affected data was located.\n- At least it won't corrupt the heap.\n- At least it won't corrupt the stack.\n- At least it won't corrupt the current stack frame. (My name for this is the \"local variables are safely in registers\" fallacy.)\n- At least it won't corrupt the stack pointer.\n- At least it won't corrupt the CPU flags register / any other CPU state.\n- At least it won't corrupt the executable memory of the program.\nOS and hardware security features like W^X can make this unlikely, but self-modifying programs can be built so it's in principle possible through UB as well. Certainly, there's no guarantee that UB won't do this!\n- At least it won't corrupt streams like stdout or stderr.\n- At least it won't overwrite any files the program already had open.\n- At least it won't open new files and overwrite them.\n- At least it won't completely wipe the drive.\n- At least it won't damage or destroy any hardware components. Not all devices have the same level of self-protection against bad inputs written to their control registers. This is the kind of lesson one tends to learn the hard way.\n- At least it won't start playing Doom if the program didn't already have the Doom source code in it. I'd be quite impressed if you made a compiler that makes programs run Doom when they encounter UB. Consider it a challenge!\nFalsehoods like \"but it worked fine before\"\n- If a UB-containing program \"worked fine\" previously, recompiling the program without any code changes will still produce a binary that \"works fine.\"\n- Recompiling without code changes and with the same compiler and flags will produce a binary that still \"works fine.\"\n- Recompiling as above + on the same machine will produce a binary that still \"works fine.\"\n- Recompiling as above + if you haven't rebooted the machine since the last compilation will produce a binary that still \"works fine.\"\n- Recompiling as above + with the same environment variables will produce a binary that still \"works fine.\"\n- Recompiling as above + at the same time of day and day of week as before, during a Lunar eclipse, having first sacrificed a fresh stick of RAM to the binary gods, will produce a binary that still \"works fine.\"\nFalsehoods about self-consistent behavior of UB\n- Multiple runs of the program compiled as above and with the same inputs will produce the same behavior in each run.\n- Those multiple runs will produce the same behavior if the program, ignoring the UB, is deterministic.\n- But they will if the program is also single-threaded.\n- But they will if the program also doesn't read any external data (files, network, environment variables, etc.).\nCommunity-contributed falsehoods around UB\n- Using a debugger on a UB-containing program will show program state that corresponds to the source code. This is a corollary of falsehood #16, further explained in this post. UB can corrupt the behavior of the program both before and after the UB, so the source code you see in your editor no longer matches the actual executing program. Of course, you can still use the debugger to step through assembly instructions and view register state. But highly optimized assembly isn't easy to understand to begin with, and UB-induced weirdness will only make it harder. Overall, a situation that is best avoided. Contributed here.\n- Undefined behavior is purely a runtime phenomenon. In Rust, a counter-example is misusing #[no_mangle] to overwrite a symbol with an incorrect type. A C++ counter-example is violations of the One Definition Rule (ODR), some of which the compiler is not required to report before causing havoc.\nFalse expectations around UB, in general\n- Any kind of reasonable or unreasonable behavior happening with any consistency or any guarantee of any sort.\nThe moment your program contains UB, all bets are off. Even if it's just one little UB. Even if it's never executed. Even if you don't know it's there at all. Probably even if you wrote the language spec and compiler yourself (Speaking from experience. Hopefully not one you have to relive to believe.).\nThis is not to say that all outcomes in the list above are equally likely, or even plausible (especially the one about running Doom). But they are all allowed, valid, spec-compliant behavior.\nIt's perfectly possible that your program has UB, and it's been running fine for years without issues. That's great! I'm happy to hear it! I'm not even saying you need to go back and rewrite it to remove the UB. But as you make your decisions, it's good to know the full picture of what the compiler will or won't guarantee for your program.\nHonorable mention for one special assumption\n\"If the program compiles without errors then it doesn't have UB.\"\nThis is 100% false in C and C++.\nIt's also false as stated in Rust, but with one tweak it's almost true. If your Rust program never uses unsafe, then it should be free of UB. In other words: causing UB without unsafe is considered a bug in the Rust compiler. These are rare and you are quite unlikely to run into them.\nWhen Rust unsafe is used, then all bets are off just as in C or C++. But the assumption that \"Safe Rust programs that compile are free of UB\" is mostly true.\nThis is not an easy feat. We owe a debt of gratitude to the folks who cumulatively put engineer-centuries into making it so. It's Thanksgiving, and I thank you!"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:c7357c1b-39ca-49ec-8dde-ac50c6b907bc>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How Mochen office and TR House use surroundings to design building?","answer":"Both buildings integrate with their surroundings but in different ways. Mochen office respects the diverse urban fabric of Beijing's Tong Linge Road by quietly sitting back from the street with a courtyard separating it from urban space. TR House in Barcelona uses vitrified ceramic tiles in four different green tones that match the surrounding landscape's seasonal changes, creating a merging effect. Both designs emphasize connecting with their environment - Mochen through spatial arrangement and TR House through material choices and color schemes.","context":["Mochen Office by Mochen Architects & Engineers\nMochen Architects & Engineers have sent us images of the office they designed for themselves in Beijing, China.\nProject description from Mochen Architects & Engineers\nTong Linge Road is located south of Beijing Xicheng District, between Chang’an Street and the Xuanwumen West Street. Our new office sits on the west side of the road. Before transformation it once was the Beijing Institute of TV Technology, a typical 1980’s office building with a courtyard.\nWe found that construction along the Tong Linge Road is extremely diverse: both sides of the road are large tracts of courtyard houses that have been converted or added by the locals are in derelict condition and facing demolition; among the houses there are also multi-storey residential buildings built during the sixties and seventies, high-rise residential apartments built in the late nineties, a large government agency (Xinhua News Agency), a church with Chinese and Western elements, and even a vegetable market having its walls decorated with Roman columns.\nJust as many parts of China which are constantly in construction, these buildings built in different periods and different styles caught between the two major city roads follow the growth of the old urban fabric. Seemingly chaotic and irrelevant development grew to display a wonderful order which has been accepted by the locals and become an integral part of their lives, as their formation and growth are in line with modern social and cultural background, and also result of various factors working together during the period of time. Like those settlements formed by individual unorganized behaviors thousands of years ago, this constant changing and sustainable development has formed a type of settlement in the new era, and destined to become history studied by the future generations after thousands of years. New construction happens on a daily basis and new order is established constantly, so in stead of chanting irrelevant slogans such as preserving old as old by those people suffering from Electra Complex, one should face the future architecture like an architect with modest attitude.\nFaced with such a renovation project with specific but also generally applicable background, we wish to sustain the order that has formed in the area, not to destroy original diverse street spatial forms, tolerate every fragment, treat them as sections of history, as opposed to conducting so-called selective repair. New building is still quietly sitting a distance from the street; a courtyard separates the office from the urban space; original entrance mass is retained while simple treatments are used to enhance the sense of entering a place. We believe this truly embodies our objective to show respect for history.\nSpecific to the building program, our inspiration and techniques are derived from pursuit of Chinese traditional culture, as re-establishment of culture and tradition awareness is the premise to avoid extinction of diversity.\nIn modern context, awareness of culture and tradition requires creative thinking; it can not exist by following inherent form, but conforming contemporary and future aesthetic features. With new form, traditional culture may revitalize, just as a butterfly emerges from its cocoon.\nBased on these, we strengthen visual artistic expression with contemporary minimalist style in the building process, and try to use abstract forms as metaphor for traditional culture, in order to avoid plainness and weakness caused by simple symbolic fragments. Water, bamboo, mountain, courtyard and so on, these things conveyed at the spiritual level closely related to traditional Chinese cultural conceptions are what we are pursuing and trying to create. Strolling inside and outside, culture is to be passed down and remain prosperous through the process of experiencing the building top-down.\nVisit the website of Mochen Architects & Engineers – here.\nPhotography by Shu He and Lin Mingshu","Situated in Barcelona, Spain, TR House (2015) by PMMT | The Hardt\nSituated in Barcelona, Spain, TR House (2015) by PMMT. TR House Barcelona is a single-family house with a compact morphology. Its shape is the answer to the limitations presented by the pre-existing conditions, combined with an innovative solution and with solid functionality criteria. In light of the urban planning constraints of this site and once it is situated on a depressed area, we had to solve an accentuated slope between the main entrance and the access to the house, creating two levels of access; one inferior and one intermediate. Trough slopes and ramps that establish different relations between the landscape, the house, and its interiors, we’ve tried to minimize the big impact of the gap between the main entrance and the lower part of the site.\nThe image of the building aims to respond to the defined functional needs. On one side, an outer envelope made of vitrified ceramic tiles, assembled on a stainless steel wired net, giving a response to the need to merge with the green surroundings. Within a range of greens, we’ve worked with four different tones to obtain de same shades that one observes on the surrounding landscape during the four seasons of the year, creating the required merging feeling. By this ceramic curtain, we were able to solve 4 plans that in architecture are normally solved in separate ways: the facade, the pergola, the curtain walls and the roof.\nThe outside platforms are stitched in a way that connects the different access areas located different heights, with a cobblestone ramp made with granite pieces interpolated with small grass areas. On the exterior side that is open to the landscape, a large wooden platform has a de function to lengthen the living/dining room area, extending it to the outside, creating a nice outer living space, under the shade of trees. This platform also gives access to the back part of the house, establishing an interesting circuit flow.\nDue to its morphology and topography, the trapezium-shaped site exposes a heavy slope on the tip that is closer to the creek. In this area, further away from the street, a playing area is generated. The pronounced slope is solved with a wooden platform sequence that establishes a dialogue between the house and the garden, once the platforms are made with the same type of chestnut wood that one can find on the facade. The proportion and disposition of the wooden pieces are the same, both on the facade and on the exterior platforms.Therefore, the TR House Barcelona represents an innovative fully-functional exercise that achieves a clear dialogue with its surroundings at the time as it gives an answer to the changing needs of its users.\nCheck out the mini-doc on the design and build process of this unbelievably beautiful house below.\nAesthetically and Geographically Related Projects:\n- Termitary House (2014) by Tropical Space\n- House in Koamicho by Suppose Design Office\n- Frame House (2012) by UID Architects & Associates\n- Tepozcuautla House (2015) by grupoarquitectura\n- House AB Barcelona (2015) by Built Architecture"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:4af3856f-e931-472d-8b7e-7bd8e44662c0>","<urn:uuid:aff7f80a-35e3-4b9c-9543-8481480b94fa>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the physical health benefits of dancing compared to those found in community-based social support exercise programs?","answer":"Dancing provides multiple physical health benefits including improved strength, flexibility, mobility and balance. Specifically for ballet, controlled movements help strengthen knees, ankles and feet, while arabesques build gluteal and core muscles. Studies show an hour of aerobic dance 2-3 times weekly is as effective as cycling or jogging for fitness and weight loss. In comparison, social support exercise programs demonstrated increased physical activity levels (44.2% median increase in time spent being active), improved fitness levels, and reduced body fat percentage. Both approaches appear effective at enhancing physical health through increased activity.","context":["You're never too old to benefit from taking up dancingby Ruth Nichol\nWhen Jackie Scannell hung up her ballet shoes 45 years ago, she assumed her dancing days were behind her.\nScannell, who lives in Central Hawke’s Bay, returned to the barre eight years ago. Since then, she has gradually built up her strength to the point where she is able to go en pointe (dance on her toes), something that even young dancers can find difficult.\nAs her teacher, Esther Juon, points out: “You have to be incredibly fit to do what Jackie has done.”\nSpending four hours a week at ballet classes hasn’t just made Scannell fitter, stronger and more flexible. It has also fixed a long-standing lower back problem, and given her a sense of satisfaction and achievement as well as providing what she describes as a workout for her brain.\n“The amount you use your brain is incredible, because you have to think about so many different things as you dance.”\nShe’s one of a small but growing number of so-called silver swans – mostly women who are returning to (or in some cases taking up) ballet later in life. Although they tend to range in age from their late teens to their early sixties, some are much older; according to a recent BBC report, the oldest ballerina at adult classes run by the Scottish Ballet was 102.\nA survey by Dance Aotearoa New Zealand (Danz) last year found there are two main reasons people return to or take up ballet as adults. The first is to improve their physical health and the second is to improve their mental health and sense of well-being.\n“It gives me strength and muscle tone,” said one respondent. “It makes my day feel better – I leave feeling good,” said another.\nIn October, the American Association of Orthopaedic Surgeons issued a statement recommending ballet as a way for people of all ages to improve mobility and build strength. Spokesperson Nicholas DiNubile – orthopaedic consultant to the Pennsylvania Ballet – said the artform provides flexibility, strength, core conditioning and agility training.\n“The controlled movements produced in ballet, such as demi-plies [knee bends with feet planted to the floor] and releves [toe raises], help to strengthen knees, ankles and feet. Arabesques [leg lifts to the rear] build gluteal and core muscles. Jumps help develop balance and agility.”\nHe said dancers are also much less likely than athletes who play ball sports to suffer the kind of knee injury that put All Black Aaron Cruden out of last year’s Rugby World Cup. That’s because, unlike athletes, dancers have rigorous training in how to jump and maintain balance.\nBallet is not the only kind of dance that can improve physical and mental health. Many kinds of dance provide similar benefits. A 1998 Japanese study, for example, found that an hour of aerobic dance training two to three times a week is just as effective for building fitness and losing weight as spending the same amount of time cycling or jogging.\nUS research published earlier this year found that two hour-long sessions a week of a specially created Latin dance programme helped improve the fitness of a group of sedentary Spanish-speaking Latinos aged 65 or older. The researchers are now looking at what effect dancing has on cognitive functioning.\nIn Britain, Oxford University researchers recently found that simply dancing in time with others increases people’s threshold for dealing with pain.\nNone of this comes as a surprise to Danz chief executive Anton Carter, who says dancing in its many forms – from ballroom to kapa haka – is much more popular than people realise, with an estimated 630,000 New Zealanders of all ages dancing regularly. “More people participate in dancing than play rugby or netball,” he says.\nHe describes dance as a bit of a health gold mine that is yet to be properly exploited.\n“On a personal level, people who dance regularly certainly understand the benefits and that’s why they do it, but the rest of society hasn’t yet clicked on.”\nDespite an apparent backlash against bread – against carbohydrates and gluten – the sandwich endures.Read more\nThe author of worldwide bestsellers Sapiens and Homo Deus says our free will is at stake.

Although several good measures have been developed, several issues remain to be addressed.\n- Reliable and valid measures are needed for the spectrum of physical activity. Rationale: Current measures are better for vigorous activity than for moderate or light activity.\n- Sedentary people are more likely to begin activity at a light level; this activity is often not captured by current measurement techniques.\n- Increased consensus about “best measures” for physical activity would help to increase comparability between studies and would facilitate assessment of effectiveness.\n- Note: This is not intended to preclude researchers’ latitude in choosing what aspects of physical activity to measure and to decide which measures are most appropriate for a particular study population. Perhaps a useful middle ground position would be the establishment of selected core measures that most researchers should use which could then be supplemented by additional measures. The duration of an intervention’s effect was often difficult to determine.\nEach recommended and strongly recommended intervention should be applicable in most relevant target populations and settings, assuming that appropriate attention is paid to tailoring. However, possible differences in the effectiveness of each intervention for specific subgroups of the population often could not be determined. Several questions about the applicability of these interventions in settings and populations other than those studied remain.\n- Are there significant differences in the effectiveness of these interventions, based on the level or scale of an intervention?\n- What are the effects of each intervention in various sociodemographic subgroups, such as age, gender, race, or ethnicity?\nOther Positive or Negative Effects\nThe studies included in this review did not report on other positive and negative effects of these interventions. Research on the following questions would be useful:\n- Do informational approaches to increasing physical activity help to increase health knowledge? Is it necessary to increase knowledge or improve attitudes toward physical activity to increase physical activity levels?\n- Do these approaches to increasing physical activity increase awareness of opportunities for and benefits of physical activity?\n- What are the most effective ways to maintain physical activity levels after the initial behavior change has occurred?\n- Are there other benefits from an intervention that might enhance its acceptability? For example, does increasing social support for physical activity carry over into an overall greater sense of community?\n- Are there any key harms?\n- Is anything known about whether or how approaches to physical activity could reduce potential harms (e.g., injuries or other problems associated with doing too much too fast)?\nThe available economic data were limited. Therefore, considerable research is warranted on the following questions:\n- What is the cost-effectiveness of each of these interventions?\n- How can effectiveness in terms of health outcomes or quality-adjusted health outcomes be better measured, estimated, or modeled?\n- How can the cost benefit of these programs be estimated?\n- How do specific characteristics of each of these approaches contribute to economic efficiency?\n- What combinations of components in multicomponent interventions are most cost-effective?\nResearch questions generated in this review include the following:\n- What are the physical or structural (environmental) barriers to implementing these interventions?\n- What resource (time and money) constraints prevent or hinder the implementation of these interventions?\n- In the typical intervention, volunteers were grouped to provide companionship and support to help each other reach self-selected activity goals. Study participants received phone calls from other participants and from study staff members to monitor progress and encourage them to continue their activities.\n- Some studies involved formal discussion groups to address barriers to exercise and negative perceptions about activity.\n- Studies were conducted in the United States (7 studies), Canada (1 study), and Australia (1 study).\n- Studies were offered in community settings, including community centers and churches (6 studies), a worksite (1 study), and a university (2 studies).\n- Six studies exclusively or primarily reported results for women, and three studies also included men in their study populations.\n- Study populations for most studies were middle-aged; one study included women aged 18 years or older, and one study focused on women ages 50 to 65 years.\n- Three studies restricted their populations to people who were sedentary at the beginning of the study; the rest included people at any initial level of activity.\nTask Force on Community Services.

{"question":"I want to start urban gardening. What are the basic requirements for growing plants, and what potential problems should I watch out for?","answer":"The basic requirements for urban gardening include adequate sunlight (ideally 5-6 hours daily, with south or southwest orientation), access to water for regular irrigation, and appropriate containers with good drainage. For water management, plants in containers need frequent but light watering, with daily watering needed in hot months and every five days in winter. As for potential problems to watch out for, these include: contaminated soils (especially lead contamination), ozone pollution from fossil fuels, water supply issues (both rainwater and municipal water may contain harmful pollutants), and human-related challenges like produce theft. It's also important to check if permits are required for activities like tearing up grass or building fences, and to consider the effects of concrete and pavement that can create excess heat in urban gardens.","context":["Today there is a concern to lead a healthy life, eat healthily and know the origin of the food we eat. These concepts have popularized the fashion of creating urban gardening ideas on the terrace or balcony. Next, we give you the keys to be able to carry it out without any problem.\nThere are foods that are worthwhile to grow in your urban garden. Vegetables grown in a particular garden will have a flavor that cannot be compared to those you can buy in a package. This is due to the lack of sunlight when they are maturing. They are harvested when they are green and mature in artificially lit chambers to be transported (long distances) to the consumer.\nFoods grown in an urban garden without chemical fertilizers or pesticides have the aroma and flavor of natural products in contact with nature. See grow plants and collect their fruits to provide great satisfaction and personal pride.\nWhere to develop urban gardening ideas?\nIt is essential that the plants receive sunlight, the ideal would be a continuous exposure, but if it is not possible at least they receive it from 5 to 6 hours. The advisable orientation is the south or southwest.\nSome leafy vegetables such as spinach, lettuce, chard, watercress, aromatic plants, adapt well and prefer semi-shaded areas. With 3 or 4 hours of sun they have enough. Strawberries and strawberries only need 2 or 3 hours of light in the morning. In case of not having enough solar lighting, you can create reflective surfaces that help increase it.\nIrrigation in the urban garden\nTo work with urban gardening ideas, the balcony or terrace must have a water tap, to fill the shower or install an automatic irrigation. If you do not have a tap, you can install a water tank with a programmer in which hoses with drippers will be attached.\nPlants that are grown in containers need more water than those that grow in the soil. You have to do frequent watering but with little water to avoid waterlogging. Make sure that the containers have good drainage. To the extent possible, avoid watering leaves and foliage to prevent fungal attack.\nYou should be aware of the weather, in the hot months the plants will need a daily watering, while in winter with one every five days will be sufficient. To check if you need water you just have to touch the earth, if there are traces stuck on your finger it is still wet, but you should water.\nChoose the right containers for urban gardening ideas\nYou can choose from a wide variety of containers, depending on the available space of your terrace or balcony.\nThe pots that you use for your plants can also be used to grow vegetables and aromatic plants. If you choose the model with water reserve, you will not have to worry about watering.\nThe culture boxes are suitable for growing aromatic plants, cherry tomatoes, peppers and leafy vegetables.\nIf you have enough space you can opt for cultivation tables. They are more comfortable because you do not have to bend over, suitable for species that do not grow in height: peppers and leafy vegetables.\nYou can create a vertical garden on your terrace or balcony with mini gardens. They are polypropylene containers, a material that is very resistant to the weather. You can grow aromatic plants, lettuce, strawberries…\nChoose the substrate for your crops\nA good substrate makes the plant grow healthy and develop bearing good fruit. The most recommended is that which is composed of coconut fiber and earthworm humus because it is spongy, light and has porosity to have the nutrients. It is advisable to pay with compost regularly.\nChoose simple crops to develop urban gardening ideas\nTo get started in the urban garden, it is better to start with simple crops. When you have gained experience you can incorporate other species.\nIt is one of the most appreciated products. They need a lot of sun and heat to ripen well, in addition to constant watering. You will need support where you can tie it to develop in height. There are tomato species that do not need it like cherry.\nIt is one of the most grateful vegetables because they grow fast and you can plant them in all seasons.\nIt is planted in the month of May and begins to bear fruit in the summer months. There is a wide variety of sizes, spicy, sweet … It is a perfect vegetable to grow in an urban garden.\nIt can be grown every month of the year. They need a deep soil to grow and develop well.\nIt is a resistant vegetable that can be grown all year round.\nIt is one of the vegetables for hard and cold resistant. If the plants in the summer months you can harvest their fruits in winter.\nVegetable short cycle. You just have to wait a month for the harvest. It needs frequent watering and a fertile land.\nAromatic and culinary plants.\nYou can grow from parsley, oregano, basil, thyme, chives, and coriander. For the mint, it must be grown in separate containers because they are very expansive.\nWhat do you think of these tips of urban gardening ideas to create an urban garden? I hope you find it useful to turn your terrace or balcony into a special garden.","Growing produce in your own backyard or a community garden can be an amazing experience that allows you to not only choose the produce you consume, but have control of the process from seed to harvest. Issues affecting urban gardens aren’t usually at front of mind when you decide it’s time to open up the soil in your yard or rent a garden plot, but there’s a lot more to consider than just where to buy your seeds.\nProblems with Urban Gardens\nMost urban garden problems aren’t readily apparent when you first dig the soil, but they are very real. Here are some of the most common things to consider before you plant:\nPermits. Depending on where your garden is located, you may need a permit for tearing up the grass, building a fence or keeping urban livestock like chickens, bees and goats. Check with your local municipality before putting in the garden of your dreams to avoid finding out the hard way that it’s not allowed. A lot of urban gardening problems can be prevented by procuring the right permits the first time.\nThe human element. We all want to assume that our neighbors are both helpful and supportive of our garden efforts, but that’s not always the truth. It’s a good idea to talk to neighbors before starting a front yard garden and to erect a fence where there’s a lot of foot traffic. Produce theft is a real thing and happens to disappointed urban gardeners everywhere.\nSun protection. Urban community gardens are especially susceptible to problems with sunscald and radiant heat because many are constructed in areas littered with plenty of concrete, pavement and large structures. When these surfaces warm up through the day, they can literally hold onto the heat for hours and cook your plants well beyond nightfall.\nContaminated soils. Even if the soil in your urban garden is healthy and rich, it may be hiding secret contamination from the past. Lead contamination is by far the biggest risk, and although most vegetable plants won’t uptake lead into their systems, it can be a problem if you don’t wash produce thoroughly or a child eats the soil in the garden. Having a soil test for heavy metals is good practice before you get to gardening.\nOzone. Burning gasoline and other fossil fuels can result in ozone pollution near the ground. Although there’s little you can do to protect plants from this hazard, knowing ozone is a problem can help direct your gardening efforts. Ozone-resistant garden plants are being developed, but aren’t available to the public yet. Until then, you may want to move gardens to areas further away from roads and sources of pollution.\nWater supply. Rainwater gardening is romantic and earthy, but not every area has rainwater that’s safe to use for gardening. Pollutants can concentrate in rainwater in urban areas, injuring plants and causing potential harm to gardeners. Municipal water may also be suspect, depending on native minerals and additives, like fluoride, which can hurt sensitive plants. Accessing useable water can be a trick in some areas, especially where drought and water rationing are common. Plan ahead for water long before you start to plant."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:d5daa00c-c367-4519-98e7-ed3bbd40c18c>","<urn:uuid:08ac9338-96d1-4325-a16f-720d0cbea998>"],"error":null}
{"question":"As someone interested in sea turtle conservation, what are the main threats facing sea turtle nests in Tybee Island compared to Boca Grande, and what protection measures are in place?","answer":"In Tybee Island, the main concern is light pollution, which is addressed through the 'Lights Out on Tybee' program requiring beachfront lights to be turned off by 10 p.m. In Boca Grande, predators pose a significant threat, including birds, crabs, ants, bobcats, raccoons, coyotes, and unleashed dogs on the beach, with reports of ongoing coyote/bobcat destructive activity. Both locations have protection measures in place: Tybee Island has DNR-trained volunteers who monitor and mark nests daily, while Boca Grande has the Sea Turtle Association volunteers who patrol and protect nests. Both locations emphasize the importance of keeping beaches clean, avoiding nest disturbance, and maintaining proper distance from nesting areas.","context":["Everything You Need to Know About Sea Turtle Nesting Season on Tybee Island\nDuring the day, the beach is filled with sunbathers, sand castles and sunshine, but at night, sea turtles make their way out of the Atlantic to begin nesting.\nSea turtle nesting season is a special time for Tybee Island. Loggerhead sea turtles and occasionally their cousins crawl onto our beaches to lay their precious eggs. We understand that nesting season is a fascinating experience, so we've broken it down and compiled a list of everything you may need to know about turtle nesting season on Tybee Island.\nWHEN DOES SEA TURTLE NESTING BEGIN?\nNesting season begins May 1st and typically ends at the end of October. During this time, the program \"Lights Out on Tybee\" is in effect. To avoid turtle disorientation, please make sure to turn off beachfront lights by 10 p.m., avoid the use of cell phones and only use red flashlights on the beach.\nTurtle Tip: Create your own red light by using a red magic marker to color the tip of your flashlight. After turtle season, you can easily wipe it off and return to using your flashlight regularly.\nWHAT KIND OF SEA TURTLES NEST ON TYBEE ISLAND?\nLoggerheads are the most common sea turtles along the Georgia coast with rare appearances by green sea turtles, leatherbacks and Kemp Ridley turtles.\nWHEN DOES THE MOTHER LOGGERHEAD LAY THEIR EGGS?\nFemale loggerheads crawl out of the ocean at night to nest. They make their way up just past the high tide line and dig a deep round hole using their two rear flippers. The mother then lays her eggs in the hole and covers it back up with sand before leaving.\nTurtle Tip: Adult loggerheads weigh more than 200 pounds, which causes them to be slow moving making the entire nesting process over an hour long.\nHOW DO YOU KNOW WHERE THEIR NESTS ARE?\nEvery morning, DNR trained and permitted volunteers from the Tybee Sea Turtle Project walk the beach to look for new nests. They search for specific \"sea turtle crawls\", which are the tracks left by the mothers when searching for a spot. Once they find a nest, they rope it off and mark it, so people do not disturb it.\nTurtle Tip: Loggerhead sea turtles are endangered, and it is illegal to disturb their nests.\nHOW MANY EGGS DO THEY LAY?\nThey typically lay 80 to 120 ping pong-sized eggs.\nHOW LONG UNTIL THEY HATCH?\nThey typically incubate for 55 to 60 days before they hatch. They hatch in unison and make their way toward the water using the reflection of the moon and stars on the water for guidance.\nTurtle Tip: They crawl in groups for their safety to overwhelm waiting predators.\nDO THE MOTHERS OR FATHERS COME BACK TO CHECK ON THE EGGS?\nInterestingly, male sea turtles almost never return to land after being hatched. So, mothers come ashore along to nest, and once she returns to the water, she never comes back.\nHOW CAN WE HELP PROTECT THEM?\nTo ensure a safe turtle nesting season, please clean up any trash you see on the beach, avoid sea turtle nests, obey the Lights Out on Tybee program and level out sandcastles and holes.\nIf you are interested in seeing a sea turtle up close, the Tybee Island Marine Science Center is home to a loggerhead named Admiral, who serves as their Marine Debris Ambassador. The center offers valuable marine education and programs to keep our island informed and safe.","Boca Grande Sea Turtle Association volunteers are reporting damage left from Tropical Storm Hermine, as well as several more incidents regarding predators interfering with sea turtle nests and hatchlings recently.\nAccording to one patroller, as of Thursday afternoon, Sept. 1, there were only 22 nests left. About 19 of those were in constant washover and many others left in standing water. That was three hours prior to high tide. One patroller did have a good experience, though. “\nIt was a very exciting (Thursday) morning for turtle patrol on Gasparilla Island,” said volunteer Carol McDonald Forrester. “We braved the remnants of Hermine – strong winds, very high surging surf, wading through deep, murky puddles – to excavate a green sea turtle nest before the surf washed it away. How lucky for us! There was a pretty good hatch from the nest, but only one sole survivor. He’ll spend the day with us in his sand bucket and we’ll release him tonight. Our beaches and turtle nests have taken a significant hit, so we felt we had to do everything we could to preserve this hatch.”\nTurtle patrol volunteer Melissa Csank released 58 baby loggerhead hatchlings on the beach at the Boca Grande Club on Wednesday evening. All of them made it into the water successfully.\nHatchlings face many predators, both on their way to the water and once they get into the ocean. On the beach, birds, crabs, ants, bobcats, raccoons and coyotes and even unleashed dogs are common threats to nests and newly hatched turtles. Once in the ocean, they face a host of marine predators until they reach adulthood. “Predator activity increases as hatching season begins, and there have been a few nests that have been opened or dug up by predators this season. Raccoon, coyote and bobcat tracks have been reported. Typically, less than 20 eggs (of nests with approximately 100 eggs) are taken; however, once opened, birds and ants can infiltrate the nest and cause even more destruction,” Csank said. One volunteer said ongoing coyote/bobcat destructive activity has been a problem in Zone 1 on the island for weeks now. Canine tracks have also been spotted around nesting areas. Dog owners are asked to please keep your pets on leashes at all times on the beach.\n“There were several more predations last week. One nest in zone number 31 was a hatch about to happen. There were lots of partly hatched babies crushed as a result.” Coyotes continue to be a threat, but the invasions cannot be stopped because the animals are indigenous to the area. Another volunteer spotted two bobcats on the beach in one week: a rare occurrence, she said, after 36 years of living in Boca Grande.\n“It concerns me that there might be a lot of offspring left here, with no natural predators populating our area. I also fear for my dogs.”\nIf you find hatchlings on the beach, it is recommended that you let them crawl to the ocean on their own, maintain a safe distance, and make sure lights are off so hatchlings don’t become disoriented. Do not remove them from the nest. If they are wandering away from the ocean or found during the day with birds circling, call the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission at 888-404-FWCC for assistance.\nAs of August 26, the Association reported 784 Loggerhead (caretta caretta) turtle nests and 6 green sea (chelonia mydas) turtle nests on the island.

{"question":"In terms of team involvement, how do Ishikawa sessions compare to risk management team meetings described in the medical device context?","answer":"Ishikawa sessions emphasize positive team collaboration through brainstorming to identify root causes, while risk management team meetings in the medical device context can create apprehension among team members, with engineers and risk management teams sometimes dreading FMEA sessions due to their tendency to get bogged down in detailed investigations of minor issues, potentially preventing important issues from receiving proper attention.","context":["Ishikawa diagrams are also referred to as fish-bone (due to their shape and structure), or cause and effect diagrams. A fish-bone diagram is a commonly used quality tool and\nmethod with the aim of finding the root cause of a problem.\nThe basic theory and principle of the fish-bone diagram was established in the '60s, by Kaoru Ishikawa, a Japanese professor and\ninnovator, who deeply participated in Japan’s\ninitiatives after the 2nd World War, with the support of Deming and Juran.\nDr. Ishikawa found out, that the causes of fundamental problems can be summarized more easily if they are categorized in a pre-defined structure. As each defect is a result of\none or the correlation of more defect causes, the Ishikawa diagram is a logic tool that is able to visualize the defect categories, and even their interaction as well.\nThe setup of an Ishikawa analysis starts with the clear structuring of potential root causes\nIshikawa is a team work, best if used during brainstorming.\nThe structure of the fish-bone is simple:\n- 1) The head of the fish is always the precisely defined fundamental problem (effect of the failure). Important as always: the precise problem description is inevitable.\n- 2) After stating the fundamental problem, we go along the spine of the fish. The spine will be the manifold link between the cause categories and the fundamental problem.\n- 3) Several bones, ribs are attached to the spine, these will be the categories or groups of failure causes (see 7M below). The team collects all influencing factors that has any relation to the fundamental\n- 4) The best in the Ishikawa diagram is that further bones (sub-causes) can be attached to the upper level bones, and so on, so the tool flawlessly visualizes the cause-effect relationship.\n- 5) As soon as all possible root causes are filled into the fish-bone structure, the team has to include those ones that could cause, and exclude the ones that could not cause the particular failure.\nThis inclusion and exclusion is not based simply on theory, but happens with proofs and evidences by the verification and reproduction of the failure mode.\nThe major cause categories (7M) are considered during the elaboration of an Ishikawa analysis:\n- Man: all failures that can be linked to the people and human factors.\n- Method: means the causes that are originated from the production method, procedures, regulations, etc.\n- Machine: the causes coming from the machinery and equipment.\n- Material: all raw materials and sub-assemblies that are used for producing the final good.\n- Environment (milieu): the failure causes, coming from the environment specific factors, such as time, shift, temperature, humidity, etc.\n- Measurement: our measurement, data collection and control methods that might be having effect or impact on our production. This is a category, which is usually forgotten, but very important.\n- Management: organizational and management related causes.\nThe structure of the Fish-Bone diagram (Ishikawa) (Source: qMindset.com)\nOn top of the 7M cause categories, some organizations also consider the effects of Maintenance, as a separated root cause category.\nBenefits of Ishikawa:\n- Exploration of possible root causes.\n- With its predefined 5M or 7M structure, we can easily see if we missed to consider a failure cause category (e.g. \"we have not evaluated the possible causes originated from the materials and the\n- The fish-bone diagram is a visual tool, so gives a much more transparent view, than many other methodologies.\n- Helps to pre-filter the major root cause possibilities for further deep analysis.\n- Can easily be integrated into a deeper analysis framework (like 6Sigma), and can be attached to other quality tools, such as\nIshikawa is not only tool that can be used for reactive problem solving\n, but also for a proactive\ndefect prevention analysis during the product- and process design.\nFor deeper technical problems, the joint use of Ishikawa and 5Why is very effective.

One reason that they may not be eager to click “Accept” is that these sessions can quickly devolve into detailed investigations of issues of negligible severity or probability of occurrence. The time devoted to these issues soaks up the team’s time and energy – to the point that important issues may not receive the attention they deserve.\nWithout a mature product line or medical device risk management system, small or start-up device companies may have the opposite problem. There, the list of hazards being considered may be limited to those issues that are most obvious to the design team and may not provide a comprehensive assessment of device risks. Instead of an overly detailed analysis, these companies run the risk of not going deep enough.\nThis article presents an approach that device companies have successfully implemented to focus their risk management activities and help to ensure the safety and efficacy of their products.\nWhere to start? – System Boundaries\nThe key to identifying priorities is to first establish a clear scope for the analysis by defining the system boundaries. How you go about defining system boundaries depends on the type of analysis being conducted. Perform a gap assessment on the device information: what do you know and what is not known? A process flow diagram is typically best at assessing a process or the usage, like the human factors impacting the device; however, a list of materials (e.g., a bill-of-material or list of sub-systems) is typically best when assessing risks associated with the product design.\nTypically, it is best to start big and work down into the details. For example, if you have a device that is designed to be used with other devices, you should begin your assessment by looking at the whole system so that you will be able to consider how your device interacts with the other parts of the integrated system and what new risks may arise when your device is integrated into the system.\nBy saying “start big,” we mean that the focus of your analysis will change as you progress through the Design and Development process. As you move from concept to detailed design to design transfer, you will learn more about the function and features of your device and the process that you will use to manufacture the device. The boundaries of your analysis will transition from system-wide assessments of broad hazards to potentially detailed analyses of high-risk subsystems and user interactions.\nThe boundaries of the analysis should be clearly described in the risk management plan (RMP) for the device. Your RMP should be updated prior to beginning a new Design and Development phase to identify the types of analysis and system boundaries that will be assessed in the next stage(s) of the process.\nThe boundaries are set, now what? – Look for Hot Spots\nOnce the boundaries of the system are defined, the next step is to identify the elements of the system that require focused attention. The guidance that supports ISO 14971:2019 (TR 24971) provides some helpful direction for focusing risk assessments that is appropriate for all devices. Annex A, Identification of hazards and characteristics related to safety, contains a list of questions intended to help the risk analysis team characterize potential safety impacts of their device.\nBut your consideration of potential risks shouldn’t be limited to this list. The authors of the standard are careful to state that “these lists are neither exhaustive nor representative of all medical devices, and the manufacturer is advised to add questions that can have applicability to the particular medical device and to skip questions that are not relevant. There will be different risks for wearable medical devices, internet connected medical devices (cybersecurity), software as a medical device, a general medical instrument and an in vitro diagnostic. The manufacturer is also advised to consider each question not only on its own but also in relation to others.” Answering these questions in addition to researching the types of problems that occur with similar devices is good “homework” for the risk team because it can help to identify the types of analyses that need to be performed.\nThe standard also contains examples of hazards that “could ultimately result in harm” (Table C.1). This list can help remind the team to consider categories of hazards that may not be top-of-mind. Other resources (e.g., previous risk analyses and product complaints for similar devices, the FDA’s MAUDE database, other relevant risk standards/ guidance documents, etc.) can also be used to identify potential hazards.\nOnce you’ve established a list of potential hazards, the key step (that not all manufacturers take) is to identify how they relate to the system elements of your device (the elements in the system boundary that you previously defined). By making this explicit link between the system elements and the potential hazards, you will have a much better sense of where your efforts should be focused. To illustrate this process, below is a simplified table showing the relationship between a list of hazards and the major components of an infusion pump.\nFrom this very simplified view, we are illustrating how (even at the earliest stages of the process) priorities can be established to guide subsequent analyses. From this prioritization, the Electronic Controls were found to be the highest priority (three “Highs”). The team can now establish a plan to address each System Element in priority order. In addition, you also have an indication of the types of analysis to conduct. For Electronic Controls, the initial focus can be placed on design analyses to ensure safety from electrical shorts and shocks, and usage analyses to understand how best to minimize the potential for user errors (a usability study may be in your future).\nAt this stage of the analysis, most risk teams will jump directly to their FMEAs. The problem with this approach is that while you’ve done a good job of prioritizing where to focus your attention, you can still get lost in the details of the high priority elements (there are a lot of components and coding in\n“electrical controls”). In the next article, we will address how conducting a Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) at this stage of the process (before you begin your FMEA) can significantly improve your understanding of your device’s risks and greatly simplify and focus your FMEAs.\nMEDIcept … Trusted Solutions, Rapid Response …\nMEDIcept Inc. is an international consulting firm specializing in medical device, IVD, and biotechnology Regulatory, Quality, and Clinical Services.

{"question":"I'm studying historical changes in government power - how did the framers' views on limiting government authority compare to the evolution of voting rights restrictions?","answer":"The framers were concerned with limiting governmental authority to prevent abuse of power, as Madison noted 'all men having power ought to be distrusted to a certain degree.' However, they did not place specific economic limitations on government power. In contrast, voting rights evolved through explicit restrictions - even after the 19th Amendment granted women's suffrage in 1920, many groups like Native Americans (until 1924), Chinese Americans (until 1943), and women of color faced various voting restrictions through mechanisms like poll taxes and literacy tests until the 1965 Voting Rights Act eliminated many of these barriers.","context":["- Historic Sites\nThe Constitution: Was It An Economic Document?\nA leading American historian challenges the long-entrenched interpretation originated by the late Charles A. Beard\nDecember 1958 | Volume 10, Issue 1\nNor were there other specific limitations of an economic character upon the powers of the new government that was being erected on the ruins of the old. The framers properly gave the Congress power to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the states. The term commerce—as Hamilton and Adair (and Crosskey, too!) have made clear—was broadly meant, and the grant of authority, too, was broad. The framers gave Congress the power to levy taxes and, again, wrote no limitations into the Constitution except as to the apportionment of direct taxes; it remained for the most conservative of Courts to reverse itself, and common sense, and discover that the framers had intended to forbid an income tax! Today, organizations that invoke the very term “constitutional” are agitating for an amendment placing a quantitative limit upon income taxes that may be levied; fortunately, Madison’s generation understood better the true nature of governmental power.\nThe framers gave Congress—in ambiguous terms, to be sure—authority to make “all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property” of the United States, and provided that “new states may be admitted.” These evasive phrases gave little hint of the heated debates in the Convention over western lands. Those who delight to find narrow and undemocratic sentiments in the breasts of the framers never cease to quote a Gouverneur Morris or an Elbridge Gerry on the dangers of the West, and it is possible to compile a horrid catalogue of such statements. But what is significant is not what framers said, but what they did. They did not place any limits upon the disposition of western territory, or establish any barriers against the admission of western states.\nThe fact is that we look in vain in the Constitution itself for any really effective guarantee for property or any effective barriers against what Beard calls “the reach of popular majorities.”\nIt will be argued, however, that what the framers feared was the states, and that the specific prohibitions against state action, together with the broad transfer of economic powers from state to nation, were deemed sufficient guarantee against state attacks upon property. As for the national government, care was taken to make that sufficiently aristocratic, sufficiently the representative of the propertied classes, and sufficiently checked and limited so that it would not threaten basic property interests.\nIt is at this juncture that the familiar principle of limitation on governmental authority commands our attention. Granted the wisest distribution of powers among governments, what guarantee was there that power would be properly exercised? What guarantees were there against the abuse of power? What assurance was there that the large states would not ride roughshod over the small, that majorities would not crush minorities or minorities abuse majorities? What protection was there against mobs, demagogues, dangerous combinations of interests or of states? What protection was there for the commercial interest, the planter interest, the slave interest, the securities interests, the land speculator interests?\nIt was Madison who most clearly saw the real character of this problem and who formulated its solution. It was not that the people as such were dangerous; “The truth was,” he said on July 11, “that all men having power ought to be distrusted to a certain degree.” Long before Lord Acton coined the aphorism, the Revolutionary leaders had discovered that power corrupts. They understood, too, the drive for power on the part of individuals and groups. All this is familiar to students of The Federalist, No. 10. It should be familiar to students of the debates in Philadelphia, for there, too, Madison set forth his theory and supported it with a wealth of argument. Listen to him on one of the early days of the Convention, June 6, when he is discussing the way to avoid abuses of republican liberty—abuses which “prevailed in the largest as well as the smallest [states] …”\n… And were we not thence admonished [he continued] to enlarge the sphere as far as the nature of the Government would admit. This was the only defence against the inconveniences of democracy consistent with the democratic form of Government [our italics]. All civilized Societies would be divided into different Sects, Factions & interests, as they happened to consist of rich & poor, debtors and creditors, the landed, the manufacturing, the commercial interests, the inhabitants of this district or that district, the followers of this political leader or that political leader, the disciples of this religious Sect or that religious Sect. In all cases where a majority are united by a common interest or passion, the rights of the minority are in danger.… In a Republican Govt. the Majority if united have always an opportunity [to oppress the minority. What is the remedy?] The only remedy is to enlarge the sphere, & thereby divide the community into so great a number of interests & parties, that in the first place a majority will not be likely at the same moment to have a common interest separate from that of the whole or of the minority; and in the second place, that in case they should have such an interest, they may not be apt to unite in the pursuit of it. It was incumbent on us then to try this remedy, and … to frame a republican system on such a scale & in such a form as will controul all the evils which have been experienced.","An Overview of the 19th AmendmentIn 1848 women and men met in Seneca Falls, New York to advance the cause for women’s rights. The convention, organized by Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Lucretia Mott, Martha Wright, Mary Ann M'Clintock, and Jane Hunt marked the beginning of a formal women’s suffrage movement. The men and women of the movement made speeches and petitioned Congress, pressuring government officials to recognize the woman’s right to vote. Stanton, Mott, and suffrage advocate Susan B. Anthony did not live to see women get the right to vote. Instead, they paved the way for future suffragists like Alice Paul, Ida B. Wells, and Mabel Ping-Hua Lee.\nThe women leading the women’s suffrage movement were not always unified. Some suffragists thought only white women should exercise their right to vote. Others like Charlotte Forten Grimke, Mary Ann Shadd Cary, and Mary Church Terrell knew women of color also had a right to participate in electing government officials.\nThe first constitutional amendment to secure votes for women was introduced to congress in 1878. It failed. By 1919, suffragists get another amendment introduced to congress that would secure women's right to vote. The 19th Amendment passed both the House and Senate. The states ratified the 19th Amendment in 1920, officially recognizing women’s right to vote.\nWhile many women were able to head to the polls, the amendment did not give voting rights to all women. Women of color, immigrants, and lower income women were often deterred from voting by laws and social pressure. For example, Native American women were not considered US citizens until 1924 and were not permitted to vote. Women who were convicted of a crime were also unable to vote, even if they completed their sentence.\nAfter the ratification of the 19th Amendment in 1920, suffragists like Alice Paul knew that their work was not finished. While the government recognized women’s right to vote, many women still faced discrimination. Paul and other members of the National Woman’s Party drafted the Equal Rights Amendment. If ratified, the amendment would guarantee equal rights to all people regardless of their gender. The Equal Rights Amendment was ratified by both houses of Congress in the 1970s but failed to get adequate support from the states. It has not yet been ratified to the Constitution.\nWomen’s rights advocates did make progress in passing other legislation after 1920. Congress passed the Equal Pay Act in 1963, making it illegal to pay a woman less for doing the same job as a man. A year later, Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964. This act is often associated with the Civil Rights Movement as it prohibits employers from discriminating against an individual based on their race. The act also states that employers cannot discriminate against someone based on their gender. Before the Civil Rights Act of 1964, employers could choose not to hire a woman because of her gender.\nA Brief Timeline of the 19th Amendment\n- July 1848- The first Woman’s Rights Convention takes place in Seneca Falls. Suffrage is part of the resulting Declaration of Sentiments\n- February 3, 1870- The 15th Amendment is ratified, guaranteeing the right to vote regardless of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.\n- January 1878- A women’s suffrage amendment is introduced to Senate. It fails in 1887.\n- 1914- Another women’s suffrage amendment is introduced. It also fails.\n- 1918- The 19th Amendment passes the House and then fails in the Senate by 2 votes.\n- February 10, 1919- The 19th Amendment fails in the Senate by 1 vote.\n- May 21, 1919- The 19th Amendment passes in the House.\n- June 4, 1919- The 19th Amendment passes in the Senate.\n- June 10, 1919- Wisconsin and Michigan are the first states to ratify the 19th Amendment.\n- August 18, 1920- Tennessee is the 36th State to ratify the 19th Amendment law, passing the three-fourths threshold requirement for the amendment to become law.\n- August 26, 1920- The 19th Amendment is adopted as part of the US Constitution.\nVoting Rights After the 19th Amendment\nThe 19th Amendment did not guarantee that all women and men in the United States could vote. Securing this essential right has been an long struggle, that for some, continues on to this day.\n1924, Indian Citizenship Act- Native Americans deemed US citizens, but states continue to decide who votes. Many continue to disenfranchise Native Americans.\n1943, Magnuson Act- Chinese in America granted the right to become citizens, and therefore to vote (the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 previously prevented this)\n1962- Utah is the last state to enfranchise Native Americans.\n1965, Voting Rights Act- African Americans and Native Americans continued to face exclusion from voting through mechanisms like poll taxes, literacy tests, and intimidation.

{"question":"Which condition offers more treatment options - Crigler-Najjar syndrome or kidney failure requiring dialysis?","answer":"Crigler-Najjar syndrome has more diverse treatment options. These include light therapy (phototherapy), blood transfusions, liver transplants (for type 1), and medication (phenobarbital for type 2). In comparison, kidney failure patients requiring dialysis have two main treatment paths: either regular dialysis (which can be done through hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis, at home or in centers) or getting a kidney transplant to survive.","context":["- hard to wake up\n- unable to sleep\n- unable to urinate or defecate\n- athetoid cerebral palsy (a form of cerebral palsy involving involuntary movement of the hands, arms, and legs)\n- hearing loss\n- vision problems\n- intellectual disability\nCrigler-Najjar syndrome (CNS) is an inherited disease in which bilirubin (a pigment produced in the liver during the breakdown of red blood cells) cannot be properly broken down by the liver. In CNS, a specific enzyme responsible for the breakdown of bilirubin malfunctions.\nAccording to Genetics Home Reference, a publication of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), CNS is an extremely rare disorder seen in only one of every 1,000,000 births (GeneticsHomeReference, 2012).\nThere are two types of CNS: type 1 and type 2. Type 1 (early-onset CNS) is a severe form of the disorder and most patients do not survive childhood. Type 2 (late-onset CNS) is less severe and many patients with this form survive into adulthood.\nEnzymes are proteins that are essential to the normal functioning of many body systems and the chemical reactions that regulate the body’s many systems. In CNS, the enzyme that typically breaks down bilirubin fails to work adequately, causing the bilirubin to build up in the body.\nCrigler-Najjar is an inherited disease. If either of your parents or any grandparents had CNS, you are more likely to develop the condition. You must inherit a defective gene from both parents to get the severe form.\nAs bilirubin builds up, the skin and eyes turn yellow, leading to a condition known as jaundice. This yellowing is usually apparent at birth or soon after and is the most visible and striking sign of CNS. The yellowing often becomes more pronounced as bilirubin increases.\nIn addition to yellowed skin and eyes, a baby with jaundice may be:\nUntreated jaundice causes kernicterus. Kernicterus is a form of brain damage, which can lead to:\nSeek medical attention immediately if your child shows any signs of jaundice or possible CNS.\nSeveral factors play a part in diagnosing CNS. Your doctor could run several tests and ask questions about family history to make the correct diagnosis.\nYour doctor may use your past medical history, family history, and a blood test to determine if the condition is present. A blood sample can be checked for the presence of bilirubin. The bilirubin in the blood is measured to determine if CNS is present.\nIn infants, an initial bilirubin test is administered using a light meter. By holding the light meter to a child’s head, a nurse can check the bilirubin levels present in the skin. A high bilirubin result is usually indicative of jaundice. If the level is high, the doctor will likely order a blood test.\nOther tests that may be used to measure bilirubin or the functioning of the liver include a liver biopsy (a small piece of the liver is removed and examined under a microscope) and an enzyme assay (measurement of enzyme activity).\nThere are multiple possible courses of treatment for CNS. The foremost treatments are described in the following sections.\nThe most common treatment for babies with CNS is light therapy, also known as phototherapy. This noninvasive procedure exposes the child’s skin to blue light to prevent or treat yellowing of the skin. This treatment is more successful in children, due to their skin being much thinner. Thin skin makes it easier for light to be absorbed. Adults have thicker skin that does not allow light to be as readily absorbed.\nIn serious cases, a blood transfusion may be necessary to remove excess bilirubin from your bloodstream. A blood transfusion works by removing a measured amount of blood through one tube, while feeding fresh blood into your body through another tube. It is typically done in an outpatient setting and takes one to two hours.\nPeople with early-onset (type 1) CNS may find success in having a liver transplant. However, this option isn’t successful in people with late-onset CNS.\nPeople with late-onset CNS may be treated using a drug called phenobarbital. This medication is normally prescribed to people who suffer from seizures, but it is also prescribed to treat the symptoms of CNS. This is a habit-forming drug, so it is usually used under close monitoring by your doctor.\nPatients with type 2 (late-onset) CNS have a better outlook. People with type 2 CNS do not suffer significant organ damage. However, they may develop jaundice.\nChildren with type 1 CNS need lifelong treatment for this syndrome. If they survive, children with this form of the syndrome typically have significant brain damage as adults.","By removing the waste and extra fluid from your blood, dialysis does the work your kidneys no longer can do. Once people with chronic kidney disease reach stage 5, or kidney failure, they must undergo dialysis regularly or get a kidney transplant to survive.\nMany people do dialysis three times a week as an outpatient at a dialysis center – Puget Sound Kidney Centers operates six such centers in counties north of Seattle. But for some people, being tied to a center isn’t ideal. If you’re looking for a little more freedom and flexibility with dialysis, home dialysis might be right for you.\nBenefits of home dialysis\nIn 2010, the Medical Education Institute asked nephrologists in the U.S., ‘If you had kidney failure and had to wait five years for a transplant, which type of dialysis would you choose?’ An overwhelming majority – 91 percent in fact – said they’d do a type of home dialysis rather than dialyzing in a kidney center.\nThe benefits of home dialysis include:\n- More flexibility. Home dialysis gives you more freedom with dialysis, allowing you to create a flexible dialysis schedule, making it easier for you to work and travel. Overall, home dialysis often means less interruption in your daily life.\n- The ability to take control of your kidney health. With home dialysis, you’re really in control of your kidney health. You work with your nephrologist to put together a plan for dialysis, fitting it in around work or other regular activities. You decide if you’d like to dialyze at night, you put your own needles in (or have a care partner help you) if you do hemodialysis at home and you keep your own treatment logs.\n- The option to have more dialysis and thus feel better. It’s simple – most people feel better with more dialysis treatments. Your kidneys used to work 24 hours a day, seven days a week. With dialysis in a center, you would likely receive the standard three treatments a week, each about four hours. That means your kidneys are only working 12 hours a week, or half a day instead of the seven days they were working back when they were healthy. With home dialysis, you have the opportunity to give yourself more dialysis, which leaves most people feeling a lot like they did before they get sick.\nHow does home dialysis work?\nHemodialysis uses a filter, called a dialyzer, a dialysis machine and rinsing fluid, called dialysate, to clean your blood of wastes and remove extra fluid. In a dialysis center, the hemodialysis machines is quite large – at home, you’ll have a much smaller machine. Most home dialysis machines weigh about 75 pounds and can fit on a bedside table or nightstand.\nIf you choose to do hemodialysis at home, you will most likely have one of the following schedules:\n1. Dialyze five days a week, for about three hours at a time.\n2. Dialyze overnight, while you sleep, three or more days a week.\nIf you and your doctor decide hemodialysis at home is right for you, you’ll undergo training at one of our centers to learn how to give yourself treatments at home.\nTo learn more about hemodialysis at home, contact our home department at 425-259-5195.\nWith peritoneal dialysis, or PD, your own body acts as a filter. First, to prepare for PD treatments, a surgeon will place a tube, called a PD catheter, in your abdominal cavity. Several weeks after the minor surgery, you’ll be able to start PD treatments. During a PD treatment, called an ‘exchange,’ cleansing fluid (dialysate) is placed in your abdominal cavity to draw out waste and extra fluid from the blood. After a period of time, usually two to three hours, the dialysate containing waste and extra fluid is drained and replaced with new, clean dialysate.\nThese ‘exchanges’ can either be done during the day by hand or with a machine overnight.\nIf you choose to do PD, you will most likely have one of the following schedules:\n1.

Get a fistula.\nConsidered the gold standard for hemodialysis access, a fistula is a device placed in your body, usually your arm, that connects a vein and an artery. This makes regular dialysis treatments possible. A fistula takes several months to mature so if possible, plan ahead and get one placed before you need to start dialysis. If you need to start dialysis sooner, your doctor might suggest a graft or a catheter as your dialysis access. Both these accesses allow for repeat dialysis; however, the chance of infection with both a graft and a catheter is higher. When possible, make a plan with your doctor to get a fistula, the safest hemodialysis access, placed.\n2. Undergo training.\nTo learn how to give yourself hemodialysis treatments at home, you’ll undergo training at one of our centers. Training typically takes about four to six weeks. You’ll learn how to put your own needles in, order supplies and keep treatment logs.\n1. Get a peritoneal dialysis catheter.\nTo do PD, you need an access. A surgeon will place a peritoneal dialysis catheter, a thin tube, in your abdominal cavity. This surgery is usually done as an outpatient. Your PD access will stick out a bit, near your belly button, but is easily hidden by clothes. After about a week, you’ll be able to start learning how to give yourself PD treatments.\n2.

( The option to mark ' * ' is required )","Indoor Farming and the Age of Clean, Healthy Food\nFertilizer and pesticides are said to be among the best things to happen to food production, enabling farmers to produce immensely larger yields with less effort, but also protect the produce from any pests. This makes things a lot easier but creates other issues along the way. Traditional agriculture is quite reliant on these substances and in some cases tends to overuse them to the point of harm. Luckily, there is a new best thing happening to food production called indoor farming.\nAs the name suggests, it is a method for growing plants indoors, in a highly-controlled and monitored environment without using any pesticides or fertilizer at all. Instead, the plants are nourished via sophisticated nutrient delivery systems called hydroponics or aquaponics. But why is this so important and why is a shift from fertilizers and pesticides necessary?\nWhy are Fertilizers and Pesticides Bad?\nThe issue with fertilizers is that at least some parts of them end up washed away into a river or lake of some kind, resulting in the so called “dead zones” which are harmful for the fish. As for pesticides, their full effect on the human body is actually not completely known, but long exposure to such substances results in symptoms such as hand tremors and headaches. Simply put, pesticides and fertilizers help us produce both a larger quantity and better looking food, but might impact our bodies and certain wildlife negatively.\nDespite a global decrease in the usage of these substances in recent years, the number is still pretty high: the amount of pesticides used in agriculture for 2007 was a jaw dropping 877 million pounds.\nAs you might have already concluded, all of us have probably had our fair share of pesticide-rich meals, but luckily indoor farming offers another alternative where mass produced food can actually be free of any harmful additives.\nWhat Makes Indoor Farming a Better Alternative?\nLet`s examine the indoor farming process in order to illustrate not only why the produce is free of any harmful substances, but also more environmentally friendly in general. An indoor farm called Bowery Farming is among the top innovators in the field with their so called post-organic produce. They grow plants in vertical rows, without using any harmful additives, while monitoring every growth stage and controlling exactly how much light and nutrients the plants receive.\nIndoor farming is a form of agricultural science that addresses most of the challenges traditional agriculture has.\nThe Environmental Benefits of Indoor Farming\nIndoor farming can be incredibly space and resource efficient, using close to 95% less water and much less land. Bowery manages to be 100 times more productive than a regular farm of the same size, while producing clean, pesticide free products.\nFurthermore, indoor farms provide superiority in terms of transportation, as they can be located in almost any urban location, drastically decreasing costs.\nThere is a term called food miles, which describes the distance food travels before reaching your plate and the associated carbon emissions that were generated by it. Estimations show that a typical American meal travels a distance of 1500 miles!\nAccording to a paper called “Food-Miles and the Relative Climate Impacts of Food Choices in the United States,” 17% of all food related emissions are attributed to transportation, while the rest are related to production.\nImplementing indoor farming close to densely populated cities can drastically shorten the distance food needs to travel before reaching the end consumers and thus generate a smaller carbon footprint – your meal would have to travel no more than 50 miles to your plate.\nFurthermore, by growing plants in a controlled environment every process can be tailored and adjusted according to specific needs, which makes the overall system very efficient and also results in fresh and healthy produce.\nWhat Makes Indoor Farming Produce So Clean?\nConventional farming is a messy business with lots of dirt, insects, pests, uneven sunlight and water involved. Indoor farming is the exact opposite and consists of carefully calculated and adjusted processes, undisturbed by bad weather conditions and without CO2 emissions from tractors. As mentioned earlier, plants are often grown without soil, suspended in mid-air by using a hydroponic nutrients delivery system.\nWhat truly makes the process shine, though, is the equipment used to replace the function of the sun. Advances in full spectrum LED grow lights make it possible to provide plants with the exact color spectrum they need for each stage.\nLED grow lights help the plants grow healthy and good looking, ensuring quality consistency among the different batches without any genetic modifications. This is not only good environmentally, but also responds to the public`s opinion and interests.\nLiving and Eating Healthy\nThe 21st century has seen an unprecedented global shift towards a healthier lifestyle, and people are paying more attention to what they eat and how their food is produced. Naturally, countries putting the most efforts into indoor farming development and producing clean organic food are the ones where the environmental and food quality issues are most serious.\nSpecifically in Asia, where there has been news of melamine in baby food and bad meat being served in fast food restaurants, there is a rising demand for clean food, which in turn stimulates the indoor farming sector. As stated in a report called ‘The Rise of Asia’s Indoor Agriculture Industry’ – “Combined, these trends favor indoor growers whose vegetables are typically grown without pesticides and in at least semi-clean room conditions.” Furthermore, some governments provide support for stimulating indoor agriculture, such as subsidies or favorable loan conditions.\nWith the rising importance of issues such as climate change and poor food production techniques, indoor farming has the potential to bring major positive change. Although it might not be perfect at the moment, it is drastically improving and will continue to get more environmentally friendly and resource efficient, saving energy and cutting back on CO2 emissions while producing tasty plants."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:2d79cc7e-4bf6-42e6-92fe-f3ae41be2f73>","<urn:uuid:71599610-f1f5-4aeb-ada9-b4ec73c89fae>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Need comparison: assembly methods in both colloidal crystals and engineered tissue - what techniques do they use?","answer":"In colloidal crystal assembly, researchers use techniques like electric fields, shear forces, and gravitational fields to arrange nanocolloidal particles into ordered arrays, particularly for creating photonic crystal structures. For tissue engineering assembly, researchers use a different approach involving scaffold-based techniques where they create precise three-dimensional structures using CT scan data, populate them with stem cells, and provide nutrients and growth factors. A specific example is the hydrogel capsule method developed by George Eng, which uses a lock-and-key assembly system similar to Legos to create controlled cell patterns.","context":["University of California at Berkeley\nPhD CHE ’96\nUniversity of Wisconsin at Madison\nBS CHE and Economics ’90\nOur research investigates complex fluids – soft materials with properties intermediate between fluids and solids. Our current interests include nanocolloidal assembly, colloidal gelation, and the biomechanics of bacterial biofilms. Applications that interest us include creating new optical materials, sensors, biomedical devices and procedures, as well as materials for energy management.\nThe assembly of nanocolloids into useful structures has long been a key aim of chemical engineers and materials scientists. For example, ordered arrays of colloidal particles formed in the liquid state can be further processed to yield photonic crystal structures useful for sensing and optical materials. Yet, the success of this technological aim is severely hindered by some deep fundamental problems. For example, the crystal structures that have been fabricated to date are disappointingly small, most likely because typical nanocolloidal building blocks are not nearly complex as molecules. We address this challenge by synthesizing anisotropic colloids and assembling them with the assistance of applied electric, shear and gravitational fields. We collaborate with Profs. Sharon Glotzer, Mark Burns and Joanna Millunchick in pursuit of this aim. In a second effort, we address the fact that the typical size of the ordered arrays that have been produced in academia is currently too small for real-world applications. In collaboration with Professor Ron Larson, we have investigated the complex fluid dynamics of large-scale methods for colloidal crystal production, such as spin coating. These questions are studied within a collaborative, student-drive research program that includes novel colloid synthesis, direct visualization of assembly structure and dynamics by confocal microscopy as well as rheological measurements.\nColloidal gelation is a common industrial process to manage the rheological and microstructural properties of complex fluid formulations used in the stabilization of consumer products, ceramic materials and pharmaceutical formulations. By developing new 3D confocal microscopy methods, our group has made fundamental discoveries about gels that are currently being applied in industry to develop new materials and complex fluid processing methods. Currently, we are engaged in an investigation of the origin of rupture and yielding in colloidal gels. The work involves a combination of advanced microscopy techniques, flow cell fabrication using methods such as microfabrication, and rheological measurements.\nBiomechanics of bacterial biofilms\nWith Dr. John Younger of the U-Michigan Department of Emergency Medicine and collaborators at two other universities, we are exploring the biomechanical properties of bacterial biofilms. Biofilms are colonies of microorganisms that are pervasive in a range of natural and industrial settings. They can also grow on devices, such as intravascular catheters, that are introduced into the body as part of medical practice. Biofilm structure and mechanics is thought to play a protective role by, for example, improving the resistance of bacteria to antibiotic treatments. The aim of this project is to understand and measure the mechanical properties of biofilms of size about 10 – 100 microns, since these dimensions match the scales relevant to medical practice. As part of this work, we have developed a flexible microfluidic rheometer for micromechanical measurements of bacterial biofilm elasticity. Current work is focused on molecular characterization of the extracellular polysaccharides present in biofilms, rheological characterization of whole biofilms, and confocal microscopy visualization of the complex microscopic structure of biofilms.\nOur research is supported by NSF, NIH, DOE, and Procter & Gamble.\nMichael Solomon is Professor of Chemical Engineering and Professor of Macromolecular Science and Engineering at the University of Michigan.

The process starts by obtaining CT scans of bone that needs reconstruction. These are converted into three-dimensional images and used to create a scaffold in the exact shape and size of the defect.\nLearn more about Prof. Vunjak-Novakovic's research (Credit: Columbia News Video Team)\nThe same images are used to make a chamber into which the scaffold is tightly fit. Then the scaffold is infused with mesenchymal stem cells—the kind that can differentiate into different varieties of cell types—obtained from the patient's fat and fed with a medium containing nutrients, growth factors and oxygen. \"We condition the bone for three weeks and fit it into the defect,\" she explains. \"You would actually grow a piece of bone that would totally resemble the bone you are replacing or regenerating.\"\nThis \"grow your own bone\" approach could offer alternatives to current methods of using inorganic materials such as titanium, which cannot adapt to the body. \"If the patient is young, the titanium wouldn't grow with the person or change as we age,\" says Vunjak-Novakovic. \"We are trying to replace these materials with living human bone grown in the lab.\" This approach was reported in 2009 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and recently validated in large animal studies.\nTissue cells form specific structures critical for their function. Cardiac muscle cells, for example, organize themselves in parallel formations, enabling the heart to contract and pump blood through the 100,000 miles of blood vessels in the body. Cells without specific spatial organization may never become fully functional if they do not replicate in the proper structure, Vunjak-Novakovic said. Her lab creates large quantities of tissues, to better study their structure and investigate drug therapies.\nGeorge Eng, a research assistant in the MD/PhD program, recently devised a method to make tissues that can be assembled like Legos. He created a template and differently shaped hydrogel capsules—a material with flexibility similar to natural tissue—that fit together in a lock-and-key manner. This new tissue-creating technique lets researchers construct unique and controlled cell patterns that allow precise studies of cell function in response to many different environments. This approach was reported in the March 4, 2013 issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\nLife in the lab started early for Vunjak-Novakovic. She grew up in Belgrade, Serbia, in the former Yugoslavia, where her father, a chemical engineer, arranged for her to spend time in labs during the summers. She received her Ph.D. in chemical engineering from the University of Belgrade and traveled to the United States in 1986 with her husband and son to study at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on a Fulbright fellowship. There, a meeting with MIT Professor Robert Langer, considered a pioneer of tissue engineering, was pivotal. \"When he explained he was working on tissue engineering, I said 'tissue what?' but it immediately became a lifelong professional niche for me,\" she recalls.\nShe collaborated with Langer for years but became a visiting professor at MIT in February 1993, when the republics of the former Yugoslavia were already at war. \"My poor country was falling to pieces so we kept extending our stay,\" Vunjak-Novakovic recalls. Later that year she joined the MIT faculty full time, and got a green card. She became a naturalized citizen in 2000 and arrived at Columbia in 2005.\nVunjak-Novakovic sees today as a golden age for the field of tissue engineering. \"I expect that during our lifetime we will be able to leave a mark and help people live longer, better lives.\""],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:568b5396-35f7-4bce-9603-9f7845f9de39>","<urn:uuid:5670aaa4-2fa6-4564-bb72-1813babd717b>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the key policies for creating affordable housing and how do local Helena organizations implement these solutions?","answer":"Key policies for creating affordable housing include developing new dedicated affordable units, preserving existing affordable housing stock, and reducing barriers to housing supply through zoning changes and density allowances. These policies are implemented in Helena through a coordinated network of organizations including the Helena Housing Authority, Good Samaritan Ministries, and United Way of the Lewis and Clark Area. These organizations work together through the coordinated entry system to connect people with available housing resources, maintain waiting lists for public housing, and provide housing navigation services. The system emphasizes both immediate assistance through emergency services and long-term solutions through permanent housing placement.","context":["Policy objective: Reducing homelessness and meeting the emergency needs of homeless individuals and families\nHomelessness and housing policy\nFor most people, homelessness is a temporary state. Having an episode of homelessness does not distinguish a family or an individual from other households with incomes at the well-below-poverty levels characteristic of people who enter emergency shelters. Most poor or deeply poor people do not fall into homelessness, even in high-cost cities. Analysts have found it very difficult to predict which people in a city will become homeless. The pathway into homelessness seems to be a combination of an immediate crisis such as eviction or family conflict and having almost no income. This combination of economic fragility and “bad luck” leaves people no option for a place to stay other than a shelter or the “street.”\nHowever, strong empirical evidence confirms that homelessness is essentially a housing problem. Rates of homelessness are greater in cities, towns, and counties with low vacancy rates and high rents and lower in cities, towns, and counties with relatively high levels of housing assistance targeted to poor people. Furthermore, the pathway out of homelessness is a stable, permanent housing unit, even for people whose housing instability is linked to mental illness or use of alcohol or drugs. The availability of appropriate services is important to many individuals’ success in maintaining stable housing, but people who become homeless tend to need the same supportive services as people with similar challenges who remain housed. Such challenges include low educational attainment, weak connection to the workforce, and psycho-social issues, all of which exist at high rates among people living in poverty, both those who experience homelessness and those who do not. The behavioral health services that many people experiencing homelessness need usually are funded through one of the Medicaid waiver or special programs or through the public mental health system.\nThere is no evidence that transitional housing—that is, temporary placements in supervised facilities with on-site or linked services—is needed or effective. Rather, services are best provided by linking people in stable, permanent housing to services provided in a community setting. Experience and research shows that the housing should be permanent in the sense that the occupant has the same security of tenure as other renters, not conditional on cooperation with services or sobriety – an approach called Housing First. Permanent housing that is linked to those services in a way that ensures that people have access to them is called permanent supportive housing or PSH.\nAn emergency response system is also needed—not everyone can be diverted into staying in or obtaining housing immediately. But the size and expense of the city’s emergency shelter system can be minimized by effective policies that channel funds that might otherwise have gone to shelter into longer-term housing solutions. Those policies include short-term rental assistance, but given the weak earning potential and fragile support systems typical of people who experience homelessness, many will require permanent affordable housing to avoid becoming homeless again.\nEnd and prevent homelessness with the housing policy toolkit\nThe exhibit below describes how a wide range of housing policies can be used to prevent and end homelessness. All four policy categories in the Housing Policy Library have some role. The most obvious policy categories are the first, which focuses on creating and preserving dedicated affordable housing units, which can be used to expand the inventory of housing for people leaving homelessness (including permanent supportive housing for those who need service-linked housing) and the third, which focuses on helping renters access and afford units.\nPeople who become homeless are overwhelmingly renters. Negligible numbers of people enter homelessness from units they owned; this was true even during the Great Recession and the associated foreclosure crisis. And when people find permanent homes after a homeless spell, those homes are almost inevitably rented.\nRent subsidies, especially when targeted to families and individuals with extremely low incomes, both prevent homelessness and can be used to place people otherwise on the street or in shelters into housing quickly and effectively. Tenant-based rental assistance is used just as effectively by families leaving homelessness as it is by other low-income families. For people who need service-linked permanent supportive housing may take the form of dedicated affordable housing units or tenant-based housing vouchers that are linked to services. Some cities have found that getting the public housingA federal program dedicated to providing decent and safe rental housing for low-income families, older adults, and persons with disabilities. There are around 1.2 million houesholds residing in public housing units, managed by over 3,000 housing authorities. Programs differ in types and sizes. agency to provide a set-aside of tenant-based housing choice voucherOfficially known as \"Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher\". It is the largest and most sought after housing program in America. Section 8 HCVs are managed by various public housing agencies (most commonly referred to as housing authorities), which falls under the supervision of HUD. Program participants typically pay 30% of the rent, and the rest is covered by the HCV.s is the only way to achieve the volume of permanent supportive housing needed for individuals with chronic patterns of homelessness. PHAs in cities with large numbers of homeless people are often reluctant to create open-ended preferences that put people experiencing homelessness at the top of waiting lists, because of a concern that no one else will have access to housing assistance. However, some PHAs have been willing to create set-asides of finite numbers of vouchers to serve this vulnerable population.\nThe other two policy categories also have a role. By moderating housing costs, expanding the overall supply of housing can reduce pressures on family budgets caused by high housing costs and make the families or friends of people in crisis more willing to provide a temporary place for them to stay. Measures that lower barriers to creating affordable housing can help with the location of supportive housing—for example, by permitting small multifamily properties. Policies that advance housing stability are also important. Good cause eviction policies and legal assistance can avert one type of crisis that is often a pathway into homelessness. On the other hand, when cities adopt policies that improve housing quality through code enforcement, they should consider whether enforcement of rules designed to prevent overcrowding will discourage people from offering a family in crisis a place to stay temporarily.\nI. Create and preserve dedicated affordable housing units\nPrevents homelessness: cities, towns, and counties with more assisted housing (project and tenant-based) have fewer people with housing crises that lead to homelessness.\nResolves homelessness for particular individuals and families: access to assisted housing prevents returns to homelessness.\nProvides a platform for delivering services to formerly homeless individuals—in particular, those with behavioral health needs and chronic patterns of homelessness.\nUse subsidy programs (LIHTC and capital subsidies for affordable housing developments) to create new permanent supportive housing (PSH). Can be entire property or set-aside of units; no consensus on which is preferable.\nUse operating subsidies for affordable housing developments and project-based vouchers to make units in new and existing properties affordable for formerly homeless people (incomes at SSI levels or lower).\nWork with PHAs and private owners of affordable housing developments to create preferences and set-asides within public housing, Housing Choice Vouchers, and privately-owned assisted housing for people leaving homelessness and adapt occupancy requirements.\nIncorporate special needs housing into inclusionary zoning, density bonuses, tax abatements, and other incentives or requirements for affordable housing.\nII. Promote affordability by reducing barriers to new supply\nExpanding the overall supply of housing (especially rental housing) lowers rents and reduces crises that lead to homelessness (inability to pay rent, crowding, unwillingness to take in family or friends in crisis).\nPermitting higher density housing development and encouraging small multifamily housing expands locations and properties for permanent supportive housing and other special needs housing.\nRezoning for higher density development, reducing barriers to development, and facilitating the use of lower cost types of housing units can lower the cost of rental housing overall.\nChanges that permit additional housing types may enable development of PSH.\nIII. Help households access and afford private-market homes\nTenant-based rental assistance prevents homelessness; cities, towns, and counties with more assisted housing have fewer people with housing crises that lead to homelessness. Utility assistance can also help forestall housing crises.\nResolves homelessness for particular individuals and families: access to assisted housing prevents returns to homelessness.\nTenant-based assistance can provide a platform for delivering services to formerly homeless individuals—in particular, those with behavioral health needs and chronic patterns of homelessness. Many formerly homeless people prefer housing that is integrated into the community, and the Olmstead decision requires communities to give people with disabilities that opportunity.\nWork with PHAs to maintain and expand quantity of Housing Choice Vouchers within budget constraints (e.g., fully utilize resources despite budget uncertainties).\nWork with PHAs and other providers of rental assistance to create preferences for people leaving homelessness within the public housing, Housing Choice Voucher, and privately-owned assisted housing programs adapt occupancy requirements. Consider targeting all vouchers to households with extremely low incomes, to help people avoid homelessness.\nUse HOME tenant-based rental assistance and state or local-funded rental assistance for people leaving homelessness. Provide security deposit and/or first month’s rent assistance to help families re-establish a residence.\nUse set-asides of Housing Choice Vouchers for PSH.\nIV. Protect against displacement and poor housing conditions\nPrevents homelessness: eviction is a common pathway to homelessness. Crowded housing reduces willingness to take in family or friends in crisis.\nUse “Just cause” eviction policies, eviction prevention programs, and legal assistance for at-risk renters to reduce housing crises that can trigger homelessness.\nTrade-off: strong housing codes and code enforcement are important for ensuring housing quality, but can lead to eviction; make households unwilling to take in family or friends in crisis.\nCombining policies to end and prevent homelessness\nThe specific polices highlighted in the exhibit often can and should be used in combination, as illustrated in the following scenarios:\nScenario 1: A city, town, or county with a large or growing number of individuals with chronic patterns of homelessness identifies a need for an expanded supply of permanent supportive housing. The city, town, or county offers gap financing to a developer who commits to setting aside 20 percent of the units for permanent supportive housing in a development that is being recapitalizeTo provide new funding for old, distressed properties for maintenance or upgrade. Multifamily developments often needs to be recapitalized after a certain number of years.d and preserved with LIHTC. Medical and case management services are provided through a partnership with the city’s mental health agency. Project-based Section 8 rent subsidies already attached to this preservation property are used to make the rents affordable for people whose only source of income is SSI.\nScenario 2: A city, town, or county is experiencing an increased inflow into its emergency shelters for families. As an alternative to building another shelter, the city, town, or county persuades the public housing agency to target a higher percentage of its housing choice vouchers to families with extremely low incomes. Through a further agreement with the PHA, the city uses the waiting list for Section 8 vouchers to reach out to families who may have a crisis leading to homelessness while they are waiting their turn for a rent subsidy. The city, town, or county also examines its enforcement of housing codes to determine whether rules against overcrowding are associated with increased demand for emergency shelter.\nPartnerships and coordination\nAs the scenarios just described illustrate, policies to prevent and end homelessness require coordinated policies and partnerships. A city, town, or county that has identified ending and preventing homelessness as an important objective should examine how the strategic planning carried out by the Continuum of Care (CoC) that has that function for the homeless services system can be linked to the city’s broader strategic planning for housing.\nCoCs differ from city to city, county to county in their governance and functions. Some are embedded in local government, while others are led by private non-profits. In some places they already have succeeded in making the public housing agency and the mental health and Medicaid agencies full partners in ending homelessness. If that is the case, the agency responsible for the city, town, or county’s housing plan can build on the relationships that the CoC has established as the foundation for a partnership. In other cases, the housing agency should make itself part of the CoC and help to strengthen it.\n- Aron, Laudan, Martha Burt, and Edgar Lee.

The list is made up of those that have completed the VI-SPDAT assessment and can be sorted or filtered accordingly. The BNL ensures that we’re working towards HUD’s criteria and benchmarks for ending Veteran and chronic homelessness.\nCase Conferencing: Case conferencing is a region’s formal, planned, and structured meeting in which providers coordinate staffing assignments, provide client level updates, and ensure coordination of services. The goal of case conferencing is to provide holistic, coordinated, and integrated services across providers, and to reduce duplication. Case conferences are usually multidisciplinary, and include multiple providers from the area. Case conferences should be used to identify or clarify issues regarding a participant’s housing status and progress towards permanent housing; to assign primary Housing Navigation responsibilities; to strategize solutions; and to adjust current service plans, as necessary. Case conferencing must be documented and must follow any policies and procedures established for CES.\nCase Management: Case management is defined by the Case Management Society of America as “a collaborative process of assessment, planning, facilitation, care coordination, evaluation, and advocacy for options and services” to meet individual needs. Case Management in the context of CES should be voluntary and client centered, with the goal of identifying strengths and client directed goals, while promoting “health, recognition, and well-being” (USICH, 2016). Case Managers in CES should ultimately focus on linking the client to a permanent housing resource and providing the necessary services needed to promote housing stability.\nContinuums of Care (CoC): A community planning body, as required by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, to organize and deliver housing and services for a specific geographic region; develop a long-term strategic plan for preventing and ending homelessness; and to apply for federal resources.\nCoordinated Assessment: A centralized or coordinated process designed to coordinate program participant intake assessment and provision of referrals. A centralized or coordinated assessment system covers the geographic area, is easily accessed by individuals and families seeking housing or services, is well advertised, and includes a comprehensive and standardized assessment tool. (Definition from HUD Notice: CPD-17-01)\nCoordinated Entry System (CES – herein, Greater Helena Area Housing First): CES is a regionally based system that connects new and existing programs into a “no-wrong-door network” by assessing the needs of heads of households experiencing literal homelessness and linking them with the most appropriate housing and services to end their homelessness. The goal of the CES is to streamline processes through which communities assess, house, and retain individuals who are homeless; to ensure all of our homeless neighbors are known and supported; to target and maximize limited housing resources; and comply with the federal mandate to adopt a standardized intake and coordinated assessment process for housing. The essential components of CES are: 1) as system that is low-barrier and easy to access; 2) a system that identifies and assesses people’s needs; and 3) a system that prioritizes and matches housing resources based on those needs.\nCrisis Housing: Crisis Housing means any facility, the primary purpose of which is to provide temporary, emergency shelter for the homeless.\nData: Consistent process for gathering information, tracking/entering data into a database like HMIS or CONNECT, sharing information across programs, data protections to keep sensitive information secure.\nDiversion: Diversion relies on a formally trained “diversion specialist” to facilitate a conversation about safe alternatives to shelter, outside the homeless system, and often includes facilitating connection between a person in crisis and their support system through mediation/conflict resolution. Diversion is an approach, not a program. The approach focuses on a person’s strengths and supports their process of identifying the resources available to them to help resolve their housing crisis.\nEmergency Solutions Grant: A program of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to provide emergency shelter to homeless individuals and families living on the street; rapidly re-house homeless individuals and families; and prevent individuals and families from becoming homeless.\nFront Door: An access point where a participant can meet with an intake professional in person or via phone. In the Greater Helena Area, this is Volunteers of America, The Salvation Army, Good Samaritan Ministries, PureView Health Center, Healthcare for the Homeless, and 2-1-1.\nHCV: Housing Choice Voucher, a.k.a. Section 8.\nHomeless: An individual who belongs to one of the following categories. The System prioritizes categories 1 and 4.\nCategory 1: An individual or family who lacks a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence, meaning:\na. An individual or family with a primary nighttime residence that is a public or private place not designed for or ordinarily used as a regular sleeping accommodation for human beings, including a car, park, abandoned building, bus or train station, airport, or camping ground; or\nb. An individual or family living in a supervised publicly or privately-operated shelter designated to provide temporary living arrangements (including congregate shelters, transitional housing, and hotels and motels paid for by charitable organizations or by federal, state, or local government programs for low-income individuals); or\nc. An individual who is exiting an institution where he or she resided for 90 days or less and who resided in an emergency shelter or place not meant for human habitation immediately before entering that institution.\nCategory 2: Individuals and families who will imminently lose their primary nighttime residence\nCategory 3: Unaccompanied youth and families with children and youth who are defined as homeless under other federal statutes who do not otherwise qualify as homeless under this definition; or\nCategory 4: Any individual or family who:\na. Is fleeing, or is attempting to flee, domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, stalking, or other dangerous or life-threatening conditions that relate to violence against the individual or a family member, including a child, that has either taken place within the individual’s or family’s primary nighttime residence or has made the individual or family afraid to return to their primary nighttime residence; and\nb. Has no other residence; and\nc. Lacks the resources or support networks, e.g., family, friends, and faith- based or other social networks, to obtain other permanent housing.\nHousing First: Housing First is an approach that offers permanent housing as quickly as possible for people experiencing homelessness, particularly for people with long histories of homelessness and co-occurring health challenges, while providing the supportive services people need to keep their housing and avoid returning to homelessness. The provider ensures that the supportive services that program participants need or want in order to achieve permanent housing, including links to mainstream programs or partner agencies (i.e. mental health services, substance abuse treatment, medical services, child care, etc.). Income, sobriety and/or participation in treatment or other services are voluntary and are not required as a condition for housing.\nHousing Navigation: Housing Navigation is the process by which homeless clients that have entered the CES system are provided ongoing engagement, document collection, and “light” case management services in order to facilitate a match to an appropriate housing resource. In the context of CES, outreach workers, case managers, and other homeless service providers may provide housing navigation assistance.\nHousing Navigator(s): Housing Navigator is the client’s primary point of contact in CES, often a social worker, case manager, outreach worker, or volunteer. Some CoCs have implemented a Housing Navigator function to ensure efficient and effective enrollment and subsequent movement of program participants from crisis response to stable housing. Specific staff duties might vary, but a Housing Navigator can perform a variety of functions to reduce the time it takes persons in crisis to obtain housing.\nOutreach Coordination: The planning and ongoing coordination of outreach activities in a region. This should include a multi-disciplinary approach that ensures adequate geographic coverage and the use of best practices to outreach.\nPermanent Housing (PH): Community-based housing without a designated length of stay, which includes both Permanent Supportive Housing (PSH) and Rapid Rehousing (RRH). Examples of permanent housing include, but are not limited to, a house or apartment with a month-to-month or annual lease term or home ownership.\nPrevention: An approach that focuses on preventing homelessness by providing assistance to households that otherwise would become homeless and end up in a shelter or on the streets.\nRapid Rehousing (RRH): A support intervention that uses a combination of case management, Housing Navigation, and short to medium term financial assistance to assist mid-range acuity homeless households identify and stabilize in tenant-based, scattered site, permanent housing.\nS+C: Shelter Plus Care – More commonly known as “Permanent Supportive Housing.”\nSSVF: Supportive Services for Veteran Families\nStandardized Access: Goals of coordinated entry system are for the system to be easily accessible and welcoming to the wide range of people who may experience a housing crisis in service areas.\nTH: Transitional Housing\nThe 4 A’s of CES: Access, Assess, Assign and Accountability\nTransition Age Youth (TAY): An individual between the ages of 16 and 24 years. Please note that while the Youth Coordinated Entry System serves youth and young adults, ages 16-24, for the purposes for Rapid Rehousing, youth must be at least 18 years old to sign a lease. Therefore, for the program area of Rapid Rehousing, TAY are defined as youth ages 18-24.\nU.S. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD): A U.S. government agency created in 1965 to support community development and home ownership.\nVA: Veteran Affairs\nVASH Voucher: Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing Voucher\nVI- SPDAT: Vulnerability Index – Service Prioritization Decision Assistance Tool. An evidence-based assessment tool that combines the Vulnerability Index (VI) to determine the chronicity and medical vulnerability of homeless individuals, and the Service Prioritization Decision Assistance Tool to help service providers allocate resources in a logical, targeted way."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:0bb5ffca-8b89-49b9-86b2-ce6ede41e051>","<urn:uuid:033efced-6a8d-40b8-b348-5e503ad88128>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Could you please explain what is included in calculating the factory/works cost according to standard cost accounting?","answer":"The factory/works cost includes the following items: First, the PRIME COST, which consists of direct material costs (calculated from opening stock of raw material, plus purchases, plus carriage inwards, minus closing stock). Then add other consumable stores, repairs of machines/plant, and depreciation of plant & machinery. Finally, subtract any amount received from sale of scrap. The total of all these elements constitutes the factory/works cost.","context":["- Business and Employment»\nCosting and Cost Accounting\nCosting and Cost Accounting.\nCosting or cost accounting is a branch of accounting which deals with recording classifying and appropriate allocation of expenditure to determine the cost of product and services. After determining the cost one can fix the profit margin and also the fix the selling price. In this complex and competitive market scenario, it is essential to determine the cost of products and services. It also help the management to take an informed decision to reduce cost and increase the profit, reduce the manufacturing cost, whereby reducing the selling price. To sustain in this competitive market, producers needs to reduce the selling price and increase the quality.\nDefinition of Costing.\nAccording to Harold J Wheldon \"Costing is the classifying, recording and appropriate allocation of expenditure for the determination of the costs of products or services; and for the presentation suitably of arranged data for purposes of control and guidance of management.\nThe term \"Costing\" and \"Cost Accounting\" are used interchangeably. However, Costing refers to the technique and process of ascertaining costs. There are specified rules and principles which are used to determine the cost of products and services. Whereas the term Cost Accounting refers the process of finding out the cost.\nAccording to the Institute of Cost and Management Account \"Cost accounting is that part of management accounting which establishes budgets and standard costs and actual costs of operations, processes, departments or products and the analysis of variances, profitability or social use of funds.\"\nUse of costing\nEvery economic activity such as production and services involves some\nexpenses. These expenses may be of raw materials, labour cost or other\ndirect and indirect expenses. The purpose of production or services is\nthat to earn profit. Cost accounting serves the purpose of identifying\nthe expenses and cost and the profit margin of the product. For\nexample a cloth factory launches a new shirt. It has to incure $30 for\nmaterial $ 20 for labor and $ 25 for other overheads. The selling\nprice fixed as $ 100. The cost of the shirt is $ 75 (30+20+25) Profit\nis $ 25 (100-75).\nEvery manufacturer requires such information for the purpose of planning, decision making and cost control. Most of the time it is difficult to extract such information from the financial accounting. A new system of accounting is developed to cater the requirement of the management to control the cost. Various limitations and deficiencies of financial accounting gave rise to the need of cost accounting.\nCosting provides the following benefits:\n1. Fast Decisions: Costing help the management to take fast and informed decision on the basis of data provided by the Cost Accounting.\n2. Optimum Profit: Costing help the organization to maximize the profit by exercising efficient control in personal, financial, production and marketing activities.\n3. Maximum utilization of Limited Resources: By minimizing the wastage, once can minimize the wastage and maximize the utilization of resources.\n4. Maintain Social Responsibility: Social responsibility in terms of regular supply, reasonable price, proper quality can be attain by effectively utilizing the cost accounting.\n5. Effective Management: In large manufacturing plants requires special attention in every stage and process of the manufacturing. Cost accounting help the management to easily control every stage of the manufacturing process efficiently. It'll help the management to identify the inefficient department or process and address the issue and correct it.\n6. Help the organization Globally competitive: In this ever changing\nglobal market stringent control over costs can help the organization to\ncompete globally with other manufactures/markets.\nDue to the many advantages, many companies are opting the help of costing to control the cost. It is now a widely recognized branch of accounting and generating employment for people who are specialized in Cost accounting. Costing helps in checking of wastage, pricing, control of resources, management of process, discharge of social obligations, flow of data for decision making and provides opportunity for profit growth in the organization.\nFrequently arriving items in a cost sheet\nCost of Direct Material\nOpening Stock of raw material\nAdd Purchase of raw material\nAdd: Carriage inwards\nLess: Closing Stock\nPRIME COST (Total of all the above)\nOther consumable stores\nRepairs of Machines/Plant\nDepreciation of Plant & Machinery\nLess: Amount received from sale of Scrap\nFACTORY/WORKS COST (Total of all the above + prime cost)\nOffice and administrative Overheads\nCOST OF PRODUCTION (Total of all the above + factory/works cost)\nSelling and distribution overheads\nSales department salaries\nCOST OF SALES (Total of all the above + cost of production)\nProfit (Balancing figure)\nSales (Actual sales value of the product)"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:461269b3-aaf9-40a5-9af6-028ba29063c8>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the legal requirements for constructing a boundary wall between properties, and what notice procedures must be followed for excavation work near neighboring buildings?","answer":"For boundary walls, in the absence of a servitude, an owner may build only on their own ground. If it's a shared boundary wall, neither owner may remove, raise or lower it without the other's consent except in emergencies. For excavation work near neighboring buildings, a Section 6 Notice must be given for any works within 3 meters of the adjoining owner's building, or within 6 meters if any structures would intersect a 45° angle from the neighbor's foundations. This notice must be given one month in advance and include detailed plans of the proposed excavation. If reasonably required, the building owner must underpin or strengthen the foundations of the adjoining owner's property.","context":["Know your rights: Boundary walls\nAs a property owner, you are entitled to enjoy, use, consume, convert, alter, destroy or sell your property and what the land produces in any way you please within the limits of state and local authority regulations, provided you do not interfere with the legal rights of others, including your neighbours' rights to the same enjoyment of their property.\nThe boundaries between your properties mark where your rights end and your neighbours' begin.\nHaving a knowledge of each others' rights and obligations is the first step in establishing a good relationship with your neighbours and enjoying your rights to the full.\nBoundaries between properties are recorded in official town planning diagrams kept by the local authority in control of the area. In the event of a dispute over the dividing line between two properties, the first step is to check the official property plans. Refer to the title deeds of your property and your neighbour's to ascertain the plan numbers and with which deeds the plans are filed.\nIf you and your neighbour are unable to come to an agreement, even with the aid of the plans, or if you cannot find the property boundary pegs, you should ask a registered land surveyor to re-determine the boundary.\nIn the absence of a servitude, an owner may build only on his or her own ground.\nA builder who departs from the plans when building on your property might be guilty of encroachment - the building of part of your house on the property of a neighbour. The neighbour could demand demolition of the encroaching portion or the payment of compensation for the use of part of his or her land. A court might rule that demolition would be unreasonable (for example, because the cost of removing the structure exceeds the benefit to your neighbour of removing it) and direct you to take transfer of that part of your neighbour's property on which the building has encroached. As a property owner on whose property a neighbour has encroached, your right to insist on removal may, however, be lost if you do not demand removal within one year and one day of becoming aware of the encroachment. Alternatively, the court may, in its discretion, simply award compensation to you for the encroachment.\nA further legal remedy available to a person whose land has been encroached upon is to eject the encroaching neighbour and to retain the structure erected on the land against payment of compensation. This remedy may, however, be invoked only if the encroaching structure is independent of any structure on the land of the neighbour who built it, or can easily be separated from any such structure.\nBoundary (party) walls or fences\nIn the absence of proof that a boundary wall, fence or hedge is entirely on one of two adjoining properties, it is presumed to be half on one property and half on the other. Some legal authorities state that each part is separately owned by the owner of the property on which it stands, but that there are reciprocal servitudes of support. Other authorities state that the wall is owned jointly by the owners of the adjoining properties. The law relating to such encroaching boundary walls reflects the influence of both theories. An owner who transfers his or her property, automatically transfers the joint ownership. Neither owner may, without the consent of the other remove, raise or lower the boundary wall or tamper with it in any way except in an emergency, although in terms of common law a neighbour is allowed to break down a wooden fence and replace it at own cost with a more expensive partition.\nEither owner may re-erect a boundary wall destroyed by an act of God, such as fire or flood; the other owner would have to contribute half the cost - if he or she will derive any benefit from it. Each owner is obliged to contribute to the maintenance and repair of the wall, although an owner can refuse to contribute to the cost of an unreasonably expensive new wall. Moreover, an owner is under no obligation to replace with a similar structure a boundary wall that was unreasonably expensive when it was originally erected.\nIt is best to come to an agreement with your neighbour on the amount to be spent on the wall. Although both of you would be entitled to reasonable use of the boundary wall, fence or hedge, this right does not include reducing its strength or making it unstable. It does, however, include improving and altering the appearance of the side that fronts your property. Subject to local-authority regulations, you may use your side of the boundary wall as support for a beam or for water pipes. If it is strong enough, you may even build on it.\nThe Fencing Act, 1963\nThis regulates the duties of landowners with regard to boundary fences in agricultural areas. The Act divides the country into proclaimed areas in which contributions to the cost of boundary fences are either obligatory or non-obligatory. If you are not sure in which type of area you live, ask your local authority.\nIf you farm in an obligatory area and wish to erect a boundary fence, you have a right to demand a contribution towards the costs from landowners whose properties border the land you wish to fence in. You must send your neighbours written notice of your intention to erect a fence, stating the type and purpose of the fence, the estimated cost of erecting it and the contribution required, based on the value or benefit of the fence to them. If none of them object within one month, you may erect the fence and claim a contribution from all to whom you gave the notice. (When a neighbouring owner cannot be traced or is absent from South Africa, you can hand the notice to his or her authorised representative; alternatively, you can publish it in the government gazette and, three times, in a local newspaper. Your neighbour will then have three months in which to object.\nShould your neighbour object, by expressing the wish, perhaps, to erect a different type of fence, the dispute, in the absence of agreement between neighbouring owners, will then have to be settled by a board of three people specially constituted for that purpose. Each disputing party may appoint one member to the board, and the two members so appointed nominate a third person to decide the dispute. If one of the neighbours fails to appoint a member or if the two members appointed by them fail to appoint a third member, the chief magistrate of the district in which the land in question is situated may appoint a member. The third member acts as chairperson of the board and the decision of the majority constitutes the decision of the board, which may be enforced as if it were a judgment of the magistrate's court of the area. Alternatively, if both neighbours agree, a board consisting of only one member may decide the dispute between them.\nIf a landowner in an obligatory area wishes to jackal-proof an existing fence but the neighbour does not agree to do so, the landowner who wants the jackal-proof fence will have to carry the full cost, unless the Minister of Agriculture has declared the area to be obligatory in respect of the construction of jackal-proof fences.\nIn non-obligatory areas, a contribution can only be asked from a neighbour who is going to use the fence or is going to derive some other benefit from it\nSay, for instance, you want to erect a fence to prevent your sheep from straying onto a neighbouring farm that is devoted entirely to the production of honey, your neighbour will be perfectly entitled to refuse to contribute since he or she will derive no benefit from it. If, on the other hand, there is an obligation to contribute to the cost of the fence and the amount is in dispute, a board may be appointed to decide the matter in the same way as it would a dispute between owners of adjoining land in obligatory areas.\nIf the cost of erecting or contributing towards a boundary fence is greater than R40, an advance can usually be obtained from the Land and Agricultural Bank of South Africa.\nWhere adjoining owners share a single driveway to their garages, the plans will show who owns the driveway and who, by right of servitude, may use it.\nIt is possible that the driveway may be owned either in undivided shares or that each owner owns a specified half and is entitled to the use of the other half.\nEven the sole owner of the driveway has no right to obstruct your access to a garage on your property. If an obstruction to your driveway is in a public place, ask the police to take action; if the obstruction is in the driveway itself on private land, do not, under any circumstances, take the law into your own hands by removing it. If the owner refuses to remove it, ask your attorney to write him or her a letter. If the matter still cannot be resolved, you will have to approach the court for an order to compel the owner - or to allow you - to remove the obstacle.\nPaying for repairs\nTitle deeds might make it clear who is responsible for repairing shared driveways, walls or fences. A servitude might make a single owner entirely liable for the costs of upkeep. If your neighbour refuses to make essential repairs, anyone who is entitled to enforce the servitude may obtain an estimate of the cost of repairs. It is unlikely that a contractor will undertake the work if it is known that the person responsible for payment is unwilling to pay. The servitude holders may therefore have to pay the contractor themselves and present the owner with the bill. The owner of a wall or driveway who is not bound by servitude is normally under no obligation to carry out repairs. However, in the case of deterioration that is likely to prove dangerous to the public, a local authority might order the owner of the property in question to carry out the necessary repairs. In any event, the owner will be liable for damage to your property caused by known defects (or defects that should have been obvious) - for example, if a wall collapses and damages your property.\nIf the title deeds do not specify that repairs are the responsibility of one owner, it is best for neighbours to agree to share costs. This should be done by an exchange of letters setting out what work is to be undertaken and how the costs are to be shared; alternatively, an attorney could draw up an agreement to be signed by the parties involved.\nOverhanging branches and intruding roots\nIf branches of a tree growing on an adjoining property overhang your property, you may ask your neighbour to saw them off and remove them from your property. If your request is refused, you may saw the branches off yourself to the extent that they overhang, although you may not keep them unless your neighbour refuses to collect them. You may then recover from your neighbour the reasonable expense of removing the branches. Alternatively, you may force your neighbour to remove the offending branches by obtaining an interdict, compelling him or her to do so.\nThe law with regard to fruit on overhanging branches is not clear. Some legal writers say that you are entitled to pick fruit from the overhanging branches and keep it, while others state that you may take fruit only if it has fallen off the tree by itself. The matter awaits a decision by the Supreme Court.\nUsually you can't complain if leaves from a neighbour's tree fall onto your property. The planting of trees is held to be a natural and ordinary use of land, however close to a boundary they may be. Even if damage is caused by leaves from your neighbour's trees blocking your gutters, you cannot claim damages, since it has been held in court that damage of this kind can be prevented by routine cleaning of the gutters, a normal and inexpensive act of maintenance. If leaves, branches, flowers or fruit fall from your neighbour's tree onto your property, you cannot force your neighbour to remove them. You may demand the removal of roots that encroach on your property, whether beneath the ground or on the surface, or you may remove them yourself. If the roots have damaged your property, you may insist that they be removed and you may claim compensation for the damage they caused.\nUnless restricted by a servitude, your neighbour may erect buildings or grow trees on his or her property that obstruct your view or block out the sunlight that you would otherwise receive.\nThere is, however, an important limitation upon the right of a neighbour to build structures or grow trees that block out your light or create a mess on your property: if your neighbour does so, not in the enjoyment of his or her own property, but rather with the improper motive of causing a nuisance to you, you may be entitled to claim compensation or even to obtain an interdict compelling him or her to remove the offending structures or trees.","There is a new activity to be added to the list of potentially irritating things property owners can do to upset their neighbours and that is to excavate a basement (or two). This article explores in general terms one of the key issues that arises when such works are planned, namely, the application of the Party Wall etc Act 1996 (the Act) and the rights and obligations of the person carrying out the works (the building owner) and their neighbours (the adjoining owner).\nWhat work does the Act cover?\nThe Act was brought in to:\n(a) regulate and facilitate building work comprising:\n- building or demolishing a party wall or structure (section 1)\n- carrying out repairs to party structures (section 3)\n- excavating a site within 6 metres of neighbouring buildings\n(b) provide a mechanism for resolving disputes in connection with the carrying out of those works.\nThe Section 1 Notice governs works where the building owner intends to build a new wall or party fence wall (not a wooden fence) and must be given one month before the works commence. Service of a notice for this kind of work is mandatory, even if the adjoining owner consents to the proposed work.\nThe adjoining owner may:\n(a) consent within 14 days or\n(b) do nothing\nIn the event of (b) the building owner can only build on their own land.\nThe Section 3 Party Structure Notice governs works to an existing party wall or party fence wall and must be given to the relevant adjoining owner at least two months before works are due to start. It is possible to get the adjoining owner’s prior consent to the works.\nThe Section 6 Notice must be given in relation to any works that sink foundations or other structures within\n(a) three metres of the adjoining owner’s building or\n(b) six metres, if any part of the proposed structures (such as foundations) would be dissected by a line drawn downwards at a 45° angle from the nearest part of the adjoining owner’s foundations.\nOne month’s prior notice must be given to include detailed plans and sections of the proposed excavation and new structure. If the adjoining owner reasonably requires, the building owner is obliged to underpin or strengthen the foundations of the adjoining owner’s property.\nDisputes and the Party Wall Award\nA “dispute” under the Act arises or is deemed to arise if:\n(a) there is a failure to respond to a section 3 or 6 notice;\n(b) the adjoining owner does not consent to a section 3 notice within 14 days;\n(c) the adjoining owner serves a counter-notice under section 3; or\n(d) the building owner fails to respond to a section 3 counter-notice within 14 days.\nOnce a dispute has arisen a party wall surveyor must be appointed to represent the adjoining owner’s interests, this may be the building owner’s party wall surveyor (who must act impartially) or an independent surveyor. The costs are to be met by the building owner.\nThe party wall surveyors prepare and agree a schedule of condition of the adjoining owner’s property, any appropriate timetable for carrying out the work, the payment of costs, the method for protecting the adjoining owner’s property and the terms of inspections, which is then formalised in a Party Wall Award. The schedule of condition is the evidence against which any claim for damages by the adjoining owner is assessed. Generally, the adjoining owner cannot claim compensation for any inconvenience or loss of enjoyment of their property whilst the work is carried out.\nSecurity for expenses (Section 12)\nWhere extensive structural work is to be undertaken the adjoining owner will want the comfort of knowing that in the event the building owner runs into financial difficulty there is a sum of money set aside to ensure that both properties are reinstated and not left partially complete. The section 12 notice must be served before the building owner starts any work and the amount of the financial security agreed between them or, in the event of dispute, by the party wall surveyors.\nFailure to serve notices\nWhilst the Act does not contain any sanctions for failure to serve any relevant notice, that does not mean the adjoining owner is powerless as their rights are protected by the general law: breach of statutory duty, nuisance and trespass, which may entitle them to pursue a claim for damages or seek an injunction.\nThe moral of the story is:\nFor anyone contemplating carrying out major building works, there is a salutary lesson in the case of Jones v Ruth  EWHC 1538 where a building owner undertook an extensive project to his property on a piecemeal basis over a period of four years, committed trespass and caused significant harassment and nuisance to the adjoining owner leading to an award of damages against him of £100,000. This is an extreme example of what happens when a building owner does not pay heed to statutory and common law obligations, but also a reminder to adjoining owners not to allow a situation to deteriorate to the point where significant distress is caused and costly litigation ensues."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:9395d077-3447-41d9-8c07-73cbab7b6929>","<urn:uuid:24789585-c433-4550-a772-42c26ad765b8>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How does autism spectrum disorder manifest differently across individuals, and what environmental research breakthroughs has UC Davis made about its causes?","answer":"Autism spectrum disorder manifests uniquely in each individual - in social communication, some may have little to no verbal language and rarely initiate interaction, while others can speak in full sentences but struggle with reciprocal conversations. In behavioral patterns, some may show severe self-stimulatory behaviors while others mainly have difficulty with transitions and planning. Regarding causes, UC Davis has made breakthrough discoveries showing that ASD development involves complex interactions between environmental factors and genes. Their research demonstrates that nutrition can buffer against toxic chemical effects, and they've identified specific placental biomarkers that may indicate increased ASD risk through environmentally-induced epigenetic changes.","context":["The UC Davis Environmental Health Sciences Center mission is to advance understanding of environmentally-induced disease and disability, and develop interventions that reduce harmful exposures or mitigate their effects on health. Our vision for the current period is to work towards accelerating integration of basic science with translational objectives, creatively address community environmental health problems and tackle climate mitigation and adaptation in partnership with various California agencies. Mechanistic research and novel approaches to exposure science will lay the foundation for greater rigor and relevance in these investigations and deep engagement with stakeholders in California’s communities and government will ensure that the results are transformed into actions that reduce morbidity and mortality. As UC Davis is home to both internationally renowned environmental sciences and world-class health systems, the EHS Center strives to build bridges between the two. More broadly, a key strategy to achieving the Center’s vision is changing the culture in the health professions to fully embrace the critical role of environment in bringing about disease and disability; and conversely, to infuse environmental scientists with a similar appreciation for how the ecosystems they study influence health in humans and other animal species with which we share this planet.\nUC Davis’ EHSC has been developing and implementing new model systems for toxicologic research. Examples include: a vivarium placed in a real-world location of heavy traffic (Bein & Wexler) now being deployed in a study of Alzheimer’s Disease using genetically susceptible mice (Lein); a zebrafish model for examining reproductive effects using community water sources (Teh); and another fish model based on the Exxon Valdez oil spill for studying embryonic PAH exposures in relation to cardiac development and function (Whitehead). Advantages are not only that the exposure levels are directly relevant to human populations, but also that they represent real-world mixtures, thereby engaging on community concerns and strengthening connections to population or clinical intervention. In other work, a novel human breath sampler to measure metabolomics in condensates provides a relevant technologic innovation with direct application for diagnostics in asthma.\nIn human studies, UC Davis has been a leader in the field of environmental etiology in autism, identifying the first gene-environment interactions, and more recently, environment-nutrition interaction in autism spectrum disorder (Schmidt). This research demonstrates the implications of multifactorial causation, wherein no single factor is responsible for development of a disease or condition, but rather the effects of any one exposure may depend on the presence of others (Hertz-Picciotto, Schmidt). Thus, improving nutrition can buffer against the impact of toxic chemicals. EHSC researchers are pioneering exploration of environmentally-induced epigenetic and gene expression alterations in the placenta as biomarkers for developing autism spectrum disorder, with the observation that some highly methylated domains may confer greater risk for ASD (Lasalle, Schmidt). Such biomarkers could be critical, as early intervention can alter a child’s developmental trajectory. This research is framed by both discovery-mode and biologically-based conceptualizations of multifactorial causation.\nAnother major strength at UC Davis is in the area of pulmonary toxicology. Mechanistic studies by EHSC researchers investigating a wide range of exposures have demonstrated inflammatory and immune dysregulatory responses to methyl mercury, which increases transcriptional expression for pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8 (Vogel); aerosolized silver nanoparticles, which translocate to the rodent olfactory bulb and activate microglia (Van Winkle, Pinkerton); and particulate matter (PM) exposure during early life, which sensitizes the mouse lung to allergen challenges later in life in the absence of PM exposures (Pinkerton).\nCommunity engagement activities of the EHSC are focused primarily on the San Joaquin Valley, but also extend throughout the state. A Community Stakeholder Advisory Committee, consisting of representatives from coalitions concerned with environmental justice, issues of water and air quality and pesticide exposures, promotes the development of community-scientist partnerships. Several community-based or community-instigated pilot projects are in progress: an investigation of community water quality for reproductive effects using an experimental model in zebrafish; an economic analysis of health costs due to the adverse neurocognitive effects from exposures to organophosphate pesticides; a study of particulate air pollution in the region around the Salton Sea; among others.\nThe EHSC is also engaged in climate-related health concerns. As California has adopted a Climate Change Program covering both mitigation and adaptation and geared to protecting the health and safety of the population and our state’s natural and man-made resources, we are well-positioned to assist. Ongoing EHSC climate-related activities include: attention to enhanced air pollution exposures as ambient temperatures rise (Pinkerton); research on heat strain and associated acute kidney injury among farmworkers (Schenker); a recent workshop on domoic acid, a neurotoxin produced by harmful algal blooms all along the Pacific Coast that is contaminating seafood, requiring shutdowns of fisheries, and harming sea mammals; and a new project on magnification of heat stress in the elderly from housing/neighborhood characteristics (Ko). These latter two were launched in collaboration with California EPA’s Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment.\nFinally, EHSC members have served on a range of national advisory committees that influence public policy. Dr. Pessah served on the California EPA Developmental and Reproductive Toxicant Identification Committee (DARTIC) and US EPA Science Advisory Board’s Chemical Assessment Advisory Committee; Dr. Pinkerton serves on the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine Committee for Review of the Health Effects of Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS); Dr. Hertz-Picciotto chairs the National Academy of Medicine’s Committee on Veterans and Agent Orange. Dr. Pam Lein serves as an Expert Author for US EPA IRIS Assessment of PCBs and chairs the Scientific Advisory Board for the US Food and Drug Administration National Center for Toxicological Research. Dr. Tony Wexler is a member of the Scientific Advisory Committee, EPA Center for Air, Climate, and Energy Solutions, Carnegie Mellon University and University of Washington. Drs.

The core features of ASD include\n- Persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction\n- Restrictive and repetitive patterns of behavior, interests or activities\nThese symptoms exist on a spectrum, and are diagnosed based on severity and intensity of support required (very substantial support, substantial support, and support). Currently, ASD is estimated to occur in approximately 1 in 68 individuals. ASD disproportionately affects boys; however, the expression of the disorder is often more severe in girls. Despite advances indicating a genetic component, the causes of ASD remain largely unknown at this time.\nWhat is the role of the word spectrum in ASD?\nThere is a saying that if you’ve met one individual with ASD, you’ve only met one individual with ASD. This is because each individual diagnosed with ASD may present differently and require a different level of intervention.\nIn the category of persistent deficits in social communication and interaction, some individuals with ASD “requiring very substantial support” may have little or no verbal language. These individuals rarely initiate social interaction, and may not respond to social overtures from others. On the other side of the spectrum, individuals in need of “support” may be able to speak in full sentences, but struggle to engage in reciprocal conversations or to initiate and maintain friendships.\nIn terms of patterns of behavior, individuals requiring “very substantial support” may engage in self-stimulatory behavior (i.e., hand flapping) that severely limit functioning throughout the day. Behavior that exists on the other end of this spectrum may include difficulty transitioning between activities, as well as organizing and planning.\nOverall, it is important to remember that the behaviors in each domain that make up ASD may exist with varying severity and impact on day to day functioning.\nWhat are the most effective and evidence based treatments for ASD?\nRegardless of the severity of ASD symptoms, early and intensive intervention is universally considered to be best practice in treatment. Research on ASD intervention is primarily focused in two areas: Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) and Developmental Social Pragmatic (DSP).\n- ABA interventions are based primarily on the concept that difficulties associated with ASD can be addressed through the identification and reinforcement of specific target behaviors\n- DSP interventions are focused on improving the ability to jointly engage in activities with adults and peers.\nThe following is a more in depth look at evidence-based interventions for the treatment of ASD\n- The most notable treatment for ASD is Early Intensive Behavioral Intervention (EIBI). EIBI consists of 20-40 hours per week of treatment for 2-3 years. As previously indicated, earlier intervention is critical, and EIBI is recommended prior to 5 years of age. Comprehensive ABA programs are adult led, and focused on all areas of functional deficit. Most comprehensive programs begin with an assessment of age appropriate behavior milestones, which are then addressed by an individualized curriculum. Depending on level of support needed, therapy may take the form of Discrete Trial Training (DTT) or Natural Environment Teaching (NET). DTT is a highly structured teaching method in which skills are broken down and individually taught. Each trial is typically reinforced with a tangible reinforce (i.e., candy, toy). NET is primarily delivered in the natural environment, capitalizes on opportunities for incidental learning, and makes use of natural reinforcers in addition to tangibles.\n- Pivotal Response Training (PRT) – PRT is based on the principles of ABA, and primarily targets “pivotal” responses rather than individual target behaviors. Pivotal responses include: motivation, response to multiple stimuli, social interaction, as well as self-management. The overarching philosophy is that improvement of these pivotal responses will lead to improvement in a variety of other functional behaviors. As PRT is play based and child initiated, this intervention may be more effective for children who possess already established behaviors including: increased social initiation and toy play.\n- Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS) – PECS is an augmentative/alternative communication (AAC) intervention based on the principles of ABA. PECS encourages the initiation of communication. That is, the child must initiate a request by presenting a picture of a desired item to a communicative partner who then fulfills the request. As the child masters various stages, the communicative repertoire is expanded to include sentences, attributes, commenting, as well as the answering questions. PECS and other AAC devices are primarily used with minimally verbal children.\n- Early Start Denver Model (ESDM) – ESDM is a blend of both ABA and DSP approaches to treatment. ESDM integrates elements of a relationship-based approach with behaviorally based teaching strategies. Specifically, a therapist or parent is instructed to match their child’s affect and allow the child to lead the activity. The program is based on a developmental curriculum and outlines the skills that need to be taught at any given time. ESDM has been shown to be effective across a wide range of abilities.\nYou can click to learn more about our Applied Behavior Analysis services.\nIn addition to these treatments, there are a variety of treatments that are currently being thoroughly investigated. These interventions include various parent training techniques, DIR floortime, comprehensive classroom based approaches, as well as PCIT. It is important to keep an eye on the literature, as treatments are constantly evolving, and new randomized controlled studies are being completed.\nThe following article was utilized in the development of the above:\nTristram Smith & Suzannah Iadarola (2015) Evidence Base Update for Autism Spectrum Disorder, Journal of Clinical Child & Adolescent Psychology, 44:6, 897-922\nAs the variety of intervention strategies for ASD has increased significantly over time, this article was chosen, as it is the most recent evaluation of what is currently offered in the field. The future directions for research stated by the authors place value on treatments that are emerging as evidence based, supporting the notion that any review of evidence based treatment must be as recent as possible.\nWritten by Ariel Kornblum, PsyD, BCBA, LBA"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:93aeb2c3-8ef9-4b16-a195-975ab8af8c5d>","<urn:uuid:c430fd78-133a-47f8-8ded-888fbe4029e9>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the traditional methods of reactive power compensation in power grids, and how are modern power electronic solutions transforming this landscape? ⚡","answer":"Traditional reactive power compensation methods primarily relied on electrostatic capacitors and synchronous compensators for centralized compensation on the high voltage side. Shunt capacitor compensation remains widely used, while synchronous compensators, though beneficial for stable operation through smooth reactive current adjustment, have limited application due to high costs and maintenance complexity. Modern power electronic solutions have revolutionized compensation through three main approaches: as switching capacitors with zero voltage conduction capability, as reactive power output regulation switches with high-frequency control, and as power electronic current converters like STATCON and Active Power Filters (APF). These modern solutions, particularly static var generators (SVG) and active power filters, offer advantages such as fast response times, continuous adjustment capability, and the ability to simultaneously address both harmonic and reactive power issues. The evolution continues with distributed generation systems, particularly solar inverters, being recognized for their potential to provide reactive power support at the distribution level, as demonstrated in European countries like Germany.","context":["1.Standard requirement of reactive power for power quality of grid\nThe national standard GB12325-90 “Allowable Deviation of Power Quality Supply Voltage” has specified the principle of reactive power compensation for each voltage level of power grid. According to the standard, reactive power should be compensated locally as far as possible to reduce reactive power flow on the grid. For distribution lines of 10kV and below, the voltage network of the common distribution transformer can be properly dispersed and installed with 0.4kV low-voltage capacitor banks that can be switched, so that the line can meet the compensation requirements at the maximum load and no reactive power back-off occurs at the minimum load. For allowable deviation of power supply voltage, the sum of absolute value of positive and negative deviation of power supply voltage of 35kV and above shall not exceed 10% of rated voltage, the allowable deviation of three-phase power supply voltage of 10kV and below shall be 7% of rated voltage, and the allowable deviation of 220V single-phase power supply voltage shall be +7% and -10% of rated voltage. Voltage deviation is defined as the difference between the actual voltage and the rated voltage when the voltage change rate is less than 1% per second.\nState department standard SD325-89 “electric power system voltage and reactive power technical guideline (try out)” regulation, reactive power and reactive power load of the power system should be used when peak or trough points (voltage) layer and the (electric) area basic balance principle, configuration and operation, to avoid the long lines or multistage transmit reactive power transformer.\n2.Reactive power requirements for grid loads\nReactive power is very important to the operation of power supply system and load. Most of the load in the distribution system is inductive, such as for ventilation, air conditioning, water pump asynchronous motor, many fluorescent lamps used for lighting, as well as for communication and computer system rectifier, electronic voltage regulation power supply. Among them, motors, fluorescent lamps and other loads as well as transformers and reactors must consume reactive power to work normally, which is determined by their own electrical characteristics; And frequency converter, rectifier and electronic regulated power supply and other power electronic device usually adopt phased approach, the ac current often lags behind the voltage, they not only should consume large amounts of reactive power, but also produce a large amount of harmonic current, even simple diode rectifier device, although the basic phase ac voltage current, but as a result of current waveform distortion, The large amount of harmonic current generated also consumes reactive power. In order to transmit active power, a certain phase difference between the voltage at the transmitting end and the voltage at the receiving end is required, while in order to transmit reactive power, a difference between the voltage at the two ends is required, which can only be achieved within a very narrow range. Obviously, it would be unreasonable and often impossible for all this reactive power to be supplied by generators and transmitted over long distances.\nIf the reactive power in the power grid is in short supply, the electrical equipment will not have enough reactive power to establish a normal electromagnetic field, then these electrical equipment can not maintain the rated condition of work, the terminal voltage of the electrical equipment will drop, thus affecting the normal operation of the electrical equipment. For example, the electromagnetic torque of an asynchronous motor running in a power system is proportional to the square of its terminal voltage. When the voltage is reduced by 10%, the electromagnetic torque is reduced by approximately 19%. At this time, if the resistance of the mechanical load driven by the motor is unchanged, the slip rate of the motor will increase, the heating will increase, and the temperature of the winding will increase, which accelerates the aging of the insulating medium and greatly affects its service life.\n3.Reactive power quality problems of existing power grid\nThe influence of reactive power on power grid is mainly in the following aspects.\n(1) Increase the capacity of equipment The increase of reactive power will lead to the increase of current and apparent power, so as to increase the capacity of generators, transformers and other electrical equipment and wire capacity. At the same time, the size and specification of power users’ starting and controlling equipment and measuring instruments should also be increased.\n(2) Equipment and line loss increase The increase of reactive power, so that the total current increases, so that the loss of equipment and line increases.\n(3) the voltage drop in the line and transformer increase If is impact of reactive power load, but also can make the sharp fluctuations in voltage, reduce the power supply quality, in recent years, with the use of the large capacity motor and other perceptual load, the power system reactive power problem there are three new characteristics: one is the increase of demand of reactive power is larger; Second, the fluctuation of reactive power is large; Third, the reactive power problem is often accompanied by harmonic problems. The direct consequence of the traditional reactive power problem to the power system is the reduction of the system voltage. Now the reactive power problem not only brings the voltage reduction problem, but also affects the voltage stability problem. Several large area power outages in recent years in the world are either caused by reactive power problems directly or accompanied by voltage collapse in power outages. In China, the present structure and used to have a lot of different load, the current due to the large increase in the so-called “bad load”, such as air conditioning load as well as the large capacity electric arc furnace and so on, causes the sudden increase to the power grid reactive power demand makes the grid voltage continue to reduce, the traditional reactive compensation devices (parallel capacitor) of reactive power output is greatly reduced, This could drag the grid voltage to the brink of collapse.\nIn addition, due to the imbalance between the development of power supply and load, the distribution of reactive power compensation capacity in various regions is unreasonable, resulting in excess reactive power compensation in some regions, resulting in high voltage, while in some regions, reactive power compensation is insufficient, the voltage is low, and even high and low voltage coexist in some regions. This is also the result of the current reactive power can not be done in situ compensation, so it is difficult to achieve the reactive power partition, hierarchical balance.\n4.Methods of reactive power compensation\nThe role of reactive power compensation is:\n(1) improve the power factor of power supply and electricity system and load, reduce the capacity of equipment, reduce power loss;\n(2) Stabilize the voltage of the receiving end and the power grid, improve the quality of power supply, and set the dynamic reactive power compensation device at the appropriate place in the long-distance transmission line can also improve the stability of the transmission system, improve the transmission capacity;\n(3) In the three-phase unbalanced situation, through the appropriate reactive power compensation can balance the three-phase active power and reactive power load.\nThe early reactive power compensation devices are electrostatic capacitors and synchronous compensators, which are mainly used in the high voltage side of the system for centralized compensation. Shunt capacitor compensation is still one of the main compensation methods and has a wide range of applications. The essence of synchronous compensator is synchronous motor. When the excitation current changes, the motor can change the magnitude and direction of the output reactive current smoothly, which is very beneficial to the stable operation of the power system. However, the application of synchronous compensator is limited due to its high cost, complex installation and difficult maintenance. At present, the static reactive power compensator combined with power electronic technology is widely used. In the reactive power compensation technology, the local compensation is the most ideal one, but the load has the characteristics of large dispersion and large quantity. The reactive power compensation device is required to be small in size, low in cost, easy to operate, easy to maintain and install, and must be capable of dynamic compensation. Limited by technology, dynamic compensation has not been well developed in the early stage of reactive power compensation. In the past 30 years, with the development of power semiconductor devices and power electronics application technology, this problem has been solved. Thyristor switching capacitor (TSC) and thyristor controlled reactor (TCR) are the two most widely used devices at present.\nReactive power compensation and power electronics technology are combined in three ways. One is as a switching capacitor. Because of the short response time of power semiconductor switch, it can accurately choose the Angle of capacitor switching, realize zero voltage conduction, avoid the generation of inrush current, and improve the reliability of capacitor use and the stability of power system. The second is as a reactive power output regulation switch. Because of the high switching frequency of power electronic devices, it is convenient to control the conduction Angle of capacitor current, so as to realize the continuous regulation of reactive power and fast track the change of load reactive power. The third is the introduction of power electronic current converter technology, which uses the converter as a reactive power source to compensate the reactive power, such as static switching camera (STATCON) and active filtering (APF).\nAt present, the commonly used reactive compensation device for static var generator (SVG), its basic principle is to phase bridge type circuit through the reactor or directly on the grid in parallel, properly adjust the ac output voltage of bridge type circuit, phase and amplitude or direct control of the ac current, can make the circuit absorption or meet the requirements of reactive current, Realize the purpose of dynamic reactive power compensation. The essence is to use the voltage difference between the output voltage of the inverter and the voltage of the grid on the output reactance of the inverter to form the required reactive compensation current. By controlling the amplitude of the output voltage of the inverter and its phase relative to the voltage of the grid, the nature and magnitude of the reactive power absorbed by SVG can be controlled. The specific control methods for SVG to generate required reactive current by adjusting the reference value of reactive current can be divided into indirect control and direct control. The former indirectly controls the AC side current of SVG by controlling the phase and amplitude of the AC voltage fundamental wave generated by the SVG converter. The latter is the use of tracking PWM control technology on the inverter output current waveform instantaneous value feedback control, its response speed and control accuracy than indirect control method has been greatly improved. The connection mode between inverter and load can be divided into series compensation and parallel compensation. The former uses the transformer to compensate the series voltage, which is actually equivalent to phase-shifting control voltage source. The latter, in turn, acts as a current source, absorbing capacitive (or inductive) reactive current from the system. At present, the parallel stationary reactive power generator is widely used, and its advantage is easy to control. In addition, multilevel technology is widely used in stationary phase modulators, which greatly increases the capacity of reactive compensators.\nAs the instantaneous reactive power theory is put forward, there is a used for dynamic suppress harmonic and compensate reactive power of the new power electronic devices – active power filter (APF), its structure and SVG is similar, but the detection signal decomposition and the way of processing, can achieve at the same time for harmonic elimination and reactive power compensation, and both can be realized respectively. Its advantages are that it has a very fast response to the change of the compensation object, can be adjusted continuously and does not need redundant energy storage components, and will not occur resonance problem. However, there are still some problems such as high cost, low compensation capacity, complicated realization and difficult elimination of high harmonics. With the development of power semiconductor devices towards large capacity and high frequency, this kind of devices which can compensate both harmonic and reactive power must have a good development prospect. In addition, the integrated flow controller (UPFC) is a kind of more novel power regulator, it use converter changing string concatenated transformer and superimposed on the phase voltage transmission line voltage, make its amplitude and phase Angle can change continuously, so as to realize on a line of active and reactive power adjustment accurately, and can increase transmission capacity and dampening system oscillation, It has the advantage of flexible operation.","Utilities deliver both active (or real) power and reactive (or imaginary) power along their distribution lines. Real power does the actual work when you flip on a light switch. Certain energy loads, such as motors and refrigerators, include energy storage elements that periodically need to reverse the direction of energy flow. This electric power from stored electromagnetic energy, which returns to the source in each cycle, is known as reactive power.\nUtilities care about reactive power because, even though it does no work at the point of consumption, it is needed to maintain voltage to deliver active power. Do you remember the largest blackout in U.S. history that surged through the Northeast in 2003? The cause for this, and several other major blackouts, can largely be attributed to a severe shortage of reactive power, which failed to maintain voltage along major power routes.\nUtilities can produce any combination of kilowatts and VARs (Volt-Ampere-Reactive units measure reactive power) but they must constantly focus on maintaining the right balance. Motors and other reactive power requirements impact that balance, meaning that any imbalances are generally located near the motors. Because VAR support comes from utility generators that are located far from load, distributed generation (DG) provides the potential for a new way to provide VAR support – by using the inverters on solar arrays connected to distribution circuits to help create a more balanced and reliable grid.\nIn a similar vein, this also means that inverters with reactive power capability may be able help utilities accommodate higher penetrations of photovoltaics (PV) on the distribution grid with fewer grid upgrades.\nIt seems like a win-win situation, no?\nInterestingly however, the ability of DG systems to provide VAR support has largely been ignored in the U.S., generally because any policy action has been too complex to implement. That may be starting to change, with three recent and somewhat noteworthy policy developments.\n- Last October, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) made a move toward formally recognizing the benefits of reactive power. On October 17, FERC issued an order that requires jurisdictional entities providing reactive power to formally file reactive power rates with the commission, even though the rate schedule would provide no compensation for such a service.\n- In California, this issue recently came up in a Smart Inverter Working Group that IREC has been participating in over the past several months. The group put forth their recommendations for inverter capabilities regarding reactive power in a highly technical report, starting on page 32, section 2.4.5. California is proactively addressing some of these technical matters in order to lay out the technical steps needed to accommodate high solar penetration and to optimize DG resources.\n- And in January, the Planning Committee for PJM, the regional transmission operator serving the mid-Atlantic states, gave near unanimous approval to a problem statement and issue charge to explore whether to require renewables such as solar PV to install enhanced or “smart” inverters that can produce and absorb reactive power in addition to inverting DC power to AC. However, any smart inverter requirement is not likely to come about until PJM goes through the approval process to revise IEEE 1547 Standard for Interconnecting Distributed Resources with Electric Power Systems.\nThis topic is certainly nothing new, however. Germany and other European countries have been relying on reactive support from DG systems for quite a while. And FERC has long espoused the host of ancillary benefits, including reactive power, that DG can provide to create a more stable and reliable grid.\nIn a 2007 report, FERC noted that, “on a local basis there are opportunities for electric utilities to use DG to reduce peak loads, to provide ancillary services such as reactive power and voltage support, and to improve power quality.”\nWhile implementing ancillary services and VAR support at the distribution level will still require significant technical and regulatory changes, these recent actions are promising. At the least, they’re a signal from the powers-that-be that we will need to shift how we approach utility services, from a technical standpoint, in order to safely accommodate the rapid growth of distributed resources."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:f7599eb2-c0de-45bc-b51a-45cf4074f05c>","<urn:uuid:19946764-a1c7-4e59-8b2e-394f4d7afdc5>"],"error":null}

In doing this, it assists in improving the business relationship with the customers of the company. The resulting impact is a driven growth of sales for the company.\nIn most cases, CRM is designed with the aim of compiling information from customers’ organization channels. In other words, Fogleman (2013) donates that it is a point of contact between the company and the customers through direct emails, social media, websites, live chat, and marketing materials among others. CRM is adopted in three primary systems which include CRM Software, CRM Technology Market, and Cloud Solution.\nCRM Software- CRM software helps in consolidating the documents and information from the customers into a single database to enable users’ to access and manage the information. It is essential for the automation of various workflow processes within the organization such as alerts, calendars, and relevant tasks that are essential to customer service. It thus gives the management the ability to track performance as well as productivity by the customer information that has been logged into the system\nCloud-Solution-It is a cloud-based system that is adopted as a CRM to provide real-time customer or company data or information to sales agents both in the office. It becomes effective as long as the devices used are internet connected i.e. laptops, smartphones, tablets, etc. However, if the company faces off/goes out of business, the access of the information can be compromised.\nCRM Technology Market- Adopts the use of salesforce.com, SAP, Oracle, and Microsoft as the main vendors preferred by many companies. The technology unites the administration, security, maintenance, and control functions of the database and the company information. However, it resides on the server of the organization and adopts the use of cloud computing hence allowing access to information in a remote place.\nIn the adoption of CRM, there are many challenges experienced by the companies. Some of them include;\n- Difficulty in developing a ‘single view customer’ when different data sets are organized in a single dashboard.\n- Reduced customer experience as a result of poor handling of technical support and long wait times on phone calls\n- Duplicate or outdated information slows down the data processing.\nAdopting CRM in the organization has many benefits i.e. enables easy management of customer information, improves business relationship with the customers, and enables a company to retain the existing customers. Namhee and McLean (2014) also denote that adopting proper CRM in a company increases sales due to increase in the customers through better services\nEffective and satisfactory customer service requires an organization to adopt proper customer service strategy.

{"question":"How do the financial returns of Moon versus Safety Not Guaranteed demonstrate the evolving market for sci-fi storytelling?","answer":"The financial performance of these films reveals interesting patterns in sci-fi storytelling success. Moon, with a $5 million budget, grossed $9.7 million worldwide, while Safety Not Guaranteed, made for just $200,000, earned over $4 million, making it relatively more successful. This aligns with the broader trend in science fiction where the focus has shifted from expensive technical elements to compelling social narratives. As mentioned in discussions of modern science fiction trends, the genre has moved away from pure technological focus since the 1950s, emphasizing social change and human stories instead. This is reflected in the market success of lower-budget films that prioritize strong character development and storytelling over special effects.","context":["Why science fiction films help us study the future\nUniversities and think tanks have always been skilled at archiving the past and analysing the present. But what about the future? Why were we so unprepared for the COVID-19 pandemic? And how will new technologies – ranging from artificial intelligence and robotics to so-called ‘human augmentation’ – impact our societies? In this first contribution of our new topic ‘Tomorrow’s Worlds’, Etienne F. Augé argues that science fiction is a valuable source of inspiration for political analysts offering us a better grip on the future.\nIn the West, most of us are used to a comfortable lifestyle. We can plan ahead due to good health care, a decent pension, and an overall feeling of security. This bubble of safety is sometimes punctured by a crisis, from terrorist attacks to a global pandemic or rumours of a war against China.\nEven though Western governments are better prepared for crises than their counterparts in less developed countries, they remain taken by surprise when the next ‘unforeseen’ crisis hits them. One reason is that governments as well as ordinary citizens are faced with an exponential amount of data.1 Distinguishing between relevant and irrelevant factors and developments becomes harder by the day. Our world has moved from ‘big data’ to ‘impossible-to-handle data’.\nEven ambitious projects from well-funded organisations, like Global Trends 2040 of the American National Intelligence Council2 , often tend to be wrong about their predictions of the future, and are usually rather vague about them. Other well-known initiatives such as Shell’s future scenarios3 , tend to be off the mark for the simple reason that this powerful Anglo-Dutch oil company simply cannot imagine a future where they themselves would become marginalised.\nIt is difficult to blame these organisations as predicting the future remains a nigh impossible task\nThere are numerous reasons why such large, powerful companies like Shell fail to predict the future with some accuracy. One obvious reason is groupthink, a psychological phenomenon that pushes a group to find consensus rather than examine daring ideas. Another could be vested interest, since thinking ‘outside the box’ and imagining a future without Shell is a real career killer for any Shell-employee. A last reason could simply be a lack of imagination, as relying on trends alone often results in tunnel vision, which certainly clouds a clear vision of the future.\nIt is difficult to blame these organisations as predicting the future remains a nigh impossible task. There are numerous past forecasts that got it notoriously wrong. Orrin E. Dunlap Jr. from The New York Times did not see a future for television in 1939, as the “problem with television is that the people must sit and keep their eyes glued on a screen; the average American family hasn’t time for it”.4 Thomas Watson, chairman of IBM, announced in 1943 that there may be “a world market for maybe five computers”.5 And Steve Ballmer, former CEO of Microsoft, famously laughed at the iPhone in 2007, seeing no future in it.6\nFutures Studies: a new idea?\nDespite the many mishaps, it is of course possible to think about the future and design desirable futures – often on the basis of different scenarios. So-called ‘Futures Studies’ have developed extensive methodologies to do exactly that, and a host of futurists are working fulltime around the globe imagining our future, providing scenarios to make humanity better prepared and more resilient to change.\nThis is hardly a novel idea. As early as 1932, one of the founding parents of science fiction, British author H.G. Wells, broadcast on the BBC a short plea entitled ‘Wanted – Professors of Foresight!’ He remarked: “It seems an odd thing to me that though we have thousands and thousands of professors and hundreds of thousands of students of history working upon the records of the past, there is not a single person anywhere who makes a whole-time job of estimating the future consequences of new inventions and new devices. There is not a single Professor of Foresight in the world. But why shouldn't there be?”7\nIt took some time before Wells’ advice was followed. Studying the future has only become part of academic research and teaching since the 1960s. During all phases of the Cold War, strategic planning – including playing so-called ‘War games’ – was considered essential to prepare for an uncertain future.\nFor Western governments, it became existential to imagine how new technologies – ranging from satellites to computers, and from television to the internet – would affect their prosperity and security\nIn 1964 the US-based RAND Corporation famously published the Report on a Long-Range Forecasting Study, stating: “The fact remains, however, for better or for worse, trend predictions – implicit or explicit, ‘scientific’ or intuitive – about periods as far as twenty or even fifty years in the future do affect current planning decisions (or lack of the same) in such areas as national defense, urban renewal, resource development, etc.”8\nThinking about the future was not just a frivolous exercise. For Western governments, it became existential to imagine how new technologies – ranging from satellites to computers, and from television to the internet – would affect their prosperity and security.9 Futures Studies were called upon not only to predict crises, but also to imagine and design better policies concerning all societal sectors, from defence to energy, from education to food, and from supply chains to geopolitics.\nWhat remains surprising is that many experts working in Futures Studies hardly watch science fiction, let alone read it. Most experts dismiss the genre as unserious, a teenage distraction at best. According to its critics, science fiction is barely science, and usually involves poor writing.\nThis bad reputation is largely undeserved and science fiction is often misunderstood. Though there certainly is plenty ‘cheap’ science fiction, some authors have had a lasting impact on societies – think about Isaac Asimov’s ideas on robotics, Philip K. Dick on philosophy, or Frank Herbert on ecology. The list is impressive, and way too long for a single article. Science fiction has had a major impact on our societies, mainly because it has constantly reinvented itself.\nScience fiction is hard to define. One of its best writers, Norman Spinrad, claimed “science fiction is anything published as science fiction”.10 This generous definition would also include famous mainstream authors into the category of science fiction. George Orwell’s 1984 is a classic work of fiction, but rarely recognised as science fiction, although Orwell imagines a future dystopia for a reason, namely to avoid it.\nThe category or term science fiction has become a bit of a misnomer. Science was indeed the focus when science fiction started off with authors like Mary Shelley, Jules Verne, and Wells. Today, the element of science is of decreasing importance to the genre, since it has become clear that technology is hardly the answer to all human problems. Since the 1950s, the focus of science fiction is on possible future social change, rather than technology per se. Clearly, authors have drawn lessons from Auschwitz and Hiroshima: science and technology in the wrong hands could well mean the end of humanity.\nModern science fiction trends like hopepunk11 barely make use of technology for their stories, where steampunk – another major trend in science fiction – even creates a uchronia (an idealised or fictional conception of a particular period of time, especially in the past)12 where steam power has again become the main source of energy. The Handmaid's Tale, currently a popular TV show initially based on Margaret Atwood’s novel, also imagines a future world centred around technological regression rather than scientific progress.13\nScience fiction as a source of inspiration\nScience fiction can be a remarkable source of inspiration for Futures Studies as it continually asks the question: what if? The genre can also be used as a sandbox to turn over new ideas, since one of the main purposes of the genre is to discover and invent.\n‘What if cars could fly?’ is a trope in science fiction, but science fiction goes much deeper and questions present societal models by imagining alternative ones. What if women and men were equal in rights? What if earth was not the centre of the universe and aliens really exist? What if artificial intelligence could help us overcome issues such inequality or misinformation? The list is endless, or only limited by our imagination.\nThe global pandemic we are living through today, has been the topic of many works of science fiction\nScience fiction can also be used to prevent the worst from happening, by presenting possible future challenges and problems that today’s policymakers decide to ignore, often for lack of a long-term vision. The global pandemic we are living through today, has been the topic of many works of science fiction: I am Legend in 1954, that inspired three later film adaptations; 12 Monkeys (1995); and more recently the movie Contagion (2011, by Steven Soderbergh14 ).\nThe rise of robots is another favourite topic among science fiction writers and is becoming dangerously close to reality since drones may have attacked humans fully autonomously for the first time in 2021.15 Another classic science fiction theme is the end of the world, though the main difference with religious prophecies is we can avoid doom by reacting soon enough, redemption not being provided by a megalomaniac deity but by societies changing together. Hopefully.\nDue to its spectacular and imaginative qualities, science fiction is Hollywood’s most profitable genre. Today, science fiction movies and television shows comprise about one third of all Netflix productions.\nBoth the US army16 and the French military17 are using the power of science fiction to get better prepared for future conflicts or crises. For modern armies, it is crucial to be able to anticipate how terrorism or guerrilla warfare might evolve, and science fiction writers are able to provide possible scenarios for future conflicts.\nScience fiction is also a major source of inspiration for Silicon Valley’s high-tech companies. Would the ‘metaverse’18 envisioned by the company formerly known as Facebook exist without a description of the next frontier in Neal Stephenson’s Snow Crash? Even in Stephenson’s novel, the metaverse is owned and controlled by a giant corporation known as the Global Multimedia Protocol Group. This tends to show that science fiction has a major power to make things happen through self-fulfilling prophecies – for better or for worse.\nAutocratic states like the People’s Republic of China and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia are also embracing the power of the genre, after initially having strongly rejected science fiction. Recently, Saudi Arabia has commissioned the public relations firm Ruder Finn to promote ‘Neom’, the Saudi mega-city of the future inspired by science fiction.19\nIt seems today that controlling the future contributes to controlling the present, as more and more entities embrace the power of science fiction to literally capture imagination\nNeom is pitched as a city of the future based on “sustainable living” and “focused on setting new standards for community health, environmental protection, and the effective and productive use of technology”, at an initial 500 billion US dollars. Interestingly, Saudi Arabia now brands itself as a future oriented country, sponsoring the UNESCO Future Literacy Summit in 202020 and hosting the 2022 World Science Fiction Convention.\nThe People’s Republic of China has decided to actively encourage science fiction writing ever since they realised that most Silicon Valley inventors and designers were avid science fiction fans, as Neil Gaiman explained in a wonderful conversation with Kazuo Ishiguro.21 Since the Chinese government remains keen on its control over its citizens, special guidelines have been issued to make sure China is depicted in the best way possible.22\n“Who controls the past controls the future: who controls the present controls the past”, George Orwell famously claimed in his 1984. It seems today that controlling the future contributes to controlling the present, as more and more entities embrace the power of science fiction to literally capture imagination.\nUsing science fiction\nScience fiction can still be used for the greater good. Combining scientific methods with the capacity of stimulating imagination from science fiction can lead to a powerful tool to anticipate the future, or make it happen. For that reason, science fiction has become ‘trendy’ as organisations understand that, beyond Futures Studies, there should also be a narrative motivating societies to embrace change.\nEven the United Nations, usually cautious about innovation, has decided to make use of science fiction as an inspiration for its mission, challenging so-called dystopia with better futures imagined with science fiction.23 For now, the European Union remains hesitant to follow the UN’s example. Science fiction could nevertheless help the EU tremendously by creating inclusive scenarios for desirable futures, reducing declinism and limiting fears of tomorrow.\nThere is a long road before academia incorporates Futures Studies as part of all curricula, but we better start today than tomorrow\nThe time might therefore be ripe for giving voice to a new kind of expert who is able to combine ‘traditional’ Futures Studies methodology with storytelling skills to lead societies away from doomsday-thinking. A prime example of such an initiative can be found in Arizona State University (AZU), where the Center for Science and the Imagination collaborates with established science fiction writers like Kim Stanley Robinson, but also with up and coming authors to imagine better futures.24\nIn 2015, inspired by AZU, Erasmus University Rotterdam established the special program called ‘The Consortium’ aimed to combine university-based research skills and creativity, academia and the ‘real world’, and bright students and experienced professionals – all geared towards generating scenarios for the future; hopefully desirable ones. In a world where neither Francis Fukuyama nor Samuel P. Huntington have been right about their vision of the world of the future, we believed it was high time to train our students to design the future they want and be ready for unplanned catastrophic scenarios.\nThere is a long road before academia incorporates Futures Studies as part of all curricula, but we better start today than tomorrow. As Wells warned us in 1932: “Because if it is not to be peace foreseen and planned and established, then it will be disaster and death. Will there be no Foresight until those bombs begin to rain upon us?”7\n- The future of Overcapitalism: Metropolis (1927)\n- The future of Humanity: 2001: a Space Odyssey (1968)\n- The future of the Universe: Solaris (1972)\n- The future of Humans: Blade Runner (1982)\n- The future of Society: Minority Report (2002)\n- The future of our moon: Moon (2009)\n- The present of robots: Animatrix (2013)\n- The future of Time: Predestination (2014)\n- No future: Mad Max: Fury Road (2015)\n- The future of Earth: Aniara (2018)\n- The future of Space: Ad Astra (2019)\n- 1According to the World Economic Forum, the entire digital universe was around 44 zettabytes in 2020, which translates into 44.000.000.000.000.000.000.000 bytes.

This includes creating films that “highlight Chinese values, inherit Chinese culture and aesthetics, cultivate contemporary Chinese innovation” as well as “disseminate scientific thought” and “raise the spirit of scientists.” Chinese sci-fi films should thus portray China in a positive light as a technologically advanced nation.

Let’s take a look at them here, from highest to lowest in terms of budget.\nIn Moon, Sam Rockwell stars as “Sam Bell,” an isolated helium-3 miner about to complete a three-year tour of duty on the far side of the moon. His only company is a robot GERTY (voiced by Kevin Spacey), and he suffers greatly from faulty communications with Earth which only allow him to send one-way messages to his wife.\nAs his stint comes to a close, Sam begins hallucinating and having increasingly bizarre experiences, and ultimately discovers unexpected information about the true nature of his assignment.\nWhat makes Moon shine as a sci-fi story is its unusual and isolated setting, compelling acting, and intriguing food-for-thought twist at the end.\nMoon was co-written by director Duncan Jones and screenwriter Nathan Parker. They set out to keep the budget limited to $5 million by limiting the cast size and filming in a studio (source: Wikipedia). The movie grossed $9.7 million worldwide and won many awards.\nSleep Dealer is a fascinating study in low-budget sci-fi. Although it didn’t perform well in the box office (perhaps because it was only released in 18 theaters), as a sci-fi story I thought it deserved more attention.\nIt’s an intriguing tale of Mexican workers doing grunt work across the border in the United States via remote controlled robots. They’re connected to their alter-egos through a network accessed by cables implanted into their backs and arms. Just as Mexican migrant workers perform many of today’s heavy labor tasks, so do these workers — but from a place “safely” across the border, where they are worn out by their late night hours, desperate to make an income.\nThe story raises interesting social inequity questions, much as Elysium did (albeit at a much higher budget).\nOf the four films, Sleep Dealer is the one that truly tackles social commentary in the way sci-fi is known for.\nAnother Earth embodies a simple sci-fi concept that’s well-executed: What if there was another Earth, and an identical copy of you was present on that mirror planet?\nA young woman, played by actress Brit Marling, struggles to redeem a horrific mistake — a drama playing out under the glow of this duplicate, mirror Earth. When she realizes there’s a chance for redemption tied to the duplicate planet, she enters an essay contest to try to win a civilian ticket to the mirror world.\nThe budget for Another Earth was a $750,000, brought in $1.7 million in the box office, and won awards.\nWhat made the movie so powerful were the tragic circumstances the character created and her painful path to try to recover from them. The sci-fi element of the story was always present — the second Earth was a constant backdrop — but that was the only visual effect necessary. The story felt like science fiction primarily through implication, which I thought worked brilliantly.\nSafety Not Guaranteed\nIn Safety Not Guaranteed, a young magazine intern, Darius, played by Aubrey Plaza, gets picked by one of the magazine writers to go with him and another intern to research the story behind a classified ad that reads:\n“Wanted: Somebody to go back in time with me. This is not a joke. P.O. Box 91 Ocean View, WA 99393. You’ll get paid after we get back. Must bring your own weapons. Safety not guaranteed. I have only done this once before.”\nWhat makes this movie so terrific are the kooky, ever-so-slightly-over-the-top characters and Darius’s growth arc from her reluctance to enjoy life to a more go-for-it spirit. As in Another Earth, the actual sci-fi element is there primarily through conversation and implication: Is this time travel guy for real, or not? Delightfully, you don’t discover the answer until the very end. (And I’m not going to tell you what it is, either.)\nThe budget for Safety Not Guaranteed was a mere $200,000 and it grossed over $4 million, making it the most financially successful of the bunch. The movie also won several awards.\nBudget-Box Office Comparison\nLet’s take a look at how the four movies compared in terms of budget and box office. Isn’t it fascinating that the lowest budget performed the best at the box office, relative to its budget?\n|Sleep Dealer (2008)||$2,500,000||$107,559|\n|Another Earth (2011)||$750,000||$1,776,935|\n|Safety Not Guaranteed (2012)||$200,000||$4,010,957|\nSo what can we take away from all this?\n- Keep the budget low by keeping it simple. One idea, well-executed, can go a long way.As Chris Soth said in one Sci-Fi Circuit column, “Stick to one ‘What if?’ or change and play out the unexpected consequences of it.”\n- Sci-fi aspects can be minor background elements and still significantly impact the tone and genre. Although Safety isn’t even listed in IMDB as “sci-fi” — and it arguably isn’t — the sci-fi tweak on the story was what hooked me and kept me wondering throughout.\n- Great roles and great acting still count, even in the low budget market — and perhaps more so. Every single one of these movies had compelling story lines, stakes, and characters.\n- A limited cast size can help keep the budget low too. Each of these movies had just a few core characters: One in Moon, three in Sleep Dealer, two in Another Earth, and two to four in Safety (depending on how you count).\n- Sci-fi is everywhere. I’m struck by how much sci-fi material is out there for the taking with a little creative brainstorming and a willingness to see it through. And it doesn’t require complex world-building, alien races, or advanced technology to make the sci-fi magic we know and love. How cool is that?\nThanks for reading!\n- Getting a Grip on the Sci-Fi Market with Dan Gordon by Jenna Avery\n- Breaking Into the Sci-Fi Spec Market with Shane Joseph Willis by Jenna Avery\n- Sci-Fi Circuit: Sci-Fi Storytelling, Part 1 — Story Type, Mistakes, & Big Ideas with Chris Soth, by Jenna Avery\n- Sci-Fi Storytelling, Part 2 – Structure, Budget, & What’s Next with Chris Soth, by Jenna Avery\nGet more tips on writing sci-fi in Steve Duncan’s webinar\nWrite Sci-Fi Film & Television Scripts That Sell"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"language-ambiguous"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:41cf21ad-95dd-489f-a0e9-7f72685fc8a5>","<urn:uuid:fda63612-b287-46ac-b211-6495e03422b5>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Looking to start hobby projects - what are safety considerations for soldering both electronics and stained glass, and what materials should I avoid?","answer":"Key safety considerations include: 1) Eye protection is essential - safety glasses are crucial as you only get one set of eyes and repairs are difficult. 2) Regarding materials, it's recommended to use lead-free solder for electronics to avoid toxic metals. For stained glass, different solder types have different properties - 50/50 can handle higher temperatures than 60/40, while lead-free solder requires more heat and patience to achieve good results. When setting up your workspace, use a reusable board or thick non-corrugated cardboard to protect your work surface. Additionally, always use a proper soldering iron stand to prevent accidents and maintain proper ventilation when working with any type of solder.","context":["Certainly there are lots of electronics and kits that have entered Makers’ lives lately. Some people already know how to solder, but many people are just getting started. Amy posted a comment voicing her frustration at learning the seemingly guild like skill of soldering.\nBelow are my notes to Amy, which seemed like it would be handy information to others as well.\nIt can be done, this soldering thing.\nHere are a few things that I try to keep in mind.\nSetting up on a reusable board or thick cardboard (not the corrugated kind) is good, because cleanup will be easy, and you won’t run the risk of messing up the table.\nA decent iron is nice, but a cheap one can do. Turn off the cheap irons when not in use, because the tip seems to dissolve if left on. You don’t need to spend lots of money on a fine expensive tool if you are just figuring it out. You can learn how to do it on a cheap or borrowed iron, then when and if you can recognize the difference and value, then spend the money or talk somebody into gifting you a good one. Lots of people like the temperature controlled ones from Weller.\nKeep the tip clean. A wet sponge works, but I like steel wool better. Wipe the tip periodically. The sponge will cool the tip when you want it to be hot.\nA soldering iron stand is good, but at least keep the business end of the iron from burning a hole through the board and onto the table.\nThin, lead free solder is good. Try to stay away from the lead based stuff. See the earlier comment about metals and the badness they cause.\nMost people only get one set of eyes. Replacements are difficult to have installed. You are better off to take care of the pair or one you have, than to get them repaired later. Wear your safety glasses while doing dangerous stuff.\nRecognize the components:\nPretty much all electronic components have markings on them. Mostly they are done in small white print, but resistors are indicated with color bands. Look at the parts list, and search the markings on any components you are not familiar with. If you put a single diode or LED in backwards, that could be the problem that makes your circuit not work. Check and double check. Search for the things you have, and look at pictures of them. Check the documentation that comes with any kit you have for notes about what the components look like and how to handle them.\nLooking at the pdf for the kit Amy mentioned, there are a few things that could slip you up. LEDs, transistors and capacitors are all polarized in this circuit. Make sure they are all in the right orientation. The transistor might be exotic, here is a page that has datasheets for it. l According to this page, you could use a 2N3904 to replace the BC547. The 3904 is a pretty common transistor, you should be able to harvest one out some junk device like a radio or toy.\nResistors are not polarized, but the color bands are completely essential to get right. Resistors regulate the flow of the current in the circuit. Electricity will always follow the path of least resistance. If you have a high value resistor in a place that calls for a low value one, electricity will not flow where it should. You can read them by looking at the colors. There are lots of great resistor color code calculators. Here is one that looks good, but there are many more online.\nResistance is measured in Ohms, often symbolized by an upside horseshoe, greek symbol for omega. If you can get your hands on a meter, you can set it for Ohms, and check your color band calculations against the numbers the meter will show. A multimeter is also handy to be able to check continuity and voltage. See this page for some info on how to use a multimeter.\nYou are heating up the parts, not the solder. When the parts are hot enough, the solder will flow onto them. Touch the iron to the junction between the board and the component, let it heat up, then touch the solder to either the board or the component. Dumping it onto the tip will melt the solder, but often results in a cold solder joint.\nLess is better in soldering\nYou should have the very least amount of solder needed to hold the component to the board. If you have blobby solder joints, you will likely have trouble with bad connections called cold solder joints.\nSometimes it is a good idea to practice on junk. You can try soldering a wire onto a coin, US pennies work pretty good for that, they are mostly zinc with a bit of copper. Lots of other countries have other alloys, often with lots of aluminum in them, so I don’t know about that. Aluminum wicks the heat too fast, so it probably wouldn’t work.\nYou can also break apart an old radio or other device, cut some wires, get some parts and just solder some stuff together. After a bit you get the hang of it.\nIf you use the search box on any of the Maker Media sites and put in the word soldering, there are loads of resources that should help you get started.\nYou can watch the Make Weekend projects podcast on soldering, which is great.\nMake Volume 1 had a primer on soldering.\nCheck out the post about a photo gallery of soldering basics.\nCheck out this great project for building your own fume extratctor.\nThere is lots of great information on soldering at Instructables.\nThis is not some mystical skill that people get handed to them from the tinkering gods. You learn it by doing it. You do it because you want to make something. You keep doing it because you want to make more interesting things. Learning this is just a process of getting some skills, and improving them by using them. Eventually, you can get to the point of designing your own circuits, but you can do lots of great things by following the path established by others. There are a small handful of tools that you can use with soldering and electronics. This kit has pretty much everything you need to get started.\nGood luck, keep at it, and by all means, let us know about your progress.\nYou may have other tips for people who are new to electronics, kits and soldering. Please contribute your techniques and ideas in the comments.

Here are answers to common questions.\nStained Glass Soldering Temperature Questions\nTemperatures For The Hakko FX-601\nThe temperature you need for soldering a bead with the Hakko FX-601 is normally between 360C and 410C (680-770F).\nI say ‘normally‘ as it depends on a couple of factors including tip size, solder type and how quickly you move the iron along the seam. Those who are quicker have their stained glass soldering temperature set at 410C but if you solder more slowly you need to reduce the temperature to 360C.\n360C is a good temperature for starters as it gives you more time.\nHow Tip Size Affects Stained Glass Soldering Temperature\nSome say the size of the iron tip is more important than either the wattage or the temperature. My feeling is that they work in tandem and all feed into the optimum soldering experience. The most important thing is consistent temperatures and no cold spots.\nThe Hakko FX-601 comes with a small tip – 3/16″ – which is good for decorative soldering and delicate operations but not so good for running a bead. I’d suggest buying 1/4″ and 3/8″ for more control over your beaded seams.\nYou don’t have to worry that the larger tip will cause your solder to spill over. It sounds obvious but the width of the bead depends on the outer edges of the foil joint. The solder is not going spread out onto the glass if you use a wider tip.\nHow To Use The Iron Tip To Control The Temperature\nThe front edge of the tip is the coolest area, next is the side edge, the hottest area is the flat sides. You can control the melting solder by how high off the work you keep the iron.\nIf you want more heat change the angle of the iron tip – hold it flatter so that more of the iron tip is exposed to the solder. Do the reverse for a cooler iron, hold the tip more vertical (giving less of the iron tip to heat the solder) and the process will slow down. When you get super quick and confident you can turn the temperature up. You just have to move faster!\nYou’ll find the optimum temperature for YOU by experimenting. It will depend on your soldering speed and what you’re actually doing with the solder.\nWhat Stained Glass Soldering Temperature To Use For Different Tasks\nDon’t expect to set the heat dial and forget about it. Your soldering iron temperature needs to be tweaked in response to the job in hand. You’ll learn by experience what works for you but here are a few pointers:\nSet the temperature hotter (410C or even above) for these type of stained glass tasks:\nEmbedding wire, soldering brass rods into a lampshade, removing excess solder off a vase cap. Just remember to turn it down again afterwards otherwise melting of lead came could happen!\nIf the solder isn’t flowing and you’re not achieving a nice bead then try turning the iron up. I’d practice on some foiled pieces of scrap first if you’re inexperienced.\nSet the iron temperature lower (360-310C) for the following:\nDecorative soldering and soldering lead came, free-form solder art.\nTemperatures To Use For Different Solder Types\n50/50 can be heated to a higher temperature than 60/40 solder.\nLead-free solder doesn’t flow as nicely as 60/40 or 50/50. It reacts more like 50/50 and takes a lot of heat to make it flow nicely. When running a bead it’s better to work slowly, allowing the solder to heat up a little more. With practice and patience you can run a very nice solder bead with lead-free solder.\nHeat And Soldering Irons\nYou can see from the above pointers that there are various factors feeding into the stained glass soldering temperature question! Soldering irons are the final factor.\nThe good thing about the Hakko FX-601 is that the wide range of temperatures it offers means that it can be used for all sorts, from electronics to stained glass repairs.\nWeller irons achieve temperature control via a magnet in the (replaceable) tip which switches the iron on and off at the preset temperature. Two preset temperatures are available but you need to swap out the tip to change the temperature. These pertain to the number at the end of the tip – 7 = 700F, 8 = 800F.\nHakko uses modern electronics to provide an adjustable temperature. This is very useful as it can be easily adjusted it to suit the type of work you’re doing (copper-foil or lead) and the particular application.\nThe important thing to remember is that one temperature doesn’t work for all scenarios. I frequently adjust the stained glass soldering temperature as I work. The way it “feels” is more important than the actual temperature.\nhttps://everythingstainedglass.com/hakko-fx-601temperature-questionhttps://everythingstainedglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/212530_10-1.jpghttps://everythingstainedglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/212530_10-1-150x150.jpgFAQStained Glass ToolsCornerstone,Soldering Copper Foil,Soldering Lead Came,Soldering ToolsStained glass soldering temperature is something I get asked about a LOT.

{"question":"As someone dealing with chemical sensitivities, I'm curious about how mindfulness could help manage symptoms, and what is the scientific explanation behind MCS?","answer":"Mindfulness can help manage chemical sensitivity symptoms by helping relinquish the struggle with painful emotions and making better decisions. Rather than trying to control emotional responses, which often makes them more intense and persistent, mindfulness allows you to simply observe and accept the sensations without judgment. As for MCS itself, it's an acquired disorder characterized by recurrent symptoms affecting multiple organ systems in response to various chemical compounds at doses far below what the general population tolerates. These reactions can occur from exposure to common items like laundry products, perfumes, cleaning supplies and building materials. The condition develops either through a one-time acute exposure or long-term low-level exposures to environmental toxins. MCS affects up to 15% of the population and typically impacts several body systems including neurological, immunological, respiratory and gastrointestinal, with the central nervous system almost always being affected.","context":["Mindfulness is at the core of Dialectical Behavior Therapy DBT, a CBT treatment for pervasive emotion regulation problems. Every DBT skills group begins with mindfulness meditation. Every skill depends on mindfulness. Often when trying to understand when something went wrong during your day or when something went right, mindfulness is implicated. Why mindfulness is so important in DBT however, is usually misunderstood.\nWhat Is Mindfulness?\nMindfulness, at its essence, is simply being present. This means paying attention to what is happening right now. Without judgment. Without overthinking. Without invalidating your experience. Mindfulness is just being willing to show up to the present moment. It is acceptance of the present moment.\nIt sounds simple, but most people spend a very small portion of their day mindfully engaged in their lives. We usually tune out our actual experience, and get distracted by thoughts about our experience. Most of us get so conditioned to engaging with our thoughts rather than with reality, it is very easy for us to lose sight of what is actually happening to us, and consequently, how best to handle what is happening to us.\nHow Does Mindfulness fit into DBT and CBT?\nDialectical Behavior Therapy is a treatment that targets emotion dysregulation. Often people get emotionally dysregulated by seemingly insignificant or trivial events, not because of the events themselves, but by the judgments people have about the events. For example, you may have a job that you are reasonable happy in. Let’s say it’s working at a clothing store. You like clothes, and you like interacting with people, so it seems like a good fit. What you don’t like however, is folding clothes. You find it boring. Now, you may only have to fold clothes for about 30 minutes of a six-hour shift, which is really just a small portion of the job. You may find that as you fold clothes, your mind starts to make all kinds of negative judgments about folding clothes. “This is terrible.” “What a waste of time.” “This is stupid.” “This job is awful.” Rather than spending the time focusing on folding the clothes, your mind is busy telling all kinds of disturbing stories about this task, and will likely trigger emotions such as anger, resentment, even despair. What’s worse, these emotions have a way of coloring the rest of your day. Now instead of tolerating 30 minutes of an unpleasant chore, you spend the whole day in a foul mood, judging all aspects of your job negatively, feeling worse every minute. Because being in a bad mood for most of the day, more days than not, is very unpleasant, you start having judgments about your mood, thinking, “I can’t take this anymore.” So what started out as a relatively insignificant thing has caused a lot of suffering.\nA mindful approach to this dilemma would be to approach the unpleasant task in the spirit of acceptance, willing to engage in it without engaging in a lot of judgments about it. The moment you notice a judgment, your turn your mind to folding the clothes, aware of the sensation of the fabric against your fingertips. Noticing the movement of your arms. Describing the smell of the new fabric as it reaches your nose in waves. By fully engaging in the task, repeatedly turning the mind to it, there is little room for negative attributions. You may now even find it to be a calming, soothing activity. This is one way mindfulness can help avert an emotional downward spiral.\nMindfulness can also be effective in helping us make the best decisions. People with pervasive emotion dysregulation often have histories full of others invalidating their wants, needs, thoughts, and feelings. Over time, persistent invalidation from the outside nourishes invalidation on the inside. After a while, people with emotion dysregulation learn to invalidate their own experience, having learned it was wrong, bad, or dangerous for some reason. People who get good at invalidating themselves tend to lose touch with their own experience. They no longer consider their own opinions. They no longer know where to find their own intuition. Consequently, self-invalidators live lives inconsistent with their own values and dreams. They don’t find it important when their needs are being sacrificed for those of someone else. All of this results in people who do not do what is best for themselves, which is a hard way to live life. As a result, they are unhappier, and thus more prone to becoming emotionally dysregulated.\nFinally, mindfulness can help with emotional dysregulation by way of helping to relinquish the struggle with painful emotions. One of the reasons people develop emotion dysregulation is because they try to quash or control their emotional responses to things. Trying to control an emotion is kind of like trying to grab tightly onto jello. The more you try, the more of a mess it makes. With emotions, the more we try to control them, the more intense they become, and the longer they persist. Unfortunately, due to an environment plagued by invalidation from others, there is pressure from the outside to control the emotions, leading to more intense emotions, leading to more invalidation, etc. This tends to become a self-perpetuating feedback loop.\nMindfully experiencing emotions is the opposite of the control strategy. With mindfulness, you simply observe what comes up with the emotion. You notice a feeling of your face flushed. You notice a lump in your throat. You notice all of the experiences that are the emotion, and you do so not with the intention of suppressing them, but in the service of accepting each and every one of them unconditionally. There is an old expression that you can’t argue with an emotion. This is because the emotion is there for a reason, so the best one can do is tolerate it without holding on or pushing away. It is a paradoxical approach, but the end result is emotional experiences that are less disturbing and of shorter duration. The emotions naturally go just as they came. Giving them permission to be there lets emotions take their natural course as fleeting, changing, dynamic sensations.\nThese are some of the main reasons mindfulness is relied on so heavily in Dialectical Behavior Therapy. There are many other uses of mindfulness in the treatment. In fact, as mentioned earlier, every skill relies on a foundation of mindfulness, so there are as many uses of mindfulness as there are skills, and then some.\nOne of the most important points about mindfulness, is that it is very difficult. Our brains are hardwired to make judgments, time travel, and create stories. In a way, working to be mindful is working against the biology of our brains. No one is perfect at this. Luckily, there is no need to be perfect at it. We can experience the real benefit of mindfulness when we notice we are not being mindful, and choose to turn our minds back to the now. That is the power of mindfulness: recognizing when we are not mindful. If we get distracted a thousand times, we have a thousand opportunities to notice and shift our attention. It’s a bit like fly fishing. Your mind casts its line to far-flung places when you are distracted, and then you reel it back in when you reorient your mind to the present. And like fly fishing, this process occurs again and again. Numerous times in the course of one minute. And the more we practice, the easier it becomes to recognize when the mind has left the building. And with each time we practice, we gain a little more clarity and control.\nAll material provided on this website is for informational purposes only.

By sensitivity we mean symptoms or signs as related to chemical exposures at levels tolerated by the population at large, that is distinct from such well recognized hypersensitivity phenomenon as IgG-mediated immediate hypersensitivity reactions, contact dermatitis and hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Sensitivity may be expressed as symptoms and sign in one or more organ systems. Symptoms and signs wax and wane with exposure. (2)\nSo what does this mean in lay terms? Well basically it means that growing numbers of people, myself included, are beginning to develop serious health problems from exposures to the common everyday chemicals we find in our environment. These chemicals can be items such as scented laundry soap or fabric softener, treated fabric, perfume, cologne, disinfectants, pesticides, herbicides, household cleansers, cigarette smoke, car exhaust, gas heat or other petroleum products, air fresheners, bleach, shampoos, toothpaste, food supply, new carpet, remodeling materials, wood smoke or cosmetics to name a few.\nThe symptoms of multiple chemical sensitivity are vast and numerous and usually effect many organ systems. Enzyme pathways may be inhibited and liver detoxification pathways become overloaded. The blood brain barrier is affected (3) and neurological, immunological, respiratory, endocrine, cardiovascular, genitourinary and gastrointestinal systems are likely to be affected with the central nervous system almost always being affected. (4)\nSymptoms may include depression, fatigue, headache, migraines, difficulty concentrating, irritability, short term memory loss, lack of coordination, shaking, trembling, visual and verbal disturbances, muscle pain, difficulty breathing, rashes, anxiety, impaired mobility, itching, disorientation, confusion, food sensitivity, excessive drowsiness, constipation, diarrhea, earaches, heart pounding, hypothyroidism, learning disabilities, elevated blood pressure, increased pulse and many more.\nIndividuals affected with multiple chemical sensitivity are forced to make profound changes in lifestyle and diet and endure multiple losses in life as they knew it, including their livelihood, identity, friends and sometimes even family members. Most of those afflicted are no longer able to be in environments that contain the above listed chemicals, which are found almost everywhere. Therefore, this means that most public places are off limits to them, their social life becomes extremely limited and there are very few places if any that they are capable of obtaining employment. It becomes increasingly difficult to function in this chemicalized world at all.\nThe prevalence of multiple chemical sensitivity in the population may be as high as 15% at this time, (4) and yet there is incredible backlash from the medical and chemical communities who try to deny and discredit the existence of this devastating illness, because to acknowledge it would mean that global change would have to take place.\nDr. Rea, the leading medical specialist in Multiple Chemical Sensitivity, calls it an environmentally triggered disease and explains that it may be acquired either by a one time acute exposure or from low-level long-term exposures. As well as being chemically sensitive himself, Dr. Rea treats individuals with multiple chemical sensitivity in his clinic in Dallas, Texas. He points out that in 1987 the American industry poured 22 billion pounds of toxic chemicals into the air, food and water. He adds further that the well being of man is a function of his environment; living in polluted surroundings adversely affects our health, and as the number of dangerous environmental pollutants continues to increase so do the numbers of people sensitive to these contaminants. (3)\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services states that Multiple Chemical Sensitivity is an acquired chronic syndrome described as a severe toxic allergic like reaction to extremely low levels of chemicals in our environment. It has developed over the past four decades and is caused by overexposure to some 100,000 new, more toxic synthetic chemicals. Research contends that a victim’s body becomes unable to cleanse its tissues of chemicals to which it is exposed, either in small doses over time or from a single tremendous dose. (5)\nIt really should come as no surprise to us that this phenomenon is occurring, as our bodies are made of the same ingredients as our earth and the toxicity of our environment has been evident for a long time in our declining and deformed wildlife. Rachel Carson in her groundbreaking book Silent Spring first warned us of this over 35 years ago (6) and although we have been somewhat successful at raising some awareness of the consequences that our chemicalized society is having on our environment and wildlife, we have been leaving out a very important piece of the puzzle.\nWe are not pointing out that these toxins are not only poisoning nature, but our own bodies as well. We are not immune to the destruction the environment is enduring. Wildlife is smaller and more vulnerable as they are exposed to the elements continuously and the deadly symptoms appeared in them first, and now we are beginning to see the same in human beings. The animals have tried to warn us, but we have not heard them. They cannot speak our language, but they have been warning us very loudly in their own language.\nAnother profound cutting edge book \"Our Stolen Future\" which has not received the attention it deserves written by two leading environmental scientists and an award winning environmental journalist give a staggering account of the messages our wildlife has been giving us and provide overwhelming evidence that synthetic chemicals are endocrine disruptors and they are not only upsetting normal reproductive and developmental processes, decreasing sperm count, increasing hormone related cancers, endometriosis, birth defects, sexual abnormalities, but are also threatening are actual survival.(7) Their conclusions are startling and terrifying and should serve as a wake up call to all individuals.\nCindy Duehring, a sufferer of multiple chemical sensitivity deceased at the age of 36, after a long struggle with multiple chemical sensitivity complications, was a leading researcher and writer at Environmental Access Research and took this quote from Environmental Neurotoxicity in an article titled, “Screening for Nervous System Damage from Chemical Exposure” “it was a most dangerous illusion that our society has brought forth, in the false belief, that the chemical ingredients in our everyday home and office consumer products, from cosmetics and perfumes to cleaners and carpets, have been tested for health effects to protect the public. Most of the chemicals have never tested and are not under any regulation. There are three new chemical compounds introduced in the United States every day. Pre-marketing testing of compounds as potential neurotoxicants have serious deficiencies. Many of these neurotoxic compounds came into use before the passage of the Toxic Substance Control Act in 1976 and remain untested and are still not required to be tested.\" (8)\nAs the very wise Chief Seattle said to his people in a tribal assembly in the Pacific Northwest in 1854 “We are part of the Earth and it is part of us. We know the white people do not understand our ways. Our portion of land is the same to them as the next, for they are strangers who come in the night and take from the land whatever they need. This we know. The Earth does not belong to humans; humans belong to the Earth. All things are connected like the blood which unites one family. Whatever befalls the Earth befalls the children of the Earth. Humans do not weave the web of life; they are merely a strand in it. Whatever they do to the web, they do to themselves.” In conclusion he added, “When the thicket and the eagle, the swift pony and the hunt are gone from the land, it will mark the end of living and the beginning of survival.\" (4) This could not be more true and is evidenced very profoundly in multiple chemical sensitivity.\nAs a whole we are not hearing the warnings that the wildlife is giving us. Hopefully we don’t all have to become poisoned before we listen and learn. Multiple Chemical Sensitivity is only the tip of the iceberg and if society does not begin to hear the messages of the earth, then someday we will see human beings on the endangered species list.\nMultiple Chemical Sensitivity Treatment\nMany people have multiple chemical sensitivities, but are not aware of it, because the average medical doctor is not trained in this area. They will typically tell you that your symptoms are the result of stress or depression or may even call you a hypochondriac. To find a doctor who can make a diagnosis of chemical sensitivity, you need to see a doctor of environmental medicine that can be found at the American Academy of Environmental Medicine. Some physicians who practice Functional Medicine are knowledgeable and capable on this topic as well.\nOnce the body begins to break down from environmental toxins and chemical sensitivities develop, it is very difficult to make a complete recovery. The main method of treatment consists of avoiding chemicals, which means the life of the individual is profoundly altered, permanently. So prevention is the best medicine.\nThe best step you can take to protect yourself from developing multiple chemical sensitivities is to adopt a green lifestyle. Environmental toxins are at the root of MCS, so therefore they must be eliminated. This means at a minimum you should be using environmentally friendly and natural personal and health care products, cleaning supplies and yard care. No pesticides, herbicides, air fresheners, perfume or cologne and eat an organic diet as much as possible. The construction of your home should be made as non-toxic and green as possible, mold should be avoided and all dental procedures should be done by a biologic dentist.\nHowever, MCS is two pronged. On one hand the environmental toxins you are exposed to must be reduced, but on the other hand is how capable your body is of detoxing these chemicals. A variety of treatment modalities have been found to be helpful in improving the level of sensitivity and promoting some degree of healing in some individuals by improving the detoxification system.\nMost chemically sensitive people have an abundance of nutritional deficiencies, and these deficiencies lead to a detoxification system that does not function properly, which together results in Multiple Chemical Sensitivity. Addressing nutritional deficiencies as quickly as possible is of the utmost importance. The longer deficiencies are present the harder they are to correct, the less effective the detoxification system is and the more damage that is done to the body. As sensitivities begin to snowball, the individual often becomes sensitive to the nutrients needed to correct their biochemistry, which leaves them in a catch 22 situation.\nSome tests that every MCS person should have include: the Organic Acids Test, RBC Mineral, Amino Acid Plasma, Hair Analysis, GI Effects and Fatty Acid Profile. You can learn more about these tests by visiting my Functional Medicine Page. These tests will tell you which nutrients you are deficient, which systems aren't functioning properly and how capable you are of detoxing chemicals. Then nutrients can be used to correct or improve the issue.\nAnother vital test for the chemically sensitive individual is called Detoxigenomics. This test can tell you if you have any genetic problems that are impairing your detoxification capabilities and steps that can be taken to improve them.\nThe ALCAT test is a simple test kit that can be sent to your home and test you for 10 of the most common chemicals in the environment, as well as sensitivity to mold, foods and food additives, which typically accompany MCS.\nIt is believed that malfunctioning adrenal glands, mitochondria dysfunction and heavy metal toxicity may play a crucial role in MCS and some people find improvements in their condition, by supporting their adrenals and detoxing heavy metals.\nMost people with MCS have candida overgrowth and the toxins that candida emits overloads the liver and adds to or causes sensitivity to chemicals. Significant improvements in sensitivity levels can often be found by addressing candida with the candida diet, antifungals etc.\nAutonomic nervous system dysfunction is always a primary component of MCS, and any steps that help restore balance to the autonomic nervous system are helpful for many, such as mindfulness, mindfulness based meditation, deep breathing exercises, yoga, tai chi, and nutritional support to correct deficiencies. Some new treatments on the horizon that target the autonomic nervous and have been exceptionally helpful for some include Amygdala RetrainingTM and Dynamic Neural Retraining.TM However, it's important to note that MCS is a complex, multi-faceted condition and the autonomic nervous system is only one system involved.\nIt's crucial that you read how toxins make you sick, to understand the complex process that takes place in your body and all the steps needed for recovery.\nThe degree of healing that one can acquire depends on many things: How competent your health care provider is and whether they guide you to the most appropriate tests and treatment methods. How much money you have to spend on tests and treatment. The level of damage that has been done to your body by chemicals. How long you've been dealing with the situation. Your nutritional status and how long you've been nutrient depleted. The types of toxins and level of toxins you've been exposed to. Whether you have the money and ability to acquire safe housing. For many, who lack resources, MCS is a progressive condition when these underlying issues cannot be addressed.\nLearn More about Multiple Chemical Sensitivity on the Following Pages:\nA comprehensive overview of MCS.\nA great handout to educate family member and friends.\nMCS Fact Sheet\nHelpful Resources for Living with Multiple Chemical Sensitivity\n- Living with Chronic Illness\n- Coping with Chronic Pain\n- Living Life to the Fullest\n- Green Living Tips to Save Your Health and the Planet\n- Cognitive Reframing Techniques\n- Living in Spite of Your Symptoms\n- Managing Cognitive Impairment\n- Environmental Health\n- Chemicals in Common Fragrances\n- Health Hazards of Dryer Exhaust\n- Mold and Your Health\n- Deep Breathing Exercises\n- Using Gratitude to Enhance Your Health\n- Inspirational Quotes\n- Humor and Inspiration to Enhance Your Health\n- Benefits of Meditation\n- Getting Back to Nature\n- The Healing Power of Love\n- Managing Stress\n- Using Brainwaves to Manage Chronic Pain\n- Mindfulness - A Powerful Tool for Improving Health and the Quality of Life\nUse Mindfulness based Meditation to Improve Health, Manage Symptoms, Increase Spiritual Growth and Develop a Richer, More Meaningful Life"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:beeebb8d-2b71-48a9-9c6e-e2b69b0342cd>","<urn:uuid:b0066ed5-95a8-4285-9e2a-14fb68a2cba4>"],"error":null}

But once you dig into the details, Hasselblad medium format photography is defined by so much more. This includes larger pixel size and meticulously calibrated sensors, a wide dynamic range of colour tones, the Hasselblad Natural Colour Solution, leaf shutter lenses with superb flash synchronization, and even more creative freedom in post-production.\nSENSOR SIZE AND PIXELS\nIt all starts with the sensor. The CMOS sensors built inside Hasselblad medium format cameras deliver the best in image quality, resolution, and detail capture possible. More importantly, it’s the size of the pixels that makes the biggest difference in image quality. The bigger a pixel is, the more light-gathering capability it possesses. With greater light gathering power, finer and more detailed tonal information can be produced, delivering more information in the final file. Essentially, this gives a photographer more choice and creative freedom in post-production and retouching.\nHasselblad camera sensors are individually calibrated to ensure maximum performance in any given situation. A massive amount of data is gathered for each unit in the production stage in order to study the variations that can occur and see how the sensor performs under different circumstances. Through Hasselblad’s rigorous sensor testing, all irregularities are corrected automatically when shooting with any Hasselblad.\nClick image to zoom\nCAMERA: H6D-400C MS\n© SWEE OH\nDynamic range, measured in stops, refers to the range of light intensities present in a photo, from the darkest shadows to the brightest highlights. Larger sensors with larger pixels, in comparison to the traditional 24x36mm sensor size, offer a wider dynamic range that preserve the details that can get lost in shadows and highlights. Hasselblad’s ecosystem of high quality hardware and brilliant software solutions can deliver up to 15 stops of dynamic range, as opposed to the standard 10-12 stops expected from most full frame cameras. The deep shadows and bright highlights that can be captured by a Hasselblad camera in a single exposure reduce the need to exposure bracket or shoot multiple images for high dynamic range image processing afterwards.\n© KARL TAYLOR\nMEDIUM FORMAT COMPARISON\nIn a new set of comparative videos made by Hasselblad, photographer Karl Taylor shows the differences between 35mm format and medium format along with the advantages of the latter in an unbiased manner.\nAs one of the best photographers in the business with over 20 years of experience and technical expertise, Karl takes the viewer through clear explanations where he compares shooting with the Hasselblad H6D-100c and the leading 35mm format camera.\nHASSELBLAD NATURAL COLOUR SOLUTION (HNCS)\nThanks to the HNCS, selecting a specific colour profile in order to capture accurate colours correctly becomes unnecessary. Combining the wide colour spectrum of the sensor’s 16-bit colour data and the Hasselblad sensor’s wide dynamic range, the HNCS produces images that are delivered with accurate, natural colours. This universal profile produces consistent and tonally correct colour matching to what the human eye sees without needing to set up multiple colour presets. The HNCS is designed to deliver an accurate reproduction of the scene being photographed. This generates a smoother, analogue, film-like output compared to more saturated, contrasted captures by other systems.\nLEAF SHUTTER LENSES\nLeaf shutter or central-type shutters, integrated into the lens rather than the camera, provide a major advantage to photographers. The construction minimizes vibration and ensures a lifetime of accurate performance as well as the ability to build a smaller camera body compared to having used a focal plane shutter. Leaf shutters synchronize with flash up to 1/2000th of a second without any specialty equipment, providing immense creative control in the studio and outdoors. When combined with Hasselblad’s excellence in optical design, the results are lenses from 21mm to 300mm with excellent image rendition offering the best experience in photography and are further grown with unique accessories such as the HTS 1,5 Tilt and Shift Adapter or Macro Converter that allow users to expand the capabilities of their lenses into specialty feature sets.\nTo help you learn more about the image quality and handling of Hasselblad products, we have collected tutorials, sample images and guides."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"advanced_reasoning"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:87d7f018-7018-40b2-989a-ef022d7d8e0f>","<urn:uuid:6a0a7318-3e60-4d07-bb20-e3e01601fc7f>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do the extreme temperature conditions in Death Valley compare to the air quality monitoring efforts in the Bay Area?","answer":"While Death Valley experiences extreme temperatures, holding the record for the highest temperature ever recorded on earth at 134.1°F at Furnace Creek in 1913, the Bay Area focuses on monitoring and managing air quality through specialized equipment like NASA's airborne lab jet. This jet conducts low-level pollution measurements under 1,200 feet from Santa Rosa to Salinas and over the Pacific Coast, helping understand both local pollution and pollution that travels from other regions, including Asia. The stark contrast in environmental challenges shows how different regions face varying climate and pollution concerns that require distinct monitoring and management approaches.","context":["South Bay News\nSpecial NASA jet testing Bay Area air quality\nMOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. (KGO) -- An aircraft that looked like a fighter jet seen making low passes over the Bay Area Thursday is the latest weapon scientists are using to fight air pollution, an airborne lab that could someday allow us to breathe cleaner air.\nThe small jet was on a target-specific mission Thursday. It was out to capture ozone and greenhouse gases over the Bay Area in the never-ending battle to control air pollution. One of the under wing pods is equipped as an airborne science lab. Intakes on the bottom sample the air then exhaust it out the back. Computers do real-time measurement and analysis.\nThe mission is a partnership of Nasa Ames, the Bay Area Air Quality Management District, and other agencies. \"We're hoping to have an understanding of the air that flows into the Bay Area so that the models that the Air Quality District runs can use the proper input conditions to understand how much of it we're being given and how much of it we're producing ourselves,\" NASA scientist Laura Iraci said.\nThe jet stream can deliver pollution from Asia to California. That means conditions in Beijing can have an impact here. \"Anything that's dealing with other parts of the world will eventually come to us locally here in the Bay Area and the effect of that is we have to know about it, as well as health issues, as well as other issues that concern us,\" said NASA Atmospheric Science Branch Chief Warren Gore.\nAs the jet took off from Moffett Field, the primary focus was measuring low-level pollution, generally under 1,200 feet, from Santa Rosa to Salinas and out over the Pacific Coast. However, researchers say they also need to factor in pollution at higher levels. \"Things like mountains and just kind of general heating up the land, all help mix the atmosphere, so we need to have a look at what's coming above and what can possibly be mixed down and influence us on the surface,\" Climate Researcher Emma Yates said.\nIt's hoped the long-term study will help reduce pollution. \"That will help us determine what we might need to do in the future to further regulate or curb certain pollutants so that we don't have air pollution problems,\" said Lisa Fasano with the Bay Area Air Quality Management District.\nThursday marked only the beginning of research into Bay Area air pollution. Eventually, satellites will be going up as well as the agencies continue to coordinate and to study pollution\nNASA, pollution, south bay news, david louie\n- San Jose police officer arrested for sexual assault 40 min ago\n- Crews fix broken water main in SF's Lower Haight\n- Officials investigating acid spill at Tesoro refinery\n- Family mourns young woman killed by tree\n- High speed chase ends in crash in Richmond\n- Report: CVS could face $29M fine for painkillers\n- Portland family calls 911 about angry cat\n- Fitbit users still looking for answers on Force rashes\n- 5-year-old boy, babysitter struck by car in crosswalk\n- Stars raise money for SF children's hospital\n- Man gets prison time in laser-pointer case\n- Petaluma police searching for suspected drive-thru thief\n- abcnews: 'The Bachelor' Finale Full Recap\n- weather: Bay Area weather forecast for Tuesday","“On top of Mt. Whitney” Photo: Emiliano Reyna\nThe Eastern Sierra is a land of extremes. There are extremes in temperature and climate, of topography and geology, about features of the fauna and flora, and in feats of human endeavor in the region.\nFurnace Creek in Death Valley (163 miles southeast of Bishop) still holds the record for the highest temperature ever recorded on earth. On July 10, 1913 it was a blistering 134.1 degrees Fahrenheit. While there is some dispute by scientists about the accuracy of this recording the next hottest recorded temperature was also at Furnace Creek in Death Valley. What’s more, the average temperature during the month of July 2017 was 107.24 deg. F., making it the hottest single month ever reliably measured anywhere on Earth since records began in 1911. Now that’s pretty extreme.\nHigh above Bishop in the White Mountains are the world’s oldest living non-clonal organisms, the Great Basin Bristlecone Pine (Pinus longaeva). Growing between 9,800 and 11,000 feet in an all but inhospitable climate these trees live for thousands of years. There are few other living organisms that live to such extreme old age and none are nearly as old as the oldest of them, which is determined to be over 5,050 years old now.\nOne of the most well known geographical features of the area is that it is home to the lowest point and the highest point on the continental USA. Badwater Basin (near Furnace Creek) in Death Valley sits at 282 feet below sea level. It is not the lowest point on the earth, but ranking at number 8 on the list of “lowest exposed land on the earth’s surface” it definitely qualifies as extreme. What makes this all the more intriguing is that it is situated only 85 miles, straight-line distance, from the highest point in the country, Mt. Whitney. This summit is 14,505 feet above sea level, making this a dramatic rise of almost 15,000 feet from Badwater Basin in a relatively short distance.\nThere are numerous other places in the world where mountains rise up steeply more than 15,000 feet – consider the mountains of the Himalayas and the Andes. However there are few if any other places that rise from below sea level to over 14,500 above sea level in so short a distance and display such entirely different climates at each point. It is extremely fascinating.\nPerhaps more fascinating than the extremes of nature are the extreme feats of daring, strength and ingenuity that humans have performed in this extreme landscape in which we live. The history books are full of the stories of explorers and adventurers who braved the elements and challenged themselves physically and mentally to achieve their objectives.\nMen and women still participate in activities that require extreme fortitude. The Eastern Sierra is a mecca for sporting events that go beyond the realm of the usual.\nBadwater to Whitney Portal Utramarathon\n“The World’s Toughest Foot Race.”\nThe distance by road between Badwater Basin and Mt. Whitney portal (elevation 8,300’), where the road ends at the trailhead for the hike up to the summit, is 135 miles. In the sporting discipline of ultra running, any race longer than a traditional marathon of 26 miles is classified as an ultramarathon. The STYR Labs Badwater 135 is not just ultra by this definition – it is extreme.\nThere is no ‘straight line elevation’ gain between these two points. The cumulative vertical ascent is 14,600’ and cumulative descent is 6,100’. Athletes must cross three mountain ranges and vast stretches of desert with temperatures well over 100 degrees.\nEntry to the race is by invitation only and 100 endurance athletes representing approximately twenty-five countries and twenty American states participate in the event. The official head-to-head race began in 1987 and has been held annually every year since then. It also holds the distinction of being conducted “without serious incident, fatality, or any citations issued by any branch of law enforcement” in all those years.\nThe race concept was born from one man’s solo attempt to make this crossing. Al Arnold, an ultrarunning pioneer known as the “joggernaut”, began his quest to run from Badwater to Whitney in 1974. His first attempt was aborted for dehydration and the second in 1975 for a knee injury. In 1976, injuries kept him from attempting it again, but in 1977 he succeeded and summited Mt. Whitney 80 hours after his start at Badwater.\nToday the race does not summit the mountain due to regulations that no longer allow competitive events in the John Muir Wilderness. Nevertheless, according to race organizers, it is still considered, “the most demanding and extreme running race offered anywhere on the planet.”\nL2H (Lowest to Highest)\nThis is not as much an event as it is a personal challenge. It is most assuredly a challenge of an extreme kind and even a visit to one of the websites that provides information on possible routes and what to expect has an ominous warning about the extreme nature of this challenge.\nThe challenge is to hike the backcountry from Badwater Basin to Mt. Whitney. Whereas this foot trek will take intrepid hikers to the summit of Mt. Whitney and the official running race ends at Whitney Portal, some 8 miles and several thousand feet below the summit, the distance covered is largely similar. The total distance covered is about 130 miles (depending on the precise route followed), but the total elevation gain more than doubles that of the highway route. Of course there is one last challenge upon summiting the mountain, and that is to descend again or continue onto the John Muir Trail.\nThe hike is intended to be a journey of adventure across the wilderness by avoiding paved roads and vehicle traffic whenever possible. It is about walking and living (if only for a few days) in a land of extremes. There are greater extremes of geography, ecology and climate along this route than many other off-highway journeys. The hike requires careful advance planning. Travelers must arrange for their own resupply of food and water and it is necessary to obtain a permit to summit Mt. Whitney. The latter can be a challenge in itself as permits are booked months in advance and the permit date, once obtained, is not adjustable. However, neither this nor the route is insurmountable and many hikers have successfully traversed this rugged, harsh and extremely beautiful landscape.\nThe L2H hike will not fail to leave an indelible impression on your heart and soul.\nBishop High Sierra Ultra Marathons\nFor over 20 years trail runners have ascended to the ‘big backyard’ of Bishop to participate in this magnificent trail running event. The organizers of this race stage 4 distances in which runners may compete in 20-mile, 50km, 50-mile or 100km courses. For most non-runners just the 20-mile “fun run”, as it’s billed, would seem extreme, but for seasoned long distance trail runners this extreme running event is as exhilarating as it is challenging.\nThe Bishop High Sierra Ultra Marathons start at an elevation of 4,429 feet with the highest point of the 100km course topping out at 9,360. The cumulative gain/loss of this race is more than simply the difference – it is 11,227 feet! In addition to the high elevation, athletes must be wary of obstacles, such as small rocks, roots and puddles along the trail, and deal with big changes in temperature and light. The races begin at dawn and the longest continues well into the night. Notwithstanding all this, applications to participate are generally oversubscribed and the event is limited to 250 participants.\nIt is one of the most spectacular events on the annual trail running calendar featuring wide-open views of the Owens Valley and the majestic Sierra Nevada soaring high above the race courses. There is a long-standing commitment from the residents of Bishop and the Eastern Sierra in support of this event and it is renown for the quantity and quality of the aid stations and volunteers.\nThese 50-mile and 100km courses are considered to be a perfect training opportunity for the 100-mile! mountain trail races that follow at other venues later in the year. Now that’s ultra extreme!\nJune Lake Triathlon\nWhile a standard triathlon event may not generally be considered extreme as multi-sport and long distance events go, the June Lake Triathlon does differentiate itself from other such events due to its magnificent high altitude setting. June Lake, 56 miles north of Bishop, is nestled in the high alpine region of the Sierra Nevada at an elevation of 7,600 feet above sea level. This fact alone adds a level of difficulty to the physical challenge of the 6 races offered here. The event is touted as “The toughest race in the most beautiful place” and we believe it merits a listing in this list of extreme events.\nOrganizers of the event present races for a broad cross section of age and ability. The event includes sprint, Olympic and Half-Ironman distances with categories for individuals, relay teams and aquabike (a biathlon of just the swim and cycle disciplines), plus a short course for children between the ages 6 – 12 years old.\nIt a marvelous family fun event that has something for everyone who aspires to the good extremes of life.\nMammoth Gran Fondo\nWhere in the world is there a 100-mile road bike race with only one traffic light? The answer – the Eastern Sierra, Mammoth Lakes, 40 miles north of Bishop. The Mammoth Gran Fondo road race, previously known as the High Sierra Fall Century, is the preeminent cycling road race in the area.\nIt is fast becoming the norm for long distance bike races to adopt the Italian concept of Gran Fondo, which translates to Big Rides, and offer a variety of timed race distances. This event presents three route options, 102-mile Gran Fondo, 70-mile Medio, and 42-mile Piccolo – all with timed results.\nThis is arguably one of the most beautiful and quiet rides anywhere in the world, with 75 miles of the Gran Fondo route closed to through traffic. The route delivers great uphill climbs interspersed with long, fast descents all set in a quiet landscape of sweeping vistas and towering mountains. Race organizers provide full SAG and tech support, 6 fully stocked aid stations, mid-way lunch for Gran Fondo and Medio riders, free on-course photographs of racers, promotional gifts, and a great after party.\nIt is extremely fun, challenging and breathtakingly beautiful.\nThe Graniteman Challenge is as extreme as it sounds. It is a three-day, multi-sport event that challenges athletes to swim, bike, and run long distances that are each singularly challenging enough. Most athletes who participate in this event put their bodies to extreme physical test for well over 9 hours cumulatively. Fewer than 5 participants to date have come in under 9 hours.\nThis weekend triathlon is held in conjunction with the Mammoth Gran Fondo and the Tioga Pass Run, which are scheduled on consecutive days during the first weekend of September. The swim portion of this triathlon is presented the day prior to the road race making this a weekend of extreme physical endurance for all who participate.\nThe challenge is named for the ‘granite-to-granite’ swim held in June Lake where 2.4 miles of swimming in the waters of this high alpine lake surrounded by towering granite cliffs can only be achieved by the hardiest of women and men.\nThe Tioga Pass Run, which is principally a stand-alone road running event, is a long-standing race that begins in Lee Vining, 64 miles north of Bishop, and follows the spectacularly scenic California State Route 120 into Yosemite National Park. The race ends at Tioga Pass, the entrance to the park. This 12.4-mile run, with a total elevation gain of 3,200 feet, is one of extreme beauty and significant challenge to all who undertake it.\nThis challenge must qualify as one of the most extreme cycling challenges in the USA. It is said for every cyclist who dreams of riding the Tour de France, this challenge is the chance to experience the kind of climbing for which “Le Tour” is famous. What’s more – it is said to be even tougher. The climbs are longer and tougher than any back-to-back stages of the Tour de France and three of the summits are much higher than any in the famous European race.\nThe Everest Challenge is a two day, two stage challenge that ascends and descends six of the most beautiful and most brutal road bike climbs in California. These climbs are each challenging in their own right and to ride them consecutively, three on one day and three the next, is indeed an extreme endeavor. The challenge is named for the world’s highest mountain because, in just a little more than 200 miles of riding, the total elevation gain that every successful cyclist rides is 29,035 feet – as high as Mt. Everest.\nIn other words, this challenge is like riding two 100-mile bike races in two consecutive days with the added challenge of ascending well over 15,000 feet the first day and over 13,000 feet the next. Now that’s seriously extreme!\nIn years past this challenge was staged as a sanctioned and permitted competitive event with aid stations and SAG (support and gear) assistance. This is no longer the case, however, it can be done as an individual challenge and cyclists from around the country test their strength and endurance in these mountains every year.\nDual Sport Rally\nA legal system of roads and trails for motorized vehicles was designated in the Eastern Sierra in 2009 following many years of inventory and analysis. This included public involvement to balance the needs for recreational opportunities and to protect the unique character of our public lands. The result is an extensive network of 2,200 miles of OHV trails and roads providing access through almost one million acres of the Inyo National Forest.\nEvery year dual sport motorcycle enthusiasts come to Bishop to spend a weekend in the mountains to test their mettle and their metal. Hosted by the Ventura County Motorcycle Club this event is offered to experienced dual sport riders only. While it is a fun family event the riding covers almost 800 miles of varying and difficult terrain. Riders can choose their own routes and help is always fairly close at hand, but the extreme nature of this mountainous region requires and high level of skill and experience.\nThe organizers, who present the event under permit from the US Forest Service and BLM (Bureau of Land Management), have a strict policy on bike setup, capability, fuel range capacity, licensing, and more. The event is restricted to 300 riders and it is often a sold out event.\nIf you’re skilled and ready for some extreme high desert, mountain riding – ride this extreme rally.\nNow that you’ve reached the end of this article do you find you’ve been waiting to exhale? Here’s a fabulous event that’s not extremely difficult but it is extremely fun!\nThe Pamper Pedal is the ‘glitz and glamour’ ride event of the year and it is reserved for women riders only. Men may participate by pampering the women on this fun ride by cheering them on and serving delicacies at any of the three aid stations along the route. It begins in Mammoth Lakes and ends in Bishop. The route is 48.7 miles long, has 1,323 feet of cumulative uphill (easy-peasy), and an extremely wonderful 5,025 feet of beautiful, sweeping downhill.\nNow if all those previous events listed above are just a little too extreme for you come and give this one try.

{"question":"请问，what are the traditional Welsh Christmas celebrations like, and what safety protocols should be followed for organizing such winter festivities?","answer":"Traditional Welsh Christmas (Y Nadolig) celebrations included attending 'Plygain' church services between 3-6 AM, making treacle toffee, and decorating homes with mistletoe (for protection from evil) and holly (symbolizing eternal life). For organizing winter festivities safely, several protocols must be followed: keeping kitchen and cooking facilities away from main events, proper handling of electrical fittings with circuit breakers in isolated locations, ensuring underground or overhead electrical wires away from pathways, providing appropriate fire extinguishing equipment with trained personnel, and maintaining multiple exit points. Additionally, strict enforcement of entry-exit protocols, proper lighting and ventilation, and establishment of central control rooms with CCTVs for monitoring are essential safety measures.","context":["Welsh Culture & Tradition:\nWales is certainly unique, and the culture and tradition have changed little for many centuries.\nThe Romans occupied Wales for 400 years, and after the Romans came the Normans, Vikings, Picts and Saxons. The medieval era in Wales is full of rebellious exploits by the Welsh, most notably by princes like Owain Glyndwr. Parliament acts between 1536 and 1543 unified Wales with England.\nWelsh culture and tradition is celebrated at a festival called \"Eisteddfod.\" This was originally a medieval meeting of the \"bards.\" There were poetry competitions and harp-playing in these times, but today there is choir-singing, music bands, acting, reciting, writing and painting. Each town and village appears to have their own little \"Eisteddfod\", and it is another way to revive local interest in the national language and culture.\nThere are two important versions of \"Eisteddfod\" in Wales. The first is the National Eisteddfod, which is held in North and South Wales on alternate years, at the start of August. The ceremonies are conducted by \"Gorsedd of Bards\" (an association of people interested in Welsh art and culture).\nThe International Eisteddfod occurs in Llangollen, where there is dancing and singing from all over the world. (This global festival takes place in July).\nOther traditions and holidays in Wales:\nCYMANFA GANU (Hymn Singing): Dating back to around 1190, this event centers on the singing of hymns. The singing used to go hand-in-hand with the \"temperance movement\", but is now conducted for the sheer pleasure of singing.\nNOSON LAWEN (Merry Night): This event started as a tradition to bring out the hay harvest. Activities include verse-reciting, harp-playing and dancing.\nNOS GALAN GAEAF (All Hallows Eve): Meaning the beginning of the new year in ancient times, this is the night Welsh spirits are said to walk abroad. In Montgomeryshire, a mash was made in many farmhouses that included nine ingredients: potatoes, carrots, turnips, peas, parsnips, leeks, pepper, salt and milk. In this mash, a wedding ring was hidden. The young maiden who first found the ring in the mash would also be the first married.\nY NADOLIG (Christmas): In many parts of Wales at Christmas, it used to be the custom to attend a church service known as \"Plygain\" (daybreak), between three A.M. and six A.M. To pass the time waiting for Christmas Eve, young people would make treacle toffee, and decorate their homes with fresh mistletoe and holly. Mistletoe was thought of as a magical plant that protected the home from evil. The holly was a symbol of eternal life, and was often displayed along with ivy, rosemary and bay leaves.\nGWYL SAN STEFFAN (St. Stephens Day; Boxing Day - December 26th): The day after Christmas was also a significant event in Wales. One of the activities included \"holly beating\" or \"holming\" (where young men would slash at the arms of young females with holly branches until they bled). Thankfully, this \"tradition\" no longer takes place.\nNOS GALAN (New Years Eve): Some quaint Welsh customs for the new year were: \"all existing debts were to be paid\"; never lend anything to anyone on New Years Day else you would have bad luck; and the behavior of an individual on this day was an indication of how they would behave all year!\nTWELFTH NIGHT (evening of January 5th): This was the celebration of the end of \"Christmastide.\" All of the holiday decorations would be taken down, and the ashes from the Yule log would be buried with the seeds to ensure the coming of spring, and a healthy harvest.\nFEAST OF THE EPIPHANY (January 6th): A large cake was prepared and divided into three parts to represent Christ, the Virgin Mary and the Three Wise Men. A ring was concealed in the cake, and whoever found the ring at the neighborhood gathering was elected King or Queen of Misrule (presiding over the day's festivities).\nTHE WASSAIL: This means to be \"whole and healthy\", and both Christmas and New Years were marked by \"wassailing.\" This included both drinking and singing.\nHUNTING THE WREN: Associated with Twelfth Night, young men would capture a wren and present it in a gilded cage to villagers in exchange for money or gifts of food.\nSHROVE TUESDAY:' The last day of feasting, drinking and merry-making before Lent began.\nY CROCHON CREWYS (The Lenten Crock): Another country tradition where food plays a large role. A \"crochon\" was usually a scooped-out turnip, or other large vegetable. It was placed on the window sill of a farmhouse in the cover of darkness, during which a verse of poetry was recited.\nSUL Y BLODAU (Sunday of the Flowers): This is Palm Sunday in Wales, and it is the custom to decorate the graves in the churchyards with flower arrangements as a preparation for Easter. Graves were cleaned, weeded and whitewashed before the flowers were placed.\nY GROGLITH (Good Friday): One custom on Good Friday includes walking barefoot to church, so as not to disturb the earth!\nDYDD LLUN Y PASG (Easter Monday): On Easter Sunday, some Welsh townspeople made collective pilgrimages to the tops of nearby mountains at dawn - to watch the sun rise.\nST. DAVID'S DAY (March 1st): St. David is the patron saint of Wales (much like St. Patrick is to the Irish). This is the most important holiday in Wales, and it is on this day that the Welsh remember their roots, and celebrate their culture and identity. St. David was a crusader for Christianity, and is said to have died on March 1, 589. His remains are buried at the Cathedral of St. David's in Pembrokeshire, West Wales.","While planning for large events the management needs to take note of (i) type and duration of event, (ii) size of the expected crowd, gender, and age profile of attendees, and (iii) locational characteristics.\nThe event organizers have to accordingly plan, rehearse and undertake safety drills with the help of police, fire, health, forest, revenue, and public works departments. For example, in a religious events, depending on the estimated crowd size, duration of the mela or darshan can be extended to avoid a larger gathering.\nVolunteers and others for help\nHelp of volunteers os often taken for organising various events. It is important to take care of the following:\n- Uniform, and identity cards for volunteers for ease of recognition.\n- Crowd management training; how to frisk visitors, how to operate metal detectors, how identify trouble makers, and suicide bombers.\n- Ensure that they frisk bidi, cigarette, match box, lighter, and others to avoid fire incidence.\n- First aid training including triage, CPR, handling and transport of injured for paramedics.\n- Putting in place disaster protocol, and standard operating procedure (SOP) for all nearby by hospitals.\n- Central control room equipped with CCTVs to monitor, and spot crowd buildup areas.\n- Loud speakers, and public address systems for making important announcements, and keeping masses informed.\n- Temporary observation towers, if required.\n- Deployment of UAV / drones for monitoring crowd movement, crowd density, and risk.\n- Dedicated wireless system for communication between personnel.\n- Traffic congestion delays response, rescue, and relief operations.\n- Coordinate with railway, transport department, and private bus operators.\n- Charge high entry, and parking fee to discourage private vehicles.\n- Provide shuttle bus service between venue, and the nearest railway station, and bus terminal to ensure rickshaws, and taxis do not crowd the venue.\n- Ensure strict enforcement of traffic, and parking rules even for VIPs.\nEntry tickets and display\n- Provide seat numbers, and entry passes. General admission makes crowd control, and movement of people difficult.\n- Assign parking, and seating arrangements with colour coded path ways.\n- People often ignore written instructions, and keep asking volunteers. Arrangement should therefore be made for regular multi-lingual announcements, particularly related to crowd movement. This would facilitate effective communication even for the illiterates.\n- Accordingly, multilingual sign-boards or display boards should be put up to disseminate information about entry, and exit routes, food, water, and rest room facilities, help desk location for lost, and found items, and children.\nPathways and hawkers\n- Hawkers, and sellers should be prohibited in corridors, and pathways.\n- Sale of cigarettes, and all tobacco products should be prohibited.\n- Hawkers should not be allowed to use stoves, loud whistles, scary masks, fire crackers, and other such items that could be misused by miscreants to scare people.\n- Hawkers should be allowed at exit points rather than at entry points.\n- If the shrine is atop a hill, or in the mountains, there should be separate track for pedestrians, and ponies or horses.\n- There should be adequate facilities for light, ventilation, drinking water, and toilets- along the pathways.\nEntry – exit barricades\n- Doors must not be suddenly opened, or suddenly closed.\n- Multiple exits must be provided.\n- Routes of ingress, and egress must be separate.\n- Entry, and exit points must have strong but non-permanent, and manoeuvrable barricades. The barricades should not have strong metal spikes; else these might cause injuries during stampede.\n- Strict adherence should be maintained to time, and punctuality as delay causes anger, and restlessness in the crowd.\nFreebies, autographs and others\n- There should be multiple, and well distributed points for freebies, if any.\n- Volunteers should ensure that a single distribution point is not overcrowded.\n- The freebies should never be allowed to be thrown randomly at the crowd, like SRK did at Vadodara railway station during the promotion of his film Raees.\n- Celebrity should not be allowed to mingle with the crowd as it might (i) compromise personal security, and (ii) trigger rush of people for his glimpse or autograph.\n- Number of persons should be strictly limited in accordance with the bearing capacity of podium, lift or temporary stairs.\nElectric and fire hazard\n- Kitchen, and cooking facilities should be away from the main event.\n- Proper care should be taken in handling LPG stoves, firewood, and electric fitting.\n- Circuit breakers, fuse boxes, switchboards, fuel tanks must be kept in isolated location with security guard.\n- Electrical wires should be underground, or overhead, and always away from the pathways to minimise tripping hazards.\n- Appropriate fire extinguishing equipment should be kept ready with trained personnel.\n- Dustbins should be provided, and there should be no littering, particularly of food items that could attract dogs, monkeys, and elephants.\nUse of S&T and ICT\n- Use of Aadhar linked barcoded passes, together with authentication at both entry, and exit points would ensure exact details of persons actually present at the venue at the time of the disaster.\n- This data can be utilised for crowd characteristics assessment, and providing specialized facilities or assistance, if required.\n- Special applications could be crated for digital entry pass, and GPS enabled instructions for parking, and entry – exit points.\n- With the use of RFID or App based visitor passes real time monitoring of crowd buildup can be resorted to, and accordingly necessary preventive measures can be put in place.\n- Sensors can be installed to monitor heat, smoke, and noise levels at various points, and data from these could be utilised for estimating crowd buildup.\n- CCTV, UAV, and drones can be utilised for crowd monitoring.\n- Data collected during the event could be used later for big-data analytics with crowd simulation. This would help in effective management of future events.\n- Use of SMS, social media, prerecorded voice mails to communicate, and disseminate important information.\n- Use of dedicated website, social media account, toll-free IVRS number to disseminate authentic information, and to prevent rumor mongering.\n- Used of RFID, and barcode together with photographs for the identification of dead bodies, and personal belongings.\n- Logistics: material, medicine, blood donors, inventory management, and personnel management – all could be managed efficiently using ERP software.\nDM after stampede\n- Event volunteers, and paramedics to commence rapid triage, first aid, and referral of injured.\n- Distribute patients to earmarked hospitals in a coordinated manner, so that relatives do not face inconvenience in locating them.\n- A control room,and helpdesk to handle all the inquiries.\n- Police personnel, and relief workers to ensure proper tagging, documentation, and safe custody of personal belongings of victims.\n- Psycho-social supportbe arranged for the survivors, and the persons who lost their loved ones."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:0fde1031-3f54-4b81-85ee-13c530b6f005>","<urn:uuid:3e782f37-a547-440f-92b8-c7ad10b9b454>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What's the difference between working with color in vector graphics software versus physical character modeling? Por favor give examples!","answer":"In vector graphics work, colors are defined using precise values in color models like CMYK, RGB, or Pantone as part of finalizing a character bible. In contrast, when working with physical character modeling (such as with plasticine), the focus is on understanding the character's volume and corporeality in three dimensions, which provides new insights about the character even if the final product will be two-dimensional. The physical modeling stage comes before the digital clean-up phase where precise color values are determined.","context":["For anyone working professionally in character design, a character bible is one of the most essential elements of your workflow. A character bible is the document that gathers the subject's design, turnaround, biography, hero poses, colour schemes, props and worlds in a precise, easily understood package. It's used in numerous fields of work, including animation, game development and book creation.\nA well-crafted character bible is the key to opening new doors, and is something you can hold in your hand to help you communicate your ideas to any potential collaborator or producer.\nIn Pictoplasma Academy workshops, tutors Rilla Alexander and Nathan Jurevicius pay a lot of attention to all of the different aspects of the character bible, with the aim of encouraging attendees to take their ideas and concepts to the next level. Here, Pictoplasma shares some tips from the character bible workshop, to help you learn how to make your own character bible document.\nThe very first thing our tutors get the students to do is obsessively draw their character over and over. Despite having drawn a character for years, attendees are challenged to look at new ways of seeing their design. The idea of this exercise is to break away from old habits and open up possibilities of what could be revealed if pushed.\nSome of the most enjoyable and fruitful exercises involve mirroring facial expressions, human puppetry and a mind-bending fan art session. In this last exercise, everyone comes together for an intense speed-drawing event, interpreting the entire group's characters. You learn a lot from the interpretation and exaggeration of others!\nAlexander and Jurevicius also ask attendees to work just on the silhouette of their character and cut it out from board paper. When it comes to the silhouette of your character and its most characteristic poses, it is good to reflect on basic psychological rules, such as a triangular shape standing for danger, a circle for friendliness and a rectangular form for strength.\nStressing one or combining two in your design will influence how your character appears to others. The fun part is when they take this to the next step and ask students to create paper masks of their characters. Students then act out and embody their creation through a number of interactive exercises.\nThis leads directly to exposing the personality of your character. As much as you work on the outer qualities, you should also think about the inner ones. We have found it practical to do a lot of brainstorming and free association – for example, filling in lists of things you like to draw, writing short biographies for your character and reading them to fellow attendees, putting your characters in a defined situation and deciding how they will react.\nThe more you can imagine your character as a being that is independent from your creation, the more you will instinctively find out about its personality.\nAll this is done without a computer – attendees will just need a pencil or pen and paper, and occasionally some board paper, scissors, glue and staples. Next is plasticine, as you need to put your character in front of you to get a 360° vision of it. As you hold your creation in your hands, touch it and take a look at it from all sides, it's a great moment that feels like you've created a new life. You will find out a lot at this stage. Things that look great in 2D don't necessarily translate well or easily into the third dimension.\nIf the medium you want to take your character into will remain flat, you might feel you don't need this information, but even if you aim for a two-dimensional illustration, it's good to know about your creation's volume and corporeality. Working with your own plasticine model will often give you a new understanding.\nIt is also essential for you to draw the turnaround – six views that show your character from front and back, both sides, bottom and top. Again, you might never want to feature your character from these perspectives, but it helps to understand how it could look from different angles early on.\nAlexander and Jurevicius encourage attendees to document all this material on the wall, gradually building up a collection that tells the story of their character. It's at this point that we get students to transform their sketches into vector graphics, doing clean up, deciding on the most important poses, and making turnaround views precise.\nAt this stage, the character bible is finessed and polished by adding short biographies of your main character(s), a synopsis of the project and a definition of colour schemes in precise values (such as CMYK, RGB or Pantone). This process could potentially also include sidekicks, props that are important to the character or a map of the world the project is set in.\nEven if you never reveal these aspects of your character to the wider world, doing these exercises will better inform you of your character and the world it inhabits, and in the long-term, help you to create a more personal and rewarding final project.\nOnce you start pitching, communicating to others or passing your character on for production, the character bible will be an essential tool for any collaboration.","The CMYK color model is a lesser-known color model. You may have never heard of it before, even though you’ve most certainly benefited from it.\nIn this post, we’ll cover when the CMYK color wheel is used, the CMYK primary colors, and what it means to be a subtractive color model.\nYou’ll walk away with a high-level understanding of when the CMYK color model is relevant and how to interact with it – all invaluable skills if you’re involved in the world of digital color.\nWhat is a Color Model?\nA color model (also known as a color system) is a process for creating more colors starting from a few primary colors.\nColor models explain how color works in different situations and applications. Our goal for this post is to explain how this works in the CMYK color model.\nWhat is the CMYK Color Model?\nThe CMYK color model is often also referred to as “process color.” It was first popularized at the turn of the 20th century when printers found that starting with magenta, cyan, and yellow inks provided the largest possible set of unique colors when used in print media.\nIf you’re wondering why CMYK has four letters in its acronym (instead of three, like the RGB and RYB models), it’s because of the addition of key (black) into the mix.\nThis is because black ink is usually used in printing even though black (or at least a dark muddy color due to technical limitations) can technically be created by blending cyan, magenta, and yellow together.\nAlthough it’s possible, using pure black pigmented ink simply creates a blacker black, but it avoids soaking the paper with ink, which would damage it. Blending three colors of ink to create black weakens the paper since it saturates the fibers so much.\nIn additive color models, such as the RGB model, white is the “additive” combination of all primary colored lights, black is the absence of light. In the CMYK model, it is the opposite: white is the natural color of the paper or other background, and black results from a full combination of colored inks.\nDid you know? RGB is the color space for digital images, while CMYK is the color space for printed materials.\nCMYK Colors Explained\nSurfaces appear to be certain colors because of the wavelengths of light they absorb and reflect.\nObjects that look red look that way because they absorb all wavelengths except red ones. Objects that look white reflect all wavelengths of light.\nObjects that look black absorb all color wavelengths (which is why you don’t want to wear black color or any dark colors in the summer if you want to stay cool). The CMYK color model works by blending pigments that reflect the desired wavelengths.\nThis is known as subtractive color because the pigments “subtract” specific colors from white paper. Specific color wavelengths are absorbed by pigment, changing what color is reflected back to be perceived by our eyes.\nWhite light without red leaves cyan, white light without blue leaves yellow, and white light without green leaves magenta.\nThe CMYK color model is used in digital printing. Anytime you’re translating an image from a digital computer screen to a printed product on the page, you’re using the CMYK model.\nBecause mixing ink works differently than mixing pigments or light, the CMYK color model has a different set of primary colors than the RYB or RGB color models.\nCMYK Primary Colors\nKey (black) deserves an honorable mention in this context because most printers use it, essentially, as another primary color.\n- Magenta + yellow = red\n- Cyan + yellow = green\n- Cyan + magenta = blue\nTheoretically, you could create black by combining all the primary colors. But in practice, printers generally use key (black) ink to do it instead, since using that much ink can actually damage the paper in the printing process.\nAll digital printers use the CMYK color model because it’s the most effective way to blend pigments for printing.\nWhen working on creating printed materials, you can tell the printer the exact density of ink required to create the desired colors, making a seamless transition from design to the printed final product, from business cards to magazines and beyond.\nHowever, many programs (like Adobe Photoshop) will display in RGB color spaces, be sure to change the color profile of the file you want to print to achieve your desired results.\nYou’re probably wondering why printers can’t just use the RYB color model, since they’re both subtractive models.\nThe reason is that the CMYK model is able to bridge the gap between RGB color mode (such as a digital design of a logo) and the printed page in a way the RYB model simply can’t.\nAt the end of the day, understanding the different color models is essential to successful graphic design. This way, you can optimize each stage of the design process."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:ffcb4413-8371-46de-aa75-b5a407a3cd11>","<urn:uuid:8fbd0cd0-24b5-401d-9670-4a8e72066913>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How is Australia's renewable energy sector creating job opportunities while the country simultaneously faces extreme climate challenges?","answer":"The renewable energy sector in Australia is showing significant job growth potential while the country battles severe climate impacts. The sector currently employs about 26,000 people and could grow to 45,000 jobs by 2025, with two-thirds of these jobs in regional areas. These positions span various roles including construction managers, engineers, electricians, and technicians. However, this job growth is occurring against a backdrop of intensifying climate challenges, as evidenced by Tasmania's recent experiences of record high temperatures, prolonged drought, and devastating fires that have destroyed unique forests and triggered over 2,000 dry lightning strikes in a single day, burning 3% of the island's area.","context":["As the global renewables transition accelerates, the future for coal regions has become a big worry. This raises an important question: can renewables create the right jobs in the right places to employ former coal workers?\nAccording to our new research, the answer in many cases is “yes”. Renewable energy jobs provide a good match for existing coal jobs across a range of blue and white-collar occupations, including construction and project managers, engineers, electricians, site administrators and mechanical technicians.\nBut about one-third of coal workers, such as drillers and machine operators, cannot simply switch over to renewables jobs. So as our economy pivots to renewables, planning and investment is needed to help coal regions survive.\nRenewables jobs: a snapshot\nOur research, commissioned by the Clean Energy Council, is the first large-scale survey of renewable energy employment in Australia.\nWe surveyed more than 450 Australian renewable energy businesses, covering large scale wind, solar and hydro, rooftop solar and batteries. We wanted to find out how many people were employed, and in what jobs.\nWe then projected employment until 2035 using three scenarios for the future of the electricity market, developed by the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO).\nOur results suggest renewable energy can be a major source of jobs in the next 15 years. But the trajectories are very different depending on government COVID-19 stimulus measures and wider energy policy.\nWe found the renewable energy sector currently employs about 26,000 people. Temporary construction and installation jobs now comprise 75% of the renewable energy labour market, but as the sector grows, this will change (more on that later).\nAustralia’s renewable energy target was reached last year, and has not been replaced. According to the Reserve Bank of Australia this caused renewables investment to fall by 50% last year compared to 2018. Under a “central” scenario where these policies continued, 11,000 renewable jobs would be lost by 2022.\nWe then examined a “step change” scenario where Australian policy settings were in line with meeting the Paris climate agreement. This would create a jobs boom: renewable energy employment would grow to 45,000 by 2025 and average around 35,000 jobs each year to 2035. Up to two-thirds are in regional areas.\nUnder all scenarios, job growth is strongest in rooftop solar and wind. Most are in the construction and installation phase, comprising both ongoing and project-based jobs in trades, as well as technicians and labourers. But by 2035, as many as half of renewable energy jobs could be ongoing jobs in operation and maintenance.\nRenewable energy jobs will be higher than our projections. We excluded employment areas such as building electricity transmission networks, bioenergy, professional services, renewable hydrogen, growth in minerals needed for renewable energy, and jobs in heavy industry such as “green” steel.\nRenewables vs coal jobs\nAll up, coal mining in Australia employs about 40,000 people. As mentioned above, renewable energy jobs could grow to 45,000 by 2025 – and more once other sectors are included.\nAustralia’s renewable energy industry already employs considerably more people than the 10,500 working in the domestic coal sector – mostly thermal coal mining and power generation.\nAbout 75% of coal mined in Australia is exported. About 24,000 people work in thermal coal mining for both domestic use and export – slightly fewer than the current renewable energy workforce.\nNew renewables jobs in coal regions\nAround two-thirds of renewable energy jobs could be created in regional areas. These would be distributed more widely than coal sector jobs.\nThe leading coal mining states, NSW and Queensland, have the biggest share of renewable energy jobs under all scenarios.\nAEMO has identified “renewable energy zones” where most large-scale renewable energy is expected to be located. In both NSW and Queensland, some of these zones overlap with the coal workforce. In NSW, the Central West zone could also create employment in the Hunter region. In general, though, many renewable energy jobs will be located in other regions and the capital cities.\nIn terms of occupations, there is overlap between coal and renewable energy. These include construction and project managers, engineers, electricians, mechanical trades, office managers and contract administrators and drivers.\nThe timing and location of these renewables jobs will influence whether they can be a source of alternative jobs for coal workers. Re-training of coal workers would also be required.\nBut there is no direct job overlap for the semi-skilled machine operators such as drillers, which account for more than one-third of the coal workforce.\nPlanning for the decline\nRenewable energy can meaningfully help in the transition for coal regions. But it won’t replace all lost coal jobs, and planning and investment is needed to avoid social and economic harm.\nCoal regions need industry development plans and investment to diversify their economies to other industries, including renewables. Almost half our coal workers are aged under 40, so Australia will not be able to follow Germany and Spain’s lead by relying on early retirement schemes.\nAt some point, demand for our coal exports will collapse – be it due to the falling cost of renewables, or policies to address climate change. If we don’t start preparing now, the consequences for coal communities will be dire.\n- Authored by Chris Briggs, Research Principal, Institute for Sustainable Futures, University of Technology Sydney; Elsa Dominish, Senior Research Consultant, Institute for Sustainable Futures, University of Technology Sydney, and Jay Rutovitz, Research Director, Institute for Sustainable Futures, University of Technology Sydney","The best of EcoWatch, right in your inbox. Sign up for our email newsletter!\nFerocious Heat Engulfs Usually Temperate Tasmania\nBy Kieran Cooke\nAustralia has been going through one of its hottest and stormiest summers on record and usually temperate Tasmania, its island state, has taken a battering.\nClimate change-related weather events have brought cyclones and raging floods to the northeast of the country, while drought and temperatures exceeding 40°C (104°F) have resulted in parched lands and rivers drying up in areas of New South Wales.\nSummer on the island of Tasmania, Australia's most southerly state, with a generally temperate climate, is usually a time for BBQs and beach swimming. This summer has been very different.\nA prolonged drought and record high temperatures have caused a series of devastating fires, destroying unique forests and vegetation and forcing people to leave their homes.\nCritics of the Australian government say it's clear climate change is wreaking havoc; meanwhile politicians continue to pander to the interests of the country's powerful mining and fossil fuel industries.\nMike Willson is a Tasmania resident, a fire equipment specialist and a volunteer with the Tasmania Fire Service. Here he tells Climate News Network what life has been like on the island over recent weeks:\n\"There is menace in the air. Days full of thick brown smoke. The clouds of smoke have even been swept across 2,500 kilometres of ocean to as far away as New Zealand—itself trying to cope with its own forest fires.\nA new phenomenon has arrived in Tasmania—lightning storms without rain. In one day in mid-January there were over 2,000 dry lightning strikes over the south-west and central highlands here, starting up to 70 bush fires.\nEven with water bombing by planes and helicopters, the fires—which have already burned out 3% of the area of the island—are virtually impossible to control.\nDealing with these fires is like fighting a snarling dragon.

{"question":"Can printed pictures help remember historia better que digital images en brain-based learning?","answer":"Based on the information provided, both printed and digital images are effective memory aids. For studying subjects like history, printed pictures can be particularly useful as they allow for hands-on activities, such as arranging images of events in chronological order. In brain-based learning, visual content is highly effective regardless of format, as 80-90% of information absorbed by the brain is visual. The key is to pair concepts with meaningful images to ensure information is stored in long-term memory, whether using printed or digital formats.","context":["One thing that many special needs children struggle with is remembering what they are taught in school. If you think about it, the majority of school involves recalling and using information you have learned in the past. To excel in math, you must first memorize your numbers then understand and remember addition and subtraction before you can move on to multiplication and division. Almost every subject requires the ability to build upon former knowledge. So if a child struggles to remember things, it just makes school that much harder for him. There are several ways you can help your child remember things easier. The first memory aid is the use of visuals.\nA visual is any image or picture that goes along with what your child is trying to remember. Visuals can be especially helpful for a child with a speech or language problem. Every person remembers things that they see better than words they hear or read. How many times have you been able to picture a person, but not remember their name? For special needs students putting a picture with a concept can give them a mental attachment to the thought which will help them remember it.\nYou can use visuals in many different ways as you work with your child.\n- Printed pictures – As you teach or review subjects like history or science, find pictures online or in books that apply to what you are covering. You could even print out some of the pictures and use them in activities. For example, if you want your child to remember the main events of the Civil War, print out a picture for each event. Then have your child practice putting those pictures in the correct order.\n- Child-drawn pictures – Let your child draw small doodle type pictures next to notes on the information they are learning. Remember the pictures don’t necessarily have to make sense to you, just to the child. If you want your child to practice their multiplication facts, you could let them doodle a different pictures next to each fact while they are studying. When you quiz them next, reminding them of the doodle when they forget a fact may help them remember it.\n- Cut up words – Old magazines are a great resource for usable visuals. Your child could cut out pictures about what you are learning, but they could also cut out the printed words and use them. For example, if you are studying prepositions in English, have your child make a preposition collage. Let them cut out all the examples of prepositions they can find in a magazine and glue them onto a large sheet of paper. Hang the paper somewhere they can see it often.\nPutting ideas into picture form can make the difficult task of remember information much easier for students that struggle with language. In the next post, we will discuss using motions as a memory aid.\nHow do you use visuals to help your child recall information?\nPhoto by: studio tdes","There is a simple way to design effective eLearning courses about any subject: brain-based learning. This instructional approach was defined by Hileman in 2006 and has since inspired many “brain compatible designers” — those who seek to understand the principle and reasoning behind their teaching.\nThe idea behind the concept is that learning is innate and linked to biological and chemical processes in the human brain. Much of the time, eLearning instructors are unaware that they are hindering the learning process through ineffective training methods and inappropriate design. When eLearning professionals have a greater knowledge of the brain, they are able to make better decisions about design and create richer learning conditions that attend to students’ social and emotional needs.\nActually, most eLearning professionals know more about brain-based learning than they think; for instance, many start their courses by activating prior knowledge, which helps learners build on what they already know and strengthens connections in the brain. Many use a variety of media types that help students think visually, kinesthetically, and phonetically.\nCreating brain-based courses is actually relatively easy, especially when following the acronym B.R.A.I.N. B.A.S.E.D., coined by Sarah Hielman in 2006 (Hilemans, S. (2006). \"Motivation Students Using Brain-based Teaching Strategies.\" The Agricultural Education Magazine, 78(4), 18-20).\nB: Brain's Time Clock\nThe human brain runs on 90 to 120 cycles called ultradian rhythms, which influence attention, interest, cognition, memory, visual perception, arousal, performance, moods, and behavior. To accommodate these cycles, it is important to vary instructional activities and spend no more than 12 to 15 minutes of focused attention on passive learning.\nDon't expect your learners to go through content once, pass the assessment and remember it forever. Repetition of information strengthens connections in the brain and the brain encodes information most efficiently when content is repeated in multiple ways. Therefore, the most effective eLearning courses repeat information through a variety of ways such as video, images, charts, before and after modules and graphic organizers.\nReview of information should happen at gradually lengthening intervals as this reinforces neuronal connections. The more practice students have, the stronger these connections become; however, it is essential that practice be interesting.\nThere are a few approaches designers can use to create effective eLearning courses:\n- Pre-exposure — providing hints about the learning topics days, weeks, or months in advance.\n- Previewing — clear exposure to content before a lesson such as through an overview.\n- Priming — direct exposure to content.\n- Reviewing — recapping of learned material.\n- Revising — checking that students have learned material correctly.\nA: Active Learning\nRather than allowing learners to become passive recipients of information, eLearning professionals need to get students actively involved through physical or mental performance. When people learn by doing, they become energized, they stick with the content, and they learn more.This increases the blood flow around the body, improving learners’ memory, retrieval, and confidence.\nLow energy levels are unavoidable if students remain seated for long periods of time. In eLearning environments, role play, energizing online discussions and quick games can all add sensory stimuli to raise blood pressure and epinephrine levels to eliminate drowsiness, reduce restlessness, and reinforce information. Allowing learners to do some exercises on their own to better understand abstract ideas, write an essay or work with an interactive simulation are also helpful strategies.\nThe brain responds best to visual content: of all the information it absorbs, around 80 to 90 percent is visual. Studies on memory have found that one of the easiest ways to ensure that learners store information in their long-term memory is to pair concepts with meaningful images. Visuals help people make sense out of the content and direct attention, increasing the possibilities that the learners will remember. This implies that eLearning designers would do best to match chunks of text with graphics, diagrams, and videos whenever possible.\nRecommended read: this post digs deep into some statistics and facts to further convince of why eLearning developers should embrace visuals when creating their courses.\nWhen learners see something new, dopamine levels increase in the brain as students know the stimuli has the potential to reward them in some way. This motivates learners to seek out the reward. There are a huge number of opportunities to introduce novelty in eLearning courses simply by being creative; for instance, developers can use fresh examples, surprise learners with new data or present a scenario that’s completely unpredictable. Or, even engage students through games and simulations that require learners to apply the information in unfamiliar contexts.\nB: Be Color\nAs color connects neuropathways, people remember colors better than verbal or textual cues alone; for instance, The Institute for Color Research – now called Color Matters, confirmed that color can improve learning from 55 percent to 78 percent as well as comprehensive by as much as 73 percent.\nAdditionally, humans exhibit different reactions according to the wavelengths of color. Yellow and pink can improve memory, green and blue help students relax and lead to increased concentration, red leads to a release of adrenaline and can be aggravating. Researchers have found that blue or black on a white background is the best for overall comprehension and retention.\nMore research on color psychology for eLearning here.\nA: Automatic Learning\nScientists believe that around 95 percent of learning is non-conscious, which means non-verbal communication is of central importance in eLearning courses. Designers need to create a positive environment with sufficient resources and stimuli where students will enjoy learning.\neLearning designers need to be curious about how their material can trigger the unnoticeable or subtle aspects of your learners’ experience. After all, while the conscious mind is analytical and rational, the unconscious mind follows no logic.\nBook recommendation: Brain-Based Learning: The New Paradigm of Teaching by Eric Jensen\nS: Social Brain\nRecent neuroscience research underlines the brain’s inherently social nature. Humans are social animals, and working together can enhance learning. Effective eLearning courses should include plenty of opportunities for social interaction that enables learners to increase their comprehension and retention of new information. Include places on your course for learners to be social, whether it is a blog with comments, a chat or a forum.\nE: Elicit Emotions\nEmotions are pivotal to attention, perception, memory, and problem solving. When the amygdala, the emotional part in the center of the brain, notices that content has a high emotional value, it considers this material to be more important. Learners remember this stimuli more easily. Storytelling is one of the best ways to evoke emotions such as risk, excitement, urgency, and pleasure. Plus, stories have the added benefit that their structure makes sense to the hippocampus and this helps students store this content.\nD: Develop Thinking Skills\nIncluding problem solving in eLearning makes content more relatable to the real world. Effective eLearning courses often allow students to gather information, conceptualize a problem, generate possible outcomes, and publicly present the final results."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:6a365550-1314-4bcf-bd2c-20a3a7563bef>","<urn:uuid:68846e5b-c59d-425b-ab8a-d171ba394ad4>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Is physical therapy important for both pre-surgical rehabilitation and triple arthrodesis recovery?","answer":"Yes, physical therapy is important in both cases but serves different purposes. In pre-surgical rehabilitation (prehab), physical therapy focuses on building overall strength, endurance, and flexibility about six weeks before surgery to improve post-surgical outcomes. For triple arthrodesis recovery, physical therapy is required specifically after surgery to restore strength and mobility in the ankle joint, typically starting after the 12-week cast period once stable fusion is observed. Both involve therapeutic exercises and functional strength training to optimize patient outcomes.","context":["Why am I hearing so much about “prehab”?\nPre-surgical rehabilitation, or “prehab,” is increasingly popular in the surgical and physical therapy communities. Just as “rehab” generally refers to work that patients do to recover after surgery or intense medical treatment, “prehab” is designed to be undertaken prior to that procedure.\nWhat does pre-surgical rehab accomplish?\nTo put it succinctly, prehab shortens rehab. For patients who have pre-planned joint replacements or other reparative operations, pre-surgical rehabilitation helps reduce the time and challenges of post-surgery rehabilitation.\nAfter surgery, patients must re-learn how to move again. Much of that need comes from the lack of muscle mass and flexibility that their existing condition caused. In addition, the surgery itself often involves some pain and stiffness in the following days and weeks.\nPre-surgical rehabilitation is designed to help you regain some of your lost strength and flexibility before you even have the surgery, as well as build up your ability to heal more quickly after your operation. When done correctly, prehab can dramatically decrease the time and pain associated with post-surgical recovery.\nWhat happens in “prehab”?\nAssuming you have enough planning time, your pre-surgical rehab sessions would start about six weeks before your operation, depending on what your doctor advises. Our physical therapist will also help you evaluate your goals and your concerns. (Many patients worry about climbing stairs after surgery, for example, or even that first walk to the hospital bathroom.)\nDuring your sessions, you’ll be working on building your overall strength and endurance, so your body bounces back from the surgical trauma. In addition, your physical therapist will help structure a plan that meets the challenges of your particular surgery, such as building upper body strength if you’re going to be getting around on crutches.\nWhat can I expect from pre-surgical rehab?\nStudies show that patients who participate in pre-surgical rehabilitation experience these specific benefits:\n- Increased stamina and confidence. Not only will you have more aerobic endurance and muscle strength to take on postoperative routines, but you’ll have the confidence in having already built up the strategies for doing so.\n- Increased mobility. Prehab gives you the physical flexibility you’ll need to work through post-surgical stiffness. Our physical therapists also coach you on techniques for maintaining your balance, and compensating for limbs you can’t fully use while you are recovering.\nSurgeons routinely refer post-surgical patients to our physical therapists to help them recover strength, function and mobility.\nOur therapists provide one-on-one, evidence-based physical therapy treatment sessions to help facilitate your recovery and return to activities of daily living (ADLs), work, recreational activities and even competitive sports.\nThe rehabilitative process depends on the injury and type of surgery. We help patients recover and rehabilitate from a variety of orthopedic post-operative procedures, including:\n- Knee, hip and shoulder joint replacements\n- Reconstruction of any one or more of the four major knee ligaments: anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), medial collateral ligament (MCL), posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) and lateral collateral ligament (LCL)\n- Arthroscopic knee surgeries (such as meniscectomies, meniscal repairs)\n- Ligament and tendon repair, including Achilles tendon repairs\n- Arthroscopic hip surgeries (such as labral repairs)\n- Nerve releases (such as cubital tunnel, radial tunnel, carpal tunnel, tarsal tunnel)\n- Neck and back surgery (such as fusions, laminectomy, decompression and discectomy)\n- Nerve compression release\n- Bone or joint fusion (arthrodesis)\n- Tendon transfers\n- Surgical fixation of fractures, including open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF), a two-part surgery used to fix broken bones where the broken bone is reduced (put back into place) and an internal fixation device is placed on the bone (e.g., screws, plates, rods or pins) to hold the bone together\n- Shoulder post-surgical recovery for rotator cuff tears, labral tears, superior labrum anterior and posterior (SLAP) tear or lesion, arthroscopy and more\n- Manual therapy\n- Soft tissue and/or joint mobilization\n- Muscle energy\n- Gait and balance training\n- Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) - electrical muscle & nerve stimulation\n- Therapeutic exercise and functional strength training\n- Functional re-education\n- Rehabilitative exercises to help increase strength, endurance, motion, balance and coordination","- What Is\nWhat is a triple arthrodesis surgery?\nA triple arthrodesis is a surgical procedure that fuses three joints of the ankle. It is used to relieve pain from arthritic, deformed, or unstable joints.\nGenerally, surgeons try to avoid the fusion procedure by treating the ankle joints with alternative methods. However, when the pain is so severe, a triple arthrodesis remains the only option.\nMost of the time, a triple arthrodesis offers satisfactory results in the long term as well. In one study that followed patients for 44 years after their triple arthrodesis, it found that 95% of patients were satisfied with the outcome.\nWhy is a triple arthrodesis performed?\nA triple arthrodesis is performed for patients with the following conditions:\n- Rheumatoid/degenerative arthritis (severe arthritis of ankle)\n- Ankle deformity\n- Ankle instability\n- Severe flatfoot\n- Abnormal connections between bones\n- Excessively high arches\n- Joint instability due to neuromuscular disease such as poliomyelitis\nMany of these conditions may be treated using other procedures. Only when the nonsurgical treatments fail, the surgeon considers a triple arthrodesis. After examining the patient’s condition and disease progression, the surgeon decides whether to perform a triple arthrodesis.\nWhat is done before a triple arthrodesis?\nTwo to three X-rays of each foot will be taken from different angles to understand the ankle problem and how to go about the surgery.\nThe patient will be admitted the night before the surgery and asked not to eat or drink anything for the next 12 hours before the surgery.\nWhat is the technique used in a triple arthrodesis?\nA triple arthrodesis is performed by an orthopedic surgeon.\n- The patient might be given general anesthesia that makes them sleep throughout the procedure or spinal anesthesia that numbs their entire leg. Additionally, an injection in the back of the knee or ankle joint may also be given to ease the pain.\n- Next, the orthopedic surgeon makes one incision (cut) on each side of the foot.\n- Further, the surgeon removes the elastic structure over the joint surfaces (cartilage), followed by the roughening of the bony surfaces and filling of the bony defects with bone grafts.\n- Next, the surgeon attaches the bones with the help of hardware such as screws. This will eventually result in healthy fusion.\n- The surgeon then sutures the incisions and covers the surgical wound with a bandage.\nWhat is done after a triple arthrodesis?\n- The patient is observed for several hours after the surgery.\n- Analgesics are given, and the leg is elevated to reduce the postoperative edema and pain in the ankle.\n- The patient is discharged after one to three days. Instructions are given about which activities need to be restricted.\n- While at home, leg elevation should be continued for the next five days, and ice should be applied over the ankle around three to four times a day.\n- The patient should visit the hospital after one week to change the wound dressing.\n- A short leg cast is applied after the edema has disappeared to restrict the movements in the ankle joint and allow healthy fusion of the joints.\n- Sutures are removed after two weeks.\nWhat are the complications of a triple arthrodesis surgery?\n- Nonunion/malunion (bones may not fuse, or they may fuse abnormally)\n- Degenerative joint disease (ankle arthritis due to wearing of the surrounding structures)\n- Delayed wound healing\n- Nerve injury\n- Avascular necrosis (Damage to the adjacent blood vessels leading to the destruction of the ankle bone)\n- Lateral instability (inability to move the ankle sideways)\n- Stiff foot\nHow long does it take to recover from a triple arthrodesis?\n- The patient wears a plaster cast, wrapped around the ankle and foot, for the first 12 weeks following the surgery. Crutches can be used to move around and avoid weight bearing on the ankle.\n- Gradual weight bearing is allowed until full weight bearing is reached. This usually takes around three months. The cast is removed and replaced by a removable walker boot.\n- X-rays are obtained at approximately 12 weeks. If stable fusion is observed, the patient can switch from the walker boot to normal shoes.\n- Physical therapy is required to restore strength and mobility in the ankle joint.\n- It usually takes around ten 10 months to become pain-free and recover from the surgery.\n- The patient can experience maximum improvement one year after the surgery.\n- AHA News: This Tick Season, Beware the Tiny Bugs That Can Carry Lyme Disease – a Danger to the Heart\n- Ticks Can Take a Licking From Really Tough Weather\n- Drug Might Help Slow Nearsightedness in Kids\n- Does Your Kid Need a Summer Vacation From Smartphones?\n- Get in the Swim: Summer Pool Safety Tips\n- More Health News »\nHealth Solutions From Our Sponsors\nMedscape Medical Reference\nTop How Long to Recover From a Triple Arthrodesis Related Articles\nArthritis (Joint Inflammation)Arthritis is inflammation of one or more joints.

Businesses are having to publish content more often and update pages more frequently as online products and services become increasingly available to consumers across the globe. Companies are turning to the translation technology industry to rapidly help make their products searchable and understandable in multiple languages. As this trend grows, language companies turn to AI translation software to meet the high and urgent demands for localized online content.\nWhat is AI Translation?\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is an aspect of computer science that gives a machine the ability to learn and adapt instead of simply processing data based on a set of instructions. With translation and localization, AI allows a device to instantly translate from one language to another.\nArtificial intelligence is a perpetually hot topic because of its rapid growth and improvement in the various ways AI touches all industries. With AI translation, the intersection of machine learning and language translation can help businesses and other organizations worldwide access new audiences and facilitate international growth more effectively than ever before. AI is already used in many ways to make translation processes faster and more efficient, including integration, workflow automation, automated quoting, and machine translation.\nThe Role of AI in Translation\nWhen people think of AI translation, they most often think of Neural Machine Translation (NMT). With NMT, AI can “learn” from completed translations using Recurrent Neural Networks, which pick up on word use, sentence structure, and intent based on context drawn from an extensive artificial neural network that resembles what happens in the human brain. Neural machine translation has proven successful in translating content for companies. An adaptive NMT engine can learn a brand’s voice, tone, and style and leverage that information to produce translations.\nNMT has advanced from Phrase-Based Machine Translation (sometimes also referred to as Statistical Machine Translation). These translation systems built statistical models of the relationships between words, phrases, and sentences in a text and then applied the model to a second language to convert those elements to the new language. NMT is effective because it requires less memory and data to perform well and allows all translations to be connected, which creates better context and accuracy for large volumes of content. NMT translates whole sentences rather than just individual words, making translations faster and more accurate.\nNMT isn’t the only way AI is leveraged within the translation industry. For instance, AI is used by large companies for its translation function in place of human translators. With the development of voice recognition systems like Alexa, language recognition software like Siri, and apps like Google Translate, AI has accomplished an incredible amount for language translation. For example, Facebook (META) has a function for translating text to text from one language to another, and Microsoft LUIS is used in chatbots to communicate with users in natural language. A more advanced version of Google Translate even has a camera function that allows it to translate a word by hovering a phone above the word or sentence.\nAdvantages and Drawbacks of AI Translation Software\nAI translation software offers many practical advantages to translation. AI translation software can efficiently speed up the translation process, which saves time and money, and builds translated content faster, allowing quicker entry into new markets. AI translation software has become valuable enough to offer a base understanding of meaning in translated content, and translation quality can improve over time by “training” the database’s language patterns with additional content.\nThere are also drawbacks to AI translation software that are important to note. AI translators may be more accurate than ever, but they aren’t humans with a deep knowledge of local cultures. Accurate translations can still be misleading or offensive to local people, and humor is something that computers aren’t well-equipped to analyze. Localization challenges for AI include context, jargon, colloquialisms, and other cultural and language nuances. In addition, AI “training” can be fast, but creating training data is time-consuming and often requires interpretation by humans. This creates a limited translation ability.\nCombining AI Translation with Expert Linguists\nContent translation can never be completely automated. The future of translation will combine human intelligence and AI-powered machine translation – a hybrid model of human translators and AI tools to form a single translation team. Machine translation will ensure AI-generated translations are accurate and fluent, while human translators will make final changes to cater to specific audiences and localize the translated content.\nBusinesses can accurately apply an AI-human approach to their translation needs. This includes using NMT for translating all content combined with human translation during post-editing or targeting web pages that would benefit from the speed of AI translation and separating them from those with the need for a more nuanced, human translation. MotionPoint is a localization company that combines cutting-edge AI technology with expert linguists to provide you with well-rounded, effective content translations to meet your budget, needs, and, most important, global outreach goals.Last updated on May 09, 2022"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:9fa64b85-f760-40c6-8f4e-235a9523926f>","<urn:uuid:5b57baf3-f93d-46d6-bdd3-49124228f243>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What is maximum tiempo para completar the CNOR exam and how many questions does it have?","answer":"The CNOR exam takes three hours and 45 minutes to complete and consists of 200 multiple-choice questions, including 15 pretest questions that do not contribute to the final score.","context":["The CNOR exam is a comprehensive and challenging assessment required by many jurisdictions during the certification process for operating room nurses. In order to sit for this exam, candidates must have at least two years and 2,400 logged hours as an operating room nurse. Once issued, certification lasts five years.\nThe content of the CNOR exam is divided into nine domains: patient assessment and diagnosis (12 percent of the exam); identification of expected outcomes and development of a plan of care (10 percent); intraoperative activities (37 percent); communication (7 percent); discharge planning (2 percent); cleaning, disinfecting, packaging, and sterilizing (15 percent); emergency situations (6 percent); management of personnel services and material (5 percent); and professional accountability (6 percent).\nThe CNOR exam is composed of 200 multiple-choice questions, 15 of which are pretest questions used to develop future versions of the exam. These questions do not contribute to the final score.\nThe CNOR exam takes three hours and 45 minutes to complete and is administered by computer. Scores are based on the number of questions answered correctly, which means that candidates should always guess even when they are uncertain of the answer.\nCandidates who pass the exam will be notified of their passage but will receive no other indication of their performance. Candidates who fail will receive a scaled score indicating how far they were from passing. The exam scores for the CNOR exam are usually delivered four to six weeks after the exam date.\nCNOR Study Guide\nStart learning how to be successful on your CNOR exam. Our CNOR study guide is guaranteed to help you get the results you deserve on your CNOR test. Some test takers prefer to study using flashcards and so we have created the best CNOR flashcards that cover everything you need to know for the CNOR exam. Note that using multiple study aids will help you maximize the benefit from your study time.\nCNOR Practice Test Questions\n1. In the Pain Assessment in Advanced Dementia (PAINAD) scale, all of the following are common indicators of pain except:\na. Compliant behavior\nd. Combative behavior\n2. Long-term substance abuse is commonly suggested by all of the following physical assessment findings except:\na. Nasal irritation and sniffing repeatedly\nb. Needle tracks on arms\nc. Burns on fingers and lips\nd. Unequal pupils\n3. With the traditional surgical wound classification system, a surgical wound that enters into a colonized area of the body, such as the respiratory or urinary tract, is classified as:\na. Class I\nb. Class II\nc. Class III\nd. Class IV\n4. The most appropriate nursing diagnosis for a surgical patient with neutropenia and absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 900 is:\na. Risk of injury\nb. Risk of aspiration\nc. Risk of infection\nd. Ineffective coping\n5. Medication reconciliation should be completed:\na. Prior to admission\nb. During the admission assessment\nc. On discharge\nd. During all phases of care\n1. A: Patients with dementia and pain do not usually react with compliance. PAINAD indicators include:\n• Respirations: Rapid and labored breathing as pain increases with short periods of hyperventilation or Cheyne-Stokes respirations.\n• Vocalization: Negative or quiet and reluctant. As pain increases, patients may call out, moan or groan loudly, or cry.\n• Facial expression: Sad or frightened, frowning or grimacing, especially on activities that increase pain.\n• Body language: Tense, fidgeting, pacing. As pain increases, patients may become increasingly combative, rigid, fists clenched, or lie in fetal position.\n• Consolability: Less distractible or consolable with increased pain.\n2. D: While pupils may be abnormally dilated or constricted and watery because of drug use, they are usually equal in size.\nPhysical signs Other signs\n|Physical signs||Other signs|\n3. B: Class II: Clean-contaminated wounds (risk < 10%) enter into colonized parts of the body, such as the respiratory or urinary tract.\nClass I: Clean wounds (risk < 2%) do not enter an area of the body that is usually colonized by normal flora.\nClass III: Contaminated wounds (risk 20%) have obvious inflammation but no purulent discharge. They may involve spillage of the gastrointestinal tract, penetrating wounds (< 4 hours), and/or substantial break in aseptic technique. Class IV: Dirty-infected wounds (risk 40%) show obvious inflammation and purulent discharge. There may be perforation of viscera prior to surgery and/or penetrating wounds (> 4 hours).\n4. C: Surgical patients with neutropenia are at risk for both exogenous and endogenous infection. Total ANC should be 1,800 to 2,000/mm3 or higher. Risk of infection is significant if the level falls to 1,000 and severe at 500. ANC is calculated indirectly from the total white blood cell count (WBC) and the percentages of neutrophils and bands:\nANC = Total WBC x (% neutrophils + % bands/100)\nIf, for example, the WBC is 5,300 with 12% neutrophils and 2% bands, neutropenia is evident despite the normal WBC:\nANC = 5,300 X 13/100 = 689\n5. D: Medication reconciliation should be an ongoing process during all phases of care. Medication reconciliation includes making a list of all current medications (dose and frequency), including herbs and nonprescription drugs and vitamins, as well as drug allergies or intolerances. This list should be posted prominently in the patient’s chart so physicians can check the list whenever ordering medications. The patient must receive a new/revised list on discharge with thorough explanation of any changes and access to drug information and the advice of a pharmacist."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:dd7d8198-63ee-41ac-b825-eeab189a4940>"],"error":null}

{"question":"Hi! What are the safety regulations and parent involvement requirements for young racers in both auto and motorcycle competitions? 🏁","answer":"In auto racing at Sunset Speedway, the Mini Stock division accommodates young drivers starting at age 12, operating within a professional environment focused on skill development and safety. For motorcycle racing, the regulations are more extensive: both parents must sign minor release forms, and at least one parent/legal guardian must be present at all times at the racetrack. If one parent is absent, they must provide a notarized minor release form printed in color. Additionally, all riders under 16 must submit a resume describing their experience and race results from related activities like motocross or flat track. The Penguin Racing School reserves the right to disallow participation for any student they feel isn't ready for roadracing, and they strongly recommend gaining racing experience in dirt track or motocross before attempting road racing.","context":["At Sunset Speedway, we offer various kinds of racing to showcase your talent and abilities. Whether you are a beginner or amateur, we are happy to offer you a professional environment where you can learn, develop your skills, and most importantly have some fun.\nMini Stock racing is one of Sunset Speedways entry level divisions. Consisting of domestic and import four cylinder vehicles. These cars are allowed adjustment in suspension and engine but must use most Original Equipment Manufacturer parts. As an entry level division the age group varies with some drivers as young as 12 years old. Many racers in Super Stock and higher divisions have cut their teeth in the Mini Stock division. This is a great division for drivers to develop their skills.\nThe Super Stock division consists of cars based on 70’s and 80’s General Motors Chassis’(Camaro, Chevelle, Monte Carlo). These cars are allowed many suspension changes from stock and use very few Original Equipment Manufacturer parts. They are powered by modified Chevrolet Small Block Engine or a General Motors 602 Crate Engine. Bodies on these cars vary from steel stock type bodies to fiberglass versions of new generation muscle cars. This division is a utilized as an excellent driver development tool for those who look to ascend the racing ladder.\nLate models use tubular frames and are built from the ground up as a purpose built race car. These cars use modified Chevrolet Small Block, Ford 351, Dodge 360 or General Motors 602 Crate engine, These cars utilize plastic or fiberglass template or newer generation muscle car bodies and feature such brands as Chevrolet, Ford, Dodge, Toyota and Buick. As the highest division at Sunset Speedway these drivers compete in NASCAR’s Whelen All American Series Division One competing for the National Title.\nAPC LATE MODEL SERIES\nThe APC Racing Series was formed in the winter of 2014/2015 to bring a touring Late Model series back to Ontario. With a rule set bringing together cars and drivers from tracks across the province. The cars while looking like Sunset’s Sauble Falls Late Models are much different. They have different motor and suspension packages. With 2 stops at Sunset in 2015 you wont want miss this roster of over 40 plus drivers.\nONTARIO SUPER LATE MODEL SERIES\nOn the track, this particular type of racing offers plenty of excitement and action! The Ontario Super Late Model Series features a premier type of racing; the Super Late Model Outlaws have a unique body style and can boast the greatest horsepower of any Ontario stock car division. Specifically, these race cars feature a hood and nose combination which slopes to the ground on a steep angle creating down force and helping the handling of the cars.\nThe OSCAAR Modified division is one of the fastest growing series in Ontario. The open wheel cars utilize a wide rules package using cars based on the same chassis as the NASCAR Whelen Modified Series with some modifications. These cars use different crate and built engine packages along with an aggressive wide tire.\nONTARIO PRO CHALLENGE\nThis particular type of racing delivers full-throttle excitement and unbelievable weight-to-horsepower ratio. Pro Challenge race cars are ¾ spec scale, tube framed Nextel Cup styled cars. They are powered by sealed Kawasaki Ninja 1100 cc engines and are fabricated with tube frames and fibreglass body paneling. Pro Challenge has a network of tracks and distributors in over a half-dozen states in the United States and Canada. Sunset Speedway is proud to be part of the Pro Challenge racing family.\nCANADIAN VINTAGE MODIFIEDS\nThe Canadian Vintage Modified is a traveling vintage stock car racing series. This year, The Lucas Oil Canadian Vintage Modifieds will be entering their 49th season. The 2015 season will feature 13 races across the province. These cars must utilize a stock roof from before 1948. They also use a combination of either an Inline 6 cylinder engine or a GM 602 Crate Engine.\nThe Canam Midgets are celebrating over 45 years of open wheel racing in southern Ontario and the United States. These cars are open wheeled racers with a wing for down force. Power also comes from 750cc Kawasaki ZX7 motorcycle engines.\nSunset Speedway is proud to be a part of The Ontario Legends Series. The Ontario Legends Series is a family based racing series that is fun, friendly and competitive. It is also INEX* sanctioned. Legend Cars are a 5/8 scale versions of 1930s & 1940s Chevrolet, Ford and Dodge, coupes and sedans. The cars are powered by a 1.2 liter (75 cubic inch) engine, allowing them to reach speeds that are over 200 km/h (120 mph). Legend Cars are raced at over two hundred tracks and speedways in Canada and the United States.","Minimum Age for Participation - 10 Years Old (YNR Events Only), 12 Years Old (Other events - graduated & approved YNR participants)\nThere has been a movement as of late that has brought several younger riders into the sport of roadracing. Although we are excited about the influx of younger riders into our sport, there are certain restrictions placed on these riders to ensure that they are to participate in the safest possible environment. We have seen some very talented youngsters in recent years and look forward to seeing many more. In addition to normal liability releases, the parent or guardian present will be required to sign a release stating that their child is ready and able to participate in motorcycle track days and/or roadracing. The Penguin Racing School reserves the right to disallow participation for any student that we feel is not ready for roadracing.\nReleases / Parental Presence Required\nInsurance regulation are very strict with regards to minor participation. Both parents must have signed the minor release form, and at least one parent / legal guardian must be present at all times at the racetrack. If one parent is not present, the absent parent must have prepared the minor release form both printed in color and notarized and presented to Penguin the morning of the event. This form is required for each date that the minor participates in. To download the minor release form CLICK HERE.\nAge 16-17 (with drivers license)\nRiders that are between 16 and 17 years old are allowed to participate in any class that their parents (or legal guardians) see fit. However, we strongly advise that these riders start in a lightweight or middleweight class (600cc 4-cylinder) and avoid the larger displacement classes. Riders who fall in this age category must present their driver's license and have parents or guardians present (with photo ID).\nAge 12-15 (and 16-17 without drivers license)\nRiders that are between 12 and 17 years old are allowed to participate on only select types of lightweight motorcycles. These motorcycles include 125 Grand Prix bikes , 500cc or smaller single cylinder motorcycles (including 450cc supermotard bikes), and 500cc or smaller 4 stroke Twin cylinder motorcycles. Riders who fall in this age category must present their birth certificate and have a parent or guardian present (with photo ID). All riders under the age of 16 in this group MUST submit a resume to Penguin prior to being accepted into the program. This will allow us to help place riders in the class that is most appropriate for them. Resumes don't need to be fancy, just a description of the youth rider experience and any race results from motocross, flat track or similar activities. We are interested in the long term success of every rider, and need to ensure that any minor that intends to participate is prepared for the rigors of riding with 1000cc sport bikes. For those who are not, we have special groups (the YNR groups) that offer a perfect entry point that does not involve open track time with general track day groups. We have had many successful young riders of late, but each rider is considered on an individual basis. We strongly recommend gaining racing experience (dirt track or motocross) before any minor attempts to road race.\nAll first time riders in this category are eligible exclusively for our YNR (Youth and New Rider) program dates. Here, they will be brought through a completely adjustable curriculum that will help build their skills and confidence in a progressive fashion. These riders will work closely with Penguin coaches. Skilled and experienced riders in this group will \"graduate\" from the YNR program when they can pass several core competency tests for the PRS staff. Riders may participate on most any motorcycle over 100cc's that is prepared for the track (street tires). Parent/Guardian requirements mirror those for the 12-15 year old riders above. Our focus is to provide a fun, nurturing environment that will develop riders with excellent skills and a love for our sport."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"content_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:afaeac48-257b-4cc9-80f3-caf7979888bc>","<urn:uuid:e6b81cb1-fc03-4432-9904-004472c9fb70>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do banks create economic money when providing loans to customers?","answer":"When a bank provides a loan to a client by depositing borrowed funds in the client's current account, they record this by debiting the assets account and crediting deposit liabilities on the bank's balance sheet. From an economic perspective, this creates economic money (though not legal tender) as the client's account balance represents the bank's liability rather than actual cash.","context":["A bank deposit is a savings account, current account, or other type of bank account with a banking institution that allows the account holder to deposit money into the account and withdraw it from the account. These operations are reflected in the accounting books of the bank, and the resulting balance is recorded as a bank liability and represents the amount of bank debt to the customer. Some banks may charge for this service, while others may pay customers interest on the funds deposited.\nThe main types of bank deposits for individuals\nCurrent accounts (deposits)\nA deposit account with a bank or other financial institution in order to reliably and quickly provide frequent access to demand funds through various channels. Since money is available on request, these accounts are also called call accounts or current accounts, with the exception of some cases.\nCurrent account provides various flexible payment methods that allow customers to transfer their funds directly. Most current accounts provide the option of direct deposit or withdrawal or payment through a debit card. Current accounts provide two different ways in which money can be lent: overdraft and offsetting mortgages.\nIn the UK, almost all current accounts offer a pre-agreed overdraft size, which is determined depending on the client’s income and credit history. Overdraft can be used at any time without the consent of the bank and can last indefinitely. Despite the fact that overdraft can be resolved, the money is technically repayable at the request of the bank or within a certain period. In reality, such a rare phenomenon as overdraft is usually profitable for the bank and expensive for the client.\nMortgage loan offset is a type of mortgage that is common in the UK and used to purchase household property, the key principle of which is to reduce the amount of overpayment on a mortgage loan. This can be achieved using one of two methods: either the lenders provide one account for all the borrower’s operations (often referred to as a current mortgage account) or they make several accounts available that allow borrowers to conditionally divide their money by purpose, but all balances the accounts will shift each day relative to each other, with the opportunity to reduce the interest paid on the mortgage debt.\nMoney market account\nThe money market account is a deposit account on which interest is paid, and for which a notification is required when withdrawing funds after a short period of time (or not). In the United States, this type of demand deposit is subject to federal savings account instructions, for example, a monthly limit is regulated.\nMoney Market Account (MMA) or Money Market Deposit Account (MMDA) assumes interest payments, which are determined based on current interest rates in the money market.\nMoney market accounts tend to have relatively high interest rates, but require a higher minimum balance (from $ 1,000 to $ 25,000) in order to earn these interest or avoid monthly payments. As a result, the investment strategy for working with such accounts is usually similar to and competes with the money market fund offered by the broker. These two types of accounts are otherwise unrelated.\nSavings accounts are those opened by commercial banks for which interest is paid, but they cannot be used directly as money (for example, to issue a check). Although they are not so convenient to use as current accounts, these accounts allow customers to hold liquid assets and at the same time receive cash rewards. For a bank, money in a savings account does not entail reserve requirements, and therefore can be used for commercial purposes.\nIn the United States, the term “savings account” includes a deposit or account that complies with legal requirements and in accordance with the terms of the deposit agreement or depository practice, the depositor has the right to make up to six pre-authorized transfers or withdrawals per month, or a term statement at least four weeks. There is no regulation limiting the number of deposits in an account.\nIn most European countries, interest on deposit accounts is taxed at the source of payment. Heavy taxes in some countries have led to the development of a significant savings offshore industry. The European Union Savings Directive obliged offshore financial centers to provide any interest information for use with EU tax authorities or withholding tax on interest paid on offshore accounts due to concerns about potential tax evasion. Account holders must pay tax or provide account holder information to the appropriate tax authorities.\nWithdrawing money from a savings account is sometimes expensive and takes more time than withdrawing from a current account. However, most savings accounts do not limit withdrawals, unlike deposit certificates. When withdrawing from online accounts, the main problem is the time required for the automated clearing house to transfer funds to an online account in a “non-chain” bank, where the amount can be easily accessible. In the period between when funds are withdrawn via the Internet bank and transferred to a local bank, interest is not charged.\nSome financial institutions only offer online savings accounts. They usually pay higher interest rates, and sometimes impose higher security restrictions. Online access has opened the accessibility of offshore financial centers to the general public.\nTerm deposit (deposit)\nA term deposit is a cash deposit in a banking institution that cannot be canceled for a fixed period or period of time. When the term ends the term deposit can be withdrawn or it can be extended for a new term. The longer the term, the higher the percentage of the deposit.\nAnalogs of the term deposit are the deposit certificate in the USA, the conditional deposit in Canada, Australia and New Zealand; bond (bond) in the UK; term deposit in India and in some other countries.\nIn a strict sense, a certificate of deposit differs from a term deposit in terms of negotiability: certificates of deposit are negotiable and can be sold at a discount when the holder needs liquidity, while term deposits usually must be kept until the end of the term.\nThe rate of return for fixed deposits is higher than for savings accounts, because the ability to hold funds in your accounts for a certain period gives the bank the opportunity to invest in higher-end financial products. However, the profitability of a term deposit is usually lower on average long-term than investments in more risky products, such as stocks or bonds.\nA term deposit is a bank deposit, the interest on which has a given maturity date. Funds are deposited in a savings institution in accordance with an agreement that (a) funds must be kept for a certain period of time, or (b) the institution may require a minimum period of time after notifying the customer of the desire to withdraw funds before funds will be made.\n“Small” term deposits are defined in the United States as deposits of less than $ 100,000, while “large” term deposits are made of $ 100,000 or more. In the United States, banks are not subject to reserve requirements for their term deposits.\nA demand deposit is a deposit account that allows you to withdraw money without paying a fee or a fine and without notifying the bank. The interest rate on demand deposits is usually lower than that of term deposits, but the minimum deposit amount is usually less.\nRegulatory framework for the opening of deposits\nSubject to the restrictions established by the conditions of the account, the account holder (customer) retains the right to pay his money on demand. The client may or may not be able to deposit money into an account using a check, internet banking or other channels, depending on conditions.\nBanking terms “depositing” and “withdrawing funds” mean that a customer deposits money into the account and accepts money from the account. From a legal point of view and a financial accounting point of view, the term “deposit” is used in the banking industry in financial statements to describe a bank’s debt to its depositor, and not the funds that a bank holds as a result of its deposit, which are shown as bank assets.\nFor example, a depositor opened a bank account in the United States, depositing $ 100 in cash and obtaining ownership of $ 100 in cash, which becomes an asset to the bank. In bank books, the bank writes its currency and coins to the debit of the account as $ 100 in cash and credits the liability account for liabilities (the so-called demand deposit account, current account, etc.) for the same amount.\nIn the audited financial statements of the bank, $ 100 in currency will be shown on the balance sheet as an asset of the bank on the left side, and the deposit account will be shown as liabilities due to the bank to its client on the right side of the balance sheet. The financial statements of the bank reflect the economic nature of the transaction in which the bank borrowed $ 100 from its depositor and pledged to repay this amount to the client in accordance with the terms of the agreement. To compensate for the liability on this deposit, the bank currently owns the deposited funds and shows these funds as an asset of the bank. These “physical” reserve funds may be held as deposits at the central bank, on which interest is calculated in accordance with monetary policy.\nAs a rule, the bank does not hold the entire amount of deposits in reserve, but lends most of the money to other customers. This allows banks to earn interest on the asset and, therefore, pay interest on deposits.\nBy transferring ownership of deposits from one side to another, banks can avoid using cash as a method of payment. Commercial bank deposits make up most of the money supply currently in use. For example, if a bank in the United States provides a loan to a client by depositing borrowed funds on the client’s current account, the bank usually records this event by debiting the assets account on the bank’s balance sheet and credits deposit liabilities or the client’s current account on the bank balance sheet. From an economic point of view, the bank creates economic money (although not legal tender). The client’s account balance does not actually represent cash, as demand deposits are simply the responsibility of banks for their customers. In this way,\nBanking Deposit Regulation\nThe activities of banks, as a rule, are subject to state regulation in order to reduce the risk of bankruptcy of a credit institution. Regulation can also have the goal of reducing the scale of depositors’ losses in the event of a bank failing. Banking regulation is a form of government regulation that imposes certain requirements, restrictions and principles on banks. This regulatory framework creates transparency between banking institutions and private individuals and the corporations with which they do business.\nGiven the interconnectedness of the banking industry and the confidence that the national (and global) economy rests on banks, it is very important for regulators to maintain control over the standardized practices of these institutions. Proponents of such regulation often built their arguments on a “too big to fail” concept. It is argued that many financial institutions (in particular, investment banks with a commercial division) have too much control over the economy to go bankrupt without huge consequences. This is a prerequisite for public injections, in which state financial assistance is provided to banks or other financial institutions that are on the verge of collapse.\nThere is a conviction that without this help, troubled banks will not only become bankrupt, but will create a chain of effects throughout the economy, leading to a system failure.\nThe objectives of banking regulation, and the emphasis, vary in different jurisdictions. The most common goals are:\n- Prudence – reduce the level of risk faced by bank lenders (i.e. to protect depositors).\n- Reducing systemic risk – reduce the risk of failure as a result of unfavorable terms of trade for banks, which can cause multiple or major bank failures.\n- Avoid abuses of banks – reduce the risk of using banks for criminal purposes, for example, to launder the proceeds of crime.\n- Bank secrecy protection.\n- Loan distribution – direct loans to privileged sectors.\n- Honest customer service and corporate social responsibility.\nBanking rules may vary widely between countries and jurisdictions. Requirements are made to banks to help achieve the goals of the regulator. Often these requirements are closely related to the level of exposure to a particular sector of a bank. The most important minimum requirement in banking regulation is to maintain minimum capital adequacy ratios. To some extent, US banks have some freedom in determining who will control and regulate them.\nBanks are required to work with the regulator’s banking license in order to conduct business as a bank, and the regulator monitors licensed banks for compliance and responds to violations of the requirements by issuing orders, imposing fines or revoking the license from the bank.\nThe regulator requires banks to publicly disclose financial and other information, and depositors and other lenders can use this information to assess risk and make investment decisions. As a result, the bank adheres to market discipline, and the regulator can also use market pricing information as an indicator of a bank’s financial health.\nThe system of insurance of deposits of individuals\nBank deposits can also be insured under the deposit insurance scheme, if applicable in the country of the depositor. Deposit insurance is a measure introduced in many countries to protect depositors of banks, in full or in part, from losses caused by the inability of a bank to make payments on its obligations within a specified period. Deposit insurance systems are one of the components of the financial system safety net, which contributes to financial stability.\nBanks are allowed (and, as a rule, encouraged) to issue loans or invest most of the money from bank deposits, instead of simply keeping the full amount secure. If many of the bank’s borrowers are unable to repay their loans on time, the bank’s creditors, including depositors, are at risk of losing their savings. Therefore, investors tend to quickly withdraw funds from a bank in a difficult financial situation before its insolvency. Because a banking institution has the potential for failure, and the massive collapse of banks can cause a wide range of harmful events, including an economic downturn, deposit insurance is supported in many countries to protect depositors and ensure that their funds are not at risk.\nDeposit insurance was first applied to protect small banks in the United States. Banks were limited in location and thus did not benefit from economies of scale, networking. To protect local banks in the poorest states, the federal government created a deposit insurance system.\nMany national deposit insurers are members of the International Association of Deposit Insurers (IADI), an international organization established to promote the stability of financial systems by facilitating international cooperation and encouraging international contacts between deposit insurers and other interested parties. Deposit insurance organizations (agencies) are for the most part managed by the government or created as a division of the central bank, while some of them are private enterprises with state support or completely private.\nThere are a number of countries with more than one deposit insurance system – Austria, Canada (Ontario and Quebec), Germany, Italy, and the USA.\nOn the other hand, one deposit insurance system may cover more than one country: for example, many banks in the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia and Puerto Rico are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Congo, Equatorial Guinea and Gabon also work in the same system.\nOpening an account. What you need to know\nIf you decide to keep money in the bank, then you need to know how to open an account ? Firstly, any opening of an account is accompanied by a contract, so when you visit a bank, you need to bring your passport with you. Secondly, of course, it will take some amount of money. Thirdly, you must be at least 14 years old. And fourthly, you need to determine the purpose of opening an account, if only income is a fixed deposit, and if salary or pension is received, this will be a current account. Further, in the case of a term deposit, it is necessary to determine the period of investment and other deposit conditions."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:94e13426-62fc-4ec2-b76c-9ed0dc4f0880>"],"error":null}
{"question":"¿How does nutrient availability compare entre alkaline soil y optimal cannabis growing conditions?","answer":"In alkaline soil conditions (pH 7.1-8.0), nutrients like phosphorus, iron and manganese become less readily available to plants. For cannabis cultivation, specific nutrient needs must be met - during vegetation it requires more nitrogen, while during flowering phosphorus becomes more essential. The optimal slightly acidic pH range (5.9-6.5) for cannabis helps ensure proper nutrient availability and uptake.","context":["It is legal for adults over 21 years of age to grow limited quantities of marijuana in states such as Colorado, Alaska, Washington DC, Oregon (after July 15, 2015) and Washington state (medical marijuana only).\nIt’s a complex task and one that requires step- by-step guidance if good quality is expected. One of the most important ingredients for a successful grow is good quality seeds.? That said, here is an overview of the basics:\nSoil is required with sufficient nutrients. Commercial potting soils usually indicate the percentages of the fundamental nutritional elements, i.e., nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. Nutrients are often provided to the soil via fertilizers but such practice requires caution. The pH should be between 5.9 and 6.5. This pH can be adjusted and commercial fertilizers (even organic) tend to make the soil more acidic (ie decreasing its pH).\nThe optimal day temperature range for cannabis is 24 to 30 ?C (75 to 86 ?F). Temperatures above 31 ?C (88F) and below 15.5 ?C (60F) decrease THC potency and slow growth. At 13 ?C the plant undergoes a mild shock, though some strains withstand frost temporarily.\nLight can be natural for outdoor growing or artificial for indoors. Under artificial light, the plant typically remains under a regime of 16?20 hours of light and 4?8 hours of darkness from the germination until flowering, although the plant can use a full 24 hours of light without harm. There is an ongoing debate over the importance of the “dark period”. It has been shown that, when subjected to a regimen of constant light without a dark period, most types of flora, including cannabis, will begin to show signs of decreased photosynthetic response, lack of vigor, and an overall decrease in vascular development. There is no defined flowering “stage”, unless you are discussing an auto-flowering variety (Cannabis Ruderalis). Typically, flowering is induced by changing the light schedule to 12 hours of light and 12 hours of darkness. Flowering in cannabis is triggered by a hormonal reaction within the plant that is initiated by an increase in length of its dark cycle, i.e. the plant needs sufficient prolonged darkness for bract/bracteole (flowering) to begin. Some Indica varieties require as little as 8 hours of dark to begin flowering, whereas some Sativa varieties require up to 13 hours.\nWatering frequency and amount is determined by many factors, including temperature and light, the age, size and stage of growth of the plant and the medium’s ability to retain water. A conspicuous sign of water problems is the wilting of leaves. Too much water can kill young cannabis plants. The additives in tap water can reduce plant growth and can be removed with reverse osmosis filtration but is expensive and produces poorer results than well or spring water.\nNutrients are taken up from the soil by plants. Nutrient soil amendments (fertilizers) are added when the soil nutrients are depleted. Fertilizers can be chemical or organic, liquid or powder, and usually contain a mixture of ingredients. Commercial fertilizers indicate the levels of NPK (nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium). During the vegetative stage, cannabis needs more N than P and K, while during the flowering stage, P is more essential than N and K. The presence of secondary nutrients (calcium, magnesium, sulfur) is recommended. Micro nutrients (e.g. iron, boron, chlorine, manganese, copper, zinc, molybdenum) rarely manifest as deficiencies. Because Cannabis’ nutrient needs vary widely depending on the variety, they are usually determined by trial and error and fertilizers are applied sparingly to avoid burning the plant.\n*The above text is compliments of WikipediaGrow MJ","To help you decide what to grow in your garden, we’ve put together this list of the 40 best plants to grow in alkaline soil. If you have alkaline soil in your backyard, this should form a starting point to help you decide which are the best plants for your garden.\nDo I Have Alkaline Soil?\nBefore you begin to choose plants for your garden, it is important to make sure that you know what kind of soil you actually have.\nFirst of all, before you delve a little deeper to discover the pH of your soil, it can be helpful to know what type of soil you are dealing with. Your soil may be:\n- chalky soil\n- sandy soil\n- silty soil\n- clay soil\n- peat soil\nOr you may have a soil that is a mixture of two or more of the above. A perfect loam is a mixed soil that is ideal for growing the widest range of plants. Chalky soils, and some clay soils, can tend towards a problem with alkalinity.\nIf you have a naturally chalky soil, you may see white lumps of limestone or calcium carbonate material in your garden beds. This can be a dead giveaway that you are dealing with alkaline soil. However, the pH of your soil is not usually something that can be detected by eye.\nYou can test the pH of your garden soil using a tester kit, which can be bought at a number of retailers or found online.\nIf your pH is between 7.1 and 8.0 then you are dealing with an alkaline soil.\nPH tester kits are relatively inexpensive – but if you suspect you have alkaline soil, there is another neat trick you can try. Take some of your soil and place it into a jar of vinegar. If it froths up, it is high in lime and alkaline in nature.\nIf you are still in doubt, you may also be able to glean clues about the pH of your soil by looking at the plants that grow naturally in the surrounding environment, or plants that do well in your neighbor’s gardens. You may also be able to find information about the soil type and pH in your area by looking up the information online.\nWhat Causes Alkaline Soil?\nAlkaline soil can be natural, caused by the natural weathering of natural minerals calcium carbonate and calcium bicarbonate in the ground but alkaline soil can also have a range of man-made causes.\nMan-Made Causes of Alkaline Soil\nFor example, it may be caused by:\n- Pollution from coal-fires and coal power plants.\n- Pollution from sodium salts used in many household cleaning products.\n- Pollution from wet cooling towers which use seawater to dissipate waste heat in factories located close to the coast.\n- Water that is treated to soften it being used to irrigate the soil. (Mains water that has been softened contains a relatively much higher proportion of sodium bicarbonates and less calcium and magnesium.)\nWhether the cause is natural or man-made, it is important to take the pH of your soil into account when planning your planting scheme. Alkaline soils can occur anywhere, but are more common in hot places with lower rainfall, where salts and other chemicals are more likely to accumulate.\nThe Pros and Cons of Alkaline Soil\nLike any soil type, and soil of any pH, alkaline soil can have both strengths and weaknesses.\nOn the plus side, an alkaline soil can:\n- Make it possible to grow certain plants that will not thrive in acidic soil.\n- Be less prone to soil-borne diseases, due to the lower level of microbial action than in more rich, moist, more biologically active soils.\nOn the other hand, alkaline soil can also have its disadvantages. It can:\n- Mean that it will be challenging to grow ericaceous (acid loving) plants.\n- Make nutrients needed for plant growth, such as phosphorus, iron and manganese less readily available, especially if the alkalinity is extreme.\nShould I Amend My Alkaline Soil?\nGenerally speaking, unless your soil is extremely alkaline, it is best to work with what you have. This means that rather than amending the soil pH, which can be a rather drastic measure, it is usually best to simply accept the limitations and grow plants suited to where you live.\nMildly alkaline soil can actually be an advantage, and so amending this soil is not usually the best option. Rather, think about the other challenges posed by your soil type (such as poor nutrient retention or water retention). Think about how these, rather than pH, can be overcome. Often,the best way to improve your soil is by improving its structure and fertility with the judicious application of organic matter. Adding organic matter will slowly and gently lower pH subtly over time.\nSometimes, however, extremely alkaline soil may need to be amended. It can be amended with the addition of large amounts of acidifying organic material. For example, this can be achieved with a heavy mulch of pine needles.\nAdding amendments such as aluminium sulfate, diammonium phosphate, ferric sulfate, ammonium nitrate or sulfur is not recommended in an organic garden.\n40 Trees, Shrubs, Edibles & Flowers That Grow In Alkaline Soil\nWhile it is by no means a comprehensive list, the below list should help you find trees, shrubs, edibles and flowers that can cope with, thrive in or overcome the challenges that come with an alkaline soil pH.\nBest Trees for Alkaline Soil\nWhen planning a garden, it is often best to start with the largest plants. Trees, large and small, can be accommodated in almost any backyard. It is with the trees, then, that you should begin. A planting scheme for an alkaline soil garden might include:\n- Cotoneaster Frigida\n- Field Maple\n- Holm Oak\n- Montezuma Pine\n- Sorbus alnifolia\n- Strawberry Tree\nMost traditional garden fruit trees prefer a slightly acidic soil environment. However, if you have a slightly alkaline soil it is worth noting that fig trees and cherry trees are amongst the trees that can best handle those conditions.\nAnother thing to consider is that it is best to source your trees from a local plant nursery, where the specimens are more likely to be suited to the soil conditions where you live, and will be grafted onto rootstocks suited to a more alkaline environment.\nBest Shrubs for Alkaline Soil\nShrubs and bushes are ideal for creating edge beds and borders. They can also be used to create layers of planting beneath your chosen trees. Good shrub choices for an area with alkaline soil might include:\n- Deutzia ‘Pride of Rochester’\n- Santolina chamaecyparissus\n- Viburnum opulus\nBest Edible Plants for Alkaline Soil\nThe limitations of an alkaline soil can make it a challenge to grow certain fruits and vegetables, many of which will do best in a neutral or slightly acidic soil. However, members of the brassica family, legumes and arid-climate herbs can all do well in a slightly alkaline environment.\nA mildly alkaline soil environment can be an advantage for members of the cabbage family, for example, because it makes it less likely that you will develop problems with diseases like ‘club root’.\nSome of the best edible plants to try in alkaline growing areas are:\n- Broccoli/Brussels Sprouts\n- Kale/ Collard Greens\n- Pole Beans\nBest Flowers for Alkaline Soil\nOnce you have established structure in your garden with trees and shrubs, and considered how you can make full use of your garden by growing edible crops, it is time to think about the lower layers of your garden.\nFlowers in the herbaceous layer have a huge impact on the visual appearance of your garden. But flowers are not only good for human beings. Flowers are also very important for garden wildlife. They can help attract pollinators and other beneficial insects.\nSome good flowers for alkaline soil are:\n- California Poppies\n- Lily of the Valley\n- Trifolium (Clovers)\n- Viper’s Bugloss\n- Wild Marjoram\nThinking carefully about your soil, its pH and other characteristics, can help you create a realistic and successful planting scheme for your garden.\nThe above list should have given you a reasonable jumping off point, which will allow you to do some more of your own research and find the very best plants for your particular alkaline soil garden."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:b9612154-e1c6-469f-950c-fcc4456677cc>","<urn:uuid:d5888e51-adba-42a5-baff-330ee3b02f1c>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Which composting method breaks down organic matter faster: traditional sheet composting or whole leaf composting without shredding?","answer":"Traditional sheet composting breaks down organic matter faster than whole leaf composting without shredding. In traditional sheet composting, organic matter is thoroughly shredded using multiple passes with a rototiller, making it readily available to soil microbes. In contrast, when composting whole leaves without shredding, the decomposition process takes longer because larger pieces of organic matter have less surface area for microbes to break down.","context":["Sheet composting offers several of the benefits of composting, while stripping away the labor of having to constantly turn your piles. Although this technique is most often used on large scale gardens and farms, if you have the right equipment (i.e. a rototiller), you can do it on a small scale as well.\nAs with all composting techniques, sheet composting offers growers a great way to lower their fertilizer costs while also recycling \"waste\" organic matter. I am always hesitant to use that term \"waste\" for food scraps and crop residues. In reality these products are just as important as the crops themselves...after all, this year's composted \"waste\" could very well turn into next years crop.\nThere are several different methods of sheet composting, however, they all hinge on a couple key factors. First, they all involve adding organic matter (i.e. leaves, grass clippings, weeds, etc.) to your soil. Second, they all require some period of \"rest\" or fallowing before the next planting. Below are the three different methods of sheet composting:\nThe Traditional Method\nMore often than not, when someone refers to sheet composting, they are referring to this technique. The steps involve adding organic matter in layers on top of your soil, and then passing over these materials with a rototiller. The key is to make several passes so the organic matter is thoroughly shredded and readily available to soil microbes.\nAs I've said before, I am not a big fan of tillage, however, when tending to large areas, the benefits often outweigh the disadvantages.\nThis technique is best done in the fall as it allows the soil microbes to feast over the winter and replanting to occur in the spring. Depending on the level of microbial activity in your soils, you may have to allow these sheet composted areas to rest for an entire season.\nGreen manuring refers to the technique of growing an annual crop with the specific intention of turning it back under into the soil. For instance, farmers and well-versed gardeners (like Gardener Ed in our Tribe) will often grow nitrogen-fixing crops such as legumes (clover, soy beans, vetch) and then till them back into the soil once they reach a desired size.\nPlease note that green manuring deserves a lot more attention than what I am giving it here; entire books have been written on the subject. So please do yourself, and your soils, a favor and investigate it further. Here is a great little guide to start you on your way.\nAs the name implies, this final technique is better\ndescribed as a means of mulching rather than composting.\nHow do you do it? You can start by covering your soil with a layer of cardboard, then add a layer of well-rotted manure or compost, and top that with a thick layer of organic material such as leaves, straw, or spent hay. Please note, you do not incorporate this material into your garden soil.\nNeedless to say, sheet mulching is a very slow approach to building soil organic matter. And in order to really make the most of this technique, you must start with a microbe-rich soil. Remember, the microbes are your work force and they're the ones that will eventually break these materials down.\nI think they say it best in The Rodale Book of Composting - \"many experts agree that you would do well to combine the labor-saving advantages of mulch with a seasonal composting program.\"\nMy biggest warning surrounding this composting technique is as follows - Know your compost ingredients! Don't add a bunch of carbon (e.g. leaves) to your soils without also adding sufficient nitrogen (e.g. grass clippings) to compliment it, especially if you want to plant into the soils the following season. Remember, you're essentially composting in place, so all of the same rules for making good compost apply (i.e. proper ingredients in the proper ratios, moisture, and oxygen).\nFor more information about the hazards of overloading your soils with carbon, please read Lloyd's comments about his mishap with sheet composting his wheat fields.\nNo matter which sheet composting technique you choose, it is important that you monitor your results. As per usual, I recommend taking an annual soil test as a means of tracking exactly what your soil does and does not need.

Share it!","Fall leaves are a valuable resource for composting. Instead of bagging them up and sending them to the landfill, you can turn them into nutrient-rich compost to improve your garden soil. Composting fall leaves is a simple and eco-friendly way to recycle this organic material. In this article, we will provide a step-by-step guide on how to compost fall leaves effectively.\nWhy Compost Fall Leaves?\nComposting fall leaves has numerous benefits. Firstly, it reduces waste and landfill space. Secondly, it provides a free and natural source of organic matter for your garden. Fall leaves are rich in carbon, which helps balance the nitrogen content in your compost pile. The resulting compost is an excellent soil amendment that improves soil structure, fertility, and moisture retention.\nStep 1: Gather Your Leaves\nThe first step in composting fall leaves is to gather them. Rake or collect the fallen leaves from your yard. You can also ask your neighbors if they have any leaves they want to get rid of. Remember to avoid leaves that have been treated with pesticides or chemicals, as they can harm the beneficial organisms in your compost pile.\nStep 2: Shred the Leaves\nShredding the fall leaves helps speed up the decomposition process. You can use a lawnmower, a leaf shredder, or simply run over the leaves with your lawn mower. Shredding the leaves into smaller pieces increases the surface area, allowing them to break down faster.\nStep 3: Create a Compost Pile\nChoose a suitable location for your compost pile. Ideally, it should be in a sunny spot with good drainage. Start by creating a layer of shredded leaves about 6 inches thick. Add a layer of nitrogen-rich materials such as kitchen scraps, grass clippings, or manure. Repeat this layering process until you have used up all your fall leaves.\nStep 4: Maintain Moisture and Airflow\nMoisture and airflow are essential for the decomposition process. Keep your compost pile moist, but not overly wet. If it becomes too dry, add water. To promote airflow, turn the compost pile regularly using a garden fork or compost turning tool. This helps introduce oxygen and speeds up decomposition.\nStep 5: Monitor the Temperature\nComposting is an aerobic process that generates heat. Use a compost thermometer to monitor the temperature of your compost pile. The ideal temperature range is between 120°F and 160°F. If the temperature drops below 120°F, turn the pile to reactivate the decomposition process. If it exceeds 160°F, it may be too hot and require additional aeration.\nStep 6: Wait for the Compost to Mature\nComposting fall leaves takes time. It typically takes 6 months to 2 years for the compost to fully mature, depending on various factors such as temperature, moisture, and the size of the leaves. The compost is ready when it has a dark, crumbly texture and an earthy smell.\nStep 7: Use the Finished Compost\nOnce your compost has matured, it is ready to be used in your garden. Spread a layer of compost on your flower beds, vegetable gardens, or around trees and shrubs. The nutrients in the compost will nourish your plants, improve soil structure, and promote healthy growth.\n1. Can I compost leaves without shredding them?\nWhile shredding the leaves helps speed up the decomposition process, you can still compost whole leaves. However, whole leaves take longer to break down, so it may take more time for your compost to mature.\n2. Can I compost leaves with other yard waste?\nYes, you can compost leaves with other yard waste such as grass clippings, small twigs, and plant trimmings. Mixing different types of organic matter helps create a balanced compost pile.\n3. Can I compost leaves in a bin or tumbler?\nYes, you can compost fall leaves in a compost bin or tumbler. Make sure to follow the manufacturer’s instructions for best results. Turning the contents regularly and maintaining proper moisture levels are still important.\n4. How often should I turn my compost pile?\nIt is recommended to turn your compost pile every 2-3 weeks. Turning the pile helps distribute heat, moisture, and oxygen throughout the compost, ensuring even decomposition.\n5. Can I add fall leaves to my existing compost pile?\nAbsolutely! Fall leaves make an excellent addition to an existing compost pile. Mix them in with the other compostable materials and continue turning the pile regularly.\nComposting fall leaves is a rewarding and sustainable practice. By following these steps and guidelines, you can turn your fall leaves into a valuable resource for your garden.
