{"question":"How do the two different malaria control research projects reflect technological evolution in mosquito control methods? 在两种方法中,哪一种更接近实际应用?","answer":"The two approaches represent different stages of technological evolution in malaria control. The transgenic fungus approach builds on natural insect pathogens by adding genetic modifications to enhance their effectiveness, and has already progressed to semi-field testing in Burkina Faso with NIH support. The gene drive technology targeting doublesex represents a newer, more experimental approach that has only been tested in laboratory cage populations but showed complete population suppression in 7-11 generations. While both are promising, the fungal approach is closer to field implementation, while the doublesex gene drive still requires 5-10 years of additional testing before considering wild release trials.","context":["Hi Brian, congratulations on winning the Fungal Biology and Biotechnology student prize. Could you briefly describe your research and how it relates to mosquito control? What do you think are the future implications for malaria control?\nThank you very much!\nIn the St. Leger lab, we apply genomics and advanced DNA technology to make insect pathogens an important model system for studying/combating infectious processes in general, as well as offering surprising new possibilities for solving insect pest problems.\nThe ultimate fate of most insects is fungal disease: many fungi have cracked the lock of the protective cuticle and are able to burrow their way into a variety of insects, sometimes with incredible host specificity. The fungus we work with in our lab is naturally a mosquito killer, but we have modified it to express in the blood of the mosquito an insect-specific spider toxin (the hybrid toxin from the blue mountain funnel web spider in Australia), which allows the fungus to kill mosquitoes much more effectively. Already, with NIH support, we have confirmed our promising lab results in semi-field conditions working with Dr. Abdoulaye Diabate and his team in Burkina Faso.\nThe potential of our transgenic fungus to control the spread of malaria and kill mosquitoes is striking, and we hope to soon add these fungi to the arsenal of mosquito control methods out there. No one technology will be a silver bullet to prevent the spread of malaria, but if we intelligently integrate all of the incredible control methods already available or in development, our transgenic fungi will be a versatile and effective component in such a program.\nWhat brought you to work with fungi? What do you enjoy most about your research?\nThe study of insect killing fungi is a natural marriage of my enthusiasm for both microbiology and entomology. I was drawn to my lab specifically by our use of genetic engineering techniques to further manipulate these fungi to generate more effective strains or mitigate risks.\nI think you can make a convincing argument that fungi are the most intricately interconnected organisms on the planet: they form intimate interactions with organisms in nearly every ecosystem, and we are appreciating more and more how vital these interactions really are.\nDuring our studies, we demonstrated that several very common insect pathogenic fungi colonize roots and promote plant growth, and we are engineering strains with customized properties with the aim of replacing chemical pesticides and fertilizers. We are only just beginning to understand the complexity and flexibility of the fungal kingdom, and I immensely enjoy how often new secrets of fungal biology are revealed during my research.\nWhere would you like to see your research taking you in the next few years?\nIn the next few years, I would like to see our fungal biotechnology applied in open field conditions to epidemiologically show that it can prevent the spread of malaria in Africa. These transgenic fungi have serious potential to lessen the burden of malaria on communities and save the lives of many children, and I plan to play a key role in the realization of this potential, which will include further lab and field testing of fungal strains, as well as staging workshops to engage the communities where they need our technology the most.\nWhat advice would you give young scientists starting out in research?\nStay curious: find a system that excites you and start asking questions. Your research begins when your colleagues and the literature run out of answers to your questions, and if you’ve picked the right system, you will never run out of questions.","Researchers have eliminated caged mosquitoes using ‘gene drive’ technology to spread a genetic modification that blocks female reproduction.\nThe team from Imperial College London were able to crash caged populations of the malaria vector mosquito Anopheles gambiae in only 7-11 generations.\nThis breakthrough shows that gene drive can work, providing hope in the fight against a disease that has plagued mankind for centuries\nProfessor Andrea Crisanti | Lead researcher\nThis is the first time experiments have been able to completely block the reproductive capacity of a complex organism in the laboratory using a designer molecular approach.\nThe technique, called gene drive, was used to selectively target the specific mosquito species An. gambiae that is responsible for malaria transmission in sub-Saharan Africa. There are around 3500 species of mosquito worldwide, of which only 40 related species can carry malaria.\nThe hope is that mosquitoes carrying a gene drive would be released in the future, spreading female infertility within local malaria-carrying mosquito populations and causing them to collapse.\nIn 2016, there were around 216 million malaria cases and an estimated 445,000 deaths worldwide, mostly of children under five years old.\nLead researcher Professor Andrea Crisanti, from the Department of Life Sciences at Imperial, said: “2016 marked the first time in over two decades that malaria cases did not fall year-on-year despite huge efforts and resources, suggesting we need more tools in the fight.”\nWorld first: Suppressing a population\nThe team’s results, published today in Nature Biotechnology, represent the first time gene drive has been able to completely suppress a population, overcoming resistance issues previous approaches have faced.\nProfessor Crisanti added: “This breakthrough shows that gene drive can work, providing hope in the fight against a disease that has plagued mankind for centuries. There is still more work to be done, both in terms of testing the technology in larger lab-based studies and working with affected countries to assess the feasibility of such an intervention.\n“It will still be at least 5-10 years before we consider testing any mosquitoes with gene drive in the wild, but now we have some encouraging proof that we’re on the right path. Gene drive solutions have the potential one day to expedite malaria eradication by overcoming the barriers of logistics in resource-poor countries.”\nTargeting ‘doublesex‘: About the research methodology\nThe team targeted a gene in An. gambiae called ‘doublesex‘, which determines whether an individual mosquito develops as a male or as a female.\nThe team engineered a gene drive solution designed to selectively alter a region of the doublesex gene that is responsible for female development. Males who carried this modified gene showed no changes, and neither did females with only one copy of the modified gene. However, females with two copies of the modified gene showed both male and female characteristics, failed to bite and did not lay eggs.\nTheir experiments showed that the gene drive transmitted the genetic modification nearly 100% of the time. After eight generations no females were produced and the populations collapsed because of lack of offspring.\nPrevious attempts to develop gene drive for population suppression have encountered ‘resistance’, where targeted genes developed mutations that allowed the gene to carry out its function, but that that were resistant to the drive. These changes would then be passed down to the offspring, halting the gene drive in its tracks.\nOne of the reasons doublesex was picked for the gene drive target was that it was thought not to tolerate any mutations, overcoming this potential source of resistance. Indeed, in the study no functional mutated copy of the doublesex gene arose and spread in the population.\nNext steps: Investigating the efficacy\nWhile this is the first time resistance has been overcome, the team say additional experiments are needed to investigate the efficacy and the stability of the gene drive under confined laboratory settings that mimic tropical environments.\nThis involves testing the technology on larger populations of mosquitoes confined in more realistic settings, where competition for food and other ecological factors may change the fate of the gene drive.\nThe doublesex gene targeted in the study is similar across the insect world, although different insects have different exact genetic sequences. This suggests the technology could be used in the future to specifically target other disease-carrying insects.\nRecent work from Imperial showed that suppressing An. gambiaepopulations in local areas is unlikely to affect the local ecosystem.\nThe Latest on: Gene drive\nvia Google News\nThe Latest on: Gene drive\n- Drive Time: Lots of SUVs, pickups — and sometimes a sedanon August 17, 2019 at 7:13 am\nMazda’s I-Activ all-wheel drive adds $3,000 to the base front-drive model ...

{"question":"Can you explain what technology commercialization is? What is the relationship between patent licensing and technological commercialization?","answer":"Technology commercialization is the process of taking an idea, concept or prototype from early product concept stage through design, development and production all the way to market. Patent licensing is a key component of technology commercialization, as shown in both documents. The SC SBDC program specifically includes license generation as part of commercialization, with license terms potentially involving fixed fees, milestone fees, royalties, equity and other considerations. This aligns with the broader IP commercialization and patent licensing practices described in the patent law context, where licensing rights are crucial for research and development, as seen in cases like gene patents where researchers must often license rights to study patented genes.","context":["SC SBDC Technology Commercialization Program\nInnovative thinkers have a new friend at the South Carolina Small Business Development Centers. People and companies with original ideas and pioneering products can benefit from the SC SBDC’s new Technology Commercialization Program (Tech Com). Technology commercialization is taking an idea, concept or prototype from the early product concept stage through design, development and production all the way to market.\nOften people lose their momentum when they realize they need startup capital, a research partner or a way to protect their creativity. SC SBDC’s Tech Com Program can help entrepreneurs form partnerships, find capital, research opportunities, explore new markets and move products into production and the hands of consumers. The program assists with technology startup creation, license generation, patents and intellectual property issues.\nEarly stage funding for startups is a key focus for the SC SBDC’s Tech Com Program. The grant proposals and awards of the federal government’s Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and its Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs are an important component of how tech startups can be funded. The SC SBDC’s Tech Com Program facilitates partnerships between private sector companies and universities where grants fund studies that help bring a product to market backed by the scientific data of a major research university.\n- Development of a concept/idea/work: A typical SC SBDC client arrives at an initial meeting to present a concept, idea or original work that they would like to bring to market. All meetings and client information is held confidential.\n- Market assessment: The SC SBDC assesses a confidential idea or concept and works with the client to develop a preliminary commercialization strategy and a market feasibility assessment. The strategy and assessment are performed in conjunction with inventors or advisors as appropriate.\n- Patenting and legal protection: The SC SBDC assists in a preliminary patent search to unearth any competing or blocking patents. When appropriate, the SC SBDC will suggest a client use copyright, trade secret or trademark rights to commercialize their inventions or works of authorship.\n- Funding: The SC SBDC will assist in guiding a client to and preparing them for early stage funding sources like SCLaunch, EPSCOR Phase 0 grants and SBIR/STTR grants.\n- Prospecting and connecting: SC SBDC will assist clients in proactively approaching companies, entrepreneurs, technology development groups and investors who are potentially suitable partners to help bring the client’s product to market.\n- Due diligence and negotiation: The SC SBDC can help when a client’s marketing activities result in a request for a more in-depth examination of technology. The SC SBDC can provide assistance with nondisclosure agreements and provide direction to clients to prepare them for discussions with potential investors or partners.\n- Commercialization deal development and licensing terms: When a commercialization partner is ready to move forward, the SC SBDC can provide frameworks for developing business terms including potential license agreements. License terms change from agreement to agreement and may involve fixed fees, milestone fees, royalties, equity and other considerations.\nTechnology Commercialization links:\nUniversity of South Carolina Office of Technology Commercialization\nInnovista Technology Commercialization\nClemson University Technology Transfer\nMUSC Foundation for Research Development\nAssociation of University Technology Managers","- Biological Inventions\n- BRAND VALUATION\n- Comparative Advertisement\n- Copyright Infringement\n- Copyright Litigation\n- Digital Marketing Rights\n- Geographical Indication\n- Indian Patents Act\n- Intellectual Property\n- Interim Injunction\n- IP Commercialization\n- IP Licensing\n- IP Litigation\n- IP Practice in India\n- IPAB Decisions\n- Legal Issues\n- Net Neutrality\n- News & Updates\n- Patent Commercialisation\n- Patent Cooperation Treaty\n- patent infringement\n- Patent Licensing\n- Patent Litigation\n- Patent Opposition\n- Patent Prosecution\n- Patent Rule Amendment\n- Patent Term Extension\n- Punitive Damages\n- Section 3(D)\n- section 64\n- South-east Asia\n- Technology Transfer\n- Trademark Litigation\nAdvancement in science and genetic application, with enhanced knowledge of the Human Genome, has been the main focus in the field of medicine and biotechnology areas. Continuous and ongoing researches in genome projects, identifying specific target genes and their respective response and functional activities, have evolved genetic therapeutics in the treatment of multifactor disorders such as heart disease, diabetes, neurological disorders, muscular dystrophy and so and so forth.\nGene patents have been the most debated matter for years. The economic and policy issues surrounding patents on genes, gene sequences, nucleotide sequences, expressed sequence tags (ESTs), single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) have posed the potency to present unique challenges in science, innovations and legal fraternity around the globe.\nPatent Issues regarding Gene Patents:\nA number of gene/DNA sequence patents grew dramatically during the Human Genome Project. Researchers have obtained patents for isolating genes or gene sequences that occur in nature. Whether this should be permitted or not is still an open debate for decades.\nGenerally, to seek a patent-protected gene, there are certain issues that a researcher comes across.\n(1) Stop or avoid researching the particular gene;\n(2) License the rights to research the gene from the patent holder; or\n(3) Continue research regardless of legal liability.\nIndeed, the choice made is often dependent on the DNA sequence in question and the line of research pursued. Regardless, the exercise of any of these three options could potentially work to reduce fundamental R&D in human genetics.\nConsidering an instance of gene patent invalidation of Myriad Genetics by US federal court. The American Association of Pathologists and others have challenged several patents relating to the breast cancer genes BRCA1 and BRAC2 held by Myriad Genetics and the University of Utah Research Foundation. BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are associated with an increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer. The patent claimed products of nature, the law of nature, and naturally occurring phenomena. The US district court for the Southern District of New York upon a decision by Judge Robert Sweet invalidated Myriad’s patents. The decision that isolated but otherwise unaltered DNA should not be patentable is now being appealed by Myriad.\nThe US Government stated that:\n“The fact that a particular segment of the human genome codes for the BRCA1 protein in a human cell, for example, rather than for adrenaline or insulin or nothing at all, is not within the power of science to alter. Such basic natural relationships may not be the subject of a patent.” (Case 1:09-cv-04515-RWS)\nSecondly, it is been argued that Myriad patents and it is the sole provider of BRCA1/2 testing has highly hindered cancer patients to receive cancer genetic testing. It is impeded that genes are the natural heritage of animals and/or humans and its use should not be restricted by patent protection.\nIndian Patent Laws on genes:\nIndia, like other major countries, have immensely involved in various biotech and medical research area, being one of the topmost competitors in the commercial market in biological therapeutic and diagnostic domains globally\nSection 3(c) of the Indian Patent Act, states that “mere discovery of scientific principle or the formulation or the discovery of any living/nonliving substance occurring in nature” is not considered to be an invention. Pertaining to this law, mere isolation of naturally occurring genes from animal or plant body cannot be patentable.\nAccordingly, section 3 (i) define diagnostic methods is not patentable. Further, it explains that in vivo diagnostic methods practiced on human/animal bodies cannot be patentable but if the diagnosis is performed in vitro i.e. on tissue or fluids that have been removed from the body are entitled to be patentable in light of inventive measures. Hence, diagnostic methods employing DNA primers or probes or the like that are different from naturally occurring genes/DNA sequences that exhibit modified functions would be considered as patentable inventions. Considering Bilski (30 S.Ct. at 3225), new and useful methods of identifying, isolating, or using genes or genetic information may be patented (prohibiting patenting abstract ideas), that are basically man-made transformation or manipulation of the raw materials of the genome, such as cDNAs.\nSection 3(j) “plant and animals as a whole, seeds and species which involve in its propagation or biological processes are not considered to be patentable”. In addition to this section 3(j) also states that apart from naturally occurring embodies, living entities of artificial origin such as transgenic plants and animals and/or parts thereof are not patentable. Microorganisms are construed to be patentable under section 3 (j). However, section 3(j) and section (c) when combined, states that isolated microorganisms from naturally occurring bodies are not construed to be patentable. Nevertheless, artificially developed genetically engineered microorganisms, vaccines, and recombinant DNA is all considered to be patentable. For instance, as seen in the case-law of Diamond v. Chakrabarty, 447 U.S. 303 (1980), ruled that “anything under the sun that is made by man” is patentable. The Supreme Court established that the man-made products of genetic engineering are eligible for patent protection under 35 U.S.C. § 101. The Patent and Trademark Office responded to Chakrabarty by granting patents on a wide range of engineered DNA molecules and useful genetic methods.\nThe basic fact about genes/gene products being patentable is that when a genetically engineered gene/DNA/amino acid sequence is novel and holds an inventive step thereby ensuring its industrial application, the patents can be claimed as:\n- Gene sequence/amino acid sequence.\n- A method of expressing the above sequence.\n- An antibody against that sequence/protein.\n- A kit made from the antibody/sequence.\nIn a more brief sense, it should be noted that rDNA, plasmids, and process of forming the same are allowed to be patentable under substantive inventive steps employed. Further, unidentified functions of gene/DNA sequences and without any industrial application cannot be construed to be patentable.\nOne such example of gene patents in India, as seen in Indian Patent No. 243373 (279/MUM/2004) assigned to Sichuan Biotechnology Research Center, discloses artificial gene sequence for encoding recombinant super compound interferon with enhanced activity. The independent claim of the patent states:\n- A method for producing recombinant interferon for inhibiting HBV-DNA replication as well as secretion of HBsAg and HBeAg comprising steps of;\n- Synthesizing and interferon DNA having a sequence as depicted in Fig.1 or 2 designed according to the codon usage;\n- Placing said interferon DNA in an appropriate host preferably E.Coli and;\n- Expressing said recombinant interferon in a said host having an amino acid sequence encoded by interferon DNA shown in said Fig.1 or 2.\nWherein Fig 1 or 2 is a gene sequence of interferon DNA. (see Patent)\nAgain looking into Biocon’s story on genes, Using patent information as an integral tool, Biocon determined areas on which the company’s R&D should focus on. One such example is how the company used patent information to gain initial access to the field of human insulin production, where it is now a major player. The product patent on human insulin had long expired, but it was still protected by strong patents on processes of production.\nIn most prosecution cases, it is been observed that the examiner objects claims directed towards isolated DNA/gene sequences in context to section 3 (c). Such objections can be dealt sating that the applicant’s/individuals claimed isolated DNA/gene sequence is purely recombinant and in modified form and its functions are not identical to that occurring naturally. But nevertheless, there are certain granted patent claims where isolated DNA/gene sequences are not substantially different from that occurring in nature. Such claims have been granted based on the previous precedence of such issued claims.\nAbout the Author: Ms. Minusmita Ray, a Senior Patent Consultant in the Institute of Intellectual Property Research & Development (IIPRD) and can be reached: firstname.lastname@example.org."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:5f1a147f-9936-444e-a87d-395caec01a1f>","<urn:uuid:8aa56135-3a75-4074-b84b-a6de1f16f4c7>"],"error":null}

{"question":"What common materials act as high frequency absorbers in rooms, and how do they affect acoustics?","answer":"Common high frequency absorbers in rooms include carpeting/throw rugs, people's clothing, and upholstered furniture. Their presence typically results in lower reverberation times in the higher frequencies. Without implementing specific acoustic measures, these naturally occurring absorbers create an absorption curve where the frequencies that are absorbed the most exhibit the lowest reverberation times.","context":["Optimal room acoustics / How to improve room acoustics\nIntroductory video on room acoustics\nAccording to respective use and building size, the DIN 18041 and the Austrian standard B 8115-3 define the ideal reverberation time (e.g. that which is perceived to be most pleasant by the average person). For ideal room acoustics, this reverberation time should remain more or less the same in the frequency range of 100-4000 Hz. For rooms where music performances take place this value should rise somewhat where frequencies lower than 250 Hz occur. However, the linear reverberation time is better suited to music rehearsal room.\nImages at right depict tolerance ranges according to standards (whereby the reverberation time of 1 second for ideal room acoustics is not likely here); tolerance range for middle frequencies plus/minus 20%.\nIn many rooms there are materials which act as absorbers. The effect is normally in the high-frequency area.\nSuch high frequency absorbers may include:\n- Carpeting/throw rugs\n- People (clothing)\n- Upholstered furnitu\nWithout the implementation of acoustic measures, reverberation time is lower in the higher frequencies\nBy way of the fact that high frequency absorbers are usually present, the absorption curve looks approximately as follows:\n(those frequencies which are absorbed the most exhibit the lowest reverberation times)\nDanger of over-absorption of high frequencies\nUsing the example of a Class A sound absorber\n((Alpha-w) αw = 1.00)\nIn the case of sound absorbers, it is frequently the case that only individual specifications such as (Alpha-w) αw are specified, yet in most cases, this is insufficient information.\nSound absorbers of this class are often characterized as broadband absorbers, even though they are also medium and high frequency absorbers.\nIn this example, the entire ceiling surface has been equipped with absorbers.\n- Incorrect absorption spread of the frequencies\n- Those frequencies required for speech intelligibility are over absorbed, while those for frequencies for undertones are not absorbed enough\n- Absorbers of this kind are not suitable for achieving ideal room acoustics\nLow frequencies are much harder to absorb than higher frequencies and are thus often simply ignored. Yet how important are these low frequencies for generally good room acoustics? This is a highly-debated topic for which there are no easy, simple answers. In order to shed light on the matter, here we present select data using speech as type of use.\nFrequency Distribution in Speech:\nIn which frequencies does information transmission occur when speaking? Information is chiefly transmitted in speech through consonants. Within the frequency band these are found above 1000 Hz (see diagram at right).\n(Source of diagram: Helmut V. Fuchs, Schallabsorber und Schalldämpfer (Springer Verlag, 2007))\nThis is often used as an argument for why lower frequencies have less significance for speech intelligibility in room acoustics.\nYet the following must be considered:\nIn which frequencies does the most sound radiation occur?\nThe frequency distribution of sound radiation is depicted in this diagram (source: Helmut V. Fuchs, Schallabsorber und Schalldämpfer (Springer Verlag, 2007)).\nThus by concentrating on medium and high frequencies the important “information frequencies” are swallowed and the parasitic frequencies are ignored. Low frequencies however have the tendency to blanket higher frequencies – think for example of the low-frequency rumbling of a passing lorry! Only insulating the medium and high frequencies – using the argument that it is these which transmit information – fails to fulfil the necessary requirements for good acoustics.\nFor most rooms, a linear frequency curve for reverberation time is ideal and in fact stipulated by DIN 18041. To achieve this, we have intensified our low frequency focus in product development.\nBelow our findings:\n- micro-perforated low frequency absorbers with a maximum performance of 100-315 Hz -> products 1, 2 and 3 and products 4, 5 and 6\n- micro-perforated low frequency absorbers with a maximum performance of 50-100 Hz (these frequencies are often not stipulated because absorption through conventional absorbers in this range is very low) -> product 1\n- One of our research findings: low frequency absorbers used in a panel absorber configuration do not exhibit sufficiently stable absorption performance.\nIt is easy to use our calculator to determine how to improve your room acoustics in the best way possible!\n- It is not necessary to know all the details; use the calculator to determine which absorber /absorber combinations are best for your planned project\n- Let the combination of the calculator and the relevant industry standards DIN 18041 and B 8115-3 do the work for you!"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:43519fd4-18a0-4dae-8061-c1bc102acfa3>"],"error":null}

The contemporary versions of these clocks differ from previous models in that modern grandfather clocks neither include ancient clock elements nor need to be turned to display the correct time.\nThe idea of grandfather clocks invokes images of a towering, majestic oak clock in the corner, complete with a lengthy pendulum that is constantly vibrating.\nAlthough the origin of its name is unknown, a grandfather clock is generally defined as a pendulum clock that has a length of more than 1.5 meters. The majority of these clocks stroke or chime at the end of an hour, while some may chime or ring after half an hour.\nGrandfather clocks operate in one of the two main types of motions, eight-day or one day. A grandfather clock with an eight-day mechanism only needs to be set once a week, whereas one-day mechanism clocks need to be set every day.\nFor over three centuries, these antique clocks were widely used and regarded as the most accurate timekeepers. The traditional workmanship and royal majesty of grandfather clocks have ensured that the clocks have remained widely popular, even after so many years.\nIn this article, we’ll go over the main parts of a grandfather clock and how it works – illustrated by a 3D diagram. You may also read the parts of a wall clock to under their differences.\nHow Do Grandfather Clocks Work?\nThe movements lie at the heart of each pendulum clock. The hour/minute hand’s striking, chiming, and subsequent timekeeping are all dictated by the pendulum’s movement. The weights and hanging pendulum are essential components of every mechanical clock’s mechanism.\nThe timekeeping is regulated and adjusted by the movement of the pendulum. Three weights may be used in a pendulum clock to operate the clock’s striking, and chiming. Each of the three weights is unique and must be placed correctly to ensure optimal operation.\nA chain or wire suspends the weights from the escapement apparatus so that they work in line with the mechanism. The clock may stop working if the weights are not adjusted over 7 days. The lifting of the weights is achieved with the help of a crank. A series of hammering rods of different lengths produce striking and chiming sounds.\nParts of Grandfather Clock\nEach movement of a pendulum clock is due to the four fundamental internal elements that make it work. The escapement, gears, setting mechanism, and weight are all elements of the internal parts. Some external parts have been discussed below.\nThe escapement was designed to ensure that the pendulum maintains a consistent swing. Clockmaker designed the pendulum, the anchor, and the escapement wheel as the three components of the escapement. The pace at which the other gears in the clock movement is determined by the escapement wheel. This escapement wheel has specifically designed teeth. The pendulum is attached to the anchor, which latches to the teeth of the escapement wheel.\nThe anchors have an upward U-shape and have two meeting points with the escapement wheel. One of the wheel’s teeth is allowed to traverse with each oscillation of the pendulum. The second hand of the clock moves continuously as a result of this.\nThe clock’s minute and hour hands move because of this basic principle, but the wheels that drive the minutes and hourly hands rotate after pendulum vibrations. As a result, the pendulum becomes a mechanism for releasing the potential energy stored in the weight.\nWheels / Gears\nAlso called gears, several wheels are installed between the weight and the escapement gear to achieve desired spinning ratios daily or weekly for convenience of operation. The weighted wheel travels relatively slower than other wheels between the opposite edges, enabling the weight to fall and release energy at steady rates.\nThough the wheel of gear ratios are simple enough to comprehend, aligning each wheel to reach a hand on the grandfather clock face becomes tough. Tubular shafts are commonly used to conduct the operation of the hands of the clock – one inside the other to solve this difficulty. Also, with tubular shafts, organizing the gear to work continuously can be a challenging task.\nGear Trains / Wheel Trains\nThe speed from the mainspring to the weight is controlled by the gear train. The clock’s hands are connected to the teeth of different wheels in a wheel train. As a result, the hour hand moves slower than the minute hand.\nA tiny lever, or winder linked to a gear pulls the gear out of line with others to configure the working of grandfather clocks accurately. The setting mechanism brings the clock to a halt, permitting it to be turned and the time to be set.\nThe pendulum gives the clock potential energy, allowing it to oscillate at a steady rate.\nThere is a small adjustment nut below the pendulum which helps boost up or slow the clock speed if it is increasing or losing time.\nDriving Weight and Main Spring\nThe clock’s power supply is provided by the mainspring. The mainspring could be a pulley that is turned by a driving weight on a cable. The power supply in several smartwatches and clocks is a metal string. This is sometimes referred to as spring winding since it preserves the mechanical power that is used to spin the clock’s movements.\nThe weight’s projected energy loss is represented by the unfolding of the string around the gear and consequent lowering of the weight. As a result, mechanical clocks should be reset regularly to replenish the stored energy of the weights.\nThe dial is the displayed face of the clock that records the revolutions of the escapement-driven gear train. In a nutshell, it uses spinning hands to show the time. A dial has numerals 1-12 on it in the most widely used displays. Subdials also display the date and lunar phases in certain clocks.\nThe chimes are among the most notable and distinctive features that have helped to define the grandfather clock. A grandfather clock without a working chime is not regarded as authentic and genuine. A variety of wheels, pulleys, levers, and hammers will be required to make the chime operate properly.\nNormally, chime sequences are sounded at the top of each hour, but quarter-hour chime sequences (the most renowned chimes sequences are Westminster quarters) were introduced to pendulum clocks in the twentieth century.\nOrigin of Grandfather Clocks\nThe sundial was man’s earliest timekeeping instrument. It was a device that measured the movement of a huge object’s shadow to calculate equal fractions of the day. A sundial is undoubtedly a useful tool for measuring time intervals, but because of the Earth’s eccentric orbital path, the time recorded by a sundial over a year might be less precise, and this left a lot of opportunity for advancement.\nWhile sundials were perhaps the most popular tool for keeping time, they were not the only ones. The clepsydra (water clocks) and the clepsammia (hourglass) were also rare inventions. Water clocks worked by allowing water to leak through tiny holes in a vessel.\nThe process of making these mechanical gadgets for measuring time was highly costly. Further, temperature, wind speed, and the fluctuation in pressure inside the vessel all influenced the time interval between movements of the clock’s operation, causing the time to be inaccurate.\nOn the other hand, the hourglass told the precise time, but it took a lot of concentration to notice when the final grain of sand dropped and to flip it over quickly.\nFortunately, in 1658, because Robert Hooke developed the anchor escapement mechanism, the grandfather clock was born. The anchor system lowered the movement of the pendulum to 4°-6°, enabling makers of grandfather clocks to make use of longer pendulums with slower beats. The newer grandfather clocks used less energy, enabling clocks to function for longer periods than traditional sundials, hourglass, and water clocks. These were also more precise and produced minimal friction.\nBy 1680, a clockmaker from Britain, William Clement had created the first grandfather clocks. Later that year, the most famous British clockmaker, Thomas Tompion, began producing them as well. Grandfather clocks became popular all over England as well as in Asia and Europe. The average cost of grandfather clocks in England peaked between 1680 and 1800, limiting clock purchases to the comparatively wealthy. However, by 1800, salaries had grown to the point that many families in the lower-middle-class could afford grandfather clocks.\nHow to Take Care of a Grand Father Clock\nExamine to see if your grandfather’s clock is balanced and steady. Ensure that the clock’s hands are neither contacting one other nor the dial of the clock. As the pendulum swings, ensure it doesn’t scratch or hit anything. Lastly, double-check that the suspension spring is not damaged and the pendulum is properly hanging.\nThe design and production of a grandfather or pendulum clock necessitate exceptional workmanship as well as a wealth of knowledge in physics and engineering. The concepts of energy and mechanics, along with the qualities of a pendulum that result in an accurate clock, remain an impressive feat.\nAlso, note that some grandfather clock components may not be found readily available in stores, therefore repairing a grandfather clock, especically clocks may cost a lot of money. To preserve the integrity and durability of each grandfather clock, it is important to take good care of them."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:71350e20-4f3f-43ef-9e25-1fa795006d8c>","<urn:uuid:5775ee69-66d0-4243-86f2-978dec6a866e>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do the origins of Piroshki relate to Greek history, and what are the main preparation techniques for making them?","answer":"Piroshki were introduced to Greece by Greek Pontiacs who were forced to leave Pontus. The preparation involves first making a yeast dough that needs to rise until it doubles in volume. After kneading and cutting into circles, fillings are added and the edges are sealed to form half moons. These can then be either fried, where they're cooked in hot oil on both sides, or baked using dry convection heat in an enclosed oven environment at 180 degrees C. The baking process makes the outside brown while keeping moisture locked inside.","context":["Piroshki, were introduced to the Greeks by the Greek Pontiacs* who were forced to leave Pontus and scattered in all parts of the world, the majority of which came to Greece.\nPiroshki are made from yeast dough usually fried. You can find them in bakeries or fast food shops, with various fillings.\nTheir size depends on the occasion. We usually make big ones but bite size piroshkis are best for parties. Who wouldn’t like to eat these for breakfast? I made different kinds, with minced beef, mashed potatoes, mushrooms and some sweet ones with apricots. I have made them in the past with graviera or halloumi and mint and with feta parsley and dill.\nPontos inherently means ‘sea’ in ancient Greek. In Greek mythology, as mentioned by Hesiod, Pontos was the child of Gaia and Aether. The term was used in ancient times for both the Aegean and the Black Seas. The Black Sea area generally, and the region around Trabzon specifically, are where Jason and the Argonauts sailed to find the Golden Fleece in the adventures of the Argonautica of Apollonios the Rhodian.\nHistorically the Black Sea was initially known as the Axenos (inhospitable) Sea, prior to its colonization by the ancient Ionian Greeks of Miletus and other Greek city states. The first Greek colony established on the northern shores of ancient Anatolia was Sinop circa 800 B.C. After the colonization of the shores of the Black Sea the name changed to Efxinos (hospitable) Sea. In time, other Greeks followed their path and, as numbers grew, more Greek colonies were established along the Black Sea coastline of what is now Turkey, Georgia, Russia, Ukraine, Romania and Bulgaria.\nThe region of Trapezus, now Trabzon, was also mentioned by Xenophon (430 – 355 BC) Anabasis, when his 10,000 soldiers had reached the Pontic Euxine Sea and cried out ‘Thalassa! Thalassa!’ – “The sea! The sea!”, the local people understood them. They were Hellenes as well and, according to Xenophon, they had been there for over 300 years. Over thousands of years the Trapezus colony, later called the Pontos Pontos region flourished, contributing to the development of a rich civilization with a strong Hellenic basis. This is verified by a various ancient Greek and Roman historians. For example, many accounts exist of the Mythridatic wars and the reign of Mythridates the Eupator and later his son Mythridates II. With the passage of time and the establishment of the Eastern Roman empire Pontos was placed under its control. Pontos remained isolated from the ‘modern’ Greek-speaking world afterward. This isolation however helped maintain the Pontic language with its strong roots to the ancient Greeks. For many years later they lived under Ottoman rule but maintained a strong sense of Hellenism and Greek Orthodoxy.\nThroughout its long history Pontos was also inhabited and invaded by the Persians, Romans, Alexander the Great, Germany, Russia and finally, the Turks. The land also had its share of royal rulers such as the Komnenos family, which made Trabzond (Trapezounda) Empire of Trebizond capital from 1204 to 1461. Like other Christians in Asia Minor as Armenians or Assyrians, Pontic Greeks had to face persecution and suffer ethnic cleansing at the beginning of the 20th century (Hofmann 2004). In 1923, after hundreds of years, those remaining were expelled from Turkey to Greece as part of the population exchange between Greece and Turkey defined by the Treaty of Lausanne. ” By courtesy Kallitehniki Stegi Pontion.\nThe Pontiacs speak the most ancient Greek dialect and then come the Cypriots.\nFor those who are interested to learn more historical facts, many books have been written on this matter and some of them you can even download them.\nFor the dough:\nPreparation time: 2 hours\nBaking time: 30 minutes and 10 minutes for frying\nI made 24 big one, 22 small ones and 8 with sweet filling.\n- 500 grams all purpose flour\n- 1 packet of dried yeast (9 grams)\n- ½ teaspoon salt\n- 1 teaspoon sugar\n- 1/4 cup olive oil\n- 1 egg\n- ½ cup of lukewarm milk\n- 1 egg (egg white for assembly and yolk for wash of pastry)\n- Dissolve yeast with half the milk, sugar and 3 tbsp flour.

Piroshki are very similar to perogies in Poland, Vareniki in Russia,etc.No matter what they are one of my favourite foods. I sometimes make them but I love it when the ladies of the Ukranian churches have dinners and you can buy them, by the dozens!!!!","Baking Cooking Methods\nThis Cooking Methods involves applying a dry convection heat to your food in an enclosed environment. Baking is similar to roasting, but refers more to breads, pastries, and other sweet items. Most items are baked in the oven until cooked through. The dry heat involved in the baking process makes the outside of the food go brown, and keeps the moisture locked in. Baking is regularly used for cooking pastries, bread and desserts.\nFrying Cooking Methods\nThis Cooking Methods means cooking your food in fat – there are several variations of frying:\n- Deep-frying, where the food is completely immersed in hot oil\n- Stir-frying, where you fry the food very quickly on a high heat in a oiled pan\n- Pan-frying, where food is cooked in a frying pan with oil; and\n- Sauteing, where the food is browned on one side and then the other with a small quantity of fat or oil. Sautéed foods are cooked in a thin layer of fat over medium-high heat, usually in a frying pan on the stovetop. Foods are just cooked until tender.\nFrying is one of the quickest ways to cook food, with temperatures typically reaching between 175 – 225ºC.\nRoasting Cooking Methods\nWith roasting, direct heat is applied to the food. The heat seals the outside part of the food and the juice inside the food cooks the food. Roasting is mainly used when cooking fleshy food like fish, meat or chicken. When heat is applied to the outer covering of the food, it seals it up thereby trapping all the juices inside the food. The action of direct heating, heats up the juices inside the food, which then cooks the food. Again there is very little nutrient lost and the flavour is not spoilt. Food is frequently rotated over the spit so that there is even heating applied to all parts of the food. This is so that heat is applied evenly to the food to make it get cooked properly.\nRoasting is generally the same as baking, but refers more to proteins and vegetables. Roasting is common to do in the oven and items are cooked until golden brown and tender. The most common item that’s roasted is a turkey on Thanksgiving. Roasting is basically a high heat form of baking, where your food gets drier and browner on the outside by initial exposure to a temperature of over 500F. This prevents most of the moisture being cooked out of the food. The temperature is then lowered to between 425 and 450F to cook through the meat or vegetables.\nGrilling Cooking Methods\nThis is a fast, dry and very hot way of cooking, where the food is placed under an intense radiant heat. You can use various sources of heat for grilling: wood burning, coals, gas flame, or electric heating. Before grilling, food can be marinaded or seasoned. A similar method to grilling is broiling, where the heat source originates from the top instead of the bottom.\nSteaming Cooking Methods\nThis Cooking Methods means cooking your food in water vapour over boiling water. For this, it’s handy to have a steamer, which consists of a vessel with a perforated bottom placed on top of another containing water.\nSteam rises as the water boils, cooking the food in the perforated vessel above.\nThis involves a small amount of hot liquid, ideally at a temperature between 160 and 180F. The cooking liquid is normally water, but you can also use broth, stock, milk or juice. Common foods cooked by poaching include fish, eggs and fruit.\nThis involves cooking liquid on top of a stove in a pot or pan. It should be carried out on a low heat, and you will see bubbles appearing on the surface of the liquid as your dish cooks.\nSimilar to grilling, the heat source comes directly from the top. You should be able to adjust your oven setting to broiling, but be careful, as this cooking methods works quickly and your meal could easily become burned.\nHere the food is part-cooked, and then immediately submerged in ice cold water to stop the cooking process.\nFirst the food is sauted or seared, and then simmered in liquid for a long period of time until tender. Pot roasts, stews and casseroles can be cooked in this way if they contain larger food items such as poultry legs.\nAgain, the food is sauted or seared first, and then cooked in liquid, but normally uses smaller ingredients such as chopped meats or vegetables.\nThis method of cooking is usually associated with roasting. The juice or liquid that comes out of the meat being cooked is spooned over the roast frequently while it is being roasted. The outer part of the meat is moistened frequently during the cooking process with the juice that is being spooned over. Usually, the extra juice from the cooked meat is added to a mixture to make the meat sauce."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:ac00e7be-aeb4-43cc-8f3d-4e5bfe6159c2>","<urn:uuid:e8bbd7fc-0690-497c-8943-da6a70433b08>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Sputnik impact - military significance + nuclear strategy?","answer":"Sputnik had dual military significance. First, it established the principle of orbital freedom, allowing spy satellites to legally pass over any nation's territory - a strategic victory for the US. Second, both the US and Soviets knew that a booster capable of launching Sputnik could also deliver nuclear warheads across continents in 30 minutes. This capability influenced America's shift toward relying more heavily on nuclear weapons rather than conventional forces for defense in the 1950s.","context":["Thank Sputnik for today's orbital freedom\nFifty years after the Russian satellite went into Earth orbit, this pioneer in space technology still holds political significance.\nNext Thursday marks the 50th anniversary of the rise of Earth's first artificial moon – Russia's Sputnik satellite. That may seem like a small achievement in an era when we watch robots explore Mars and view our weather from space. But orbiting a 184-pound beeping sphere twice the size of a basketball with no scientific or military capability sent an emotional shock wave around the world in October 1957.\nIt was a propaganda coup for the Soviet Union. A country many considered \"backward\" was now showing advanced technological capability.\nFor the United States, it was a strategic victory. Secret documents, now declassified, show the Eisenhower administration was counting on using small scientific satellites to establish the principle of orbital freedom. Like freedom of the high seas, where no nation can claim sovereignty, freedom of Earth orbit meant that any nation could orbit satellites that passed over any other nation at will. Once that principle was established, spy satellites would soon circle the planet.\nSputnik fit the plan. It was Russian and passed over the US. Therefore, the Soviet Union could not object to American satellites passing over its territory. It was also a peaceful forerunner of satellites that gather scientific data. And as a result, no other nations objected to their passing overhead.\nThat is why Eisenhower greeted Sputnik with what seemed at the time to be a baffling equanimity.\nThe American public, including all its politicians, were not privy to his strategy. They assumed Sputnik showed the US lagged behind the Soviet Union in rocketry and, perhaps, in some other technologies. They demanded action. Crafty Eisenhower had not anticipated that political firestorm. The actions he and the Congress then took beefed up support for scientific research and strengthened science education. They laid the foundation for the space program that eventually put astronauts on the moon.\nThe disconnect between the perceptions of Eisenhower and the general public was due to secrecy and public indifference to what, in retrospect, was obvious technological progress in rocketry. Several studies in the late 1940s and early 1950s concluded that it would soon be possible to orbit at least small satellites. Both American and Russian rocket experts were saying this publicly. The American public, however, considered it wishful science fiction.\nBy 1954, the global scientific community was planning for the International Geophysical Year (IGY) – an 18-month scientific exploration of all geophysical aspects of our planet starting in the fall of 1957. The US and Soviet Union were leading participants. They both promised to launch the world's first scientific satellites. Sputnik should have been no surprise. But, once again, the public wasn't paying attention. (The Monitor editor handling my reports of an impending Russian satellite later told me that \"We didn't believe you.\")\nMeanwhile, Eisenhower did not want to alarm the Russians by trying aggressively to be \"first\" into orbit. He let the Russians do it and establish freedom of orbit.\nIn the end, there was glory for all. The Russians conducted humanity's first orbital mission. A few months later, the first US satellite, Explorer 1, discovered the belts of electrically charged particles that surround Earth – the IGY's most important discovery.\nThe real winner was humanity. Just look at the wonders of space technology we now take for granted.","War and Peace in the Nuclear Age; Bigger Bang for the Buck, A; Interview with Michel Tatu, 1986 \nPart of War and Peace in the Nuclear Age.\nMichel Tatu was a French journalist who served as Moscow correspondent for Le Monde from 1957-1964. In the interview he describes Premier Khrushchev's exaggeration of Soviet ICBM forces, but notes that the USSR did have \"a huge arsenal\" deployed against Europe, which he would tell European visitors made them \"our hostages.\" Khrushchev's boasting, he relates, caused the U.S. to build up its arsenal even further. Mr. Tatu also describes the impact of the shooting down of the American U-2 reconnaissance plane, which the Soviet leader delayed announcing -- perhaps, Mr. Tatu speculates, because he did not want to wreck the Paris summit or at least hoped to get an apology directly from President Eisenhower. Mr. Tatu explains that Khrushchev's Kremlin rivals used the incident to turn Soviet policy away from detente.\n- War and Peace in the Nuclear Age\n- Bigger Bang for the Buck, A\n- Program Number\nInterview with Michel Tatu, 1986 \n- Series Description\nThe first atomic explosion in the New Mexico desert on July 16, 1945, changed the world forever. This series chronicles these changes and the history of a new era. It traces the development of nuclear weapons, the evolution of nuclear strategy, and the politics of a world with the power to destroy itself.\nIn thirteen one-hour programs that combine historic footage and recent interviews with key American, Soviet, and European participants, the nuclear age unfolds: the origin and evolution of nuclear weapons; the people of the past who have shaped the events of the present; the ideas and issues that political leaders, scientists, and the public at large must confront, and the prospects for the future. Nuclear Age highlights the profound changes in contemporary thinking imposed by the advent of nuclear weapons. Series release date: 1/1989\n- Program Description\nFor the destructive power they deliver, nuclear weapons are cheap and efficient. In the 1950’s the United States begins to rely on nuclear, rather than conventional, weapons for its defense.\nAs nuclear policy evolved during the Eisenhower Administration, three factors combined to produce a new American reliance on nuclear weapons: pressure to control the federal budget (the “bigger bang” argument); competition as each branch of the American military adapted nuclear weapons to its mission; and Soviet bluffs that fueled American fears about a “bomber gap” and later a “missile gap.” On October 4, 1957, Sputnik, the Soviet satellite that was the first to orbit Earth, shocked Americans and delighted the Soviets. A month later, the Soviets launched Sputnik 2 with a dog on board. Both the Soviets and the Americans knew that a booster capable of carrying a dog into space could also deliver a nuclear warhead across a continent in 30 minutes.\n- Asset Type\n- Media Type\n- Intercontinental ballistic missiles\n- United States\n- Cuban Missile Crisis, 1962\n- Kozlov, F.

{"question":"What are the key AI safety concerns in cleaning robots, and what specific safety standards have been implemented for autonomous floor cleaning machines?","answer":"Key AI safety concerns for cleaning robots include avoiding negative side effects (like knocking over objects), preventing reward hacking, ensuring scalable oversight, enabling safe exploration, and maintaining robustness to different environments. As for safety standards, in January 2018, ANSI and the Canadian Standards Association implemented specific requirements for robotic floor treatment machines, covering features like parking brakes, maximum speed, stopping distance, obstacle detection, abrupt surface fall detection, critical zone detection, obstacle avoidance, and machine start audio signals. These standards apply to machines performing wet/dry pickup, wax application, sealing products, and powder-based detergents or shampooing.","context":["We hear a lot these days about artificial intelligence (AI) these days, but in the telecoms world, the term is thrown about rather casually, as though it’s simply a really advanced algorithm tool to make Siri more useful.\nAI is typically discussed in the context of big data, the IoT and augmented/virtual reality apps. At the upcoming ITU Telecom World in Bangkok, the Leadership Summit and Forum – which features a digital economy theme – lumps AI in with other topics such as smart sustainable cities, the role of taxation in driving connectivity, fostering SMEs and digital financial services.\nIn the IT world, AI is taken more seriously – and treated with far more caution, albeit perhaps too much caution. Famously, Elon Musk once described AI as “potentially more dangerous than nukes”, while people like Bill Gates, Stephen Hawking and Nick Bostrum have expressed concerns that AI poses serious dangers if it’s developed with no regard for the potential risks.\nBut when you look at the actual progress of AI, the risks are less about (say) Skynet declaring war on humanity and more about the practical realities of software agents or Roombas making decisions, and the ability of humans to correct wrong decisions – or even to teach machines when they’ve made bad decisions.\nTo that end, researchers from Google AI, Musk-led startup OpenAI, Stanford University and UC Berkeley have released a paper addressing AI risks that are more grounded in the reality of how AI will be used in the coming years – such as smart cleaning robots.\nGoogle Research’s Chris Olah explains in this blog post:\nWhile possible AI safety risks have received a lot of public attention, most previous discussion has been very hypothetical and speculative. We believe it’s essential to ground concerns in real machine learning research, and to start developing practical approaches for engineering AI systems that operate safely and reliably.\nThe paper touches on five main problems that AI researchers should focus on, using the example of an AI-enabled cleaning robot:\n- Avoiding Negative Side Effects: How can we ensure that an AI system will not disturb its environment in negative ways while pursuing its goals, e.g. a cleaning robot knocking over a vase because it can clean faster by doing so?\n- Avoiding Reward Hacking: How can we avoid gaming of the reward function? For example, we don’t want this cleaning robot simply covering over messes with materials it can’t see through.\n- Scalable Oversight: How can we efficiently ensure that a given AI system respects aspects of the objective that are too expensive to be frequently evaluated during training? For example, if an AI system gets human feedback as it performs a task, it needs to use that feedback efficiently because asking too often would be annoying.\n- Safe Exploration: How do we ensure that an AI system doesn’t make exploratory moves with very negative repercussions? For example, maybe a cleaning robot should experiment with mopping strategies, but clearly it shouldn’t try putting a wet mop in an electrical outlet.\n- Robustness to Distributional Shift: How do we ensure that an AI system recognizes, and behaves robustly, when it’s in an environment very different from its training environment? For example, heuristics learned for a factory workfloor may not be safe enough for an office.\nThe paper is available here.\nSee also: this article from Wired, which offers some extra color on possible AI mishaps that won’t destroy the planet but would cause problems.","When it comes to trends in the professional cleaning industry, robotic technology is the talk of the town. But industry robots are not an entirely new phenomenon, especially not in the workplace. They have worked alongside people in factories and warehouses for decades, and the Robotic Industries Association estimates more than 250,000 industrial robots had been installed across the United States by the end of 2017.\nHowever, while robots in the workplace aren’t new, as technology advances, we are beginning to see a greater diversity of sophisticated robotics systems. In the cleaning industry, those systems can be seen tackling monotonous or dangerous tasks in factory or large warehouse and commercial environments.\nAutonomous cleaning solutions that operate in complex environments like these regularly encounter people, obstacles, and rapidly changing conditions, and as a result, demand new and different safety standards from previous, simpler industrial robots to ensure smooth and safe operation. As managers, it’s critical to ensure employees are aware of these standards and know how they will impact staff training, responsibilities, and work environments.\nSensor Advancements Bring New Solutions\nWhile traditional industrial robots often perform monotonous tasks in unobstructed environments such as an assembly line, new self-operating cleaning machines are designed to operate in much more complex environments.\n“Robots working collaboratively with humans present a new workplace risk profile that is not yet well understood,” explained Dr. John Howard, director for the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), when the organization announced the launch of its Center for Occupational Robotics Research in 2017.\nNaturally, this new risk profile raises the stakes when it comes to safety. The presence of people, obstacles, and constantly changing conditions is a challenge, but also an opportunity to bring technology up to par with the operating conditions of autonomous cleaning solutions. The below developments in self-operating machines are helping industrial and high-traffic facilities to function more safely and efficiently:\nHazard avoidance: Advanced sensors allow self-operating cleaning machines to sense and avoid hazards such as water, expensive machinery, or materials that may have fallen somewhere other than where the self-operating cleaning machine “expects” them to be. Machine sensors can feed input into an independent safety board, thereby detecting potential hazards, overriding the machine’s intended path, and stopping an accident before it can occur.\nBetter precision: In addition to sensing and avoiding hazards, advanced sensors and navigation technology allow newer autonomous machines to operate within just a few centimeters of obstacles. This means they can work around items such as desks, retail shelving, or machinery with less risk of collision or damage to both the machine and the obstacles themselves. This navigation technology also allows autonomous machines to clean extremely closely to furniture, shelving, and other items on the floor of the spaces they are cleaning.\nEnhanced navigation solutions: Another navigation development is the option to create a cleaning path two different ways. With some machines, the operator can drive a particular path, enabling the machine to recreate that path on its own later, or the machine can run independently to determine the best path to clean a space. The more options a machine provides to detect obstacles and set cleaning paths, the better chance it has to operate safely.\nNew Safety Standards\nTechnological improvements are helping autonomous cleaning solutions operate with less risk in complex environments, but that alone is not enough to ensure safety as self-operating cleaning machines become more commonplace. Industry-wide standards are needed, and in January 2018, the first safety standard specifically targeting robotic floor treatments came into effect.\nDeveloped by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the Canadian Standards Association, the new standard requires all robotic floor care machines that are sold in the United States and Canada to live up to both the basic safety requirements of a floor care machine in addition to a standard that specifically regulates the robotic part of the machine. These regulations are required for manufacturers of robotic floor care machines that want their products to be safety certified under the new standard.\nThe new safety standard for robotic floor treatment machines will also create more transparency, especially for customers. Compliance with the standard provides peace of mind for facility service providers who might be introducing autonomous cleaning solutions into the workplace for the first time. The standard was a great step in the right direction, but the professional cleaning industry still has a long way to go before safety is the norm.\nHow Will New Robotic Safety Standards Apply to Your Equipment?\nThe new safety requirements for robotic floor treatment equipment includes machines that take on:\n- Wet or dry pickup\n- Wax application\n- Sealing products\n- Powder-based detergents or shampooing.\nThe requirements also focus on the following equipment features:\n- Parking brakes\n- Maximum speed\n- Stopping distance\n- Obstacle detection\n- Abrupt surface fall detection\n- Critical zone detection\n- Obstacle avoidance\n- Machine start audio signal.\nSignificance of Equipment Certification\nAccording to ANSI, a third-party certification “provides unique credibility” and is an independent ruling—like a stamp of approval—that the product is safe. In some markets, such as the United States, employers are legally obligated to only use third-party certified equipment at their facilities. Failing to comply can lead to product recall, market withdrawal, or fines.\nOf course, complying with legal obligations is a must. But manufacturers of autonomous cleaning solutions should want to be at the forefront when it comes to safety standards, particularly because it is their responsibility to ensure safety does not take a back seat to rapidly advancing technology. To ensure the success of autonomous cleaning solutions, safety must be a top consideration during the engineering process.\n“In general, the most effective designs and most successful companies base their products around a well-designed safety architecture that gives them flexibility to provide excellent user features without compromising safety,” said Jonathan Moore of Exida Consulting, in an article on Robotics.org.\nAs of now, the safety standard applies to the United States and Canada, but experts say that a similar standard is being developed for the European markets. Based on industry trends, these safety standards will soon be commonplace in major markets. Manufacturers that want to be on the cutting edge of technology in the professional cleaning industry should put as much stock in the safety of their autonomous cleaning solutions as they do the robotics that make them run."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:e8ac91ce-8a36-4074-94b6-1c572a7f51d5>","<urn:uuid:a613d5d8-5ba9-42b0-ae52-8183737f51d3>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the operational software requirements for managing a sustainable cleaning business, and how do these systems help comply with workplace safety regulations?","answer":"Operational software for cleaning businesses includes technology for scheduling, tracking cleaners, communication systems, and payment processing. Such software helps manage workflows and create efficiency within the business, particularly for sustainable long-term operations. From a safety compliance perspective, these systems can support COSHH requirements by helping employers maintain records of risk assessments, track employee training on hazardous substances, monitor exposure levels, and document the implementation of control measures. The software can also help ensure that proper procedures are followed for handling hazardous cleaning materials and that appropriate protective measures are maintained, which is crucial as employers must prevent or adequately control exposure to hazardous substances and ensure proper health surveillance of exposed employees.","context":["Know Your Cleaning Business Jargon\nJuly 22, 2021\nJuly 22, 2021\nEvery business has its jargon. Even if you’re an industry pro, sometimes it can be hard to remember what all those terms mean.\nWe’ve gathered some common commercial cleaning business terms below, and explain them in plain language. Hopefully, you find them helpful!\nSales & revenue\nShort for electronic commerce. Refers to transactions that occur entirely over the Internet, usually through a website or app.\nWhen a company asks janitorial companies to submit proposals for a contract. It is like a job posting, but for your entire company. Also known as a request for proposal.\nA document sent from a purchaser (you) to a vendor to confirm a specific purchase of goods or services.\nIndividuals or businesses that have a good chance of becoming your client.\nAnother word for “estimate.” Given to clients or prospects to provide a sense of the cost of a project. The final, actual price may vary.\nWhen someone recommends your business’ services to someone else. This can be a much more powerful method of generating new business than sales and marketing combined.\nThis is when an employee tells someone else that your company is a great place to work.\nRewarding people for providing you with either business or employment referrals. Often, the reward is only paid out (or is much better) if the referral successfully leads to a new client or employee.\nPublic ratings by current or past clients. Employees may also review your employment quality. These can be simple number ratings (e.g. 7/10) or extensive written essays.\nStands for Request For Proposal, another term for a bid.\nScope of work\nA document that clearly outlines the cost and timeline for specific services.\nStaffing & operations\nThese are self-employed, independent contractors. It is common for cleaning businesses to employ 1099 employees.\nBrick and mortar\nA term to describe physical businesses. Usually used to contrast online or digital businesses.\nA branch of the business that handles customer questions, complaints, feedback, or praise. Strong customer service can be the backbone of many organizations, including cleaning companies.\nWhen a company grants the right to another company or individual to carry out specific commercial actions. For example, McDonalds is a franchise—each restaurant is independently owned & operated but must follow specific guidelines from the parent company.\nA term used to describe the amount of walking or foot traffic that occurs in a specific area. High footfall areas will need more floor cleaning attention.\nThe purposeful use of environmentally friendly products and techniques. Demand for this kind of cleaning is expected to continue to grow.\nPlaces in a building that people use frequently, and therefore will experience the most soiling and wear and tear.\nRefers to employees who are working at a client site. Also called “on-site staff.” These are usually your cleaners but may also include a supervisor, mechanic, or inspector.\nA specific area of focus or specialization. For example, you may specialize in cleaning high rises over 10 storeys only. Establishing a niche can be a strong strategy for growing a business.\nTechnology that exists on your computer or phone that helps manage the business. This may include scheduling, tracking cleaners, communication systems, and payment processing. Swept is an example of operational software specifically built for commercial cleaning businesses.\nSpecific cleaning services that are carried out in people’s main residences. This almost always happens during the day versus at night.\nA broad term that implies that a given activity can be continued on indefinitely without eventually collapsing due to its own costs or other negative impacts. An important strategic idea when thinking about both your business, the environment, and relationship\nThis is when you delegate your work to another contractor. You pay and deal with the subcontractor instead of your client.\nThese companies provide your company goods and services needed to run your business. Examples: cleaning supplies (product), bookkeeping (service). Building strong relationships with vendors can be a smart long-term strategy.\nA type of inspection where someone literally walks through a space to determine what job needs to be done and/or if the job was done properly.\nBefore bidding on a space, you usually do a walkthrough to get a sense of how much space needs to be cleaned during each shift, how big or small is the space etc.\nA detailed and specific set of steps designed to create efficiency within a business. Workflows may involve employees, software, or both.\nA document given to an employee. It provides the information necessary for a specific cleaning task.\nWhen colors on carpet or any other fabric fade or start to mix into one another. This gets worse when it is hot and humid.\nA brownish or yellow “stain” that starts to appear on fabrics. High pH cleaning agents or too much water is a leading cause.\nA property of a floor finish. High dirt retention means that dirt will get stuck into the finish, making it hard to sweep or clean. Low dirt retention is the goal for any good finish.\nWhen wood or other fiber-based material starts to decay thanks to fungi. Often a problem in carpets.\nWhen small holes start to appear in the material, often due to improper cleaning. Common in a porous material like concrete.\nWhen heat distorts materials such as concrete or terrazzo. A floor might crack, break, or splinter.\nProducts that have tiny grains of material in them. These grains can help physically remove tough stains.\nProducts with a low pH. Acids help dissolve and break down built-up dirt or deposits. They can also be harmful to the skin and to the environment if not properly handled.\nProducts with a high pH. Alkalines can also dissolve certain types of build-up, especially oily or greasy messes. Often used as a metal cleaner. Like acids, alkalines are also harmful to the skin and to the environment if not properly handled.\nSoap that doesn’t use water.\nA chemical that destroys harmful germs. Septic means “infected with harmful microorganisms.”\nA chemical that you put on carpets to reduce or remove static electricity.\nA tool for removing dust or dirt from carpet before it is cleaned.\nAnother word for sodium hydroxide. It is used in heavy-duty detergents.\nStreaks that look like a circle on a carpet. Usually caused by improper use of a rotary shampooing device.\nA chemical added to a cleaning product to reduce the amount of foam it causes.\nCover up or destroy the source of an odor.\nKeeps damp carpets separated from furniture, which protects both the carpet and the furniture during drying. Usually about 3 square inches, either plastic or paper.\nA product that kills fungi, such as mold.\nIodine that is mixed with a detergent, used to kill germs.\nMeasurement of the acidity or alkalinity of a solution. The range is from 0 to 14, with 0 being extremely acidic. Pure water is perfectly neutral with a pH of 7.","COSHH – A Guide to Employers’ and Employees’ Responsibilities\nEmployee Responsibilities under COSHH\nEmployee responsibilities within the COSHH (Control of Substances Hazardous to Health) Regulations of 2002 include:\n- Making use of control measures and facilities provided by the employer\n- Ensuring equipment is returned and stored properly\n- Reporting defects/insufficiencies in control measures\n- Wearing and storing personal protective equipment (PPE)\n- Removing PPE that could cause contamination before eating or drinking\n- Making proper use of washing, showering and bathing facilities when required\n- Maintaining a high level of personal hygiene\n- Complying with any information, instruction or training that is provided\nEmployer Responsibilities Under COSHH\nUnder COSHH regulations, employers’ responsibilities include:\n- Implementing control measures to protect workers from hazardous substances.\n- Preventing or adequately controlling exposure to hazardous substances.\n- Providing employees with suitable and sufficient information, instruction and training, and appropriate protective equipment where necessary.\n- Ensuring that control measures are maintained, kept in full working order, and in a clean condition where appropriate.\n- Drawing up plans and procedures to deal with accidents and emergencies involving hazardous substances.\n- Ensuring that any employees exposed to hazardous substances whilst at work are under suitable health surveillance.\n- Ensuring that substances do not exceed the Workplace Exposure Limit (WEL).\n- Carrying out a COSHH risk assessment.\nNaturally, workplaces with higher risks, such as catering or a hair salon, will require more action than, say, an office. But as an employer, you should be assessing what risks may be posed by hazardous substances, no matter where you work.\nThat way, you can identify if there are risks and if so take action to reduce them to a minimum.\nCOSHH Risk Assessment\nA COSHH risk assessment is essentially the same as a standard risk assessment in terms of the process, but your assessment of the workplace will focus solely on hazardous substances.\nIf you’re unfamiliar with risk assessments, here’s a breakdown of the main 5 steps:\n- Identify the hazards.\n- Decide who might be harmed and how.\n- Evaluate the risks and decide on precautions.\n- Record your findings and implement them.\n- Review your assessment and update if necessary.\nRisk assessments will also involve frequently monitoring the workplace’s processes and the level of exposure to substances.\nWorkplaces are active and constantly changing, so a one-off check won’t be sufficient in minimising the risks posed by hazardous substances. You have to remain constantly vigilant and alert to the dangers.\nRecap: What is COSHH?\nCOSHH stands for the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations (2002). It exists to ensure that both employers and employees do all they can in a workplace to minimise people’s exposure to hazardous substances and work in ways that are safe.\nThis means that all hazardous substances need to be identified and precautions need to be taken to ensure that workers know how to use and handle them safely.\nThe importance of controlling hazardous substances cannot be overstated. In 2012/13, around 35,000 workers reported that they had breathing or lung problems caused by work, and the most common type of reported skin disease was contact dermatitis.\nAnd it’s estimated that around 13,000 deaths occur each year due to occupational lung disease and cancer – fatal conditions that will have developed over a prolonged period of exposure to dusts and chemicals at work.\nAs an employee or employer, you can prevent statistics like this from increasing. If you fulfil your workplace duties, you can prevent dangerous levels of exposure and meet COSHH requirements.\nRecap: What is a Hazardous Substance?\nSimply put, a hazardous substance is any mixture or substance that is toxic, irritant, or corrosive – whether it’s a liquid, gas, vapour, fume, or dust.\nThey cause harm to the body via routes of entry:\n- By coming into contact with skin or eyes.\n- By being inhaled.\n- By being ingested through the mouth.\n- By entering the body through cuts or punctures in the skin.\nAlthough there are certain industries that will be at greater risk, hazardous substances could exist in any workplace. They are often used directly in work activities, produced by work activities, or already present in your workplace’s premises.\nExamples of hazardous substances include:\n- Chemicals, e.g. cleaning chemicals or bleach.\n- Fumes, e.g. from paint or vehicles that exhaust.\n- Gases, e.g. ammonia from refrigerators.\n- Dusts and powder, e.g. from flour.\nIt’s worth noting that even seemingly innocent substances can be harmful, and that includes natural materials like wood dust or flour.\nWhile many hazardous substances can cause immediate harm, such as a corrosive liquid being spilled onto someone’s skin, the main danger posed by hazardous substances is prolonged exposure. For example, if someone is in the presence of or uses a dangerous chemical for a long time, they could develop breathing difficulties or skin conditions.\nExamples of ill-health caused by hazardous substances includes:\n- Occupational asthma.\n- Occupational dermatitis.\n- Occupational cancers.\n- Skin irritation.\n- Infection from bacteria.\n- Injury or death as a result of exposure to toxic fumes.\nWhat to Read Next:\nSubscribe for the latest Hub updates!

{"question":"How do rivers shape deltas through deposition, and what role does the water cycle play in maintaining these river systems?","answer":"Rivers shape deltas through differential deposition of sediments, creating distinct layers: the bottomset bed made of clay particles that clump together and sink, the foreset bed composed of coarser sediments that don't travel far into the water body, and the topset bed of coarse horizontal sediments. The water cycle maintains these river systems through continuous renewal, with rivers being completely renewed every 16 days on average through processes of precipitation, runoff, and infiltration. The cycle is powered by the sun, which enables water to be continually purified and reused through evaporation, transpiration, and precipitation.","context":["Deltas are depositional landforms found at the mouth of a river where the river meets a body of water with a lower velocity than the river (e.g. a lake or the sea). For a delta to develop, the body of water needs to be relatively quiet with a low tidal range so that deposited sediment isn’t washed away and has time to accumulate. When a river meets a stationary body of water, its velocity falls causing any material being transported by the river to be deposited.\nThe bottomset bed - mainly made up of clay because clay & salt particles clump together (flocculate) due to an electrostatic charge developing between the particles. This makes the clay particles sink due to their increased weight producing the bottomset bed. The bottomset bed stretches a fair distance from the mouth of the river.\nThe foreset bed - composed of coarser sediments that are deposited due to a fall in the river’s velocity and aren’t transported very far into the water that the river flows into. It is dipped towards deep water in the direction that the river is flowing in.\nThe topset bed - composed of coarse sediment but, unlike the foreset bed, the topset bed doesn’t dip, it’s horizontally bedded.\nArcuate deltas (The Nile Delta, Egypt) are shaped like a triangle and form when a river meets a sea with alternating current directions that shape the delta so that it looks like a triangle.\nCuspate deltas (Ebro Delta, Spain) are vaguely shaped like a V with curved sides. Cuspate deltas form when a river flows into a sea with waves that hit it head on, spreading the deposited sediment out.\nBird’s foot deltas (Mississippi Delta) They extend quite far into a body of water and form when the river’s current is stronger than the sea’s waves. Uncommon because there are very few areas where a sea’s waves are weaker than a river’s current.\nMeanders are bends in a river that form as a river’s sinuosity increases. The sinuosity of a river is a measurement of how much a river varies from a straight line.\nMeanders develop when alternating riffles & pools form along a river channel. A riffle is a a shallow section of a channel while a pool is a deep section.\nIn a pool, the channel is more efficient while at a riffle, the channel is less efficient. This causes the flow of the river to become irregular and the maximum flow is concentrated on one side of the river. This increases erosion on one side of the river and increases deposition on the other causing the river’s channel to appear to bend. Erosion is greatest on the outside bend and deposition is greatest on the inside bend. Example of a meander: Amazon River.\nPotholes are cylindrical holes drilled into the bed of a river that vary in depth & diameter from a few centimetres to several metres. They’re found in the upper course of a river where it has enough potential energy to erode vertically and its flow is turbulent. In the upper course of a river, its load is large and mainly transported by traction along the river bed. When flowing water encounters bedload, it is forced over it and downcuts behind the bedload in swirling eddie currents. These currents erode the river’s bed and create small depressions in it.\nAs these depressions deepen, pebbles can become trapped in them. As a result of the eddie currents, the pebbles drill into the depressions making them more circular, wider & deeper. Pebbles will only be able to erode a river’s bed though if the rock the pebble’s made of is stronger than the rock the river bed is made of.\nExample: River Clyde, Scotland\nFound in the upper course, formed when water flows over a band of hard rock followed by a band of soft rock.\nWaterfalls develop when a change of lithology takes place along the river’s course resulting in differential erosion. When the rock type of the river’s channel changes from a resistant rock to a less resistant one (e.g. granite to limestone), the river erodes the less resistant rock faster producing a sudden drop in the gradient of the river with the resistant rock being higher up than the less resistant rock. As the river flows over the resistant rock, it falls onto the less resistant rock, eroding it and creating a greater height difference between the two rock types, producing the waterfall.\nWhen water flows over the waterfall it creates a plunge pool at its base and the splashback from the falling water undercuts the resistant rock. The unsupported rock is known as the cap rock and it eventually collapses into the plunge pool causing the waterfall to retreat upstream. Over thousands of years this will produce a gorge or recession.\nExample: High Force in upper teesdale.\nRapids are stretches of fast-flowing water tumbling over a rocky-shallow riverbed. They are caused by different resistance among various rocks, that leads to sudden drops and rises in the river bed. That in turn causes instabilities in the flow of a rivers currents. They are formed when the water goes from one hard rock that resists the water's erosion to a softer rock that is easier eroded. The debris formed by the erosion breaks up the flow of the river, but are not big enough to form a waterfall. Over time, rapids are formed.\nExample: River Inver\nOxbow lakes are an evolution of meanders that undergo extensive deposition and erosion.\nAs can be seen in the formation of meanders strong erosion takes place on the outside bend of a meander while deposition takes place on the inisde bend. As a result, the neck of a meander narrows.\nDuring extremely high discharge (e.g., a flood), it’s more efficient for a river to flow accross the neck of a meander rather than around it. When discharge returns to normal levels, the river continues follow this new course.\nThe meander is left connected to the channel as a cutoff. Deposition eventually separates the cutoff from the main channel leaving behind an oxbow lake. With its main source of water disconnected, the lake eventually dries up leaving behind a meander scar.\nExample: amazon river\nA braided stream is a type of stream made up of many small interconnecting channels separated by small islands of deposited material\nBraiding is caused by fluctiations in discharge levels and low river velocity which leads to the river losing both capacity and competence\nAs the capacity and competence fall, the amount of deposition increases which forms the eyots and causes the stream to divide into a series of smaller channels\nConditions associated with braided channels include a high stream gradient, a large supply of sediment and rapid/frequent variations in river discharge\nOften found in streams or rivers with very variable discharges for example in semi-arid environments or Glacier fed stream e.g. the Copper River in Alaska\nLevees are natural, raised embankments formed as a river overflows its banks.\nDuring a flood, material is deposited across the whole flood plain as the river loses velocity and energy due to increased friction\nThe heaviest material (e.g. sand/gravel) is dropped first, closest to the river channel. Over time, this material builds up on the river bank, creating a levee.\nLevees aren’t permanent structures. Once the river’s discharge exceeds its bankfull discharge, the levees can be burst by the high pressure of the water. Levees increase the height of the river’s channel though, so the bankfull discharge is increased and it becomes more difficult for the river to flood.\nCreated as a result of both erosion and deposition - predominantly depositional features.\nFloodplains are large, flat expanses of land that form on either side of a river. The floodplain is the area that a river floods onto when it’s experiencing high discharge. When a river floods, its efficiency decreases rapidly because of an increase in friction, reducing the river’s velocity and forcing it to deposit its load. The load is deposited across the floodplain as alluvium (river deposited silts and clays). The alluvium is very fertile so floodplains are often used as farmland.\nThe width of a floodplain is determined by the sinuosity of the river and how much meander migration takes place. If there’s a lot of meander migration, the area that the river floods on will change and the floodplain will become wider.","Unit 2 water and rivers new 2012Presentation Transcript\nUnit II Ecological Biology\nUnit IIThe Importance of Water and Rivers\nNow that you know some biology and ecology it’s time to go in depth. • Water’s role in the ecosystem• Characteristics• Impact on Life• Quality and pollution• Become ecologists by testing water• Learn about our own environment (The West Fork of the North Branch of the Chicago River)\nActivity: What is water?On the front desk you will see a container of water.You and your table partner must write down atleast 7 characteristics of water. Consider everythingyou have learned about water over your lifetime. CHARACTERISTICS OF WATER: Consider its color, its phase or state at various temperatures, its odor, its chemical make up, its density, etc.\nCOMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF WATERIt is a liquid but can also be a solid or gas As a liquid it ranges in temp from 0-100 degrees Celsius. Earth is the only planet where water exists in all three states.It is the most abundant compound on earth.Made of 2 hydrogen atoms and 1 oxygen atom; H 2OVery high heat capacity- can absorb a ton of heat without becoming toohotWater likes to stick together and to things- cohesionWater is the Universal Solvent (*next slide)WHEN WATER FREEZES IT EXPANDSWater is necessary for life to exist as we know it.\nA solvent is a liquid, solid, or gas capable of dissolving anotherliquid, solid or gas called a solute and forming a solution of the 2 substances..\nUniversal SolventSolvents dissolve substances.Even though water dissolves many substances, itsown molecules are not chemically changed by thedissolved materials. When it evaporates it loses itsimpurities. Why is this important? When water evaporates from solutions it leavesimpurities behind; purifying it and thus it can be used over and over.\nWater CycleNow that you see how importantwater is, lets look at how much ofthis stuff we have. GLOBE TOSS ACTIVITYHOW CAN WE AS A CLASS ESTIMATE HOW MUCH WATER COVERS THE EARTH WITH JUST OUR HANDS AND A BLOW UP GLOBE?\nPREDICTIONSOf the amount of global water, how much isrealistically usable (usable meaning fresh water notsalt water?)Your group will be given one liter (1000 mL ofwater this represents all of the water on earth, giventhe types of water found on earth predict thevarious amounts that water that exist in each type.

Another 30 percent of freshwater is in the ground.Surface-water sources, such as rivers, only constitute about300 cubic miles (about 1/10,000th of one percent of totalwater).\nNow that you see how much water isreally usable, you can understand why it is necessary to protect and responsibly use this vital substance.• Conservation can only occur through understanding the WATER CYCLE.• Remember from ecology that water was one of the important cycles in nature. Water used by plants, animals, and people is never destroyed: it is used and reused by living and non- living forms. It is the earth’s vast plumbing system. Powered by the sun, the water is continually purified for reuse.\nTHE WATER CYCLE TEST You probably know the answers to this test! Let’s see!1.

Water in the atmosphere is completely replaced onceevery 8 days. Slower rates of replacement occur in large lakes,glaciers, ocean bodies and groundwater. Replacement in thesereservoirs can take from hundreds to thousands of years. Some of these resources (especially groundwater) are being used by humans at rates that far exceed their renewal times. This type of resource use is making this type of water effectively nonrenewable.\nTypical residence times of water found in various reservoirs.

Regarding crossbows, they were a revolutionary weapon in ancient China, with evidence of their use dating back to 600 BC. They were particularly significant because they required less training and physical strength than traditional bows, allowing conscripted soldiers to use them effectively. Archaeological evidence shows Chinese crossbows could have impressive capabilities, with Qin Dynasty examples having firing ranges of up to 800 meters.","context":["Téng Yìn appellation Chéngsì was a Běihǎi Jù man. His father’s elder brother [Téng] Dān, father [Téng] Zhòu, with Liú Yáo were of the same hometown and associated families, and as the world was disturbed in chaos, crossed the Jiāng to rely on [Liú] Yáo.

[Téng] Zhòu was good in writing prose, and [Sūn] Quán treated him with courtesy due to guests, and for the military’s and state’s documents and memorials, he was always ordered to revise and polish up, and he also unfortunately was short lived. When [Sūn] Quán became King of Wú, in recollection of their former grace, gave fief on Yìn as a capital precinct Marquis. When young he had integrity, and showed beautiful conduct.

[Sūn] Quán because of Yìn, added heavy bestowment of princess, and increasingly consulted him.

Prior to the widespread use of crossbows, it was the bow and arrow that was the projectile weapon of choice. To use this weapon efficiently, however, it was necessary for archers to have a considerable amount of training as well as physical strength.\nBy contrast, it takes a relatively lesser amount of skill and physical strength to operate a crossbow. Moreover, it could be made cheaply. Thus, conscripted soldiers (who may not have had training with the bow and arrow) could be armed with crossbows to shower projectiles on the enemy.\nTracing the Origins of Crossbows\nThe crossbow may have been first invented in ancient China. Some historians believe the Chinese had even already invented the first crude crossbows as early as 2,000 BC. This is based on certain bone, stone and shell artifacts that have been interpreted as crossbow triggers. More conclusive evidence of ancient Chinese crossbows, however, comes from around the 6th century BC, if not earlier.\nPortrait of the Imperial Bodyguard Zhanyinbao, carrying his archery equipment and wearing a sheathed dao. ( Public Domain )\nWhilst the crossbow was probably first invented in East Asia, it is difficult to determine its exact civilization of origin. Apart from ancient China, the crossbow could have been first used in Central Asia. It has also been suggested that crossbow technology spread into ancient China when Central Asian marksmen were hired as mercenaries by the Chinese. Nevertheless, most of the evidence (literary and archaeological) for the earliest crossbows is from China itself.\nEarly Mentions of the Crossbow\nTwo examples of early Chinese literature mentioning the crossbow include Sun Tzu’s The Art of War , and Mohist scripts from the 4th to 3rd centuries BC. In the latter source, there is a reference to the use of a giant crossbow during the late Spring and Autumn period (from the 6th to the 5th centuries BC).\n- Excellently preserved, complete crossbow from 2,200 years ago found at Terracotta Warrior site\n- Secrets of Chinese Terracotta Army Weapons Revealed\n- New Dig at First Emperor Mausoleum Expected to Yield up to 1400 More Terracotta Warriors\nA miniature guard wielding a handheld crossbow from the top balcony of a model watchtower, made of glazed earthenware during the Eastern Han era (25–220 AD) of China, from the Metropolitan Museum of Art. ( CC BY-SA 3.0 )\nAs for the archaeological evidence, bronze triggers that were once part of crossbows were discovered in a grave in Qufu, Shandong Province. These artifacts date to around 600 BC, when this area was part of the State of Lu during the Spring and Autumn period.\nAdditionally, bronze crossbow bolts were found in a mid-5th century BC grave in Hubei province, which was at that time part of the State of Chu. In 2015, the first complete crossbow from the Qin Dynasty was excavated by archaeologists from the tomb of Qin Shi Huang. This crossbow, which measures about 1.5 m (4.9 Feet) in length, had a firing range of almost 800 m (2624 Feet).\nA kneeling crossbowman from the Terracotta Army assembled for the tomb complex of Qin Shi Huang (r. 221–210 BC) ( CC BY-SA 2.5 )\nA Crossbow Solution\nIn Europe, crossbow-like siege machines were used by the ancient Greeks and Romans. The former were even recorded to have used a smaller type of crossbow known as the gastraphates (meaning ‘belly shooter’). Nevertheless, it was later during the Middle Ages that smaller, handheld crossbows became popular on the battlefield.\nDespite its numerous advantages, the crossbow had some serious flaws. One of them was the fact that it was a very slow weapon. A crossbow’s average rate of fire was two bolts a minute. By contrast, a skilled longbow man could fire between 10 to 12 arrows in a minute.\nIt is likely that the ancient Chinese crossbows had this same problem as their medieval European counterparts. As a result of their innovation, the Chinese came up with an ingenious solution – the Zhuge nu , or repeating crossbow.\nA non-recurve repeating crossbow. Ones used for war would be recurved ( CC BY 1.0 )\nAlthough its invention is traditionally attributed to a tactician of the Three Kingdoms period called Zhuge Liang, archaeological evidence has shown that the use of this weapon predated the famous tactician about 500 years.\nNevertheless, it is entirely possible that Zhuge Liang made significant improvements to the design of the repeating crossbow. As its name suggests, the repeating crossbow was capable to firing a number of bolts before needing to be reloaded. Later repeating crossbows, for instance, were able to fire as many as 10 bolts in 15 seconds before reloading was required.\nIn Europe, crossbows were gradually replaced by gunpowder weapons. In China, on the other hand, the use of the crossbow seems to have survived up till the late Qing Dynasty. It has been said that the last major world conflict to feature crossbows was the First Sino-Japanese War (1894 – 1895).\n- Terracotta Army weapons were immensely powerful\n- The Tale of Teucer – Legendary Archer of the Trojan War and Founder of Ancient Salamis\n- 2,100-Year-Old Royal Tomb Discovered in China\nJapanese troops during the Sino-Japanese war.

It was also the leading cause for the decline in future crossbow use.\nFeatured image: Part of a Naval Battle Scroll from the Imjin War. Photo source: ( CC BY 1.0 )\nDrury, F., 2015.

{"question":"How did the Dutch achieve their independence in the 17th century, and what political theories emerged regarding sovereignty during this period?","answer":"The Dutch achieved independence through the Eighty Years' War (1568-1648) against Spain, establishing the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands in 1581. They became a major maritime power in Europe, second only to England, and their independence was officially recognized in the Peace of Westphalia in 1648. During this period, political theorists like Althusius challenged traditional views of sovereignty, arguing that sovereign rights belonged to the people as a whole rather than to princes or magistrates. He maintained that these rights could not be transferred or renounced, comparing them to one's own life, which cannot be given to another. This view contrasted with common opinion that attributed sovereign rights to princes and supreme magistrates.","context":["Historical Context and Major Features\nThe Dutch Protestants and the Flemish Catholics went their separate ways after the later sixteenth century. The situation is so completely different in Holland that it is difficult to imagine how, within such a tiny area, two such opposite artistic cultures could flourish.\nAlthough closer in outlook to the Germans, the Dutch were ethnically the same as the Flemish, who were, in turn, closer in viewpoint to their neighbors to the south - the French. A Catholic, aristocratic, and traditional culture reigned in the Flanders of Rubens.\nIn Holland, severe Calvinistic Protestantism was puritanical toward religious art, sculptural or pictorial although many of the Dutch were Catholics, including a number of painters.\nThe churches were swept clean of images, and any recollection of the pagan myths, the material of Classicism, or even historical subjects, was prohibited in art.\nDuring the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, religious subjects and, later, Classical and historical subjects had been the major stimuli for artistic activity.\nLiberated of these sources, what remained to enrich the lives of wealthy Hollanders? For they were wealthy!\nDuring the early part of Spanish rule, the Dutch, like the Flemish, prospered The East India Company was formed, and the discovery of the New World opened up further opportunities for trade and colonization. The wars of independence from Spain made Holland the major maritime country of Europe; its closest rival was England, another Protestant power in the times of the Spanish decline.\nThe great Dutch commercial cities, such as Haarlem and Amsterdam, had been stimulated and enriched, and civic pride was strong. Although it was not internationally recognized until the Peace of Westphalia in 1648, Holland in fact had been independent from Spain since about 1580 and was extremely proud of its hard-won freedom.\nThe Dutch are 'the envy of some, the fear of others, and the wonder of all their neighbours'. So wrote the English ambassador to the Dutch Republic, Sir William Temple, in 1673.\nIn the 17th century, the Dutch republic became an economic and military superpower. It was also an era in which Dutch science and arts blossomed. This era is usually referred to as the Dutch Golden Age.\nThe Laughing Cavalier is the example we shall choose to end the International Laughter Day that today has commemorated. The portrait, by Dutch Golden Age painter Frans Hals, depicts the male sitter in a 3/4 stance, face turned as he looks out at the viewer. In the upper right of the painting, upon the rather mundane green background, an inscription can be found. It reads \"aetatis suae 26, anno 1624” in Latin, translated to indicate that the painting was completed when the sitter was 26, in the year 1624, somewhat close to the beginning of the famous period in which the Dutch were acclaimed for their mastery of the arts, science and the military.\nThis work owes its name to the Victorian public and press that it first encountered upon making the journey from Paris to London in the early 1870s. The history of it only traces back as far as 1770, when it was sold in the Hague, presumably having been sold a number of times beforehand to Dutch buyers. Eventually it was acquired by Franco-Swiss banker and collector the Comte de Pourtalès-Gorgier in 1822, and his abundant collection was auctioned after his death in Paris in 1865. The man who obtained the work from auction was Richard Seymour-Conway, 4th Marquess of Hertford, who outbid Baron James de Rothschild at more than six times the sales estimate. This was an incredible show of the value of the work, which Hertford hung in his Paris home and called portrait d’un homme. From there, it was moved to England for a large, long-loan exhibition of old master paintings in Bethnal Green. The exhibition has an interesting history to itself, being one of the first of its kind not placed in the West End, with the purpose of attracting the working class to view the works and educated themselves. This work, named A Cavalier at the exhibition, was a hit at the exhibition and is responsible for much of the esteemed reputation that Hals held in England. The painting was cleaned in 1884, and some commented on his expression having changed, most notably a critic in the Athaeneum stating “The man smiles rather than laughs”. Despite this, the name was altered to Laughing Cavalier. The son of Hertford was Sir Richard Wallace, hence why the artwork can now be found in his former house, The Wallace Collection, that was donated to the nation by his widow after his death.\nThe work has faced much controversy in establishing who the sitter may be. Recorded titles that arose in the Netherlands, England and France in 19th Century suggest he was a military man, or at least an officer in a part time militia. This acknowledgement could simply be due to the prominence of portraits of both individual sitters, and large groups, as in Rembrandt’s The Night Watch. Art historian Pieter Biesboer suggests that the man might be a subject that Hals had utilised beforehand - Dutch cloth merchant Tieleman Roosterman. The detail that Hals has depicted in the costume appears intricate and colourful, imbuing the costume with life and extravagance. We see many significant emblems in the embroidery that John Ingamells sums up cohesively in his Dutch and Flemish Catalogue of the Wallace Collection: “bees, arrows, flaming cornucopiae, lover’s knots and tongues of fire” signify “the pleasures and pains of love”. Obelisks and pyramids can be seen, indicating strength, and Mercury’s cap and staff (caduceus) indicating fortune. All of these virtues are likely to be qualities that a wealthy man buying a portrait might like to display. Upon closer look, the viewer can see Hals is deceiving the eye with the detail, as the brushstrokes are large but swift, mirroring that of emotion — deep-felt but rather fleeting. His true to life depiction is enhanced with small editions that Hals has made such as the soft cream tint on his forehead, giving it a lively sheen and the circular pink brushstrokes on his cheeks give them a blushed tint.\nWhy has this particular work, that is clearly not laughing in the conventional way, become linked to the idea of laughter in such an overt manner? To begin with, we can attribute it to the mere fact that the sitter is depicted with a smile. Commissioned portraits like this one rarely show the subject with a smile. It was not until the late 18th century that this became common practice, therefore Hals was the exception to a rule. This indicates how conscious a decision of his it was, making the facial expression an important focal point for discussion. The informality of the poses of his characters gives an impression of movement and spontaneity to his work. Another element that is rather inviting about Laughing Cavalier is the liveliness already spoken of. The wrinkles beneath his eyes bulge with vitality, and the typical smiling eyes, or ‘smise’ fad of modern day can truly be experienced. A white twinkle in his right pupil distinguishes his jovial expression from a skeptical squint.\nA twinkle in one’s eye, and a smile, albeit it small, is all that’s necessary to participate in World Laughter Day. So make completely certain, even if it’s just when falling asleep, to allow yourself that much, especially today.\nFirst year Art Historian at Cambridge University and intern at Private Art Education.","Politica: Politics Methodically Set Forth and Illustrated with Sacred and Profane Examples, by Johannes Althusius\nFrom the Preface to the First Edition (1603):\nThis plan and goal was conceived and attempted by me that I might possibly offer a torch of intelligence, judgment, and memory to beginning students of political doctrine.\nAlthusius dedicates this work to two “most distinguished and learned men,” both he describes as his relatives. The first is Martin Neurath, a trial lawyer –Althusius’ wife was Margarethe Neurath. The second is Jacob Tieffenbach. So this first preface is a personal letter; it isn’t addressed to the general reader, but to two relatives, perhaps also close associates, if not mentors.\n…I have therein attributed [the rights of sovereignty] to the realm, or to the commonwealth and people. I know that in the common opinion of teachers they are to be described as belonging to the prince and supreme magistrate. Bodin clamors that these rights of sovereignty cannot be attributed to the realm or the people….\nI know some read these words and will throw out Althusius almost as quickly as they would Bodin. But this ignores the reality that people will organize politically – the only question is the extent to which coercion is introduced in the mix. It is for this reason that I am attracted to Althusius – certainly he was unique in his time (and also in small company since the Renaissance) for his views on decentralization and subsidiarity.\n…I am not troubled by the clamors of Bodin nor the voices of others who disagree with me, so long as there are reasons that agree with my judgment.\nAlthusius sees the prince or magistrate as a steward or administrator, but the rights are not his – the rights remain with the people (technically, within voluntarily-formed groups of people). These rights cannot be renounced – in other words, they cannot be granted irrevocably or without recourse. This seems to me an important point.\nFrom the Preface to the Third Edition (1614):\nDedicated to the illustrious leaders of the estates of Frisia between the Zuider Zee and the North Sea most worthy lords.\nThe import of this dedication will be made clear shortly.\nAll copies of the earlier editions had been sold out. Althusius, therefore, offers this third edition, “done during the odd hours permitted me between responsibilities to the Commonwealth.” What was this “Commonwealth”? It will be remembered that at this time, Althusius was the Syndic of the city of Emden; in other words, he viewed a city as a commonwealth – the highest political association.\nThis should be kept in mind as we move through the examination of his book – the commonwealth included a region that included people with common wealth: the key term being “common.” Not in terms of communism, but in terms of what Althusius calls “communication”: the various exchanges done by and amongst a common group of people.\nOf course, it could be argued that a modern economy does not allow for such a small commonwealth. But is this so? We need not confuse the trading of goods with the merging of polities. We have Switzerland, we have Lichtenstein, we have Singapore. Not every commonwealth need include hundreds of millions of people under one roof.\nThe Decalogue plays a foundational role in Althusius’ view:\nFor what would human life be without the piety of the first table of the Decalogue, and without the justice of the second?\nWe see all around us what that life would be: the piety of the first is lost, and the justice of the second is, at best, wobbly.\nI claim the Decalogue as proper to political science insofar as it breathes a vital spirit into symbiotic life.\nSo I am clear: a theocracy is not in my vision. It is sufficient for me that Christian leaders teach this to their congregations: no laws, no force, no prisons, none of that. Libertarians are OK with the idea of doing battle via ideas; I am merely suggesting that Christian leaders might consider the same. I am also suggesting that institutionally there is no better-equipped body to take on the power of the state.\nDo I suggest this for the sake of conversions? No; within the context of this blog your eternal soul is not my concern. I suggest it for the sake of liberty: apply laws against killing, theft, covetousness to the government; teach a moral and humble life; keep in mind that Christians have a duty to live thus on this earth, and not merely wait for the next.\nAlthusius again repeats his views on sovereignty: this does not rest with the supreme magistrate but with the people as a whole:\nThese rights of sovereignty are so proper to this association, in my judgment, that even if it [the people as a whole] wishes to renounce them, to transfer them to another, and to alienate them, it would by no means be able to do so, any more than a man is able to give the life enjoys to another.\nIf there is a fly in the ointment of Althusian political theory, it is that of the relationship of voluntarily formed groups to the commonwealth and the princes or magistrates above these. And it is here that I will return to Althusius’ dedication to this third edition and the worthy lords of Frisia:\nTo demonstrate this point I am able to produce the excellent example of your own and the other provinces confederated with you. For in the war you undertook against the very powerful king of Spain you did not consider that the rights of sovereignty adhered so inseparably to him that they did not exist apart from him.\n…you declared that these rights belong to the associated multitude…you not only defended and conserved your commonwealth from tyranny and disaster, but also made it even more illustrious.\nThe commonwealth was not the same thing as the kingdom or empire. It took war to exercise this right of the people as a group, but it is justified to Althusius within his political construct.\nFrom what I gather so far, as advocated by Althusius:\n· The commonwealth was local, and its boundaries were not necessarily fixed.\n· Some moral rules beyond non-aggression are called for if one desires healthy communication (call it “relationships,” broadly speaking) with one’s neighbors.\n· The people (or rather, various groups of people) are justified – even to war – to remove themselves from a king who does not properly respect the people as a whole.\nAll points that most libertarians can get behind, it seems to me.\nI think it is worth a few words about this war within the context of Althusius’ work:\nThe Eighty Years' War or Dutch War of Independence (1568–1648) was a revolt of the Seventeen Provinces of what are today the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg against Philip II of Spain, the sovereign of the Habsburg Netherlands.\nAlthusius wrote this preface in 1614, right in the middle of this ongoing conflict. What was the situation at the time of his writing? In 1581 – thirteen years into the war – the northern provinces established the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands. In 1609, an official truce was established, lasting for twelve years; it was during this period that Althusius wrote his preface.\nWar resumed for the Dutch, generally corresponding with the start of the Thirty Years’ War. This war between the Netherlands and Spain ended in 1648 only with the Peace of Münster, which formed a part of the Peace of Westphalia:\nScholars have identified Westphalia as the beginning of the modern international system, based on the concept of Westphalian sovereignty.\nWestphalian sovereignty, or state sovereignty, is the principle in international law that each nation state has exclusive sovereignty over its territory.\nSo much for voluntarily forming groups, provinces, and commonwealths."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:3c5e70a6-d68a-48f5-96ab-f73ab9263c5a>","<urn:uuid:c34d8218-ec91-4e07-adfc-3201ab47c295>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What's the key difference between how earlier environmental research approached global changes vs. the emerging 'earth system governance' paradigm? Super curious about the evolution of environmental science! 🌍","answer":"The key difference is that earlier environmental research focused on governing local and national environmental problems in isolation, while the earth system governance paradigm recognizes that we need integrated systems of governance from local to global levels. This is because environmental challenges are now understood as part of a single, complex system where environmental, political, social, cultural, economic and psychological dimensions merge. The new paradigm acknowledges that humans are altering the entire Earth system, operating well outside normal conditions of the past 500,000 years, requiring coordinated governance mechanisms across all levels to address these interconnected challenges.","context":["The issue confronted in the World Social Science Report 2013 is global environmental change, a phenomenon that encompasses all the biophysical changes occurring on the planet’s land areas and in its oceans, atmosphere and cryosphere.\nMany of these changes are driven by human activities such as fossil fuel consumption, deforestation, agricultural intensification, urbanisation, the over-exploitation of fisheries, and waste production. Global environmental change includes biodiversity loss, large-scale shifts in water resources, fundamental changes in the nitrogen and phosphorus cycles, ozone depletion and ocean acidification. It also includes climate change, which according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, is the most serious of today’s global environmental issues for humanity.\nAll these changes are intimately connected to accelerating production and consumption, a growing population, socio-economic and cultural globalisation, and widespread patterns of inequality. Together they comprise a major feature of contemporary life, requiring innovative policy and social transformation.\nWhy a social science report on global environmental change?\nGlobal environmental change has potentially grave consequences for the well-being and security of people all over the world. They are so grave, in fact, that warnings about an impending global humanitarian emergency are proliferating (e.g. Rockström et al., 2009; Brito and Stafford Smith, 2012; Ehrlich and Ehrlich, 2013). Such warnings are indeed pertinent: most environmental trends are negative, accelerating and in some cases mutually reinforcing, and the consequences of these changes are real and unfolding, affecting individuals and communities everywhere. When it is recognised how these problems interact with and exacerbate other social, economic and political crises – including persistent poverty, increasing inequality and socio-political discontent – a clear sense of urgency emerges. Equally clear is the challenge before society: to secure a sustainable world through effective responses to today’s interacting processes of environmental and social change. Global sustainability requires concerted action to protect the planet’s bounty and, simultaneously, to safeguard social equity, human dignity and well-being for all\nThe World Social Science Report 2013 picks up this challenge by issuing an urgent and decisive appeal to the social sciences1 to research more effectively the human causes, vulnerabilities and impacts of environmental change, and thus to inform societal responses to the sustainability challenges that society now faces. It urges social scientists to work closely not only with each other, but also with colleagues from the natural, physical, engineering, health and human sciences on accelerating the delivery of credible and legitimate knowledge for real-world problem solving.\nToday’s global environmental problems are shared problems that require joint effort, not only across the sciences but also between science and its many stakeholders and users. In this collaborative context, the burden of today’s unrelenting pressure on science to be relevant falls particularly heavily on the social sciences. What makes it so? There are three defining attributes of today’s changing global realities that call for a fundamental rethinking of how we understand and address global environmental change. Each calls for intensified, and in many instances refocused, social science research.\nThe inseparability of social and environmental systems and problems\nEnvironmental problems cannot be separated from the other risks and crises that comprise current global realities. They are not disconnected challenges; they do not occur in discrete, autonomous systems rooted in the environment on the one hand, and in society on the other. Instead, they are part of a single, complex system where the environmental, political, social, cultural, economic and psychological dimensions of our existence meet and merge. Consequently, global environmental change is simultaneously an environmental and a social problem.\nFor this reason, researchers across the disciplinary spectrum have for some time spoken of “social-ecological” or “coupled human-natural” systems. Social science research helps us to comprehend the complex dynamics of these systems. It examines how problems are connected: for example, how climate change interacts with water and food security, economic development, social inequality, poverty, migration and conflict. It explores how people’s vulnerabilities to different types of change are interrelated, and what human consequences the actions taken in response to one set of problems may have for another.\nIf society is to be serious about slowing or reversing global environmental trends, about reducing vulnerabilities, minimising impacts and improving human well-being, the social sciences must step forward more forcefully to inform understanding of these social-ecological systems. Social science can help explain how these systems unfold and interconnect across space, from the local to the global, and in time, from the past and present into the future. These insights will help unblock the inherent limitations of our current thinking and language about these systems, articulate new narratives that transcend the nature–society dichotomy, and identify opportunities for new and more effective solutions.\nA human condition without precedent\nHumans are living at a time when the Earth’s land surface and climate, its elemental cycles, oceans, fresh water, ice, air and ecosystems have all been altered fundamentally from the state they were in even just a few centuries ago. This is a remarkable and unique trait of the conditions in which society now finds itself. And scientists know with great confidence that these changes are attributable primarily to human activity. The Nobel Prize-winning chemist Paul Crutzen (2002) proposed calling this unprecedented time the Anthropocene: a new geological era in Earth’s history, in which humans are the defining geological force, and the first in which that force is “actively conscious of its geological role” (Palsson et al., 2013).\nIn the Anthropocene, people assume centre stage. This makes the causes, consequences and responses to global environmental change fundamentally social in nature. Global environmental change is about humans changing global environments, and about humans, individually and collectively, shaping the direction of planetary and social evolution. The social sciences thus have a vital role in enriching society’s understanding of what it means to live – and maybe thrive – in the Anthropocene, and in raising awareness of the opportunities, accountabilities and responsibilities this brings with it. The social sciences need to help answer questions about how the role of humans as environmental culprits can be reconciled with their role as inheritors and even victims of the environmental problems we create. They must also help society understand what defines or increases the human potential to break out of either mould, and explore what makes people into agents of deliberate change. Finally, the social sciences can help explain how people find the will and creativity to deploy their agency to safeguard human security in an equitable and environmentally sustainable manner.\nUrgent and fundamental social transformation\nThe third defining trait of this time pertains to the fundamental nature of change that society may either seek out deliberately, or be subjected to involuntarily. If society takes seriously the fact that the planet’s systems are under rapidly growing and unsustainable pressures, and that human systems are inextricably linked to their fate, it becomes clear that human security is at stake. Human security is understood here in the broadest sense. It involves people having the options they need to reverse, mitigate or adapt to threats to their basic needs and rights, and the capacity, freedom and sense of responsibility to pursue these options (GECHS, 1999). Deep social transformation is needed if societies are to maintain or establish human security, and pursue the larger quest for global sustainability in the face of human-caused degradation of essential life support systems.\nThe social sciences are uniquely placed to clarify what this means. Through engaged research, they can help society as a whole understand the nature and scope of the changes required at individual, organisational and systemic levels, and how such changes could be realised in politically feasible and culturally acceptable ways. A further important task for the social sciences is to understand the role of science in fostering deliberate, inclusive, democratic and hence deliberative processes of transformation. And it is equally vital for the social sciences to advance society’s understanding of how scientific and other forms of knowledge can be integrated to achieve culturally sensitive, locally appropriate, yet globally effective transitions to sustainability.\nGiven these features of today’s global realities, the case for greater engagement by the social sciences is clear. Their knowledge is indispensable for a clearer understanding of the causes and consequences of global environmental change, and for informing more effective, equitable and durable solutions to today’s broader sustainability problems. This is what makes the World Social Science Report 2013 on global environmental change both relevant and timely.\nThe World Social Science Report 2013 has five specific objectives:\n- develop a social science framing of global environmental change and sustainability.\n- showcase some unique contributions that the social sciences can make, taking different disciplinary and interdisciplinary perspectives into account, and writing from or about different regions of the world\n- explore and assess how well social science knowledge about changing global environments is linked to policy and action\n- influence research programming, science policy-making and funding at national, regional and international levels\n- mobilise the wider social science community to engage more effectively, and take the lead in developing a more integrated and transformative science of global change and sustainability.\nThe call for knowledge integration\nThe social sciences have been and remain marginal to global environmental change research in the post-war era. As contributions in Part 2 of the report show, it is a field that has been and continues to be dominated by the natural sciences. At the same time, and as further discussed in Part 7, global environmental change has failed to capture the attention and imagination of the more traditional, mainstream social sciences, the core of the disciplines which view the social and human world as their focus. For them, social phenomena, relationships, interactions and human behaviours may take place on an environmental stage, but they tend to be understood as being determined by humans alone.\nTo remedy this, social scientists and their supporters face a dual task: to secure a space for the environment within the social sciences, and an equally important and central space for the social sciences within the broad field of global environmental change research.\nEnvironmental change research now aims more than ever to integrate the social, natural, human, engineering and health sciences. Integration in this case does not imply the loss of disciplinary strengths or identity. On the contrary, it means being confident in one’s disciplinary base whilst remaining open to other ways of viewing and studying the world, open to asking new and different kinds of questions that emerge from an appreciation of the contributions that different disciplines and perspectives bring. Integration means engaging with colleagues from other disciplines and fields in the joint, reciprocal framing of problems and research questions, and in the collaborative design, execution and application of research.\nObstacles to knowledge integration\nThis emphasis on integrated science is dictated by two related facts: the complexity of the interconnected environmental and sustainability challenges that society faces, and the inability of any single discipline or scientific domain to understand, let alone address, such complexity. This emphasis is not new. Appeals for closer collaboration, particularly between the social and natural sciences, date back to at least the 1970s (Tsuru, 1970; UNESCO and ISSC, 2010; Mooney, Duraiappah and Larigauderie, 2013). Yet despite the progress that has been made by many academic groups and in many scientific institutions across the world – reflected in a number of the contributions to this report – the task of bringing the different sciences together in integrated global change research remains difficult. As a result, the track record on which to draw remains limited.\nThere are many reasons for this difficulty (see Part 7, World Social Science Report 2013 and Chapter 10, World Social Science Report 2010). Generally, disciplines still dominate academic and funding practices, and differences persist in the research cultures, standards and norms of different fields. Integration depends on the effective building of relations of trust. Trust is emergent and cannot be imposed. It requires time and supportive rather than competitive institutional environments. Global environmental change research brings yet further challenges. Researchers from different fields frequently accuse each other of naiveté regarding their understanding of the social or the physical world, and while the natural sciences often give preference to analysis at the global scale, the social sciences tend to work at a local or even individual level.\nAnother obstacle to integration stems from the fact that assessments of what knowledge is or is not relevant to the question at hand have traditionally been determined by the natural sciences. Much work remains to be done beyond this report, to clarify what integration means in practice, find effective ways of implementing it, and adjust institutional practices to support it.\nNew opportunities in integrated, solutions-oriented research for sustainability\nSuch work is now being undertaken within Future Earth, an ambitious new ten-year international programme of research for global sustainability. This initiative seeks to deliver a step change in the way science for sustainability is produced and used. Central to this ambition is a commitment to engage a wider scientific community and to effectively integrate efforts across scientific fields, in order to find the best scientific solutions to complex, multifaceted problems. Equally important within the Future Earth vision is an emphasis on bringing policymakers, practitioners, business and industry, as well as other sectors of civil society, into the co-design, co-production and co-delivery of knowledge for sustainability.\nFuture Earth marks significant progress in securing a real commitment from researchers, science policymakers and funders to integrated, solutions-oriented research. It provides a unique and robust institutional basis for accomplishing something that has long been called for: research that brings the natural, social, human and engineering sciences together in timely, meaningful dialogue and collaboration around joint agendas. It fosters knowledge production guided by a vision of science working with society to find solutions for global sustainability. This approach defines the context within which this report has been prepared and within which the challenges it poses to the social sciences must be understood. See Future Earth and The Science and Technology Alliance for Global Sustainability.\nFramework for the report: Transformative cornerstones of social science research for global change\nThe engagement of the social sciences will be critical to the success of initiatives such as Future Earth. What can the social sciences bring to integrated global environmental change research? What are the unique contributions they can and must make to deliver solutions-oriented knowledge for global sustainability?\nThese are the questions that the ISSC set out to answer in a 2012 report entitled Transformative Cornerstones of Social Science Research for Global Change (Hackmann and St. Clair, 2012). The knowledge framework presented in that report identifies six sets of questions that have to be answered if research on concrete environmental problems is to inform actions that result in ethical and equitable transformations to sustainability. These questions are critical social science questions, bringing the full spectrum of theoretical and empirical, qualitative and quantitative, and basic and applied social science knowledge to bear on the urgent challenges of today. The six transformative cornerstones form the thematic framework for the World Social Science Report 2013.\nThe World Social Science Report 2013 does not represent a single, unified social science voice, nor should it. And while it makes an effort to cover some of the biggest problems of global environmental change, and related social challenges confronting contemporary society today, it cannot cover everything. The contributions reflect current preoccupations and trends in a constantly changing and expanding area of work, as much as existing and growing capacities to pursue them. It is indicative of past accomplishments but does not limit future possibilities. The field is growing, wide open, and rife with opportunity to broaden and deepen what social scientists do on the topic of global environmental change and sustainability.\nMuch like an artful elephant installation appearing unexpectedly on an urban plaza or at the edge of the sea, this report invites its readers to consider new or unusual perspectives, gather new insights and understandings, and perhaps walk away thinking differently. The implications of using a social lens to examine global environmental change and sustainability, and taking the insights resulting from that changed perspective seriously, are indeed profound.\nThis article is adapted slightly from the original version published as the introduction to the World Social Science Report 2013, see full text including references.","The International Project Office is hosted by Lund University.\nSince prehistoric times, humans have altered their local environment. Beginning about a century ago, they are altering their planet. More and more parameters of the earth system are changing due to human influences. The scientific knowledge about the earth system and its current transformation becomes more confident every day. Humans now seem to influence all biological and physical systems of the planet. The four global change research programmes, affiliated in the Earth System Science Partnership (ESSP), see evidence today that the entire earth system now operates ´well outside the normal state exhibited over the past 500,000 years´. The Earth System Science Partnership thus sees an urgent need to develop better governance mechanisms and institutions at all levels to cope with this emerging earth system transformation.\nYet it is apparent that the institutions, organizations, and governance mechanisms by which humans currently regulate their relationship with the natural environment and global biochemical systems are not only insufficient. They are also poorly understood. More fundamental and applied research on the global, national and local institutions and governance systems is therefore needed. This research must address all levels of policy-making and cut across many sectors. It must be about the people who are drivers of global environmental change and at the same time part of any solution. It must be about places in all their variety and diversity, yet seek to integrate place-based research in a global understanding of the overall challenge to steer human interaction vis-à-vis earth system transformation. Eventually, this research will need to be about our planet. It is the task of developing integrated systems of governance, from the local to the global level, that ensure the sustainable development of the coupled socio-ecological system that the Earth has become. We call this research challenge ´earth system governance´. This term signals, in our view, a paradigmatic change from governing local and national environmental problems to coping with a more fundamental transformation of the earth system.\nThis research need has been recognised in March 2007 by the Scientific Committee of the International Human Dimensions Programme on Global Environmental Change (IHDP), which mandated a scientific planning committee to draft a science plan for a new IHDP Earth System Governance Project. A draft version of this Science Plan has been reviewed by more than 40 researchers and practitioners. At its 15th Meeting, October 2008 in New Delhi, India, the IHDP Scientific Committee approved the Earth System Governance Science and Implementation Plan, and appointed the Scientific Steering Committee (ESG SSC). This approval marked the official launch of the Earth System Governance Project, as a new core project of IHDP.\nThe Earth System Governance Project, while being essentially a scientific effort, is also designed to assist policy responses to the pressing problems of earth system transformation. All analytical problems studied in the project have profound policy implications. For example, the problem of the architecture of earth system governance is a key concern of current negotiations and political processes that are often faced with 'treaty congestion' and complex interlinkages between different institutions, for instance between multilateral environmental agreements and the World Trade Organization. 'Fragmented' governance architectures are also an increasing problem for decision-makers, particularly in climate policy. A related concern is the reform of the United Nations, for example with a view to the debate on a United Nations Environment Organization. At national and local levels, architecture is a key concern for decision-makers dealing with policy integration, the comparative effectiveness of policy instruments, and the integration of decision-making from international, national and local levels. Research on agency within the project will generate novel ideas on the integration of civil society actors in earth system governance, and on the advantages and disadvantages of private and public-private governance arrangements. Research on governance of adaptation and the adaptiveness of governance arrangements will inform policy-makers who have to deal with adapting politics and policies to a changing world. The accountability and legitimacy of decision-making, from local to global levels, is equally a key problem for public policy. Finally, the research on allocation and access will help to improve governance outcomes and advance philosophical and ethical discourses on an equitable approach to earth system governance."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:43fa865d-430a-424c-8b22-e7643730daa4>","<urn:uuid:b5831ea5-c593-42c7-a20b-1d6e8c558e11>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What's the key difference between how Commercial banks and GHC Funding determine loan rates for businesses?","answer":"Commercial banks primarily base their lending decisions on secured vs. unsecured loan status, with secured loans being backed by collateral like houses or cars. In contrast, GHC Funding determines its business line of credit rates (ranging from 8% to over 60% APR) based on multiple factors including the borrower's credit scores, business tenure, and business income, with the best rates going to established business owners with strong credit profiles.","context":["Types of Banks\nCentral bank: The Federal Reserve Bank (FED) in the USA The Federal Reserve System was created by an act of congress in 1913. It is the central bank of the country. It exercises monetary authority over the country. The US currency is issued by the Federal Reserve Banks. Every currency note says the words \"Federal Reserve Note\" on it. It is a banker's bank, meaning it acts as the bank for member banks. It acts as the lender of last resort, meaning that it is obligated to financially rescue a member bank, as and when needed. It has the right to buy and sell government securities. It sets the reserve ratio \"r\", and member banks have to uphold that. The USA has a two tier banking system, with the FED at the top. They deal with member banks only. The member banks deal with the public at large. The FED sets the basic regulation which the member banks have to follow. The FED also gives loans to member banks at a rate called the \"discount rate.\" Every member bank owns stock in its district FED branch. The FED sets the monetary policy of the country. There are 12 Federal Reserve Banks, located in: Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco. Each bank is administered by a bank President. The 12 FED banks are administered by a 7 member Board of Governors (BOG), appointed by the President of the United States. They have to be confirmed by the Senate. Each member serves a 14 year non-renewable term. One new member of the BOG’s is appointed every 2 years. This is done so as to insulate the FED from political control. It assures their autonomy in policy making, because one president over his 4 year term can only appoint 2 BOG members. One of the governor's is appointed the Chairman of the FED. He has a 4 year renewable term. The FED decides the reserve requirements, based on the economic situation in the country. The FED has mainly 3 tools in its arsenal to control the monetary policy of the country. They are: 1) Open Market Operation 2) Changing the discount rate 3) Changing the reserve requirements There is a FED subcommittee, called the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). It has the responsibility of buying and selling government securities, under the open market operation. This is the primary way the FED exercises expansionary or contractionary monetary policy over the economy. The FOMC consists of 7 BOG and 5 Presidents from the 12 Presidents of the 12 regional FED banks. The chairman of the FED heads the FOMC. The president of the New York FED is the only regional FED person who presides in every FOMC meeting.\nCommercial banks: Commercial banks are financial institutions which take deposits (checkable, savings and time deposits) from people and companies. These are their liabilities. They also make loans to both of them. They also buy corporate and government bonds, which are their assets. Commercial banks are financial institutions which take deposits (checkable, savings and time deposits) from people and companies. These are their liabilities. They are financial institutions which act as a financial intermediary between the saver and the investor. They also make loans to both of them. Functions: Keep peoples savings, and pay interest to them on those Accept and clear checks Issuing bank drafts They also buy corporate and government bonds, which are their assets. Nowadays they also do internet banking They give loans to people as well as companies. Some of them also have safe deposit boxes for safekeeping of client's valuables They give both secured as well as unsecured loans. A secured loan is a loan given against some collateral (asset) as a house or a car. A special case of a secured loan given against real estate (like a house) is called a mortgage loan. The commercial bank holds the title (deed or ownership) of the house or real estate, till it is completely paid off. If the borrower defaults on his loan (is not able to make agreed upon payments) the bank can sell the house and recover their balances. Hence it is a secured loan. Nowadays commercial banks are big players in the mortgage market. Unsecured loans are given based on trust and credit worthiness of the client. Examples of these would be personal loans make to their clients, extending a clients credit line and giving them overdraft facilities on their account and also their debit card.\nInvestment banks: These are large financial institutions which help companies/ firms/ even governments raise funds from the marketplace. The investment firms are the underwriters (guarantors in a sense) of the initial investment. The investment firms buy the initial public offering (IPO) of the companies in the primary stock market, in its entirety. The firms then sell them to everyone else in the secondary stock market. They back up the start up company or government (as the case may be) and its credibility. The investment firms' returns is the difference between the first issue price (IPO price) at which they bought the shares in the primary market, and the price at which they sell the shares in the secondary market. Investment firms deal with derivatives and other financial instruments. Investment banks do not take deposits from the public like a regular commercial bank. Investment banks or investment firms in the USA have to have a proper license to operate. They are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In the USA there is a clear separation between the functions of investment banks and commercial banks. Investment banks mainly raise money for firms and corporations. They help in mergers and acquisitions.\nCredit Unions: These are small banks. They give many banking services, but are only open to its members. One has to be a member of a credit union to be able to bank with them, or avail their services. Credit unions provide savings/ checking accounts to members. They also provide their members with small loans to buy consumer durable like a car. Credit unions are non-profit organizations. Credit unions are owned by their members. They have a democratic (1 person/1 vote) system to elect their board of directors. Credit unions today have their own credit cards, certificate of deposit (CD's), online banking facilities etc. Their funds are insured up-to 250,000 dollars per account by the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF). It is backed by the US government. Credit unions generally pay higher interest / dividends on their savings (compared to other commercial banks.) They also charge lower interest to their members on loans (again compared to other commercial banks.) Outsiders (non-members) cannot bank with a credit union. Credit unions are chartered to service a specific group of individuals like teachers, for example the Detroit Teachers Credit Union (DTCU.) An original members' family members can also join the same credit union. Many credit unions serve low income groups and also geographically under served areas of the USA. Credit unions are exempt from federal and state income tax. They do have to pay property taxes. Credit unions are small local banks which do a host of banking services, but have unique characteristics. It is a co-operative type bank. It is owned by its members. One cannot use the services of a credit union without becoming a member. Thus it is not open for business like a commercial bank. It gives loans to its members at competitive rates. Most of the time interest charged by credit unions is less than those charged by commercial banks. It generally gives small loans to its members, but does not make large commercial loans. It serves a community, like the Detroit Teachers Credit Union (DTCU) serving Detroit teachers. In the USA credit unions are “not for profit” organizations and hence are tax exempt. The members of the credit union control and run their own banks by electing the banks Board of Directors (BOD.) This is done on the democratic principle of one man one vote. The services they generally offer are savings and checking accounts. Online banking facilities, credit cards and CD’s. Most credit union deposits are insured by the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF). The coverage is the same as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), up-to 250,000 dollars per account. Credit unions are backed by the US government and regulated by the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA.)\nSavings and loan institutions: These are also called thrift institutions. They have a long history starting from the 1800. These are savings institutions. They also mortgage property. Upto 1970, they were tightly regulated, their interest rate ceilings or limits decided by regulators. Early on they could only make limited types of loans. Then in the late 70's, President Carter expanded their power, and deregulated them. They could now pay higher interest on their deposits, and even take loans from the FED. They could make commercial loans and issue credit cards. The S&L accounts were insured by the FDIC. But this deregulation resulted in little oversight of what the S&L's were doing. They started new and more profitable lending practices. These were in the form of loaning money to risky ventures at higher interest rates, increasing their profit margin. Under regulation, both banks and S&Ls could have 5 % of their deposits brokered, not more. With deregulation, this limit was lifted. Now they could offer higher interest on CD's and this attracted a lot of public funds. But in order to pay these high interest rates on their CD's, they had to earn even higher interest from their loans. Thus started the practice of venturing into more and more risky channels. Junk bonds were one such type of investments. They also had the inherent advantage (as opposed to regulated banks), that they would not have to declare insolvency and thus could not be shut down. Thus they operated even when things inside got really bad. There were no checks and balances. When the loans started to go bad, over time the whole edifice collapsed. The critics believe that the regulatory norms should not have been removed. That would have prevented these excesses in risky behavior. But alas, we do not learn from our mistakes. A similar problem, but on a much larger scale and magnitude has come back to haunt us. It stared in 2007 with the collapse of the housing markets. It's Deja-vu all over again.\nVirtual bank: In case of a virtual bank there is very little brick and mortar type buildings. Most of these bank business is conducted online, electronically using the telephone, the World Wide Web (WWW), internet, ATM, mobile banking via your phone. Their establishment costs are minimal. Their worker expenses are minimal. Thus their costs of conducting business (transaction costs) are lower compared to traditional banks. These banks exist in the internet only and hence are called virtual banks. The world's first virtual bank was the Security first Network bank of Atlanta, USA, set up in 1995. Its deposits were FDIC insured. In 1998 it was bought over by the Royal bank of Canada. Then other virtual banks also known as E-banks, opened up in Europe and Asia. Even today there are E-banks in the USA as: 1) AM Trust Direct 2) Bank of Internet 3) USAA 4) Virtual bank 5) WT Direct etc. These are not 100 % electronic in the sense that most have some sort of physical presence as buildings, workers' offices etc. Due to their low running costs, these E-banks could offer higher interest on their savings and also charge lower interest on their loans. This is a big advantage for the customer. The fear is the lack of any face to face meeting in case of a problem.","Business Line of Credit Rates in 2023\nKey points to note:\nGHC Funding (Access 150+ Lenders) offers a wide spectrum of business line of credit rates, spanning from 8 percent to potentially exceeding 60 percent, contingent upon the borrower’s creditworthiness and the lender's terms.\nPreferential rates are accessible for established business proprietors with sound to outstanding credit profiles.\nAdditional fees, like annual charges, origination expenses, draw fees, and maintenance fees, might accompany business lines of credit.\nExploring alternatives beyond business lines of credit includes traditional bank loans, business credit cards, peer-to-peer loans, invoice financing, and merchant cash advances.\nA business line of credit from GHC Funding can entail an APR ranging from 8 percent to over 60 percent. As lenders aren't obliged to disclose their rates, pinpointing an average rate becomes challenging.\nThe prime beneficiaries of the best business lines of credit are seasoned small business owners boasting solid credit histories. However, startups or owners with lower credit profiles confront higher interest rates and may need to undertake more extensive comparisons to secure the most cost-effective line of credit.\nHere’s an overview of current business line of credit rates and insights to aid in identifying the ideal credit line for your business.\nCurrent rates on business lines of credit\nSimilar to any financial product, interest rates and terms for business lines of credit are subject to variance among lenders and market dynamics.\nLender Line of credit rates\nGHC Funding Starting from 7.99% APR\nSMB Compass Starting from 7.99% APR\nBank of America Starting from 9.50% APR\nWells Fargo Starting from 10.25% (Prime + 1.75%)\nBluevine Starting from 6.20% (simple interest)\nLendio 8.00% to 24.00% APR\nBackd 18.00% to 24.00% (simple interest)\nOndeck 52.60% (average APR)\nAmerican Express® Business Line of Credit As low as 3.00% to 9.00% APR (monthly fee)\nFundbox As low as 4.66% APR (weekly fee rate)\nTD Bank As low as 9.24% APR (Prime + 0.74%)\nRates accurate as of 11/22/2023\nInsights from GHC Funding\nThe loan quantum for business lines of credit can vary substantially. While some lenders might offer maximum amounts extending into the millions, individual credit scores and business tenure could limit loan eligibility to $100,000 or less.\nWhat determines the interest rate on a business line of credit?\nThe interest rate on your line of credit signifies the cost imposed by your lender for the funds you access.\nIn contrast to a loan, a business line of credit operates akin to a credit card: It’s a revolving credit line where you're charged interest only on the outstanding balance, not the entire available credit.\nFor instance, if your credit line amounts to $50,000, and your current debt is $5,000, interest is solely levied on the outstanding $5,000.\nOne reason for comparing various lines of credit is the significant variability in terms offered by lenders. These factors come into play:\nCredit scores: Both your business and personal credit scores impact the interest rate. Higher scores typically lead to lower rates.\nBusiness tenure: More established businesses often secure larger credit lines and more favorable terms. Some lenders mandate a minimum business tenure of two years, though exceptions exist.\nBusiness income: Lenders assess your business revenue, cash flow, and financial health to gauge lending risk. Lower risk may result in more favorable interest rates.\nCertain lenders extend business lines of credit employing factor rates, denoted as decimals rather than percentages. For instance, a $50,000 loan with a factor rate of 1.2 incurs a total cost of $60,000 ($50,000 x 1.2 = $60,000), exclusive of other charges.\nInsights from GHC Funding\nRefer to our guide on factor rates for insights on their conversion to annual interest rates. This facilitates comparisons across lenders, enabling a clearer understanding of your loan’s total cost.\nInterest rates vs. weekly or monthly fees\nMost lenders present business loan interest rates as annual percentage rates (APRs), offering a comprehensive view of the yearly expenses, encompassing both interest and fees.\nHowever, some lenders exhibit simple interest, solely highlighting interest without considering associated fees.\nCertain lenders impose weekly or monthly charges on outstanding balances, deviating from traditional interest rates. This approach fails to provide a holistic view of actual expenses, potentially leading to higher costs.\nFor example, a 2 percent monthly fee might equate to a 15 percent APR or higher, contingent upon the outstanding balance and repayment duration.\nFees associated with business lines of credit\nThe interest rate isn't the sole expense accompanying your credit line. Additional fees might include:\nAnnual fee: Typically a fixed fee, often under $200, levied annually for maintaining the credit line.\nOrigination fee: A percentage of the total line value charged once when opening a new line of credit.\nDraw fee: Charged for each withdrawal from the credit line, often up to two percent of the withdrawn amount.\nMaintenance fee: A fee for keeping the line open, frequently imposed on unused accounts, either monthly or annually.\nSecuring favorable interest rates on a business line of credit\nConsider these tips to obtain a business line of credit with competitive rates and minimal fees:\nThorough comparison: Explore business lines of credit from banks, credit unions, and online lenders, aiming to identify the lowest eligible rates based on your credit history, annual business revenue, business tenure, and other pertinent factors.\nEnhance credit scores: Elevate your credit scores by consistently making on-time payments and maintaining low debt levels. For business credit, apart from these practices, formalizing your business as a corporation or LLC is essential.\nSecured credit line: Though not as attractive as unsecured credit lines, offering collateral may prompt lenders to offer more favorable terms, reducing their risk exposure in case of default.\nAlternatives to business lines of credit\nApart from business lines of credit, several other avenues exist to infuse capital into your business. These encompass traditional bank loans, business credit cards, and alternative funding sources, such as:\nBusiness loans: Suitable for businesses needing a lump-sum amount without requiring revolving credit. Traditional banks necessitate substantial documentation for approval but offer higher loan amounts. Conversely, alternative lenders cater to a broader spectrum of small business owners, including startups and those seeking bad credit business loans, albeit at higher interest rates.\nPeer-to-peer (P2P) lending: An alternative funding avenue backed by individual lenders or groups, offering flexibility in credit score requirements compared to conventional banks. However, P2P lending might entail higher interest rates, although good credit could secure a more favorable rate. This mode of financing suits businesses in urgent need of cash or facing difficulties securing other types of bad credit business loans.\nBusiness credit cards: Similar to credit lines, they provide revolving funding but without origination or maintenance fees associated with credit lines. Business credit cards may offer promotional periods at 0% interest and potential rewards on purchases. They also offer flexible repayment terms, potentially remaining open for years, unlike credit lines with fixed maturity dates.\nInvoice factoring or financing: These options leverage unpaid invoices to access quick financing"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:f13ee42b-9d09-4d12-99a0-93e7e3d0fdf1>","<urn:uuid:ed8ee06a-cb92-4e00-9383-50789b443a21>"],"error":null}

Especially heading into the height of the severe weather season; April, May, June, and July.\nSmall safety tips can help everyday people protect themselves and their property. Unfortunately there are also numerous myths that can actually put citizens in more danger. The following breaks down the biggest facts or myths in flooding, damaging wind, and tornadoes, and how knowing a few simple facts could save your life.\nIf my vehicle has four-wheel drive, it’s OK to drive through a flooded roadway.\nFiction. Flooding is one of the leading causes of weather related fatalities in the United States. And while the water may not appear menacing, hidden dangers like washed out roadways endanger motorists every year. Moving water becomes an even greater threat, as only 6 inches of moving water can sweep a person off their feet. The bottom line, turn around, don’t drown.\n“Water may be deeper than it appears and can hide many hazards (i.e. sharp objects, washed out road surfaces, electrical wires, chemicals, etc). A vehicle caught in swiftly moving water can be swept away in a matter of seconds.” National Weather Service\nStraight line winds can be just as damaging as the winds from a tornado.\nFact. Straight line winds, also called downbursts, are areas of intense winds produced by the outflow of a thunderstorm. They can extend over areas typically up to a mile wide, and the damage is similar to that of a tornado. The biggest difference is the direction that the debris scatters, with one direction for straight line winds, and in all directions for tornadoes.\nAn overpass provides protection from an approaching tornado.\nFiction. An overpass is actually a more dangerous place to be during a tornado when compared to a vehicle. Winds within a tornado can exceed speeds of 200mph, and when funneled under an overpass, they become even stronger. These structures also leave people exposed to the swirling debris that are picked up by a tornado. Abandoning a vehicle may block other motorists from seeking safety, putting even more people in harms way.\n“Many people mistakenly think that a highway overpass provides safety from a tornado. The reality is: an overpass may be one of the worst places to seek shelter from a tornado. An overpass as tornado shelter can put people at a greater risk of being killed or seriously injured by flying debris from the powerful tornado winds.” Ohio Committee for Severe Weather Awareness\nThe bottom line.\nThe United States is prone is a wide variety of severe weather that extend through the entire year.

Among the President’s commitments are: protecting communities from pollution, reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2030, achieving a carbon pollution-free electricity grid by 2035, and reaching net-zero greenhouse gas emissions no later than 2050.\nTo achieve these ambitious goals, we must ensure that emerging technologies contribute to a net-zero, clean energy future. The use of digital assets based on distributed ledger technology (DLT) is expanding. Digital assets are a form of value, represented digitally. As an emerging technological innovation, digital assets have provided some benefits and value for some residents and businesses in the United States, and have the potential for future benefits with emerging uses.\nCrypto-assets are digital assets that are implemented using cryptographic techniques. Crypto-assets can require considerable amounts of electricity usage, which can result in greenhouse gas emissions, as well as additional pollution, noise, and other local impacts to communities living near mining facilities. Depending on the energy intensity of the technology and the sources of electricity used, the rapid growth of crypto-assets could potentially hinder broader efforts to achieve U.S. climate commitments to reach net-zero carbon pollution.\nIn March, in Executive Order 14067 on Ensuring the Responsible Development of Digital Assets, President Biden made clear that the responsible development of digital assets includes reducing negative climate impacts and environmental pollution. The Executive Order directed the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), in coordination with other federal agencies, to produce a report on the climate and energy implications of crypto-assets in the United States. OSTP assembled an interdisciplinary team of experts to assess and extend existing studies with new analysis, based on peer-reviewed studies and the best available data.\nToday, OSTP published its report, examining the challenges and opportunities of crypto-assets for the United States’ clean energy and climate change goals, and providing a set of recommendations to further study and track impacts of the sector, develop potential performance standards, and provide tools and resources to reduce negative impacts. This report’s assessment and recommendations align with federal actions that reduce greenhouse gas emissions to protect public health and welfare, grow a clean energy economy with good-paying jobs, and improve environmental justice.\nCrypto-Assets Can Be Energy-Intensive, and the United States Has a Major Crypto-Asset Sector\nFrom 2018 to 2022, annualized electricity usage from global crypto-assets grew rapidly, with estimates of electricity usage doubling to quadrupling. As of August 2022, published estimates of the total global electricity usage for crypto-assets are between 120 and 240 billion kilowatt-hours per year, a range that exceeds the total annual electricity usage of many individual countries, such as Argentina or Australia. This is equivalent to 0.4% to 0.9% of annual global electricity usage, and is comparable to the annual electricity usage of all conventional data centers in the world.\nNearly all crypto-asset electricity usage is driven by consensus mechanisms: the DLT used to mine and verify crypto-assets. The dominant consensus mechanism is called Proof of Work (PoW), which is used by the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains. Bitcoin and Ether combined represent more than 60% of total crypto-asset market capitalization. The PoW mechanism is designed to require more computing power as more entities attempt to validate transactions for coin rewards, and this feature helps disincentivize malicious actors from attacking the network. As of August 2022, Bitcoin is estimated to account for 60% to 77% of total global crypto-asset electricity usage, and Ethereum is estimated to account for 20% to 39%.\nThe energy efficiency of mining equipment has been increasing, but electricity usage continues to rise. Other less energy-intensive crypto-asset ledger technologies exist, with different attributes and uses. Switching to alternative crypto-asset technologies such as Proof of Stake could dramatically reduce overall power usage to less than 1% of today’s levels.\nThe United States is estimated to host about a third of global crypto-asset operations, which currently consume about 0.9% to 1.7% of total U.S. electricity usage. This range of electricity usage is similar to all home computers or residential lighting in the United States. Crypto-asset mining is also highly mobile. The United States currently hosts the world’s largest Bitcoin mining industry, totaling more than 38% of global Bitcoin activity, up from 3.5% in 2020. Despite the potential for rapid growth, future electricity demand from crypto-asset operations is uncertain, demonstrating the need for better data to understand and monitor electricity usage from crypto-assets.\nCrypto-Assets Can Have Significant Environmental Impacts\nGlobal electricity generation for the crypto-assets with the largest market capitalizations resulted in a combined 140 ± 30 million metric tons of carbon dioxide per year (Mt CO2/y), or about 0.3% of global annual greenhouse gas emissions. Crypto-asset activity in the United States is estimated to result in approximately 25 to 50 Mt CO2/y, which is 0.4% to 0.8% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. This range of emissions is similar to emissions from diesel fuel used in railroads in the United States.\nBesides purchased grid electricity, crypto-asset mining operations can also cause local noise and water impacts, electronic waste, air and other pollution from any direct usage of fossil-fired electricity, and additional air, water, and waste impacts associated with all grid electricity usage. These local impacts can exacerbate environmental justice issues for neighboring communities, which are often already burdened with other pollutants, heat, traffic, or noise. The growth of energy-intensive crypto-asset technologies, when not directly using clean electricity, could hinder the ability of the United States to achieve its National Determined Contribution under the Paris Agreement, and to avoid the most severe impacts of climate change. Broader adoption of crypto-assets, and the potential introduction of new types of digital assets require action by the federal government to encourage and ensure responsible development. This includes minimizing negative impacts on local communities, significantly reducing energy intensity, and powering with clean electricity.\nDistributed Ledger Technologies May Help with Climate Monitoring or Mitigation\nDLT may have a role to play in enhancing market infrastructure for a range of environmental markets like carbon credit markets, though other solutions might work as well or better. The potential benefits of DLT would need to outweigh the additional emissions and other environmental externalities that result from operations to merit broader use, relative to the markets or mechanisms that DLT displaces. Use cases are still emerging, and like all emerging technologies, there are potential positive and negative use cases yet to be imagined. Responsible development of this technology would encourage innovation in DLT applications while reducing energy intensity and minimizing environmental damages.\nKey Recommendations of the Report\nTo help the United States meet its climate objectives, crypto-asset policy during the transition to clean energy should be focused on several objectives: reduce greenhouse gas emissions, avoid operations that will increase the cost of electricity to consumers, avoid operations that reduce the reliability of electric grids, and avoid negative impacts to equity, communities, and the local environment.\nTo ensure the responsible development of digital assets, recommendations include the following actions for consideration:\n- Minimize greenhouse gas emissions, environmental justice impacts, and other local impacts from crypto-assets: The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Department of Energy (DOE), and other federal agencies should provide technical assistance and initiate a collaborative process with states, communities, the crypto-asset industry, and others to develop effective, evidence-based environmental performance standards for the responsible design, development, and use of environmentally responsible crypto-asset technologies. These should include standards for very low energy intensities, low water usage, low noise generation, clean energy usage by operators, and standards that strengthen over time for additional carbon-free generation to match or exceed the additional electricity load of these facilities. Should these measures prove ineffective at reducing impacts, the Administration should explore executive actions, and Congress might consider legislation, to limit or eliminate the use of high energy intensity consensus mechanisms for crypto-asset mining. DOE and EPA should provide technical assistance to state public utility commissions, environmental protection agencies, and the crypto-asset industry to build capacity to minimize emissions, noise, water impacts, and negative economic impacts of crypto-asset mining; and to mitigate environmental injustices to overburdened communities.\n- Ensure energy reliability: DOE, in coordination with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation and its regional entities, should conduct reliability assessments of current and projected crypto-asset mining operations on electricity system reliability and adequacy. If these reliability assessments find current or anticipated risks to the power system as a result crypto-asset mining, these entities should consider developing, updating, and enforcing reliability standards and emergency operations procedures to ensure system reliability and adequacy under the growth of crypto-asset mining.\n- Obtain data to understand, monitor, and mitigate impacts: The Energy Information Administration and other federal agencies should consider collecting and analyzing information from crypto-asset miners and electric utilities in a privacy-preserving manner to enable evidence-based decisions on the energy and climate implications of crypto-assets. Data should include mining energy usage and fuel mix, power purchase agreements, environmental justice implications, and demand response participation. OSTP could establish a National Science and Technology Council subcommittee to coordinate with other relevant agencies to assess the energy use of major crypto-assets.\n- Advance energy efficiency standards: The Administration should consider working with Congress to enable DOE and encourage other federal regulators to promulgate and regularly update energy conservation standards for crypto-asset mining equipment, blockchains, and other operations.\n- Encourage transparency and improvements in environmental performance: Crypto-asset industry associations, including mining firms and equipment manufacturers, should be encouraged to publicly report crypto-asset mining locations, annual electricity usage, greenhouse gas emissions using existing protocols, and electronic waste recycling performance.\n- Further research to improve understanding and innovation: For improved analytical capabilities that can enhance the accuracy of electricity usage estimates and sustainability, the National Science Foundation, DOE, EPA and other relevant agencies could promote and support research and development priorities that improve the environmental sustainability of digital assets, including crypto-asset impact modeling, assessment of environmental justice impacts, and understanding beneficial uses for grid management and environmental mitigation. Research and development priorities should emphasize innovations in next-generation digital asset technologies that advance U.S. goals in security, privacy, equity, and resilience, as well as U.S. climate goals."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"format_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:81122dd4-dc21-4723-bc77-830c2029c107>","<urn:uuid:c2b3e9e1-0ef3-465d-9a23-92fdbe2309a6>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What role do additives play in Chinese egg tarts versus Brazilian pão francês, and how do they affect the final product?","answer":"In Chinese egg tarts, the key additives are custard powder in the water dough and different combinations of butter and/or shortening in the oil dough, with butter providing better taste but requiring more careful temperature control. For Brazilian pão francês, the additives are more extensive and technical, including oxidizing agents, amylases, xylanases, hemicellulases, and emulsifiers like DATEM, SSL, and uniquely, polysorbate. These additives help standardize flour performance from different wheat sources and are crucial for achieving the characteristic light, fluffy crumb and crispy crust of the Brazilian rolls.","context":["Chinese flaky egg tarts recipe\nPrior to baking, I did a lot of research on various ingredients, methods and techniques, by reading different recipes posted by bloggers and watching several youtube videos to familiarize with folding techniques of the dough. Technique is pretty much similar, adopting 3x3x4 (i.e. roll dough flat, fold into 3 folds, roll dough flat, fold into 3 folds again and finally roll dough flat, fold into 4 folds).\nHowever, in terms of ingredients, different proportions, types and even the temperature of baking. So in the end, I decided to adapt the one from the workshop because I remember it was very good, but I did some changes along the way as well.\nAnd so like I mentioned, there are 2 doughs used, the oil dough and water dough. Water dough is pretty straightforward, just combine all the ingredients to form a dough. As for the oil dough, some recipes use flour + butter, some use butter only, some use flour + shortening + butter, some use lard. I've come across one recipe that uses flour + butter + vegetable oil (featured in magazine without any reference), not sure if it's really doable.\nThe recipe I learned from the workshop uses flour + shortening + butter. The advantage of using shortening is it's more stable than butter (melts more slowly). So when you are rolling and folding the layers, the dough doesn't melt/break/fall apart that easily and you can achieve the 3x3x4 folding at one go. Whereas, if you use flour + butter, in between the folds, you have to chill the dough (15-20 mins), else the skin of the dough breaks easily.\nThis was my very first attempt. I decided to use flour + butter for my oil dough. coz I was reluctant to use shortening. Being inexperienced and the hot and humid weather didn't help, the skin of my oil dough broke during the first fold and it became very messy as butter leaked everywhere (top, bottom, sides). Other problems like the cookie cutter I used to cut each piece of tart dough was too small, I filled too much egg filling etc. So it looked quite ugly and didn't taste crispy (a bit hard).\nFor my second attempt, I made half recipe using flour + shortening + butter for the oil dough, and another half recipe using flour + butter.\nI wanted the flaky layers to look more visible (round cutter cannot achieve that) so I went to buy a set of fluted cookie cutters.\nEgg tart looked slightly better, but still filled too much egg custard filling; cookie cutter used still too short (I want to create more height in order to make the layers more visible) and temperature of baking too high.\nIn terms of taste, the one that used butter won hands-down. It was buttery and very fragrant, whereas the one that added shortening tasted quite flat.\nAnd so, my third attempt, I decided to give the flour + butter dough another chance (skip shortening altogether). I made sure I chilled the oil dough sufficiently in between, dust the work surface properly with each fold, used a larger cutter to stamp each tart, filled the egg filling to about 70-75%, baked at lower temperature (staggered temperature control). All in all, the key ingredient was patience (because our weather is very humid and butter melts very easily). It was a long drawn process indeed.\nI guess my patience got rewarded and the egg tart turned out so much better looking! It was so flaky that pieces of tart fell all over the place as I was biting into the tart\nI also tested the egg custard filling with 2 different recipes, 1 using evaporated milk and another using fresh milk. In the end, the one using fresh milk turned out slightly better, more creamy and smooth.\nHong Kong Flaky Egg Tart\n- Recipe yields 8 tarts\n- 4cm base tart casing (measures 6cm from the top)\n- 9cm fluted cookie cutter\n- 100g Plain Flour, sifted\n- 160g Unsalted Butter, cubed and keep in chiller until use\n- 20g Bread Flour, sifted\n- 60g Plain Flour, sifted\n- 5g Custard Powder, sifted\n- 10g Egg\n- 40g Iced Water\nFilling (Option 1 - Fresh Milk)\n- 100g Fresh Milk\n- 50g Caster Sugar\n- 2 Eggs\n- 1 drop Vanilla Extract\nFilling (Option 2 - Evaporated Milk)\n- 40g Evaporate Milk\n- 100g Sugar Syrup (made using 100g water + 50g sugar)\n1. Make the oil dough. Combine the flour and cold cubed butter in a large bowl. Use pastry cutter to press the butter into the flour until it forms a rough dough. Alternatively, use electric blender and pulse the mixture until rough dough forms. Work quickly so that butter do not melt.\n2. Place the dough on a piece of clingwrap and wrap it up into a small rectangle parcel (about 10cm x 15cm). Chill in fridge for 30 mins.\n3. Make water dough. Combine all the ingredients into an electric mixer, and blend until a dough forms. Knead for 5 mins until dough is smooth (texture feels like ear-lobe). Mold into a rough oval shape, wrap in clingwrap and chill for 20 mins.\n4. Take both water dough and oil dough out from the fridge. Dust the work surface with flour so that the dough will not stick to the work surface. Remove clingwrap (keep it aside). Roll the water dough into a large oval, make sure it has sufficient space allowance for the oil dough to be enclosed within. Place the oil dough in the middle of the water dough.\n5. Wrap the water dough like a parcel, encasing the oil dough, make sure no oil dough is exposed at the seams.\n6. Slightly flatten/roll the combined dough, dust with some flour top and below and wrap the dough in clingwrap. Chill in the fridge for 20 mins.\n7. Retrieve the dough from the fridge. Dust the work surface and rolling pin with flour. Remove clingwrap (set aside), dust top and bottom of dough with flour. Roll the dough into half inch thickness in rectangle shape. Fold one side towards the centre (as shown).\n8. Fold the other side towards centre. You will have 3 layers. Dust with flour all around. Wrap in clingwrap and chill in fridge for 20 mins. This is round 1 of folding. (We will do 3x3x4)\n9. Repeat step 7.\n10. Repeat step 8. This is round 2 of folding.\n11. Retrieve the dough from the fridge. Dust the work surface and rolling pin with flour. Make sure to dust a larger surface area. Remove clingwrap (set aside), dust top and bottom of dough with flour. Roll the dough into half inch thickness in rectangle shape. Fold left and right sides towards the centre (as shown).\n12. Fold one side of dough towards centre again. You will see 4 layers now. This is round 3 and final round of folding. Dust with flour, clingwrap and chill in fridge for 20 mins.\n13. Retrieve dough from fridge. Dust work surface and rolling pin with flour. Place dough on work surface, dust with flour. Roll the dough flat into 0.5cm thickness. Use cookie cutter to stamp the dough into individual tart shells.\n14. Wrap tart base using clingwrap (separate each layer) and chill in fridge for 15 mins. *At this point you could freeze the tart base for subsequent use.\n15. Retrieve tart base from the fridge. Mold each piece into the tart casing, pressing down the dough towards the sides and bottom of the casing. Avoid touching the top part (perforated) else pattern will not be visible after baking. As you can see, I'm using a larger cookie cutter because I want to create height for the egg tart without having to \"push\" the base upwards (like some recipes do). Poke some holes in the tart base using a fork gently (not too hard else egg filling will leak). Chill tart base in fridge for 15 mins. Preheat oven at 220 degree celsius.\n16. Prepare egg filling. Combine all ingredients of egg filling, make sure sugar is fully dissolved. Sieve the egg filling 2 times. Once tart base is ready, pour the egg filling into each tart to about 70-75%.\n17. Place tray of egg tarts at the bottom most rack. Bake at 200 degree celsius for 15 mins. After 15 mins, bake at 180 degree celsius for 10 mins. After 10 mins, slightly open the oven door, slip a cloth or oven mitt by the door and let egg tart bake in residual heat for another 10 mins.\n18. After 10 mins, remove the tray from the oven and let egg tarts cool slightly before removing the tarts from the casing.\nThe ones on the left were filled with evaporated milk egg filling and the ones on the right were filled with fresh milk egg filling. Our family preferred the fresh milk egg filling.\nThe egg tarts are best served warm. They remain crispy for a couple of hours in the open. If not consumed immediately it's best to keep them covered in the fridge. To re-heat, I just pop them into air-fryer or oven for a few mins and they will become crispy again!watermark at cityview cityview financial cityview church vancouver the cityview hong kong tripadvisor cityview place apartments reviews cityview magazine knoxville tn cityview best of the best knoxville augusta at cityview apartments 77060 cityview yau ma tei the cityview hong kong kowloon cityview at longwood reviews cityview boon keng floor plan fort worth hyatt place cityview cityview trolley key west fl cityview facebook cityview squash camp cityview band - echame mi la culpa cityview cooperative website loc: skyview way at cityview way san francisco ca us cityview key west trolley tour breckenridge at cityview, 535 seminar dr, houston, tx 77060 cityview on soco sausalito at cityview cityview tv & computer, inc. reviews cityview the band cityview atlanta cityview number cityview at longwood the vantage at cityview cityview apartments ithaca rosemont cityview apartments cityview animal hospital fort worth altitude cityview cityview apartments kansas city homewood suites fort worth cityview cityview sf cityview best of des moines 2021 cityview des moines iowa cityview senior tower biscayne at cityview apartments cityview philadelphia pa cityview fort worth tx cityview at longwood boston cityview target fort worth cityview hop-on hop-off boston trolley sightseeing tour cityview trolly tours boston cityview on meridian reviews cityview at soco apartments cityview net 16803 cityview place houston tx 311 cityview boulevard cityview at riverwalk prices cityview trolley tours of historic boston hyatt place fort worth cityview hotel cityview centre fort worth cityview lofts kansas city mo cityview lanes in fort worth cityview hospital fort worth","Brazilian cuisine is a reflection of the country’s multicultural population. Depending on the region, eating habits have been shaped by indigenous, European, African or Creole influences. But different as culinary tastes may be among the 212 million inhabitants, there is surprising agreement when it comes to a particular bakery product: Brazilians love pão francês — a light-colored, yeast-raised wheat roll characterized by a tender, flaky crust and a fluffy crumb.\nThese cylindrical rolls are a central feature of meals, especially breakfast. Most Brazilians start the day with cafézino, a strong, sweet espresso, and a crispy pão francês that they spread just with butter or margarine. Those who prefer a more substantial meal fry the halved rolls in a pan with butter to make “pão na chapa.”\nFor midday lunch, the roll is served with soups, stews or salads. And in the evening, with a circle of friends in a restaurant, the Brazilians like to dip into the breadbasket and soak up the sauces from the lavish meat and fish dishes with pão francês.\nMost important sales driver\nBecause freshness has top priority in the purchase of rolls, private households and restaurant owners mostly buy what they need from a total of some 64,000 small- and medium-sized artisan bakeries that are a familiar part of the street scene in Brazil. For these businesses, pão francês is generally the main sales driver and the most important item in their product range.\nCustomers’ expectations in respect of their favorite rolls are clearly defined: the pão francês must have a light, fluffy crumb, a tender, flaky, wafer-thin crust with a pale brown color, a mild taste and a wide split. The weight is between 50 and 60 grams.\nSince the cylindrical rolls are baked close together in the oven, their ends meet as the dough rises. After cooling, these “snakes” of bread are broken apart at the joints to reveal the white, fine-textured crumb. This specific appearance is another feature consumers expect.\nQuality reference for pão francês\nMany bakeries advertise their French bread as the hallmark of their trade. Nevertheless, problems with quality and standardization often occur, sometimes because of a shortage of qualified workers.\nTo offer the industry practical help in improving its production methods, the Brazilian standardization committee ABNT (Associação Brasileira de Normas Técnicas) has developed recommendations for the production of pão francês. Since 2013, the technical standard “ABNT NBR 16170” has specified criteria for evaluating and classifying French bread. Shape, size, properties of the crust, color, crumb structure, shred, odor, flavor… every detail of a perfect pão francês is described precisely in these guidelines. Although the standard is not binding, the initiators hope it will help to ensure that “French rolls” are of uniform, defined quality in all corners of the country.\nPolysorbate as an emulsifier\nIf the rolls are to be light and fluffy inside and have a thin, crisp crust, the flour used must guarantee suitable baking performance. To reconcile quality with economy in the grinding process, the mills generally combine cheaper domestic wheat lots with higher-performance imported wheat. In the past it was the Mercosur countries Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay that played the most important role, but countries like Russia, Ukraine and other Black Sea countries also have become established trading partners.\nTo standardize flours made up of very different wheat varieties and regions of origin, it is established practice in Brazil to treat the flour with enzymes and additives. The products used include oxidizing agents, amylases, xylanases, hemicellulases and emulsifying additives like DATEM and SSL. A peculiarity of Brazilian food law is the approval of polysorbate, a high-performance emulsifier that has a particularly strong effect on the gas retention capacity and stability of a dough. The additive azodicarbonamide (ADA) is also a much-used improver in Brazil. However, in comparison with other South American countries that permit a dosage of up to 45 ppm, the maximum quantity allowed in Brazil is lower, at 40 ppm.\nEnsuring firm doughs\nBesides a suitable flour, the making-up process for the dough is an important factor for the quality of pão francês. Even at the smallest artisan bakeries it is usual to have a special mechanical roll shaper to replace laborious manual rounding and molding.\nAfter mixing and kneading, the dough is left to ferment only for a short time before processing continues mechanically. On a feeder conveyor belt, the dough pieces are pressed automatically and pass through various roller systems with decreasing gap widths. This results in thin, portioned sheets of dough that are rolled up tightly by several deflectors.\nThe bakers only have to intervene to give the rolled dough portions a finishing touch to their appearance. The loaded proofing trays are then placed in the proofing chamber at a temperature of about 30°C and a relative humidity of 80%.\nThe “French mini-loaves” are baked for about 20 minutes at 200°C to 220°C after being scored lengthwise to create the split.\nFor many Brazilian consumers, the price and freshness of the rolls are still the most important criteria for buying. But generally speaking, the bakeries are noticing increasing expectations on the part of their customers. Fewer consumers are willing to tolerate fluctuations in appearance or taste. On the contrary, there is a demand for high and consistent product quality. Since it is sometimes only necessary to make small adjustments to the recipe or production method to enhance the appearance and sensory properties of pão francês, here is an overview of the most common mistakes made in production, with suggestions for avoiding them:\nProblem: Low bread volume.\nPossible causes: Fermentation time too short; too little yeast; unsuitable flour with too little enzymatic activity.\nSolutions: Prolong the fermentation time of the dough; use more yeast; use suitable flour; increase or adjust flour treatment (Alphamalt VC 5000, Alphamalt HCC 2).\nProblem: Inadequate shred/bloom.\nPossible causes: Fermentation time too long; dough temperature too high; flour too weak; too little enzyme activity.\nSolutions: Shorten the fermentation time; use cold water; use more steam in the oven; increase humidity in the fermentation chamber; use more oxidizing agent (OXEM, Elco P-100); add more enzyme improvers (Alphamalt EFX Mega, Alphamalt H 19480).\nProblem: Dark crust, soft crumb.\nPossible causes: Enzymatic activity too high; oven too hot; baking time too long.\nSolutions: Use wheat flour with lower enzymatic activity; add less alpha-amylase (Alphamalt VC 5000) to the flour; set the oven to a lower temperature; shorten the baking time.\nProblem: Holes in the crumb.\nPossible causes: Flour too weak; doughs too warm; fermentation chamber too warm; too much yeast; mixing and resting times too long.\nSolutions: Use stronger flour; use cold water; set a lower temperature in the fermentation chamber; use less yeast, shorten processing times; adjust flour treatment (use Mulgaprime 10, Alphamalt Gloxy TGO, Alphamalt EFX Mega).\nProblem: Not enough crispiness.\nPossible causes: Dough too firm; flour too weak; baking temperature too low; doughs too dry and bucky; too little enzymatic activity.\nSolutions: Use stronger flour; set the oven to a higher temperature; increase the amount of liquid in the recipe; adjust the enzymatic activity (Increase the flour treatment (Alphamalt GA 23750, Deltamalt FN, Mulgaprime 10).\nProblem: Pale, white crust.\nPossible causes: Fermentation chamber too dry; fermentation time too long; oven temperature too low; baking time too short; too little enzymatic activity.\nSolutions: Increase humidity in the fermentation chamber; reduce the fermentation time; set the oven to a higher temperature; prolong the baking time; add more alpha-amylase to the flour (Alphamalt VC 5000, Alphamalt GA 23750, Deltamalt FN).\nProblem: Blistered crust.\nPossible causes: Flour too weak; incorrect machine setting; fermentation time too long; doughs too soft; fermentation chamber too warm.\nSolutions: Use stronger flour; increase the pressure of the dough molding machine; shorten the fermentation time; reduce the amount of liquid in the recipe; reduce the temperature in the fermentation chamber.\nA Brazilian product with a hint of France\nNo Brazilian consumer expects a traditional French baguette when buying pão francês. The misleading name, which means “French bread,” is thought to have originated in the early 20th century, when the upper classes of Brazil took pleasure in visiting far-off destinations in Europe, especially France. Upon their return, the travelers gave their bakers rapturous descriptions of the delicious bread they had enjoyed in Paris. The typical loaves in France at that time were short and cylindrical, with a firm crumb and a golden-brown crust. They were forerunners of the baguette, which did not acquire its characteristic elongated shape until later. Following these descriptions, Brazilian bakers tried to imitate this European speciality. What emerged was a new bakery product in its own right; it was destined to become an unprecedented bestseller, known as “pão de sal” (salt bread), “cacetinho” (stick bread), “pão careca“ (bare bread) or “filão” (snake bread), according to the region.\nSven Mattutat is a product manager with Mühlenchemie.

{"question":"How does White Nose Syndrome affect bat behavior during hibernation, and what are the mortality rates observed in North American bat populations?","answer":"White Nose Syndrome causes bats to become prematurely active during hibernation, making them burn up their fat stores that are needed to survive the winter. This unnatural behavior can lead to starvation or freezing to death. Regarding mortality rates, the impact has been devastating in North America, with mortality rates approaching 100 percent at some sites. Specifically, certain species have been hit particularly hard, including the northern long-eared bat, the little brown bat, and the tri-colored bat. While the fungus has also been found in bats of Europe and Asia, the infection is not as destructive to bat populations on those continents as it is in North America.","context":["BAT HABITAT INVERVENTIONS: CONFRONTING ECOLOGICAL SECURITIES IN THE GREAT LAKES REGION\nA survey of the websites and promotional literature for several major parks in the Great Lakes region reveal frequent mention of certain animals. Deer, snakes, bears, wolves, moose, birds, and fish surface reoccurringly, yet other animals of ecological significance are seldom mentioned[i]. Often left out of public acknowledgement is the bat. Admittedly, for the casual observer of nature or even the curious eco-tourist, it is quite difficult to rest one’s gaze upon a bat due to their nature as small, fast, and nocturnal creatures. Even scientists who study bats have had difficulty collecting precise data about them through observation with the naked eye and have recently been developing observation techniques via mediating technologies. For example, Dr. Thomas Kunz, Professor of Biology at Boston University, has pioneered the use of thermal imaging devices in studying bat ecology and behavior[ii]. Perhaps it is because of the bat’s elusiveness that tourists rarely include them on their checklist of animals to see.\nThe physical characteristics and behavior of bats, however, only partially explain their relative ‘invisibility.’ Arguably, it is also due to the public’s lack of desire to see them. Given the number of fictional tales that vilify the bat – along with exaggerated reports of rabid bat bites – it could be said that their presence conjures notions of fear in the public imagination. This could begin to suggest why a massive ecological crisis such as the rapid spread of White Nose Syndrome – a disease which has been causing bats to die in massive numbers since 2006—has hardly shaken our public conscience.\nFirst spotted in upstate eastern New York in 2006, White Nose Syndrome is a condition in which white fungus grows on bats and prematurely awakens them during hibernation, hypothetically causing them to starve or freeze to death.[iii] It has relentlessly killed a very high percentage of bats in northeastern United States, with “mortality rates approaching 100 percent … reported at some sites,” according to Bat Conservation International.[iv] Since 2009, the disease has started to invade the Great Lakes region (fig. 1)[v], with confirmed cases already in Western New York, Western Pennsylvania, Ontario, and Quebec. Scientists are still rushing to find a solution. In the meantime, caves and mines are being closed to the public, in efforts to slow down the spread of the fungus. [vi]\nSo what would happen if the Great Lakes region began losing its bat populations in great numbers? Would bats simply become other endangered species on a list of many? The under-acknowledged reality is that bats play a critical role in ensuring the ecological, health, and economic securities of the region. In agriculture, for example, they are natural predators of crop-damaging insects. A massively reduced bat population would begin to affect the status of food security in the region. As a predator of mosquitoes, bats also play a role in preventing the spread of diseases carried by mosquitoes. Although the majority of North America is currently not under pressure to contend with diseases such as Malaria and Yellow Fever, scientists and ecologists who are researching vector-borne diseases have found that areas around the Great Lakes have an environmental “risk factor” that is as high as other locations where these diseases are thriving. For example, according to a series of maps produced by the Spatial Ecology and Epidemiology Research Group, University of Oxford, Department of Zoology (fig. 2)[vii], the vicinities around Lake Ontario and part of Lake Erie— in terms of an array of environmental conditions such as climate—are ripe for welcoming Japanese Encephalitis, a sometimes-fatal disease transmitted by mosquito bites, detected mostly in Southeast Asia. In the realms of both agricultural production and mosquito abatement, the rapid disappearance of bats would most probably spur an increased use of pesticides. Considering the possible declination of agricultural security, the rise in disease risk, and the threat of intensified pesticide use, one can speculate that the region’s health, and therefore economic security, could be at stake.\nThese kinds of security risks have not gone unnoticed by several government agencies, non-profit organizations, and the science community. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and Bat Conservation International, for example, have been awarding various research grants and holding symposiums to address the White Nose Syndrome crisis.[viii] Yet, despite recent attention, this current ecological disaster is arguably still unknown to the much of the general public. Bats, and their significance to our ecosystems of security, still remain relatively unnoticed by a more collective public conscience.\nTo bring these issues further into public consciousness, one could intensify a strategy of fear by underscoring their potentially dire consequences (as I’ve briefly done in the last paragraphs). It is also possible, however, to take another direction and consider a strategy that instead illuminates potential desires. The logics of agriculture and mosquito abatement, for example, not only indicate a need to address crop damage and disease spread, but also pertain to possibilities of tapping into more pleasure-oriented notions of food, recreation, and leisure. After all, in a region that abounds with waterside recreation (and even more potential waterside recreation), the presence of mosquitoes can often ruin otherwise extraordinary experiences. An increase in organic farming strategies — such as including bats as part of a pest control plan — could only begin to intensify the already rich culture of food in the region. In this light, bats also play a significant role in the region’s ecologies of leisure. To invite their presence, then, also underscores the desire to consider the Great Lakes coast as a place for cultural enjoyment.\nClearly, in advocating for bat survival (and proliferation), the role of architects is not the same as the role of scientists. Architects generally do not possess the expertise to meticulously study fungus and systematically track animal health, but they do have the ability to create alternative habitats that can shape a collective attitude toward bats. A question designers might ask is: Rather than focusing only on ways of preventing tourists from entering mines and caves, why not think about how to construct habitats that can, in their own right, exist as cultural attractions and therefore increase public interest in bats? Several examples come to mind in considering this question. In Austin, Texas, crowds gather each evening to watch approximately 1.5 million Mexican free-tail bats emerge from under the Congress Bridge. A host of profit-generating recreational activities have stemmed from the public desire to witness this spectacle, including bat-watching cruises, kayaking tours, bicycle tours, and even segway tours.[ix] As another example, a series of 40-foot tall bat towers initially developed by Dr. Charles Campbell in the 1920s now stand as historic monuments and tourist attractions in Texas and Florida. Currently, there is even an effort by the City of Temple Terrace, Florida and the Temple Terrace Preservation Society to reconstruct a tower that was destroyed by arsonists in 1979.[x] A contemporary example is “Animal Wall,” an enormous wall installation designed by artist Gitta Gschwendtner, and built at the boundary between a residential housing tower and a public riverside path in Cardiff Bay, United Kingdom[xi]. While it is true that many smaller, more discreet, and less expensive bat houses are perfectly functional and have successfully attracted bats, they also have a tendency to innocuously blend into the background, thereby furthering the ‘invisibility’ of bats. The projects that I’ve mentioned resist this lack of visibility by intensifying their public presence through the consideration of site, scale, and performance.\nIt is along these lines that we are currently developing a series of large-scale bat habitation projects that will take on various programs, forms, and materials depending on their installation sites. The first full-scale prototype building, titled “Bat Tower” has been installed near Buffalo, New York, in Griffis Sculpture Park, a 400 acre nature preserve with over 250 sculptures in fields, trails, forests, and ponds[xii]. In the setting of a popularly-visited sculpture park, Bat Tower stands as a kind of monument, perhaps even an unexpected spectacle in the midst of an otherwise serene pondside location. At one level, the project is a prototype to test several conditions: first, how bats will react to and inhabit the structure (to date, two months after completing its installation, bats have already been spotted flying out of tower at dusk), and second, how the structure will hold up in the extreme climate of Western New York. Yet, as a large, sculptural tower, the project could also be understood as a prototype to test the logics of tourism and its effects on ecological advocacy. How will it impact its visitors? Will it make a difference for the many schoolchildren who tour the sculpture park each year? Can it operate as a kind of performative advertisement, as a proof-of-concept for organizations, municipalities, or individuals who might be interested in building larger-scale bat habitation projects?\nAt this point, you may be wondering: how did this article begin with White Nose Syndrome’s potential impact on ecological securities in the Great Lakes Region and reach a point of discussion about architectural prototypes as a form of advertisement? Quite simply, the role of the prototype in this case is not only to serve as a reproducible object, but more significantly, to act as an instigator for further action. For municipalities, parks, institutions, scientists, and others who are currently researching ways of tackling White Nose Syndrome and bat conservation in general, the functioning prototype begins to open up more possibilities in terms of how they might apply their research toward the natural and built world. For architects and designers, the project aims to generate interest in collaborating with the science community in a continuing effort to introduce experiential dimensions to otherwise aspatial procedures of problem-solving. Lastly, the prototype’s constructed existence and visual presence will (hopefully) entice citizens to consider alternative ways of addressing ‘pest control’ issues. Rather than exterminating bats – and further contributing to the ecological crisis—the project asks: how can we confront our fear of ‘pests’ by creating situations of wonder? Through architectural interventions, we are taking a step toward developing a strategy of conflating our concerns for ecological security with our desires for recreation and pleasure[xiii].\n[i] Bruce Peninsula National Parks of Canada (http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/pn-np/on/bruce/natcul/natcul2.aspx, accessed August 20, 2010) mentions common sightings of: chipmunks, squirrels, raccoons, porcupines, snowshoe hares, skunks, white-tailed deer, snakes, and frogs.

It is caused by the fungus known as Pseudogymnoas destructans (PD) and it is recognized as a white fuzz that is growing on the snouts and faces of certain bat species (hence how it got its’ name). It will grow on the bare skin of their faces when they are in hibernation because they are inactive, and this allows for the fungus to take hold. It changes the way that bats behave, and it will make them active during times when they, naturally, shouldn’t be. This unnatural behavior will cause them to burn up the fat stores they have built up in order to survive hibernation and if they use those stores up too soon, they can die.\nAn Epidemic For Bat Populations\nIt has destroyed bat populations in North America, some sites have seen a mortality rate between 90 and 100% of the bats. The species who seem to be feeling the worst effects of this infection are the northern long-eared bat, the little brown bat, and the tri-colored (or eastern Pipistrelle) bat. There are other species who have been seen with this infection, but they are not facing the illness and mortality rates of the three listed here.\nIt has been found in bats of Europe and Asia, but this infection is not as destructive to the populations on these continents as it is to those in North America. It was unknown to scientists until the recent past.\nWhere did it come from?\nCave explorers first took pictures of bats in 2006 in upstate New York that had the white fuzz growing on their faces. It was first seen by scientists in 2007 in caves near Albany, NY. They found sick and dying bats as a result of white-nose syndrome. It is not exactly known where it comes from, but it is suspected that people are to blame for this problem.\nThe fungus grows in cold, damp caves and the spores are able to survive a long time on the clothes and outdoor equipment of people. People most likely carried the fungus into the habitats of these bats and the fungus was able to take hold easily. It has been found that people are not able to contract the illness, but they are likely to be the catalyst that caused the epidemic.\nWhat is being done?\nThis fungus is spreading quickly amongst the bat populations of the United States and Canada. The rapid spreading can be contributed to bat to bat contact but this fungus can occur in nature so it is possible that they get it from the environment.

{"question":"What's the minimum trunk height required for commercial value in both Mukau and Black Walnut trees? Looking to compare merchantable specs.","answer":"For Black Walnut trees, the minimum merchantable height required for lumber and veneer is 8 to 10 feet. For Mukau trees, a clean bole (trunk without branches) of 5 meters (16 ft) is required for timber production. Quality lumber and veneer trees of Black Walnut typically need merchantable heights several times the minimum requirement.","context":["Drip-Irrigation and Mulching of Seedlings\nEconomic and efficient watering can be done by drip-irrigation. Water basins are filled with water during rainy season and used as drip-irrigation throughout the dry season. In the field, we use our labor force to water each seedling individually. In Nyongoro, we use natural depressions that are deepened with the bulldozer to create water reservoirs, which are filled with water during the rainy season and act in the same capacity as the water basins.\nThe seedlings must also be mulched to protect the underlying soil from drying and heating up. This way, the young root system will be protected. Generally, the mulching is done with dry grass or weeds which needs to be repeated every three months, because termites consume the mulch. The mulching diminishes the heat of the soil by about 2 Celsius degrees. The use of half-moons around the trees are to retain water. When the trees are young, we water them once a week.\nIn the pictures below, we see Mrs. Ivuli, head teacher of Thua Primary School in Kitui County, and some students with their trees. This is part of our tree donation program for schools in cooperation with the Green Initiative Challenge. Each child is responsible for their own tree and has their name on it. Note the grass around the young tree and the half-moon shape on the ground that is made for the water to retain. These are simple but effective methods to increase the survival skills for the tree seedling during its first year.\nThere are different techniques for retaining water. Below is an experiment we did with water box. The experiment was not conclusive.\nOther common techniques to retain water is to dig ditches in a terrain where the water flows downhill and causes erosion and damage to crops and seedlings. Here is one of our contract farmers who uses ditches to retain the water and to avoid flooding during rainy season. The soil will have moisture for the trees for a long time and the water filled ditches will work more like a drip irrigation system.\nThe final objective is to produce logs for timber, out of stems that have a diameter of over 40 centimeters (16\") and a clean bole (without branches) of 5 meters (16 ft). Several operations are important here: planting, spacing, protection/weeding, pruning and thinning.\nThis is the distance between the pits. Mukau needs full sunlight for its development. The minimum spacing should be 4 meters (13 ft), although complete agroforestry practices require a spacing of 7 to 10 meters (23-33 ft). Initial growth is fast and soon the branches of neighboring trees start competing with each other, and then the growth slows down. At a spacing of 4 meters, this competition sets in after 4 to 5 years and thinning is needed.\nWeeding is essential for survival and fast initial growth. Grasses and herbs can kill the seedlings. Apart from that, the weeds compete for the same scarce moisture that the roots of the seedlings need.\nBecause of drought, villagers have problems getting enough grass for their livestock, while we have enough grass and weeds we want to get rid of. This works perfectly for both the villagers and Better Globe Forestry. We organize locals so they can cut grass between our trees and we have had up to 200 people at the same time cutting grass for their livestock. This is also part of our CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) to make good contact with our neighbors. We allow some schools that have cattle to grass around our older trees (as well as our own donkeys), which cannot be damaged by animals compare to our seedlings or young trees.\nPruning of Trees\nThe objective of pruning is to obtain a clean bole of up to 5 meters (16 ft) height, with all pruning scars confined to a central cylinder within this bole of a maximum of 10 centimeters (4 inches) in diameter. This can be achieved through a regular pruning schedule of about 10 prunings during the first four years of growth. In this way, first rate timber clean of knots can be produced. It is a delicate operation. The tools and timing are important. For tools, secateurs and pruning saws are recommended, later in combination with ladders.\nDuring the first months after planting, farmers traditionally pinch off buds and cut off small branches so that they can see a stem emerging and not a bush. Thus, the young tree often becomes top-heavy, and bends over even under a moderate gust of wind, as its stem is not thick and strong enough. Therefore, we recommend almost no pruning during the first five to six months, up to a height of 1.5 – 2 meters (5 - 6.5 ft).\nEven afterwards, only light pruning should be done to encourage the formation of a sturdy thick stem. This light pruning should be selective, meaning only thick branches (over 1 inch) and double leaders should be cut off, while smaller branches can stay to provide more photosynthesis or growing power.\nThe objective of thinning is to cut small and bad looking trees, providing the better ones with enough space to grow. This is an operation that starts after five years if the trees were planted at a spacing of 4 by 4 meters (13x13 ft). It is repeated once or twice in the following years, always when the branches of neighboring trees start touching and competing for space.\nMukau trees can grow over 15 meters (50 ft) high. Some rare trees show stem diameters of up to 50 centimeters (20\"). It can attain those dimensions by 20 years of age. This final product in all its beauty is a high-quality mahogany tree that is excellent for use in furniture, flooring, interior paneling etc. Our customers who patiently waited for the profit from the trees can finally harvest their green gold. The trees that are cut will be replaced by new seedlings that will grow and keep the land green and protected.","Urban Walnut Trees: Are They Valuable?\nby Don Janssen, Extension Educator\nReports of black walnut trees being sold for hundreds or even thousands of dollars often cause homeowners to dream of huge profits from selling their backyard walnut trees. Unfortunately, while good quality walnut trees are often quite valuable, walnut trees grown in an urban setting usually are not. Only an exceptionally large, high quality, urban grown walnut or group of walnut trees would interest a timber or veneer buyer.\nBlack walnut (Juglans nigra) has long been used for fine furniture, gun stocks, bowls and novelties because of its beautiful grain, color and the ease with which it can be worked. Good quality walnut logs are cut into lumber; the best are sliced into veneer.\nSeveral key characteristics determine the value of a black walnut tree for timber or veneer-including trunk diameter, merchantable height and how free the trunk is from defects. While walnut buyers will occasionally purchase small trees, particularly if they are part of a group of trees being sold, trees less than 15 inches in diameter are of comparatively little value. Quality lumber and veneer trees generally have diameters of 18 inches or more.\nA tree's diameter is measured 4 1/2 feet above the ground. It can be determined by measuring the circumference with a tape or string and dividing the circumference by 3.14.\nThe length of tree trunk that can be used for lumber or veneer is called its merchantable height. In black walnut and other hardwoods, merchantable height is usually the trunk height to major branches or forking. Minimum merchantable height for lumber and veneer black walnut trees is 8 to 10 feet. Quality lumber and veneer trees will have merchantable heights several times this height.\nThe quality of a hardwood tree is measured by how free its trunk is from defects such as crookedness, limbs, scars, swellings, bumps, cracks, holes, insect or disease damage, and wounds. Other factors being equal, the fewer the defects, the more valuable the tree.\nUnfortunately, most urban walnut trees do not display the characteristics of high quality marketable trees. Urban walnuts often grow in open areas without surrounding trees. This results in trees with short trunks and numerous branches-little or no merchantable height. They are also more likely to have been struck by lightning or injured by human activities than trees grown in the woods. Even urban walnut trees that appear suitable as lumber or veneer trees usually are avoided by buyers because of the risk that they contain objects such as nails, wire, insulators, clothes line hooks, etc., which would damage saw blades or veneer knives.\nThe combination of poor quality, high risk of embedded objects and potentially difficult logging results in most urban walnut trees being of little interest to timber or veneer buyers. This does not mean that buyers would not be interested in an urban walnut that had a 30-inch diameter trunk, 32 feet of merchantable height in a straight trunk that was virtually free from visible defects, located in the middle of a large backyard away from any utilities or buildings. Unfortunately, there are very few such trees.\nUniversity of Nebraska-Lincoln Extension in Lancaster County is your on-line yard and garden educational resource.

Their bioavailability can be affected by first-pass metabolism before reaching adequate plasma levels. In contrast, local anesthetics have distinct metabolic pathways - esters are rapidly hydrolyzed by plasma pseudocholinesterase giving a short half-life, while amides are metabolized more slowly in the liver with a 2-3 hour half-life.

The size of the resting potential can vary, but in excitable cells it is about –70 millivolts (mV).\nWhat determines the resting potential of a nerve cell?\nThe resting potential arises from two activities:\n1. The sodium/potassium ATPase, which moves three sodium ions outside the cell for every two potassium ions inside the cell and produces a net loss of positive charges and results in a negative intracellular charge.\n2. Facilitated diffusion of potassium outside the cell.\nDescribe the ionic relations in the cell for sodium, potassium, chloride, and calcium ions.\n1. The sodium/potassium ATPase produces:\na. A concentration of Na+ outside the cell that is some 10 times greater than that inside the cell.\nb. A concentration of K+ inside the cell some 20 times greater than that outside the cell\n2. The concentrations of chloride ions (Cl–) and calcium ions (Ca2+) are maintained at greater levels outside the cell.\nDescribe the depolarization of a nerve cell membrane.\nBefore an action potential can be formed, the nerve cell membrane is depolarized by either a mechanical stimulus (sound, stretch, etc.) or a neurotransmitter (e.g., acetylcholine). This allows the facilitated diffusion of sodium into the cell, which reduces the resting potential at that area on the cell and creates an excitatory postsynaptic potential or EPSP.\nIf the initial depolarization stimulus reaches a threshold voltage of −50 mV, then an action potential will be generated from that area of the cell membrane. This opens hundreds of voltage-gated sodium channels and creates a massive influx of sodium. The sudden complete depolarization of the membrane opens up more of the voltage-gated sodium channels in adjacent portions of the membrane. In this way, a wave of depolarization sweeps along the cell. This is the action potential, or nerve impulse.\nWhy is the action potential an all-or-nothing event?\nIf the critical threshold of a −50 mV membrane depolarization is reached, then an action potential will be produced, if not, then no action potential will result. Strong stimuli produce no stronger action potentials than weak ones.\nHow is membrane repolarization reestablished?\n1. Diffusion of potassium ions out of the cell.\n2. Closure of sodium channels.\nWhat is the refractory period?\nA second stimulus applied to a neuron less than 0.001 second after the first will not trigger another impulse. The membrane is depolarized, and the neuron is in its refractory period. Not until the −70 mV polarity is reestablished will the neuron be ready to fire again.\nHow long does the refractory period last?\nVaries in some human neurons the refractory period lasts only 0.001 to 0.002 seconds. This means that the neuron can transmit 500 to 1,000 impulses per second.\nWhat is the node of Ranvier?\nMyelinated neurons are encased in a fatty sheath called the myelin sheath, which is the expanded plasma membrane of an accessory cell called the Schwann cell. Where the sheath of one Schwann cell meets the next, the axon is unprotected. This area is called the node of Ranvier.\nWhy is conduction in myelinated neurons faster than in unmyelinated ones?\nVoltage-gated sodium channels of myelinated neurons are confined to the nodes of Ranvier. The inflow of sodium ions at one node creates just enough depolarization to reach the threshold of the next. In this way, the action potential jumps from one node to the next. This results in much faster propagation of the nerve impulse than is possible in unmyelinated neurons.\nACTION OF LOCAL ANESTHETICS\nWhat is a conduction block?\nIt is the reversible interruption of conduction within a neural structure by a local anesthetic.\nIt occurs when local anesthetic molecules occupy enough sodium channels within an axon to interrupt its activity.\nHow does conduction block by a local anesthetic occur?\nLocal anesthetics act by binding to open-gated sodium channels causing them to remain inactive, thus preventing subsequent depolarization.\nWhy do local anesthetics have a higher potency for nerves with a higher frequency of stimulation?\nNerves that have a higher frequency of stimulation have more activated open sodium channels that are more susceptible to the action of local anesthetics.\nWhy are myelinated nerves easier to block than unmyelinated ones?\nIn myelinated nerves, only the nodes of Ranvier need to be exposed to local anesthetic for conduction block to occur. In unmyelinated fibers, the full length and circumference of the nerve must be exposed to local anesthetic.\nDuring local anesthesia, what is the sequence of blockade and which nerve fibers are affected?\n1. Vasodilation (nerve type B, preganglionic autonomic, sympathetic, light myelin)\n2. Loss of pain and temperature sensation (nerve types A-δ and C, moderate and no myelin, respectively)\n3. Loss of pressure sensation (nerve type A-β, heavy myelin)\n4. Loss of motor function (nerve type A-α, heavy myelin)\nWhat three structures make up the anesthetic molecule?\n1. Aromatic ring (hydrophobic)\n2. Tertiary amine (hydrophilic)\n3. Intermediate chain (contains either an amide or ester bond)\nLocal anesthetics are classified into which two groups?\n1. Amino esters\n2. Amino amides\nWhat is the pH of local anesthetic solutions?\nLocal anesthetics are weak base with a pKa ranging from 7.7 to 9.1. Commercially prepared solutions are prepared as hydrochloride salts of the cation with a pH of 5.0 to 6.0 without epinephrine and a pH of 2.0 to 3.0 with epinephrine. This is why they burn so much.\nHow can pain from local anesthetic blocks be minimized?\nThe pain associated with use of local anesthetics can be decreased by adding sodium bicarbonate to the anesthetic. Alkalinization of the local anesthetic solution allows the anesthetic to enter the nerve more quickly thereby increasing the rapidity of onset and effectiveness. Normal dose for sodium bicarbonate is 1 mEq/10 mL lidocaine and 0.1 mEq/20 mL bupivacaine. It can decrease the pain of local anesthetic injection by adding 1-mL sodium bicarbonate for every 9-mL local anesthetic.\n1. Lipid solubility\n2. Protein binding\nHow does lipid solubility affect the action of local anesthetics?\nIncreased lipid solubility of a local anesthetic will increase its potency because nerve cell membranes are highly hydrophobic. Increased nerve block will occur because of facilitated entry across the nerve cell membrane.\nHow does protein binding affect the action of local anesthetics?\nLocal anesthetics with a higher-protein binding will have greater contact with the nerve membrane and thus a longer duration of action.\nHow does the pKa affect the action of local anesthetics?\nThe pKa of a local anesthetic determines the speed of onset of the nerve conduction block. Fifty percent of the anesthetic will exist in its basic and cationic form at a given pKa. The nonionized basic form has the highest lipid solubility and hence highest speed of onset. Because local anesthetics are prepared as hydrochloride salts with a pH of 5.0 to 6.0, some delay in onset will occur because of physiological buffering which is required to establish a significant base form concentration.\nIn what two ways can the onset of local anesthetics be accelerated?\n1. Preparation of the local anesthetic solution as a hydrocarbonate salt instead of a hydrochloride salt.\n2. Addition of sodium bicarbonate to the local anesthetic prior to injection.\nList four ester local anesthetics.\nList three amide local anesthetics.\nNote that these all have an “i” before the “-aine.”\nHow are esters metabolized?\nEsters are rapidly hydrolyzed by plasma pseudocholinesterase that creates a short plasma half-life. Products of metabolism include para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), which can be associated with hypersensitivity reactions in certain patients.\nLiver cells metabolize amides intracellularly.

{"question":"How does Valley Forge compare to Gettysburg in terms of military challenge and historical significance?","answer":"Valley Forge and Gettysburg represented different types of military challenges. Gettysburg involved a supreme, concentrated three-day effort where soldiers had to beat back the mighty onslaught of the Army of Northern Virginia in an intense battle. In contrast, Valley Forge required a longer, more sustained challenge over months of winter encampment, where soldiers had to fight not against foreign soldiers but against themselves - dealing with discouragement, discontent, cold, privation, and hardship while knowing their foes were well-housed. While both sites are important landmarks, Valley Forge demonstrated the crucial quality of steady perseverance and adherence to duty in the face of prolonged difficulty, rather than just heroism in a single great crisis. The Valley Forge encampment proved to be a turning point in the Revolutionary War, leading to the Continental Army's revitalization and ultimate victory.","context":["« PreviousContinue »\nwe have a due regard for the honor and the interest of our mighty nation; and that we keep unsullied the renown of the flag which beyond all others of the present time or of the ages of the past stands for confident faith in the future welfare and greatness of mankind.\" ,\nII It is character that counts in a nation as in a man.

My plea is that the virtuous man, the decent man, shall be a strong man, able to hold his own in any way, just because I wish him to be an agent in eradicating the misconception that being decent somehow means being weak; I want this to apply to every form of decency, public as well as private.\nThe worst development that we could see in civic life in this country would be a division of citizens into two camps, one camp containing nice, well-behaved, wellmeaning little men, with receding chins and small feet, men who mean well and who if they are insulted feel shocked and want to go home; and the other camp containing robust and efficient creatures who do not mean well at all.

My plea is for the virtue that shall be strong and that shall also have a good time. You recollect that Wesley said he was n't going to leave all the good times to the Devil. In the same way we must not leave strength and efficiency to the Devil's agents. The decent man must realize that it is his duty to be strong just as much as to be decent. There are a good many types of men for whom I do not care; and among those types I would put in prominent place the timid good man — the good man who means well but is afraid. I wish to see it inculcated from the pulpit by every ethical teacher, and in the home, that just to be decent is not enough; that in addition to being a decent man it is the duty of the man to be a strong man. And also this; to let the fact that he is a decent man dawn on his neighbors by itself, and without his announcing it or emphasizing it.\"\nIt is a good thing that of these great landmarks of our history – Gettysburg and Valley Forge - one should commemorate a single tremendous effort and the other what we need, on the whole, much more commonly, and what I think is, on the whole, rather more difficult to do - long-sustained effort. Only men with a touch of the heroic in them could have lasted out that three days' struggle at Gettysburg. Only men fit to rank with the\n1 Permission to use this excerpt granted by The Hart Wagner Pub lishing Company, publishers of Theodore Roosevelt's Realizable Ideals.\ngreat men of all time could have beaten back the mighty onslaught of that gallant and wonderful army of Northern Virginia, whose final supreme effort faded at the stone wall on Cemetery Ridge on that July day fortyone years ago.\nBut after all, hard though it is to rise to the supreme height of self-sacrifice and of effort at a time of crisis that is short, to rise to it for a single great effort - it is harder yet to rise to the level of a crisis when that crisis takes the form of needing constant, patient, steady work, month after month, year after year, when, too, it does not end after a terrible struggle in a glorious daywhen it means months of gloom and effort steadfastly endured, and triumph wrested only at the very end.\nHere at Valley Forge Washington and his Continentals warred not against the foreign soldiery, but against themselves, against all the appeals of our nature that are most difficult to resist — against discouragement, discontent, the mean envies and jealousies and heartburnings sure to arise at any time in large bodies of men, but especially sure to arise when defeat and disaster have come to large bodies of men. Here the soldiers who carried our national flag had to suffer from cold, from privation, from hardship, knowing that their foes were well housed, knowing that time went easier for the others than it did for them. And they conquered, because they had in them the spirit that made them steadfast, not merely on an occasional great day, but day after day in the life of daily endeavor to do duty well.\nWhen two lessons are both indispensable, it seems hardly worth while to dwell more on one than on the other. Yet I think that as a people we need more to learn the lesson of Valley Forge even than that of Gettysburg. I have not the slightest anxiety but that this people, if the need should come in the future, will be able to show the heroism, the supreme effort that was shown at Gettysburg, though it may well be that it would mean a similar two years of effort, checkered by disaster, to lead up to it. But the vital thing for this Nation to do is steadily to cultivate the quality which Washington and those under him so preëminently showed during the winter at Valley Forge - the quality of steady adherence to duty in the teeth of difficulty, in the teeth of discouragement, and even disaster, the quality that makes a man do what is straight, and decent, not one day when a great crisis comes, but every day, day in and day out, until success comes at the end.\nVI REMEMBER always that the securing of a substantial education, whether by the individual or by a people, is attained only by a process, not by an act. You can no more make a man really educated by giving him a certain curriculum of studies than you can make a people fit for self-government by giving it a paper constitution. The training of an individual so as to fit him to do good work in the world is a matter of years; just as the training of a nation to fit it successfully to fulfill the duties of self-government is a matter, not of a decade or two, but of generations. There are foolish empiricists who believe that the granting of a paper constitution, prefaced by some high-sounding declaration, of itself confers the\n1 Remarks at the Washington Memorial Chapel, Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, June 19, 1904.","By December 1777, Washington was well aware that some members of the Continental Congress were questioning his leadership abilities. The Valley Forge site—located along trade routes and near farm supplies—was an attempt to balance Congress’ demands for a winter campaign against Philadelphia with the needs of his troops. It was common for armies at the time to withdraw to fixed camps during the winter, as the harsh weather made transportation of troops, arms and supplies extremely difficult.\nThe soldiers who marched to Valley Forge on December 19, 1777 were not downtrodden or desperate. Though they had been defeated in two key battles, and had lost Philadelphia to the British, Continental troops had often put themselves on the offensive, and proved themselves as skilled fighters against professional soldiers with superior numbers. They were certainly tired, and lacking in supplies, but these were not unusual circumstances in the life of a Continental soldier. Once the troops arrived at their winter camp site, military engineers directed the construction of some 2,000 huts laid out in parallel lines, forming a kind of city, along with miles of trenches, five earthen redoubts and a bridge over the Schuylkill River.\nRaw winter weather made things difficult for the tired troops, while a mismanaged commissary and Congress’ failure to provide the army with sufficient funds for fresh supplies led to widespread hunger and lack of clothing, shoes and other supplies among the men. Yet cold and starvation were not the most dangerous threats to soldiers at Valley Forge: Diseases like influenza, dysentery, typhoid and typhus killed two-thirds of the nearly 2,000 soldiers who died during the encampment.\nTo keep his battered army together, Washington instituted policies of lashing as punishment and threatened to shoot deserters on sight. Taking rumors of his imminent replacement in stride, he decided to regroup rather than give up. In February 1778, Washington welcomed to camp Baron Friedrich von Steuben, a Prussian officer who put Continental troops through a new training regimen, including the precision marching that was so important to Revolutionary-era warfare. Von Steuben also instituted new hygiene standards in the slovenly American camp, introducing the first latrines (and ensuring they were placed far from the kitchens). In thanks, a grateful Washington had Congress appoint Von Steuben inspector general of the Continental Army. Another officer, Nathanael Greene, took charge of procuring supplies through the commissary in March, leaving Washington free to concentrate on developing strategies to confront the British. By April, the general’s critics in Congress were silenced, and news of France’s commitment to the Revolutionary cause in May brought celebration to Valley Forge.\nOn June 19, 1778, exactly six months after they arrived, a revitalized Continental Army left Valley Forge and headed towards New Jersey. Barely a week later, they forced the British from the field in the Battle of Monmouth. The Valley Forge encampment proved to be a turning point in the Revolutionary War, testing the mettle of George Washington and his troops and paving the way for their ultimate victory in the war for American independence."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:acaf0d3b-f395-4c81-b3ea-b88fff929cc5>","<urn:uuid:935846d2-3cf5-44aa-a629-ef202e37d7ca>"],"error":null}
{"question":"請比較HACCP系統和FIFO方法在食品安全管理中的應用範圍和目的 (Please compare the scope and purpose of the HACCP system versus the FIFO method in food safety management)","answer":"HACCP (Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point) is a comprehensive food safety inspection system that reviews all food handling processes in a business, identifies poor handling processes, makes corrections, and aims to prevent foodborne illness by making the safest food possible. In contrast, FIFO (First In, First Out) is a more specific storage management strategy that focuses on proper rotation of food products, ensuring that items with the closest use-by dates are used first, which helps maintain food freshness and safety in storage.","context":["10 Food Safety Storage Tips\nAdopting a systematic approach to food safety in commercial kitchens and restaurants is essential for maintaining public safety. So here are 10 strategies designed to help chefs and restaurant and kitchen managers store food safely while ensuring it remains fresh and appetising.\n1. First In, First Out. As deliveries or\nprepared foods are stored, they need to be rotated so the dates with the\nclosest use-by are readily seen by staff who then know which to use first.\nand Freezing. Cool rooms, freezers and refrigerators are machines that\nrequire maintenance. As per the manufacturer’s instructions, establish a\nprocess and schedule for checking they are functioning properly and maintaining\ntemperatures. When chilling food, this should be below 5C and when\nfreezing food below -18C. Do\nnot overcrowd your refrigerator or freezer. Air must circulate freely.\n3. Separate Different Foods. Store raw\nmeats away from fresh fruit and vegetables. This will simplify the management\nof your kitchen and reduce the spread of bacteria from one to the other. Store\nprepared foods above raw foods in the fridge.\n4. Store Food in Airtight Containers.\nAirtight containers assist in reducing the spread of harmful bacteria in the\nfridge and at room temperature. Ensure containers are clean and sanitary before\nstoring food in them.\n5. Maintain Seals. An airtight container\nis only as good as its seal. When washing, ensure seals are checked and discard\nany with cracks or excessive signs of wear. Bacteria will grow in the cracks\nand could easily spread to the contents of the container.\n6. Get Organised. Use high quality labels to clearly indicate –\na. Use by dates,\nb. Best before dates,\nd. Preparation dates,\ne. Storage dates,\nf. Who prepared it,\ng. Ingredients contained within,\nh. The contents contain known allergens,\nThe food is suitable for vegans, vegetarians,\npeople with celiac disease and other conditions.\n7. Use the Right Label Adhesive. When choosing\nlabels to indicate the above information, ensure the adhesive on those labels\nis suited to its application and is of a food safety standard. Specific label\nadhesives are manufactured to be either removable, permanent, dissolvable and\ndurable. Ensure the correct one is applied to suit the storage requirements of\nthe selected food.\n8. Be Extra Cautious with High Risk Foods. The temperature danger zone with food is between 5C and 60C. Bacteria readily grows in this range. Dairy products, meat, seafood, prepared casseroles, roasts, stews and soups are high risk foods and must not be stored within this range.\na. Keep cool desserts, sliced meats, dairy products, sandwiches and salads below 5C.\nKeep roasts, stews, casseroles, curries and\nsoups above 60C.\n9. Cover Food. This keeps dust, insects\nand airborne bacteria away from food and is a simple technique for practicing\neffective food safety.\n10. Maintain Safe Temperatures of Displayed Foods. Displayed food is at particular risk of falling within the temperature danger zone. Using a quality food thermometer, periodically conduct temperature checks to see that displayed food is above 60C or below 5C.\nMaintaining food safety standards for stored foods is an essential element for maintaining public health. Following the suggestions above will help chefs and restaurant and kitchen managers to protect their patrons and clients.

{"question":"I'm studying chemical origins of life: comparing synthetic pathways for RNA vs DNA components. Can you explain differences between primordial RNA precursor formation and 2-deoxy-D-ribose synthesis from interstellar materials?","answer":"The formation pathways for RNA and DNA components show distinct mechanisms. RNA precursors like purines and pyrimidines could form from HCN in the primordial biosphere, or begin as amino acids (including aspartic acid, glutamine, and glycine for purine synthesis). In contrast, 2-deoxy-D-ribose synthesis follows two possible routes: either from acetaldehyde and D-glyceraldehyde, or through a one-pot reaction using interstellar materials (formaldehyde, glycolaldehyde, and acetaldehyde). This latter pathway requires specific promoters like amino esters or amino nitriles and produces predominantly the D-form sugar found in DNA after 7 days.","context":["Readers and colleagues often ask why scientists care to blog, especially given increasing time demands and decreasing research funding. For me, the blog is an opportunity to have discussions with colleagues from diverse research areas all around the world. Quite often, I learn something quite new that I would not normally encounter in my chosen field of cancer pharmacology.\nA case in point stems from a reader comment by Dr Italo MR Guedes, a Brazilian soil scientist who writes the blog, Geófagos (Google Translate works well enough unless, of course, you are already fluent in Portuguese). Italo commented on our post about a French research group’s studies on the rationale underlying Ugandan chimpanzee behavior of eating clay soils prior to their favorite plant. The researchers found that the combination of soil and the plant, Trichilia rubescens, led to activation of the plant’s antimalarial compounds (nice copyrighted photograph here by the husband of the primary author).\nItalo tells us that his read of the paper leads him to think that the minerals in the soil might directly catalyze the non-enzymatic chemical conversions of T. rubescens compounds to those with in vitro antimalarial activity. I had originally postulated that the clay might improve the bioavailability of antimalarial compounds already present in the plant or contain microorganisms that catalyzed the activation of prodrugs. But Italo’s suggestion of catalysis by immobilized cations in the clay is quite plausible in that platinum catalysts are used commonly in synthetic organic chemistry and daily by those of us who commute in automobiles outfitted with catalytic converters.\nWhat was even more interesting in Italo’s comment was his allusion to the study of clay-mediated, non-enzymatic polymerization of RNA oligomers – a phenomenon I had not heard of previously (or was sleeping through in college biology or chemistry). However, chemist Dr James Ferris and his\nformer student colleague, Dr Gözen Ertem, performed work in the early 1990s at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) to show that a specific type of clay, montmorillonite, was capable of catalyzing this reaction (1992 Science PDF here).\nCorrection (13 October 2011): We deeply apologize to Dr. Ertem for mischaracterizing him as a student of Dr. Ferris. Dr. Ertem has informed us that he was a visiting professor in the Ferris laboratory for over 12 years working on RNA and montmorillonite catalysis.\nFerris and Ertem’s work addresses a crucial question in the origin of life on Earth: how could RNA polymers haved formed in the first place, in the absence of RNA polymerase enzymes? Their work on the prebiotic synthesis of RNA polymers on a clay mineral catalyst was discussed by Tim Tyler on talk.origins back in 2003, following a New Scientist article describing work of Jack Szostak’s group on montmorillonite also facilitating the formation of membrane-filled fluid vesicles from fatty acids.\nFor background, the RNA world hypothesis is based on the fact that RNA carries genetic information (like DNA) but also has enzymatic activity (like proteins: ribozymes – 1989 Nobel Prize in Chemistry to Altman and Cech). Not only can certain RNAs self-splice, but Zhang and Cech went on to show that some RNAs can catalyze the formation of peptide bonds.\nRNA bases begin as amino acids (such as aspartic acid, glutamine, and glycine in purine synthesis, plus formate and bicarbonate). Glycine and aspartic acid were among the amino acids shown by the recently-departed Dr Stanley Miller to be formed in his famed experimental system resembling the primordial atmosphere of methane, ammonia, water, and hydrogen, with electrical discharge to mimic lightning (the original 1953 Science paper is a gem, especially when considering Miller was a 23-year-old graduate student at the time – Download PDF here).\nDr Ferris published a nice, free text overview of his group’s work in 2006. This review provides an elegant and approachable treatise on the chemistry of the origins of life and discusses how other biological precursors could have been provided from comets and meteorites. Ferris also describes how purines and pyrimidines could have been formed from HCN in the primordial biosphere as opposed to how we make them from amino acids. I hesitate to say it but I’m surprised that the ID movement hasn’t twisted these examples to justify Genesis 3:19 – “For dust thou art; and unto dust shalt thou return.”\nSo, while I use Terra Sigillata here as a metaphor for medicines derived from the Earth, little did I know that a related clay is implicated in the very origins of life.\nFerris, J.P., Ertem, G.

How was the first cell born? How did the genetic material develop?\nMany scientists from different fields are trying to answer this question, but, what is the chemists’ approach?\nPrebiotic chemistry is chemist’s way to find an explanation!\nThis branch of chemistry explores the formation of amino acids, sugars, and nucleobases -the molecular building blocks of life- from even smaller blocks that existed in the primitive Earth environment. The main idea is that simple atoms and molecules (that were present on Earth) led to the formation of proteins and nucleic acids (e. g. DNA) and eventually to the organization of life in compartments and cells. Prebiotic chemistry probes different pathways that can lead to life as we know it: carbon-based and non-symmetrical (i. e. chiral).\nAn easy example that describes the chirality of bio-molecules are amino acids, building blocks of proteins, that can exist in 2 forms; mirror images of each other (Figure 1). Although they can assume the two forms below, only one of these -with its specific symmetry- can be found in the proteins (left molecule in Figure 1). Why life choose only one direction is still a big mystery.\nFigure 1: Example of chiarality in the amino acid alanine: This two molecules are the mirror image of each other, but they are not the same molecule (From Jü, Wikimedia Commons).\nIn a similar but more complicated way, the sugar that forms the backbone of DNA exists in four different forms, but only one of these, the 2-deoxy-D-ribose, is present in the biological molecule! The asymmetry of life is a question that is very complicated to answer and the founding of this paper can move us forward on the path to the solution.\nThe authors of this paper synthesized 2-deoxy-D-ribose (Figure 2) starting from materials known to be present on Earth at its early stages: acetaldehyde and D-glyceraldehyde (Figure 3).\nFigure 2: 2-deoxy-D-ribose in DNA and free (in its chain and ring forms). (Adapted from Madeleine Price Ball, Wikimedia Commons).\nFigure 3: synthesis of 2-deoxy-D-ribose (3) from acetaldehyde (1) and D-glyceraldehyde (2).\nThey performed the reaction at different pH values and initiated it with different promoters: asymmetric amino esters and amino nitriles (Promoters in Figure 3). In each of these conditions, the reaction always led predominantly to the formation of the desired sugar (3 in Figure 3) with the desired symmetry (3 was always more concentrated than 4) that is the only sugar in DNA. Noticeably the reaction did not proceed without the promoters. Moreover, changing the symmetry of the promoter did not change significantly the ratio between the products; 3 always being produced in higher quantities than 4. This suggests that the asymmetric geometry is retained from D-glyceraldehyde (2).\nWith a different approach, the authors operated a one-pot reaction for the synthesis of 2-deoxy-D-ribose starting from materials that were present in the interstellar space: formaldehyde, glycolaldehyde, and acetaldehyde. This is called the extraterrestrial approach: D-glyceraldehyde is produced from formaldehyde (green in Figure 4) and glycolaldehyde (blue in Figure 4) which then reacts with acetaldehyde (red in Figure 4) to give the final product. Although the reactants were symmetric, the asymmetric initiator and the condition of the reaction led predominantly to D-glyceraldehyde, which then retained the symmetry in the further reaction with acetaldehyde.\nAfter 7 days, the reaction produces a mixture of carbohydrates, including 2-deoxy-D-ribose. Noticeably, 2-deoxy-L-ribose was not produced by the reaction.\nFigure 4: one-pot synthesis of 2-deoxy-D-ribose from interstellar building blocks. The conditions used for the reaction are described.\nFrom a small amount of asymmetric promoter, these reactions lead to a selective product -although the reactants are symmetric- and give a first possible explanation of how the 2-deoxy-D-ribose formed from prebiotic materials. With them, we improve our understanding of the asymmetric selectivity of life and make an important step to discover its origins!"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:e789a56d-c661-481a-ab22-a9af4fca3174>","<urn:uuid:6a6960e0-3a54-45be-8c21-a031a0a3d578>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How did the transition from hunting-gathering to agriculture affect both human health and demographic patterns during the Neolithic period?","answer":"The transition from hunting-gathering to agriculture had complex effects on both human health and demographics. Health-wise, it led to widespread malnutrition and the emergence of infectious diseases. While hunter-gatherers had diverse diets with substantial meat intake, agricultural societies relied on few mono-cropped grains and nutritionally-inferior domesticated animals, leading to nutritional deficits. The sedentary lifestyle and increased population density created conditions for degenerative and infectious diseases. As a result, humans became shorter in stature compared to 25,000 years ago, and mean age of death decreased. Demographically, the adoption of agriculture triggered the first demographic explosion in human history due to reduced costs of having children. However, when fertility eventually fell back to its original level, early farmers found themselves worse fed than previous hunter-gatherers and had to work longer hours to survive.","context":["Born Expecting the Pleistocene\nby Mark Seely\nNot our natural habitat\nThe mismatch hypothesis\nOur bodies including our brains—and thus our behavioral predispositions—have evolved in response to very specific environmental and social conditions. Many of those environmental and social conditions no longer exist for most of us. Our physiology and our psychology, all of our instincts and in-born social tendencies, are based on life in small semi-nomadic tribal groups of rarely more than 50 people. There is a dramatic mismatch between life in a crowded, frenetic, technology-based global civilization and the kind of life our biology and our psychology expects .\nAnd we suffer serious negative consequences of this mismatch. A clear example can be seen in the obesity epidemic that has swept through developed nations in recent decades: our bodies evolved to meet energy demands in circumstances where the presence of food was less predictable and periods of abundance more variable. Because of this, we have a preference for calorie-dense food, we have a tendency to eat far more than we need, and our bodies are quick to hoard extra calories in the form of body fat.\nThis approach works quite well during a Pleistocene ice age, but it is maladaptive in our present food-saturated society—and so we have an obesity epidemic because of the mismatch between the current situation and our evolution-derived behavioral propensities with respect to food. Studies on Australian aborigines conducted in the 1980s, evaluating the health effects of the transition from traditional hunter-gatherer lifestyle to urban living, found clear evidence of the health advantages associated with a lifestyle consistent with our biological design . More recent research on the increasingly popular Paleo-diet  has since confirmed wide-ranging health benefits associated with selecting food from a pre-agriculture menu, including cancer resistance, reduction in the prevalence of autoimmune disease, and improved mental health.\n Ornstein, R. & Ehrlich, P.

Metabolic and physiological improvements from consuming a Paleolithic, hunter-gatherer type diet. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition, 63, 947=955.\nThe mechanisms of cultural evolution can be seen in the changing patterns of foraging behavior in response to changes in food availability and changes in population density. Archaeological analyses suggest that there is a predictable pattern of dietary choice that emerges from the interaction among population density, relative abundance of preferred food sources, and factors that relate to the search and handling of various foods.  In general, diets become more varied, or broaden, as population increases and the preferred food becomes more difficult to obtain. When a preferred food source is abundant, the calories in the diet may consist largely of that one particular food. But as the food source becomes more difficult to obtain, less preferable foods will be included and the diet will broaden. Such dietary changes imply changes in patterns of behavior within the community—changes of culture.\nBehavior ecologists and anthropologists have partitioned the foraging process into two components with respect to the cost-benefit analysis associated with dietary decisions:\nsearch and handling.  The search component of the cost-benefit ledger refers to the amount of work per calorie payoff (and other benefits such as the potential for enhanced social standing) associated with a food item’s abundance, distance, terrain, proximity of another group’s territory, water sources, etc. The handling component refers to the work per calorie payoff associated with getting the food into a state (location, form, etc.) in which it can be consumed. Search and handling considerations can be largely independent of each other. The residential permanence involved with the incorporation of agriculture reduces the search consideration greatly, and makes handling the primary consideration. Global industrial food economies change entirely the nature of both search and handling: handling in industrial society—from the perspective of the individual and the individual’s decision processes—is reduced largely to considerations of speed and convenience. The search component has been re-appropriated and refocused by corporate marketing, and reduced to something called shopping.\nDomestication, hands down the most dramatic and far-reaching example of cultural evolution, emerges originally as a response to scarcity that is tied to a lack of mobility and an increase in population density. Domestication is a way of further broadening the diet when other local sources of food are already being maximally exploited. Initial experimentation with animal domestication “occurred in situations where forager diets were already quite broad and where the principle goal of domestication was the production of milk, an exercise that made otherwise unusable plants or plant parts available for human consumption. . . .”  The transition to life-ways based even partially on domestication has some counter-intuitive technological ramifications as well.\nThis leads to a further point about efficiency. It is often said that the adoption of more expensive subsistence technology marks an improvement in this aspect of food procurement: better tools make the process more efficient. This is true in the sense that such technology often enables its users to extract more nutrients per unit weight of resource processed or area of land harvested. If, on the other hand, the key criterion is the cost/benefit ratio, the rate of nutrient gained relative to the effort needed to acquire it, then the use of more expensive tools will often be associated with declines in subsistence efficiency. Increased investment in handling associated with the use of high-cost projectile weapons, in plant foods that require extensive tech-related processing, and in more intensive agriculture all illustrate this point. \nIn modern times, thanks to the advent of—and supportive propaganda associated with—factory industrial agriculture, farming is coupled with ideas of plentitude and caloric abundance. However, in the absence of fossil energy and petroleum-based chemical fortification, farming is expensive in terms of the calories produced as a function of the amount of work involved. For example, “farmers grinding corn with hand-held stone tools can earn no more than about 1800 kcal per hour of total effort devoted to farming, and this from the least expensive cultivation technique.”  A successful fishing or bison hunting expedition is orders of magnitude more efficient in terms of the ratio of calories expended to calories obtained.\n Bird & O’Connell [Bird, D.

It was not really a revolution in that it occurred over an extended period of time (several thousand years) and in a mosaic piecemeal fashion, both in terms of the adoption of specific agrarian practices and in terms of specific groups of people who practiced them. Foraging lifestyles continue today, and represented the dominant lifestyle on the planet until relatively recently. The agricultural revolution was a true revolution, however, in terms of its consequences for the humans who adopted domestication-based life-ways, and for the rest of the natural world. The transition from nomadic and seminomadic hunting and gathering to sedentary agriculture is the most significant chapter in the chronicle of the human species. But it is clearly not a story of unmitigated success. Jared Diamond, who acknowledges somewhat the self-negating double-edge of technological “progress,” has called domestication the biggest mistake humans ever made.\nThat transition from hunting and gathering to agriculture is generally considered a decisive step in our progress, when we at last acquired the stable food supply and leisure time prerequisite to the great accomplishments of modern civilization. In fact, careful examination of that transition suggests another conclusion: for most people the transition brought infectious disease, malnutrition, and a shorter lifespan. For human society in general it worsened the relative lot of women and introduced class-based inequality. More than any other milestone along the path from chimpanzeehood to humanity, agriculture inextricably combines causes of our rise and our fall. \nThe agricultural revolution had profoundly negative consequences for human physical,\npsychological, and social well being, as well as a wide-ranging negative impact on the planet.\nFor humans, malnutrition and the emergence of infectious disease are the most salient physiological results of an agrarian lifestyle. A large variety of foodstuffs and the inclusion of a substantial amount of meat make malnutrition an unlikely problem for hunter gatherers, even during times of relative food scarcity. Once the diet is based on a few select mono-cropped grains supplemented by milk and meat from nutritionally-inferior domesticated animals, the stage is set for nutritional deficit. As a result, humans are not as tall or broad in stature today as they were 25,000 years ago; and the mean age of death is lower today as well.  In addition, both the sedentism and population density associated with agriculture create the preconditions for degenerative and infectious disease. “Among the human diseases directly attributable to our sedentary lives in villages and cities are heart and vascular disorders, diabetes, stroke, emphysema,\nhypertension, and cirrhoses [sic.] of the liver, which together cause 75 percent of the deaths in the industrial nations.”  The diet and activity level of a foraging lifestyle serve as a potent prophylactic against all of these common modern-day afflictions. Nomadic hunter-gatherers are by no means immune to parasitic infection and disease. But the spread of disease is greatly limited by low population density and by a regular change of habitation which reduced exposure to accumulated wastes. Both hunter-gatherers and agriculturalists are susceptible to zoonotic diseases carried by animals, but domestication reduces an animal’s natural immunity to disease and infection, creates crowded conditions that support the spread of disease among animal populations, and increases the opportunity for transmission to humans. In addition, permanent dwellings provide a niche for a new kind of disease-carrying animal specialized for symbiotic parasitic cohabitation with humans, the rat being among the most infamous.\nPlagues and epidemic outbreaks were not a problem in the Pleistocene.\nThere is a significant psychological dimension to the agricultural revolution as well.\nA foraging hunter-gatherer lifestyle frames natural systems in terms of symbiosis and interrelationship. Understanding subtle connections among plants, animals, geography,\nand seasonal climate change is an important requisite of survival. Human agents are intimately bound to these natural systems and contemplate themselves in terms of these systems, drawing easy analogy between themselves and the natural communities around them, using animals, plants, and other natural phenomena as metaphor. The manipulative focus of domestication frames natural systems in antagonistic terms of control and resistance. “Agriculture removed the means by which men [sic.] could contemplate themselves in any other than terms of themselves (or machines). It reflected back upon nature an image of human conflict and competition . . . .”  The domestication frame changed our perceived relationship with the natural world,\nand lies at the heart of our modern-day environmental woes. According to Paul Shepard,\nwith animal domestication we lost contact with an essential component of our human nature, the “otherness within,” that part of ourselves that grounds us to the rest of nature:\nThe transformation of animals through domestication was the first step in remaking them into subordinate images of ourselves—altering them to fit human modes and purposes. Our perception of not only ourselves but also of the whole of animal life was subverted, for we mistook the purpose of those few domesticates as the purpose of all. Plants never had for us the same heightened symbolic representation of purpose itself. Once we had turned animals into the means of power among ourselves and over the rest of nature, their uses made possible the economy of husbandry that would, with the addition of the agrarian impulse, produce those motives and designs on the earth contrary to respecting it. Animals would become “The Others.” Purposes of their own were not allowable, not even comprehensible. \nDomestication had a profound impact on human psychological development. Development—both physiological and psychological—is organized around a series of stages and punctuated by critical periods, windows of time in which the development and functional integration of specific systems are dependent upon external input of a designated type and quality. If the necessary environmental input for a given system is absent or of a sufficiently reduced quality, the system does not mature appropriately. This can have a snowball effect because the future development of other systems is almost always critically dependent on the successful maturation of previously developed systems. The change in focus toward the natural world along with the emergence of a new kind of social order interfered with epigenetic programs that evolved to anticipate the environmental input associated with a foraging lifestyle. The result was arrested development and a culture-wide immaturity:\nPolitically, agriculture required a society composed of members with the acumen of children. Empirically, it set about amputating and replacing certain signals and experiences central to early epigenesis. Agriculture not only infantilized animals by domestication, but exploited the infantile human traits of normal individual neoteny. The obedience demanded by the organization necessary for anything larger than the earliest village life, associated with the rise of a military caste, is essentially juvenile and submissive . . . . \n Diamond (1992), p. 139.

{"question":"What are the key benefits of implementing file analysis tools for data management, and what risk reduction measures should accompany their deployment to ensure effective disaster recovery?","answer":"File analysis tools provide several key benefits for data management, including identifying and removing redundant/obsolete data, optimizing disk space through monitoring, analyzing metadata to determine file relevance, tracking employee storage patterns, and assessing file access patterns to adjust permissions appropriately. However, these tools should be complemented with comprehensive risk reduction measures like data encryption, proper mobile security policies, user education on malware prevention, offsite cloud backup with military-grade encryption, and strong access controls. Additionally, regular practice of disaster recovery procedures with employees and maintaining both cloud and in-house backup solutions are essential for quick recovery in case of data disasters.","context":["How to Control Your Enterprise's Data Deluge with File Analysis\nThese five steps can help you clear out redundant, obsolete, or trivial data, stop data hoarding, and optimize storage.\n- By Ranjith Raj Gnanaprakasam\n- November 23, 2020\nAs the sheer volume of corporate data increases at an exponential rate, new approaches are urgently required to ensure this data does not become an overwhelming problem.\nAlthough day-to-day operations generate an increasing amount of data, the challenge is compounded by what's been called \"data hoarding.\" This occurs when staff members retain data no longer required or keep multiple copies of the same file in different locations. It can also occur when employees store personal data on corporate machines.\nDealing with data hoarding may bog down your IT teams, which may divert time and resources from more important projects.\nAdditionally, by storing large amounts of data, you may have to compromise on performance. Otherwise, your costs will spiral and consume an ever-greater proportion of your overall IT budget. Additionally, there are security concerns; when large volumes of data are stored and copied across multiple locations, sensitive data can end up in insecure locations.\nTo manage the influx of corporate data, the following steps can prove helpful:\n1. Identify all redundant, obsolete, or trivial (ROT) data\nThe types of data that cause the majority of your issues can be categorized as being ROT. ROT data adds to the expense of providing an ever-growing storage capacity across an organization. You can reclaim your data storage capacity by using file analysis tools.\nSuch tools can be configured to examine all data stores and identify any files that fall into the ROT category. Duplicate files should be automatically deleted while the master copy is retained. Any files that require human evaluation should be shifted to a different location for further analysis.\n2. Optimize your disk space\nMonitor disk space use across your organization and alert your IT team if free space falls below a predefined limit. This allows management to take preemptive steps before there is an impact on performance.\n3. Perform an analysis of the metadata\nTo lower operational costs and reduce infrastructure managers' workloads, you can use file analysis tools to automatically analyze the metadata associated with stored files. This allows you to determine whether such files are still relevant. If not, they can be archived or deleted.\n4. Identify and analyze your employees' data storage patterns\nMonitor and analyze data storage patterns by your users. After establishing a baseline of normal use, you can flag anomalies and take the requisite remedial actions. When combined with AI and ML, some file analysis tools can provide impressive results.\n5. Assess who is accessing which files and when they are doing so\nIt's important to assess how often and by whom certain files are being accessed. By doing so, you can determine whether to reduce permissions for certain data sets. It's likely that access should be reduced to a smaller number of staff members -- at least for some data.\nA Final Word\nThe effective deployment of file analysis tools can have a significant positive effect on how data is managed across your organization. By taking the time to carefully evaluate your existing data infrastructure, you will be much better prepared to manage your ongoing influx of corporate data. Some tools incorporate AI capabilities, allowing you to automate many tasks, which can further lessen the management burden and keep data hoarding under control.\nRanjith Raj Gnanaprakasam is a product manager at ManageEngine, the IT management division of Zoho Corp. After nearly a decade at the company, he has developed significant expertise in enterprise security, data-centric protection techniques, as well as deep knowledge about how to discover, monitor, and protect the most sensitive data stored by organizations.","One of the best investments that a business will ever make is putting together an effective disaster recovery plan. This is especially true for businesses that store a lot of data, and put a lot of faith in their IT department to ensure that their company continues to operate smoothly. So, what constitutes a disaster in terms of information technology? There are many different occurrences that can lead to data loss, including but not limited to things like user error, theft, natural disasters, equipment failure, and fire.\nThe potential for loss is huge and putting that much faith in your IT department’s ability to ensure that no data is lost is a losing battle for many companies. Most companies will experience significant data loss at some point and being prepared to deal with this data loss is a good first step. Each year in the United States alone, 15,000 hard drives fail every single day. Much of the data on these hard drives is lost and may not be recoverable.\nTo avoid serious data loss and financial hardship for your company, having a plan in place to mitigate the effects of the data disaster is imperative. With the disaster recovery plan, you will be able to deal with these circumstances, and have a clear plan laid out for your employees to follow so that no guess work is required regarding what steps need to be taken immediately following a data disaster, which can be a chaotic and hectic time for your IT department.\nReduce Unnecessary Risk\nThe first and most important aspect of an excellent disaster recovery plan is being able to reduce unnecessary risk. There is no sense in putting your company in the way of harm. There is also no way of knowing when a data disaster is about to strike. However, by identifying the potential unnecessary risks that are already in place, and taking steps to limit them, you can help to ensure that any data loss is not significant in that you are able to recover quickly and easily.\nSome of the best practices for reducing unnecessary risk for your business include ensuring that you are encrypting important and sensitive data, having the proper mobile security policies in place, and educating your users on virus and malware prevention and best practices. All companies should be using an offsite cloud backup solution, preferably with military grade data encryption. Additionally, having strong user access controls and permissions can help to minimize incidences where employees purposefully harm your data, or steal it for their own purposes.\nKnow that Disasters are Unavoidable\nOne of the biggest mistakes that many businesses make is assuming that they are going to be able to avoid data disasters completely, throughout the life of their business. Data disasters often strike without warning, and crucial elements of your organization may be put at risk in the process. As you are putting together your disaster recovery plan, focus on making sure that you are optimized for speed. This means that employees should have a good idea of what is expected of them in the event of the data disaster, and be able to react accordingly. Additionally, have strong testing principles in place to ensure that you can catch equipment before it inevitably fails.\nPractice Makes Perfect\nAnother mistake that companies often make is putting together an excellent disaster recovery plan, and then never going over it with the employees that will actually be executing the plan. Occasionally, at least several times per year, you and your employees should be walking through the plan in full. Make sure that you are working with the employees that will actually be expected to handle the tasks, in the event of the data disaster.\nPractice makes perfect. By walking through your data disaster recovery plan several times per year, when in actual disaster strikes your employees will be ready to execute your plan, and know the role that they play in recovering from the disaster.\nAlthough cloud backup solutions are an excellent choice for any business that is storing a lot of data, they should be used in conjunction with in-house data backup policies. An in-house backup of your data helps to ensure that you can quickly recover the data that is important for your operations in the event of the data disaster. With online backup solutions there can be a lot of data transfer required before you have access to the files, which can slow things down. Although when online or cloud hosted solution is imperative for ensuring that you are protecting yourself, and in-house backup solution is going to provide you with the quickest disaster recovery.\nFamiliarize Yourself with the Technology\nYour data protection policies are likely going to be handled by your IT team.

{"question":"How do both Arabic breakfast customs and Umrah rituals incorporate the concept of intention and authenticity?","answer":"In both contexts, intention and authenticity are emphasized but in different ways. For Umrah rituals, there is a strong focus on Ikhlas (sincerity), where all actions must be done purely for Allah alone, without showing off or seeking recognition from others. Taking pictures during rituals for social media is discouraged as it diverts intention from Allah. In Arabic breakfast culture, authenticity is emphasized through the use of fresh, high-quality ingredients - particularly for Hummus preparation, where using fresh lemon juice instead of store-bought is crucial, and high-quality tahini and chickpeas are essential for achieving the authentic taste.","context":["(Ihraam is the state entered into at the Meeqat in which certain acts and types of clothing are forbidden).\n1. It is mustahabb for anyone going for Hajj or 'Umrah to take a ghusl (bath Trim your nails, and remove your pubic hair) for ihraam - even if a woman is in her period or in after-birth confinement.\n2. Then the men unstitched clothing’s. He wears a ridaa (upper garment) and izaar (lower garment) and sandals or any footwear that does not cover the ankle-bone.\n3. He does not wear a hat or an 'imaamah (turban) or anything like that which fits onto and covers the head - this referring only to men. As for the women - she does not remove anything of the clothes that are prescribed for her in the Shari'ah, except that she should not tie on the niqaab (face-veil) or the burqa' or the lithaam (lower face cover, up to the eyes) or handkerchief and she should not wear gloves.\nProphet sallahu alaihi wa sallam said: \"The muhrim should not wear the shirt, or the 'imaamah, or the hooded cloak, or trousers, or garment touched by wars (dyes with saffron) or saffron; or leather socks - unless he cannot find sandals) then in that case he may wear leather socks)\nProphet sallahu alaihi wa sallam said: \"The woman muhrim should not affix a face veil and should not wear gloves. And it is permissible to for the women to cover her face - even if it touches her face according to the correct opinion - however, she should not tie it on, as Ibn Taymiyyah stated.\n4. He may put on the clothing of ihraam before the meeqat even in his own house as the Prophet sallahu alaihi wa sallam and his Companions (May Allah be pleased with them all) did. And this makes it easier for those making Umrah or Hajj by aeroplane for whom it is not possible to put on ihramm at the meeqat - so it is permissible for them to embark on the plane in ihraam, but they do not make the intention of ihramm until very shortly before the meeqat - in order that they do not go past the meeqat without ihraam.\n5. He may use body oil and perfume himself with any perfume he please which was has odour but not colour, however, women use that which has colour not but no odour - and all this to be before he makes intention of ihraam at the meeqat - after that is Haraam ( forbidden).\n6. Before going out of the house/hotel read the following supplication\n(Bismillahi, Tawakkaltu, 'a‐lallahi, wa laa hawla wa laa quwatta illah billah)\n(In the name of Allah, I place my trust in Allah, and there is no might nor power except with Allah)\n7. Supplication for travelling\nAllahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar. Subhaa‐nalathee, Sakha‐ra‐la‐naa ha‐thaa wa maa kunaa, lahu muq‐ri‐nee‐na wa innaa ilaa rabbinaa la‐mun‐qa‐le‐boon\n(Allaah is the greatest x3, How perfect He is, The One Who has place this (transport) at our service, and we ourselves would not have been capable of that, and to our Lord if our final destiny.)\nIhraam and Niyya (intention)\n1. So when he comes to the meeqat it becomes waajib (obligatory) for him to assume ihram - and the mere wish and intention to perform Umrahj or Hajj is not sufficient as that has been with him since leaving his own land - rather he must perform by word and action what will cause him to be muhrim. So when he recites `talbiyyah' intending to enter into ihraam then his ihram is concluded - as agreed upon by the scholars.\n2. And he does not say anything more than the talbiyyah. Some innovated saying: \"O Allah, I intend to make Hajj or `Umrah so make it easy for me and accept it from me...\" as none of this is reported from the Prophet sallahu alaihi wa sallam - just like speaking with the intention for wudoo and salaat and Fasting - all of this being from the newly invented matters and is well-known the Prophet sallahu alaihi wa sallam said: \"...for every newly invented matter is an innovation, and every innovation is a going astray and every going astray is in Hell_Fire.\" [Tirmidhee - saheeh]\nThe meeqaats (places for assuming ihram) are five:\n1. Dhul Hulaifah,\n3. Qarn-ul manaazil,\n5. Dhaatu `Irq.\nThey are for those who live there and those who pass by them intending Hajj or 'Umrah. And he whose house is nearer than them to Makkah then he makes ihram from his house, the people of Makkah making ihram from Makkah.\n1. Making Intention for Umrah\nThe one doing Umrah one must say\n· ( labbaikallaahumma bi-`umrah.) (Here I am O Allah making 'Umraah)\n2. Making condition\nAnd if he wishes when making talbiyyah he may state a condition to Allah fearing that which may prevent him (from completion of the Hajj) whether illness or fear - saying as the Prophet sallahu alaihi wa sallam taught:\nAllaahumma mahillee haithu habastanee\n(O Allah my place is wherever you prevent me).\nSo if he does that and is then prevented or becomes ill - then he may leave ihram of the Hajj or `Umrah - and there is no compensatory sacrifice due upon him and he does not have to do the Hajj again, except and unless it was his first Hajj - then he has to repeat it.\n3. Ihram Prayer\nThere is no special prayer for ihram, however if it is time for prayer before ihram, then he should pray and then put on ihram following the example of the Prophet sallahu alaihi wa sallam who put on ihram after prying zuhr salah in Madinah at meeqat because it was time for salah.\nAnd he should say the talbiyyah of the Prophet sallahu alaihi wa sallam\n· labbaikallaahumma labbaika\n· labbaika laa shareeka laka labbaika-\n· innal hamda wan na'mata laka wal mulka-\n· la shareeka laka\n(Here I am O Allah, here I am, there is no partners for You, here I am, Verily all praise for You, and every bounty is from You, and all dominion is Yours - You have no partners.)\nAnd the one saying the talbiyyah is ORDERED to raise his voice with it, as the Prophet sallahu alaihi wa sallam said: \"Jibreel came to me and ordered me to order my companions and those with me to raise their voices with talbiyyah.\"\nAnd women, as regards the talbiyyah, are like men - as the two preceding hadith are general - so they should raise their voices as long as there is no fear of fitnah. And `Aa'ishah may Allah be pleased with her, used to raise her voice until the men could hear her.\nEntering (Kaba ) Masjid\nSo if you enter the masjid do not forget to enter by the right foot and say the supplication:\n· allallhumma salli `alaa muhammadin wa sallim – allaahumma aftah lee abwaaba rahmatika\n(In the name of Allaah! O Allaah! Exalt the mention of your Messenger. O Allaah! Forgive my sins, and open the gates of Your mercy for me).\nTawaaf of Quadoom (arrival)\nThen he should go straight to the Black Stone and facing it make takbeer. And he may say `Bismillah' Allahu Akbar\nThen he touches the Black Stone with his hand and kisses it also, and makes sajda upon it also - as Prophet sallahu alaihi wa sallam did that, and `Umar, and Ibn `Abbaas.\nIf he is not able to kiss it then he touches it with his hand then kisses his hand.\nThen if he cannot touch it he should make a sign towards it with his hand.\nAnd he does that in every circuit. (Seven circuits)\nAnd he should not push and crowd to get to it according to the Prophet sallahu alaihi wa sallam saying: O`Umar, you are a strong man, so do not harm the weak, and when you wish to touch it, then when it became free then touch it, and if not then face it and say takbeer.\nAnd there is in touching the Black Stone a great excellence as the Prophet sallahu alaihi wa sallam said: \"Allaah will raise up the Stone on the Day of Judgement, and will have two eyes with which it will see, and a tongue which it talks with, and it will give witness in favour of everyone who touched it in truth.\"\nProphet sallahu alaihi wa sallam said: \"Touching the Black Stone and the Yemeni corner removes sins.\"\nProphet sallahu alaihi wa sallam \"The Black Stone is from Paradise, and it used to be whiter that snow, but the sins of the idolaters turned it black.\"\nThen he should begin making tawaaf around the Ka'bah - it being to his left - and he goes around past the Stone seven times - from the Stone to the Stone being one, wearing the ihram under his right armpit and over the left (called al-idtibaa') throughout the tawaaf ( seven circuits ). And walking quickly and with boldness (ramal – speed walking not jogging) in the first three only, from the Stone to the Stone - then he walks normally in the rest.\nAnd he touches the Yemeni corner with his hand each time he passes and does not kiss it, and if he is not able to touch it then he should not make any sign towards it with his hand at all.\nAnd he should say between the two corners:\nRabbanaa aatinaa fid-dunyaa hasanatan wa feel aakhirati hasanatan wa qinaa 'adhaaban naar\n[Soorat-ul-Baqarah ayah 201]\n(Our Lord! Give us good in this world and good in the Hereafter, and defend us from the torment of the Fire.)\nAnd he does not touch the two shaami corners at all because Prophet sallahu alaihi wa sallam didn’t do it.\nMaqaami Ibraheem (Place of Abraham)\nSo when he finished the seventh round he covers his right shoulder and moves to the Place of Ibrahim\nAnd he places the Maqaami Ibraheem (Place of Abraham) between himself and the Ka'bah and then prays two rak'ahs. (He can do this any place in the masjid not necessarily behind the station due to overcrowding.)\nAnd he recites therein Surat-ul-Kaafiroon ( Surah Kafiroon ) and Surat-Qul Huwallaahu Ahad.(Surah Ikhlas ) Then after praying he goes to Zamzam and drinks there of, and pours some of the water onto his head, as Prophet sallahu alaihi wa sallam said the followings in regards to zamzam water.\n· \"Zamzam water is for what it drunk for\"\n· \"It is blessed and it is a food and a cure for illness\n· The best water upon the face of the earth is Zamzam water, in it is nourishment and a cure from illness.\nThen he returned to the Black Stone, says takbeer and touches it - as before. If one can or able to do so.\nSa'ee Between Safaa And Marwah (between the mountains)\nThe he goes off for sa'ee is the walk/run between Safaa and Marwah (two small hills). And when he reaches the foot of Safaa he reads Allaah ta'ala's saying:\nInnas-safaa wal marwata min sha'aa'irillaahi faman hajjal baita 'awi`tamara falaa janaaha 'alaihi an yattawwafa bihimaa wa man tatawwa'a khiran fa'innallaaha shaakirun 'aleemun [Soorat-ul-Baqarah ayah 158]\n(Behold! Safa and Marwa are among the Symbols of Allah. So if those who visit the House in the Season or at other times should compass them round, it is no sin in them, and if any one obeys his own impulse to good, be sure that Allah is He Who recognises and knows.)\nThen he begins with as-Safaa - climbing upon it until he can see the Ka'bah ( its in the corner may not be able to see it because of the construction ) .\nThen he faces the Ka'bah - and makes tawheed of Allaah and takbeer, saying :\n· Allaahu akbar\n· allaahu akbar\n· allaahu akbar –\n· laa illaaha illallahu wahdau laa shareekalahu –\n· lahul mul ku wa lahul hamdu –\n· yuheeu wa yumeetu\n· wa huwa 'alaa kulli shai'in qadeer –\n· laa ilaaha illallahu wahdahu laa shareekalahu –\n· anjaza wa'dahu wa nasara ' abdahu\n· wa hazamal ahzaaba wahdahu\nSaying that three times and making du'aa after each time. (this must be done at the beginning of each mountain, facing the kaba take your time and don’t rush )\nSo he walks till he reaches the green sign-post - on the right and left - then runs quickly till he reaches the next sign-post. And this place was in the time of the Prophet sallahu alaihi wa sallam a dried river bed covered with small stones, and the Prophet sallahu alaihi wa sallam: (The river bed is not crossed except with vigour.) Then he walks up to Marwah and ascends it and does upon it as he did upon as-Safaa - facing the Qiblah, saying takbeer and tahleel and making du'aa and that forms one complete circuit.\nThen he returns till he ascends as-Safaa - walking in the place for walking, and running in the place for running - and that is a second circuit. Then he returns to Marwah - and so on till he completes seven circuits finishing upon Marwah. Until he completes the seven. This point he will be on the other side of the masjid.\nMake any types of dua reading from book or phones or quran during the walking between safa and marwa,\nAnd if he makes du'aa in sa'ee, saying :\nRabbighfir warham innaka antal a'azzul akram\n(O lord forgive and have mercy, verily You are the Most Mighty, Most Noble) then there is no harm as it is authentically reported from a group of the Salaf ( pious predecessors )\nThen when he finishes from the seventh circuit upon al-Marwah he shaves or shortens the hair of his head thus ending the 'Umrah - and everything that became forbidden to him upon entering ihram now becomes permissible again\nExtra Notes and advice\nIltizaam between The Corner And The Door ( Kaba Door )\nAnd he may cling to the place between the corner and the Door - placing his chest and face and forearms upon this place.\nAnd there is no particular dhikr for tawaaf - so he may read Qur'an or say any dhikr he pleases, according to the Prophet sallahu alaihi wa sallam saying : Tawaaf around the House is prayer, except that Allah has allowed speech in it, so he who speaks then let him not say except, good things and in a narration : so let him limit his talk in it.\n1. Ikhlas = sincerity doing any type of worship ( Ibada ) only for Allah alone and not for anyone else or for fame or for someone to congratulate him/her. Worship is for Allah alone.\nProphet sallahu alaihi wa sallam said all deeds are based on intentions, and each will receive what they intended. Therefore this means no showing off or getting recognition from others..\nFor example using Whatsapp, twitter, taking pictures and sending to others in the time of prayer, dua , tawaf, or kissing black stone..etc..This will fall into very dangerous situation with Allah because at that time you are diverted your intention to other than Allah. Rather than seeking Allahs pleasure one is seeing the pleasures and recognitions and praises from the creations. This falls into Riya (showing off ) and even Shirk ( making partners with Allah ) therefore the reward of the action may be reduced or even nullified if one is not careful .\n2. Following exactly the teaching of Prophet sallahu alaihi wa sallam in his actions and his speech, without any bida (newly innovated matters in the religion which has no reference from Prophet sallahu alaihi wa sallam or the companions) therefore whoever has done an action to please Allah seeking reward from Allah but not according to the Prophet sallahu alaihi wa sallam action then that particular action is nullified and it is in hellfire and the person who has acted has committed a sin. As Prophet sallahu alaihi wa sallam said \"Every innovation is misguidance and going astray”\n3. Learn the rituals of umrah prior and read the duas and mark the pages and be prepared and DO NOT imitate anyone else as they could be doing bida and cause confusion.\n4. Prophet sallahu alaihi wa sallam done only one umrah in per trip therefore its not recommended to go to Masjid Aisha and do several Umrah rather do one and do it to your best of abilities. If this was going to be good then Prophet sallahu alaihi wa sallam would have done so rather Prophet sallahu alihi wa sallam didn’t do it so we don’t do it.\n5. Once you are a traveller (having left your areas of residence), and the next Salah is due, you can combine and shorten them as this is a concession from Allah. Although its recommended not to shorten in the haramain (two masjids Makkah and Madinah due to rewards)\n· Dhur (2 Rakaats) & Asr (2 Rakaats) together\n· Maghrib (3 Rakaats) & Ishaa (2 Rakaats) together\n· Read as many sunnah/nawafil as you like, there is no restriction and do many tawafs.\n( this is available in the Umrah Download section )","If you’ve read my previous blog postArabic and Turkish Cuisine: Similarities and Differences, then you probably have noticed the significance of breakfast for the Arab region. However, Arabic breakfast has a variety of dishes that would take a book to go over and I’ve only written briefly on the topic but today I will go over one specific dish in-depth. I have surveyed 50 arabs on their favorite Arabic breakfast dish, and I’ve chosen to make the highest voted dish.\nToday you will learn how to make that dish, the different varieties of that dish, what to pair the dish with and lastly my favorite Arabic songs that you can play in the background to experience the full Arabic breakfast. According to the survey below, you will learn how to make Hummus from A to Z.\nHUMMUS: PAST AND PRESENT The name Hummus, is literally the Arabic word for chickpeas and just like many Middle Eastern dishes, the origin of Hummus is highly debated with every country claiming it as their own, and why wouldn’t they? It is after all heavenly. However, the slight evidence that exists argues that it was mainly eaten in Egypt and the Levant countries (Palestine, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon) and the earliest known written recipe was found in Cairo in the 13th century. But, now it is eaten all over the Middle East and recently in the past decade it has gained international recognition and is known almost everywhere in the world.\nIt is one of the most well known Arabic dishes, and it is a sort of an obsession in the Middle East. Since, the Middle East is filled with professional Hummus restaurants, Arabs have access to the perfect Hummus instantly. However, if you live outside the Middle East whether you’re an Arab living abroad, or a foreigner that might not always be the case, and you might have to settle for store-bought Hummus, which trust me tastes nothing like the original rich creamy Hummus. This is why today I will share my family’s recipe with you, in a few easy steps and tricks I will teach you how to make the perfect Hummus, and you will never have to settle for store-bought ones again! HUMMUS RECIPE Hummus can be made in two main ways either from scratch where you cook and prep your own dry chickpeas, or you can use already pre-cooked canned ones. To make Hummus from scratch you need to soak and prep chickpeas for almost 10 hours, which is time consuming and honestly who has the patience? Today I will teach you how to make Hummus using canned chickpeas, because it is a lot faster and it tastes almost identical to the one made from scratch. It is pretty hard to tell the difference unless you have years of experience. For the video recipe clickhere, but if you want a more in-depth explanation keep scrolling.\nFor this Hummus recipe, you’ll need the following ingredients.\n500 grams canned chickpeas\n200 grams tahini\n1/2 tsp cumin\n1 garlic clove, roughly chopped\n1 teaspoon salt\n1 teaspoon sodium bicarbonate\n5-8 ice cubes\n1/2 lemon juice\nFor the best Hummus you need to make sure you have the best and freshest ingredients. It is important that you get the best quality canned Hummus and Tahini, in Turkey these are the brands I liked the most. It is also very important that you use fresh lemon juice, not store-bought lemon juice, it could completely change the test of your Hummus. Now that we’ve gotten that out of the way, lets get to it!\n1. Drain your chickpeas in a strainer, then add them to a pot. Add water until it fully covers the chickpeas and add 1 tsp of baking soda. Let it boil for 20 minutes on low to medium heat, and add water throughout if necessary. Tip: It is important to cook the chickpeas until they’re very soft, to ensure that there are no lumps in your Hummus and that is it creamy. The baking soda helps the chickpeas peel easily and that way you won’t have to sit there peeling them one by one.\n2.While your chickpeas are cooking, add garlic, lemon juice and salt to the blender and blend until smooth. Then allow it to rest for 10 minutes. Tip: Adding garlic in this step, makes sure that the garlic’s taste mellows before its mixed with the Hummus. This way you get a slight garlicy taste without overdoing it.\n3.After your chickpea is well cooked, drain the water, rise your chickpea with cold water and let them cool for a minute or two. You will notice that they’re mostly peeled. Add the chickpea to the mixture and blend until it’s a paste. It usually takes a few minutes. Tip:It is important to blend really well, until you no longer see any chunks of chickpea to ensure that you will have creamy Hummus.\n4. Add the tahini, cumin and an ice cube and blend for two 2 minutes, each 1 or two minutes add an ice cube to the mixture. Keep blending until the Hummus is light, and creamy like the picture. Stop the blender to scoop any mixture on the sides, and blend again. Tip: It is very important to add ice cubes as the Hummus is being blended. Now I don’t know the scientific reasoning behind this but I know this way it ensure that it won’t clump up and stays smooth and light. You will also notice the Hummus’ color is lighter after you add your ice cube.\n5. Scoop your Hummus into a plate, use the spoon to create swooshes on top and drizzle olive oil and design it with a few chickpea pieces and Enjoy! or as we say in Arabic Sahteen!\n3 MUST HAVES WITH HUMMUS\nHummus is a dish in its entirety. However, it is almost never eaten alone, unless there’s some leftovers and you need to eat the last bits before it goes bad. But, if you want to get the best Hummus experience you need it pair it with these three things: Falafel, pita bread, and Arabic tea.\nPicture from https://www.themediterraneandish.com\nFalafel is like Hummus’ best friend. Hummus and Falafel are like peanut butter and jam, cookies and milk. They are almost always always paired together, and they’re paired together for a good reason. The combination just tastes out of this world. Falafel’s main ingredient is also chickpeas. It made of chickpeas, fresh herbs and spices and then is formed into balls and fried. You might find it weird that we’re basically eating chickpea with chickpea, but they taste very different and they go so well together. It is hard to make at home, and if you don’t have restaurants that sell them near by, you can probably find them in the frozen section in the grocery stores. Theres different ways to pair them: People dip the Falafel into Hummus, they eat them both with bread or they make a sandwich with Hummus, Falafel, pickles, tomatoes, and cucumbers. Whatever way you choose to pair them up, you need to try them together.\nPicture from https://hadiaslebanesecuisine.com/newsite/\nIf you’ve ever seen Westerns talk about Hummus, you’ve probably realized that they eat it as a vegetable dip, which I personally find really odd. If you do want to get the Arab experience, then never do that and instead eat your Hummus with Pita bread. Pita bread is the most common way people eat Hummus. They basically scoop Hummus with the pita bread. I specially chose pita bread, because unlike other types of bread it is very light so it does not take away from the dish’s main taste, it just complements it.\nTea with mint\nPicture from http://happywedd.com and https://tarasmulticulturaltable.com\nTea is very popular in the Middle East, and in general it is the perfect drink with Arabic breakfast. Arabic tea is usually not heavy red tea and it is paired with mint, which adds this perfect taste. Or sometimes its paired with sage (Marameya in Arabic) instead of mint. You can either drink the tea with your meal, or after the meal. So, if you are gonna eat any form of Arabic breakfast never miss out on the tea, especially when you’re eating the most popular Arabic breakfast dish, Hummus. To get the perfect experience, eat your Hummus with Falafel and pita bread, while you sip your mint tea on the side.\nIf you want to make Arabic tea here are the recipes for both.

This recipe of Hummus, is Hummus in its most basic form, it is also the most commonly eaten since its the easiest to make. But, there are variety of ways to upgrade your Hummus dish. I will share with you 3 ways to upgrade your Hummus dish, not that the basic one on its own isn’t amazing. But, you could use those recipes for times you need a change.

Hummus and meat is called Hummus blahmeh in Arabic (lahmeh is meat). It is usually eaten in Lebanon the most. It is pretty self explanatory, it is literally Hummus topped with meat. You can either top it with ground beef, or beef slices according to your liking. It is a more fulfilling and a heavier version of the basic Hummus recipe. For this recipe you can use the Hummus recipe above. Here is my recipe for Hummus blahmeh but if you’d like a more detailed recipe click here.\nFor this Hummus and Meat recipe, you’ll need the following ingredients.\n1-2 tbsp vegetable oil\n500 grams ground beef\na plate of ready Hummus\n1 green pepper\n1/2 garlic clove\n1 lemon juice\n1. Scoop your Hummus into a plate, and add a layer of canned chickpea pieces on top and set aside. 2. In a pan add your vegetable oil, and add your ground beef. Add a bit of salt, black pepper, paprika, cumin, sumac and ground coriander. Adjust spices to your likes. 3. In a blender add your green pepper, garlic and lemon juice.

Then finally, drizzle a bit of olive oil. 7. Scoop your Hummus with bread and Sahteen!\nPicture from https://littlesunnykitchen.com\nFattet is a Levantine dish, it includes the layering of bread and other ingredients on top of one another. One of the types of Fattet is Fattet Hummus, is either served as a breakfast or as a side dish for lunch or dinner. It is basically the layering of bread, chickpeas and a creamy white sauce. Each layer has a different texture and flavor, but together they form a heavenly taste. It is usually eaten with a spoon unlike Hummus and Hummus blahmeh which are eaten with bread. Here is my recipe but if you’d like a more detailed recipe click here.\nFor this Fattet recipe, you’ll need the following ingredients.\n500 grams of canned chickpeas\n1/2 tsp sodium bicarbonate\n1 kg of yoghurt\n2 garlic cloves\n3 tbsp tahini\nsalt to taste\n1. Drain your chickpeas in a strainer, then add them to a pot. Add water until it fully covers the chickpeas and add 1 tsp of sodium bicarbonate. Let it boil for 20 minutes on low to medium heat, and add water throughout if necessary. 2. In the meantime, add the yoghurt, garlic, tahini and salt and blend them until everything is incorporated and set aside. 3. Cut your pita bread into small squares and add them into a pan, drizzle olive oil on both sides and let it roast in the oven until golden and crunchy. (it usually takes around 10 minutes) 4. Once the chickpeas are cooked, drain them and rinse with cold water and set aside to cool. (Make sure it is not overcooked, and that it retains its round form). 5. In a baking dish add a layer of your roasted bread, then add a layer of your chickpeas, then add your yoghurt sauce, and finish it with another layer of crunchy bread. Drizzle a bit of olive oil on the top, and add a bit of parsley. 6. In a pot add vegetable oil and roast some pine nuts until golden. Once your pine nuts are golden, add them with a bit of their oil into the center of the dish and Sahteen!\nPicture from https://vidarbergum.com\nMsabaha also is a Levantine dish. It is a variation of Hummus and it tastes very similar, almost identical. They both use almost the same exact ingredients but the end result is completely different. The main difference between the two dishes is the consistency. Msabaha is more runny and has chunks of chickpea, unlike hummus which is very creamy and smooth with no chunks. Msabaha is basically chickpeas in a tahini sauce, hence the name. Msabaha means swimming, so the chickpeas are swimming in the tahini sauce. Here’s my recipe, but if you want a more detailed recipe click here.\nFor this Msabaha recipe, you’ll need the following ingredients.\n1 cup ready Hummus (use my recipe above)\n1 cup canned chickpeas\n1/2 cup tahini\n1/4 cup olive oil\n2 green peppers\n2 garlic cloves\n1 bell pepper\n1 and 1/2 lemon’s juice\n1. Chop your garlic, green pepper, and bell pepper roughly. 2. Add your chopped vegetables into a blender, add a dash of salt and blend. Make sure you don’t over blend it, and that there are still chunks. 3. Add your blended vegetables into a bowl, and add your lemon juice and 1 tbsp of olive oil and mix. 4. Get your serving plate, layer it with 1 cup Hummus, then add 1 cup of chickpeas, and add 1/2 cup of tahini and mix them really well. Add your vegetable mix and mix them in. 5. Decorate your plate with a few pieces of chickpea, a drizzle of olive oil and a sprinkle of parsley and Sahteen!\n3 SONGS FOR AMBIENCE\nTo have the full Arabic experience, you need Arabic music.

{"question":"Can you compare the impact of moisture stress on plant health in traditional annual flower gardens versus coco-based growing systems?","answer":"In annual flower gardens, moisture stress is primarily managed through regular watering of 1 to 1.5 inches per week, with flexibility in timing as long as the water reaches the root zone. However, in coco-based growing systems, moisture stress has more significant implications - allowing the growing media to dry completely between irrigations negatively impacts beneficial microbe populations and creates opportunities for harmful organisms to establish themselves. The coco system performs better with constant moisture levels, particularly when combined with regular nutrient feeding, as this stability helps maintain optimal root zone conditions. This difference is due to coco's unique properties and its interaction with nutrient solutions, where maintaining consistent moisture helps sustain the osmotic gradient that encourages plants to produce desirable compounds.","context":["8 Image How To Build A Wooden Boardwalk\nhow to build a wooden boardwalk could be a nice source of color to accent and your house's panorama. Whereas flowering trees and shrubs provide short intervals of shade, most annuals start blooming shortly after planting and proceed to flower for the size of the growing season. Annuals crops are available a variety of colours, sizes and species tailored to both sun or shade. This makes it doable to plant annual flowers nearly anyplace. Annuals are excellent for flowerbeds, borders, pots and window packing containers, hanging baskets or as temporary ground covers and fillers.\nAnnuals are non-woody plants that full their life cycle in one season, ending with seed manufacturing. Some annual plant do reseeds themselves, reminiscent of marigolds and appear to have a perennial habit.\nUse within the Landscape\nAnnual flowers can play an important function in a well-designed landscape. In comparison with most perennial vegetation, annuals require extra maintenance and water, so plant annual beds must be close to water sources and capable of be maintained. Try to preserve annuals in beds with other annuals or vegetation with comparable water requirements. Planting annuals randomly all through the panorama not only increases maintenance, but in addition lessens the plants' aesthetic impression.\nAlthough annual flowers and plants convey a wide range of interesting textures and types to the landscape, they are most notable for the colour they supply. You'll get the most impact in the landscape by planting in a easy combination of color. Color themes utilizing associated colours, resembling red, orange and yellow (heat colors) or inexperienced, blue and purple (cool colors) work nicely. Warm-colored flowers convey pleasure into the landscape and have a tendency to look close to the viewer, making the house wherein they're planted feel smaller. Cool-colored flowers, nonetheless, seem more distant, creating a higher sense of backyard space. Cool colors additionally tend to calm down and soothe viewers.\nUtilizing shades of 1 color (including white) is also a popular and engaging theme. Another pleasing impact comes from using complementary colors - these colours found immediately reverse one another on a color wheel - similar to orange and blue or purple and yellow. These combinations form excessive shade contrasts and create numerous pleasure and interest in the landscape. All the time be aware of surrounding or backdrop colors to realize a coordinated total design. One of the simplest ways to set off annual flower colors and textures is to provide a simple backdrop of green vegetation.\nAnnuals are a superb means to draw attention to constructing and residential entrances, walkways and out of doors dwelling areas and to provide householders and visitors with pleasing \"up-close\" visual and aromatic experiences. Once more, it is important to be selective in inserting annuals so their potential to attract consideration isn't diluted.\nPlant top is another important design consideration. Usually, a flower border has the tallest vegetation in the back, medium height vegetation in the middle and brief vegetation in the entrance. An island planting locations the tallest plants in the course of the mattress, surrounded by vegetation of decreasing heights.\nThe fashion of the annual bed should be suitable with the general fashion of your landscape design. A planting can have both a proper or casual design, depending on the association of the planting. Formal designs, for example, tend to be made up of geometric traces and symmetry, with sturdy focal points that entice the eye. In distinction, casual designs have curved, flowing traces and pure varieties, comply with pure terrain and create an asymmetrical stability throughout the planting.\nBefore planting, the bodily characteristics of the site should be evaluated. Think about the location's soil kind, fertility, drainage and its publicity to solar and wind. Compare site characteristics with particular plant requirements. An annual plant tailored to web site conditions grows and flowers extra vigorously and has fewer pest problems. Some vegetation illiberal of heat and sun might carry out adequately when planted partly shade.\nAnnual flowers provide flexibility in landscape design. Any planting may be changed every growing season, creating an entirely new design. As a part of their fast change potential, annuals can be utilized as a temporary resolution in a problem website.\nSeeds and Plants\nMany annual flowers, akin to marigolds, globe candytuft and zinnias, might be direct-seeded. Others ought to be began indoors and transplanted outside on the appropriate time. Some annuals, corresponding to larkspur, may be fall seeded. Growing seedlings indoors shouldn't be difficult, however does take some effort and a number of other weeks of careful attention. Because it's so a lot simpler and cheaper to get transplants from a garden center, many gardeners are better off buying transplants.\nWhen deciding on transplants, search for stocky plants with dense foliage and rich colors. Avoid seedlings which might be leggy, yellowish or dry wanting. If potential, examine the root system. Most healthy plant roots are white; keep away from purchasing crops with brown or black roots. While it is tempting to decide on blooming vegetation or ones with fruit forming, it is better to pick those that aren't.\nPrepare an annual bed by digging or roto-tilling 8 to 12 inches deep. Amend the soil with organic matter, akin to well-rotted manure, sphagnum peat moss, or compost. Unfold 1 or 2 inches of the organic matter over the soil and 1 to 2 kilos of fertilizer, reminiscent of 5-10-5, per 100 sq. feet of bed and incorporate. Don't over-fertilize, which might trigger excess foliage progress on the expense of flowers. Rake the mattress clean and take away any stones, clods or outdated plant particles before planting.\nSeeds of annual flowers range of their hardiness and ability to germinate below sure soil temperatures. Hardy annuals might be direct-seeded in early spring. Don't seed tender annuals till the soil has warmed to 60° F. As soon as the planting mattress has been ready, make a shallow furrow for planting the seed. Learn the seed packet for correct planting depth. Distribute the seed within the furrow and canopy very lightly with soil or, in case your soil tends to crust over, with a superb layer of vermiculite. Vermiculite won't crust over as soil often does and it permits better seedling institution. Vermiculite can be bought at most backyard center. Water the planting website with a fantastic mist to stop washing away the seed. Keep the mattress moist until the seeds germinate. Newspapers, mattress sheets or floating row-covers can be positioned over the planting site to take care of soil moisture. Decrease watering frequency because the seeds start to germinate. Skinny seedlings before they turn out to be crowded. Extra seedlings can be transplanted to different beds or potted into planters for decks or patios.\nThough some annual plants tolerate cooler conditions, most needs to be planted outdoors only after hazard of frost is previous. Plant in the course of the coolest part of the day, preferably when it is cloudy. Moisten vegetation before eradicating them from their containers. If roots are pot-bound, slightly tear the basis ball to encourage spreading.\nIn case you are utilizing plant-able peat pots, tear them to permit the roots to simply break by the sides. Additionally, tear off the highest rim of the peat pot. This prevents the peat from being uncovered to the air where it can act as a wick and draw moisture away from the soil ball, drying out the plant.\nSet the plants at the really helpful spacing and canopy them with soil to the depth of their container. Firm the soil around the roots and water instantly.\nMost crops reply effectively to pinching at planting time. Pinching, or eradicating the early flowers, permits the plant's power to be used to establish the plant reasonably than help flowers. Pinching additionally induces branching, which can, finally, improve the number of flowering stems. For finest outcomes, pinch out the first and second set of leaves.\nAnnual flowers typically require 1 to 1 1/2 inches of water every week. Be sure the water penetrates to the foundation zone. Generally, hand watering isn't satisfactory to provide ample and uniform quantities of water. Soaker hoses or sprinklers are more passable watering strategies. Soaker hoses are essentially the most environment friendly as a result of there may be little or no runoff, and evaporation and soil compaction are slight. Keep away from overhead watering, notably in the evening. This may promote foliar diseases. Watering in early morning, slightly than at night time can reduce foliar ailments.\nAn annual flower planting could require additional fertilizer in the course of the rising season. If the soil fertility is low, fertilize crops at a charge of 1/2 to 1 pound of 5-10-5 per 100 sq. toes each 4 to 6 weeks. Sprinkle the fertilizer flippantly along the row and scratch it into the soil. Be certain that to make use of an excellent flower or vegetable fertilizer, preferable with no chlorine (Cl). Check the label to verify there is no potassium chloride or muriate or potash listed within the elements. Chlorides on vegetable and annual will scale back fruiting and flowering.\nThough most weeds in landscapes may be adequately controlled with a combination of mulching and cultivation, herbicides can be found to be used in annual flowerbeds. There are numerous good pre-emerge herbicides that can be utilized with transplanted crops.\nBefore spraying or making use of any herbicide or chemical, learn the label carefully to find out whether it is safe to be used on the crops you might be rising.\nPinch off pale blooms no less than weekly to stimulate blooming throughout the season. Trailing plants, corresponding to fibrous begonia, petunias, pansies and coleus, will be pruned to keep the vegetation compact and stimulate extra blooming. Eradicating faded flowers prevents the vegetation from forming seed. Consequently, they'll bloom again in an effort to complete the life cycle.\nAnnual flowers have relatively few insect and illness issues. Nevertheless, specific issues will characteristically develop on some vegetation. Sustaining healthy plant development, spacing vegetation so that they obtain good air circulation, planting in a site with good drainage and solar publicity suited to the plant will usually reduce disease issues. Quick identification of the issue and utility of the right insecticide or fungicide will reduce pest damage.\nAnnual vegetation will add a burst for colour to any yard or landscape. The benefit of progress of most annual vegetation and resistance to disease make them perfect for even probably the most novice of gardeners. A effectively cared for annual flowerbed will be the highlight of your yard and convey you many days of lovely colour to your landscape.

Many growers follow feeding and watering patterns in which they will feed one day and then use only water the next day (and similar variations) but we recommend against this schedule as it causes plant stress.\nHow often you should water the plants will depend on several factors including the size of containers used (smaller pots = more frequent watering), and the grow room temperature and humidity. As a rule of thumb, you should start by watering once per day, and observing the moisture of the coco in the pots for a few days. If you have especially large containers (which won’t dry out as fast as small pots) you may be able to get away with watering only every other day. Additionally, with each individual watering remember to water until you get a generous amount of runoff (10-20%).\nWhy shouldn’t you dry your grow media?\nWe don’t recommend letting the coco dry completely between irrigations. The plants respond better if you provide a constant level of moisture. If your substrate mixture contains a decent amount of perlite (25%) which helps the mix drain, overwatering shouldn’t be too much of a threat, so don’t be afraid to water on days even when the coco has only slightly dried. It is important to note that this “back-and-forth” between moist and dry conditions is very stressful on plant roots. Drying negatively impacts beneficial microbe populations in and around the root zone and creates a greater chance for harmful organisms to take over.\nWhy do we recommend feeding with every watering in coir based media?\nCation exchange capacity (CEC) is a property of soil and soilless media which directly affects nutrient availability. Growers generally use the “water/feed/water/feed” schedule in soil/peat based media mostly because soil cannot hold a lot of provided nutrients and thus salt tends to build up in the grow media. In comparison, because coir’s ability to hold and exchange nutrients with the plant is much greater than most soils, the buildup of salt is reduced in the coir based media.\nTherefore, by feeding with the nutrient solution at every watering, you can maintain relatively uniform chemical conditions at the root zone. Maintaining appropriate levels of dissolved solutes at the root zone (by following application rates listed on the feed sheet) will create an osmotic gradient between the roots and coco. Having dissolved solutes in the root zone technically causes the water to enter the plant at a slower rate, which may sound like a bad thing, but ultimately results in the plant having to “try harder” to overcome the gradient.\nHere is how it works:\n- Applying dissolved solutes (i.e. nutrient solution) to the coco holding the roots will cause less water to enter the plant, because water favors moving towards solutes.\n- The plant will then “compete” by producing its own solutes (like sugars and others) inside the roots, causing the solute concentration inside the plant to increase.\n- Water will then continue to flow into the plant because the plant had to produce these extra solutes, and because water uptake has somewhat decreased.\n- The concentration of these solutes is much greater in the harvestable end-product (these solutes being desirable things like sugars, aromatic compounds, essential oils, etc.), and ultimately the harvested fruits/flowers are more nutritionally dense, have stronger flavors and aromas and generally higher quality.\n- In response to a constant presence of solute/nutrient/salt concentrations around the root zone, plants will synthesize compounds within themselves (often compounds, we growers desire, like nutrients etc.) as a way of “competing” with the soil for water—all to the benefit of the grower, as the harvested end product will end up with a higher concentration of beneficial compounds.\nWhen a “feeding with every watering” schedule is applied (continuously feeding and applying nutrients), the osmotic gradient will continue to exist and the plant will keep producing sugars and other products.\nHowever, when a “water/feed/water/feed” alternate type of schedule is applied, the nutrient concentration in the coco is always changing, bouncing back and forth between high in nutrients on the day of feeding and then being very low the following day. This oscillation between high and low nutrient concentration is stressful on the plants, but is certainly not catastrophic and many growers continue to use the “water/feed/water/feed” method without encountering too many problems. We simply recommend feeding with every watering as the best method to obtain higher end-product quality."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:a120db7c-da08-42b2-8bb2-805da5d3a734>","<urn:uuid:bce960c7-3d16-45d3-8637-a312243c461d>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Which global drug policy reform methods work better? ¿Qué es más efectivo: los cambios radicales o graduales?","answer":"The evidence shows that gradual, evidence-based reforms are more effective. The Global Commission on Drug Policy advocates for pilot programs and different approaches, like those implemented in Portugal, Uruguay, and Holland, rather than radical changes. These countries have demonstrated that careful regulation and decriminalization can work effectively. The Commission emphasizes that there is no one-size-fits-all solution, and each country needs to find its own way forward while learning from successful examples, but continuing the same prohibitionist policies of the last 50 years has proven ineffective.","context":["A number of world leaders call for ending criminalization of drug use and possession and responsible legal regulation of psychoactive substances\nFormer Presidents of Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Poland, Portugal and Switzerland Join With Kofi Annan, Richard Branson, George Shultz, Paul Volcker And Others To Make Bold, New Recommendations for Major Paradigm Shift in Global Drug Policy on the Road to UN Special Session on Drugs in 2016\nNote: the opinions expressed here are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the positions of Dianova International\nOpinion – \"Taking Control\": Pathways to Drug Policies that Work\n(…) A new and improved global drug control regime is needed that better protects the health and safety of individuals and communities around the world. Harsh measures grounded in repressive ideologies must be replaced by more humane and effective policies shaped by scientific evidence, public health principles and human rights standards. This is the only way to simultaneously reduce drug-related death, disease and suffering and the violence, crime, corruption and illicit markets associated with ineffective prohibitionist policies. The fiscal implications of the policies we advocate, it must be stressed, pale in comparison to the direct costs and indirect consequences generated by the current regime.\n(…) The obstacles to drug policy reform are both daunting and diverse. Powerful and established drug control bureaucracies, both national and international, staunchly defend status quo policies. They seldom question whether their involvement and tactics in enforcing drug policy are doing more harm than good. Meanwhile, there is often a tendency to sensationalize each new “drug scare” in the media. And politicians regularly subscribe to the appealing rhetoric of “zero tolerance” and creating “drug free” societies rather than pursuing an informed approach based on evidence of what works. Popular associations of illicit drugs with ethnic and racial minorities stir fear and inspire harsh legislation. And enlightened reform advocates are routinely attacked as “soft on crime” or even “pro-drug.”\nThe good news is that change is in the air. The Global Commission is gratified that a growing number of the recommendations offered in this report are already under consideration, underway or firmly in place around the world. But we are at the beginning of the journey and governments can benefit from the accumulating experience where reforms are being pursued. Fortunately, the dated rhetoric and unrealistic goals set during the 1998 UNGASS on drugs are unlikely to be repeated in 2016. Indeed, there is growing support for more flexible interpretations and reform of the international drug control conventions aligned with human rights and harm reduction principles.\nTaking Control makes seven recommendations which can be summarized as follows:\n- Put health and community safety first through a fundamental reorientation of policy priorities and resources, from failed punitive enforcement to proven health and social interventions.\n- Ensure equitable access to essential medicines, in particular opiate-based medications for pain.\n- Stop criminalizing people for drug use and possession – and stop imposing “compulsory treatment” on people whose only offense is drug use or possession.\n- Rely on alternatives to incarceration for non-violent, low-level participants in illicit drug markets such as farmers, couriers and others involved in the production, transport and sale of illicit drugs.\n- Focus on reducing the power of criminal organizations as well as the violence and insecurity that result from their competition with both one another and the state.\n- Allow and encourage diverse experiments in legally regulating markets in currently illicit drugs, beginning with but not limited to cannabis, coca leaf and certain novel psychoactive substances.\n- Take advantage of the opportunity presented by the upcoming UNGASS in 2016 to reform the global drug policy regime.\nCommission Members: Kofi Annan, former Secretary General of the United Nations and chair of the Kofi Annan Foundation, Ghana – Louise Arbour, former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Canada – Pavel Bém, former Mayor of Prague, Czech Republic – Richard Branson, entrepreneur, advocate for social causes, founder of the Virgin Group, cofounder of The Elders, United Kingdom – Fernando Henrique Cardoso, former President of Brazil (chair) – Maria Cattaui, former Secretary-General of the International Chamber of Commerce, Switzerland – Ruth Dreifuss, former President of Switzerland and Minister of Home Affairs – César Gaviria, former President of Colombia – Asma Jahangir, human rights activist, former UN Special Rapporteur on Arbitrary, Extrajudicial and Summary Executions, Pakistan – Michel Kazatchkine, UN Secretary General Special Envoy on HIV/AIDS in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, and former executive director of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, France – Aleksander Kwasniewski, former President of Poland – Ricardo Lagos, former President of Chile – George Papandreou, former Prime Minister of Greece – Jorge Sampaio, former President of Portugal – George P.

Just before a special UN Conference on drugs, he is calling for their legalization.\nDeutsche Welle: As the President of Colombia (1990 and 1994) you supported the \"war on drugs.\" At that time, did you believe that this war could be won?\nCésar Gaviria: We had to fight the cartels because they had become too powerful. They were putting democratic institutions at risk, killing political candidates and putting bombs in every city of Colombia. But despite the extraordinary effort to confront the cartels, the business keeps going. If we look where we are now, we have to recognize that prohibition is not the solution. We can fight against drugs for decades, but we will still be at the same point or even in a worse situation.\nHow have the cartels become so powerful?\nAs long as the world considers the consumption of drugs as something criminal, the business becomes too big and you have waves of violence damaging whole countries. In the past, this happened to Colombia, and now, it is happening to Mexico. There is insecurity in all Latin-American cities and an increase of violence and homicides. Most of that has to do with local drug consumption, or, in the case of Colombia, Mexico and some Central American countries with international trafficking. It is very clear: Humanity and the international community cannot say that they have been successful in that fight!\nSo the capture of Pablo Escobar didnt affect the power of the drug cartels?\nWe didn't capture him. In 1991, Pablo Escobar submitted to the judiciary of Colombia. He accepted the rules of the laws and the norms of the constitution. So, he went to a prison in Medellin. But as soon as he started not complying with the commitments he had with the Colombian judiciary system, he escaped, and then a group of military and policemen went after him until the Medellin Cartel was totally dismantled.\nColombia has been strengthening its police, military and judiciary for more than 20 years now. It has the largest budget in security in the Americas and the largest army in Latin America. But even doing all that, we are still a hub of drugs! We can say, we have done everything, but the world has to change the policy of criminalizing drug consumption.\nPeople in Latin America are suffering from drug violence every day. Why is it so difficult to get support for a new policy on drugs?\nPublic opinion can change if the governments have some will. In Latin America, there is a real interest in getting changes. Europe already changed policies a long time ago. In the US, those changes are happening now. For example, the relationship to marijuana is the opposite of what it was ten or even five years ago. Peoples' attitudeshave changed. They were totally tired of the policies in place, and they are moving to regulation. But there are other regions in the world that are not interested in changing their drug policies, particularly in Asia and Africa.\nWhat would be the consequences of decriminalizing drug consumption for Latin American cartels? Would they switch to another business?\nMaybe they would switch to other businesses, but that doesn't mean that decriminalization is no good for getting violence out of drugs. You cannot use this excuse not to change your policy. Narco-traffic is by far the best business of the illegal business we have today.\nHow could the peace treaty between the Colombian government and FARC rebels under negotiation now for three years influence the war on drugs?\nIt will be helpful, but it will not solve the problem. Because the problem is not only production or trafficking,;the problem is also the demand for drugs.\nDrug trafficking was one of the financial pillars of FARC…\nYes, it is true. But if FARC rebels stop trafficking drugs, that doesn't mean that narco-trafficking is going to disappear. It is like dismantling a cartel: yes, it is good, it will bring benefits, but it will not solve the problem as a whole.\nEndless war on drugs: Despite the confiscation of tons of cocaine in Cartagena, trafficking continues\nWhat then could be done to diminish the demand for drugs? Could the successful campaign against smoking be adapted and used for prevention against drug abuse?\nIt is necessary to convince people, particularly young people, that consuming drugs is bad and very damaging. It is necessary to move people to an attitude that is different - like it now is with tobacco. For example, Portugal has a much better system than most of the other countries of Europe and the world. They have moved totally to regulation.\nPortugal and Uruguay are two examples of a new drug policy. The international community should follow them?\nA lot of people have said that the decriminalization of the consumption of drugs would end in a tragedy, that overconsumption or violence would be the result. They are wrong. There is not much violence connected with drugs in Europe. Why? Because the criminalization of the consumption of drugs is relatively low.The US has a lot of violence just because the consumption of drugs is something criminal. There is no general solution for the fight against drugs; every country has to find its own way. What is clear is that we need to change the policy of prohibition and criminalization to something more reasonable that brings more results.\nWhat are your expectations about the United Nations General Assembly Special Session on Drugs from April 19-21 in New York?\nI don't have high expectations. What the Global Commission on Drug Policy expects is: Let governments do pilot programs, try different approaches, like those of Portugal, Uruguay or Holland. The worse solution I can imagine is just doing the same that we have been doing over the last 50 years.\nInteview: Astrid Prange\nCésar Augusto Gaviria Trujillo belongs to the group of three former Latin American Presidents (Ernesto Zedillo from Mexico, Fernando Henrique Cardoso from Brazil) that are calling for a new policy on drugs.

Therefore He is good.i\niHere is the Catholic Encyclopedia, which also provides a definition of evil.\n…In a creature, considered as a subject having existence, we distinguish several elements of the goodness which it possesses:\n- Its existence or being, which is the ground of all the other elements.\n- Its powers, activities, and capacities. These are the complement of the first, and they serve it to pursue and appropriate whatever is requisite for and contributory to sustaining its existence, and developing that existence into the fullness of perfection proper to it.\n- Each perfection that is acquired is a further measure of existence for it, hence a good.\n- The totality of these various elements, forming its total good subjectively, that is, its entire being in a state of normal perfection according to its mind, is its good complete. This is the sense of the axiom: omne ens est bonum sibi (every being is a good unto itself).\nThe privation of any of its powers or due perfections is an evil for it, as, for instance, blindness, the loss of the power of sight, is an evil for an animal. Hence evil is not something positive and does not exist in itself; as the axiom expresses it, malum in bono fundatur (evil has its base in good).\n3 Again. It has been proved above that there is an immovable first mover which is God. Now He moves as a mover absolutely immovable: and this moves as the object of desire. Wherefore God, since He is the first immovable mover, is the first object of desire. Now a thing is desired in two ways, either because it is good, or because it seems good. The former is that which is good, for the seeming good does not move per se, but according as it has some appearance of good; whereas the good moves per se. Therefore the first object of desire, which is God, is good.ii\niiThis is a call to review, again, Chapter 13!\n4 Further. The good is that which all things desire, which the Philosopher quotes as very well said. Now all things desire to be in act according to their mode: which is evident from the fact that every thing, by its nature, shrinks from corruption. Wherefore the essential notion of the good is to be in act, and consequently evil which is opposed to good results from the privation of act by potentiality, as the Philosopher declares (9 Metaph.). Now God is a being in act and not in potentiality, as we have proved above. Therefore He is truly good.iii\niiiPontentiality limits goodness? Let’s quote from Ed Feser’s Scholastic Metaphysics: A Contemporary Introduction, pp 36-37:\nTake the roundness of a certain rubber ball, which is actual, but in a limited way insofar as roundness as such is perfect roundness yet the ball’s roundness is not perfect (since there is at least a slight imperfection in even the most carefully made ball), and insofar as roundness, which is of itself a universal, comes to be instantiated in this particular object and in that sense limited to a particular time and place. The Thomist position is that it is only potency which can ultimately account for these limitations on a thing’s actuality…In particular, it is the potency of rubber qua material substance to take on different forms that limits the roundness…\nLet’s don’t forget that the stuff around is a combination of actuality and potentiality.\n5 Moreover. The bestowal of being and goodness proceeds from goodness. This is proved from the very nature of the good, and from the notion it conveys. For the good of a thing is naturally its act and perfection. Now a thing acts through being in act: and by acting it bestows being and goodness on other things. Wherefore it is a sign of a thing’s perfection that it is able to produce its like, as the Philosopher declares (4 Meteor.). Again, the notion of the good is that it is something appetible: and this is an end. And the end moves the agent to act. Hence good is said to be diffusive of self and being. Now, this diffusion is becoming to God: for it has been shown above that He is the cause of being in other things, since He is the per se necessary being. Therefore He is truly good.iv\nivI might have left this argument out except for footnote 10, which points to Aristotle’s Meteorology. Yes, even the ancients were concerned with climate change. In that book we learn such things as “Rawness is its opposite and is therefore an imperfect concoction of the nutriment in the fruit” but also that “Consequently a raw thing is either spirituous or watery or contains both spirit and water.” Aristotle’s science observations are not terrible, given his situation. Consider “Ripening being a kind of perfecting, rawness will be an imperfect state, and this state is due to a lack of natural heat and its disproportion to the moisture that is undergoing the process of ripening.” Ripe is good.\n——————————————————————— Ch. xxviii.\n 2 Ethic. vi.\n iii. 4.\n Ch. xiii.\n Ibid., Since, however, God … p. 31.\n 1 Ethic. i.\n D. 8. ix.\n Ch. xv.\n iii. 1.\n Dionysius, Div.

Something is killing off bees, both the wild bumblebee and its domesticated cousin the honeybee. Scientists believe they have found the reason why. Two diseases that are common in domestic honeybees are being found in the wild bumblebee population. These infections may explain why there has been a recent decline in the global bee population. One of the diseases is the deformed wing virus (DWV). The other disease is a fungal parasite, Nosema Ceranae, a microspore, which was less prevalent according to the researchers.\nA study conducted by Mark J.F. Brown of Royal Holloway University at London, found that the Varroa destructor mite that infects honeybees could be the main culprit of the virus. They looked at 26 different sites across England and found that one in five bees suffered from the DWV. The virus grounds the insect and eventually kills it.\nResearchers further found that 88 percent of the domestic honeybee population actively carries the virus and that the virus replicates. They believe that foraging from the same flowers is what caused the bumblebees to get infected; another way that the infection may be passed along is when the bumblebee raids the competitor’s hives. Brown stated that the bee population has been declining in North and South America, Europe, as well as Asia.\nOne reason that researchers are concerned about the decline in the bee population has to do with the fact that bees commercially pollinate about 90 percent of crops throughout the world. A service that is valued at $14 billion annually. While the honeybee population is important, Brown cautions that the bumblebee population is just as important. He stated that the wild bee population is responsible for a significant fraction of the pollination that takes place. The mystery of what is killing off the bumblebee has been around for the last few decades with major declines in the insect population leaving researchers baffled about what is happening to the bees.\nThe study suggested that at least a third of the honeybee population was infected with the virus, and a full 11 percent of bumblebees are also infected. Other studies suggest that it is not just the virus that the bees are spreading that is causing the widespread disappearance. A blight on the soy bean crop is also believed to have jumped from soy beans into bees in the form of a virus that is adding to the decline.\nAnother study last month suggested that pesticides which are widely used in the United States could be to blame for some of the reduction in the bee population. At least 35 pesticides are linked to compromised immune systems that are causing the bees to be more susceptible to certain types of diseases. In the United Kingdom destruction of the bees’ natural habitat is also playing a pivotal role in the decreasing number of bees. Researchers are anxious to solve the mystery behind what is killing the bees, not just for the bumblebee population, but also because of the long-term ecological effects of these insects becoming extinct.\nBy Rachel Woodruff"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:cffb8eb7-f06e-4126-8215-a77210365a1c>","<urn:uuid:87da8f6d-fb5c-43cc-bbd8-e64cc5affb9c>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do the geographic comparison methods differ between using MAPfrappe to overlay outlines and following Rome's walking tours to understand city layout?","answer":"The geographic comparison methods differ significantly. MAPfrappe uses a technical approach where users draw outlines on one map that are then overlaid onto another location with precise size preservation, accounting for projection distortions and latitude differences. In contrast, Rome's walking tours offer a ground-level experiential comparison method where distances and relationships between landmarks are understood through actual physical navigation - following specific streets like Via del Corso or Via della Conciliazione to connect major sites like the Pantheon, Roman Forum, and Vatican, providing a practical but less precise way to understand spatial relationships.","context":["Welcome to MAPfrappe, my interactive site for cartographic “mixtures.” I hope you find it interesting!\n— Kelvin Thompson\nUse this page to compare sizes of different things in the world: cities, provinces, parks, buildings, countries, etc. You draw an outline in the top map, and it appears overlaid the bottom map – at appropriate size.\nFor example, you can sketch an outline of California in the “Reference Map” below, and then overlay the outline over Italy in the “Comparison Map.” The outline in the top map stays centered in the bottom map.\nYou need basic knowledge of Google Maps interactions to get the most out of this web page.\n1) Click on the top, “Reference” map to draw an outline.

Check out the beautiful interior of colorful marble and marvel at the Oculum, which allows daylight to flood the interior.\nWalk from the Piazza della Rotonda south along the left (as you look at the Pantheon) side of the building to the Piazza della Minerva. Admire Bernini’s Elephant sculpture and briefly check out the interior of the Santa Maria sopra Minerva Church, then continue south on the Via de Cestari. Turn left onto the Corso Vittorio Emanuele II which becomes Via del Plebescito before it empties into the Piazza Venezia.\nTake a right as you enter the very busy square and head directly for the “Wedding Cake,” the Vittorio Emanuele II Monument. He is famous for uniting the various city-states into a single country.\nStay to the right of the monument and climb the second set of stairs (ramp) to the famous Michelangelo-designed Campidoglio. Surrounding the square are buildings of the Capitoline Museum (worth a visit) and Rome’s City Hall.\nContinue past the square (stay to the left) to the entrance to the Roman Forum. Pick up an audio guide or a map of the area and wander the center of Ancient Rome for an hour or two. It is difficult not to be in awe while walking on the same marble streets that Julius Caesar, Cicero, Augustus, and other famous Romans walked.\nEnd your tour of the Forum at the eastern end and marvel at the remarkably well-preserved Arch of Constantine. Then head beyond it to the iconic and incredible architecture of the Colosseum, Rome’s amphitheater built in 79 AD. Tour the arena (order tickets in advance to avoid the long lines), lamenting the loss of almost all of its beautiful white marble, but remaining astonished that so much has been preserved.\nFrom the Colosseum, walk to the northeast to visit the Domus Aureus, Nero’s famous “golden house,” then backtrack and travel northwest along the Via del Fori Imperiali to see Caesar’s Forum, about ½ mile on left and Trajan’s Forum, further along on the right.\nContinuing in the same direction brings you back to the Piazza Venezia.\nA Walk to the Vatican\nFrom the Piazza della Rotonda (in front of the Pantheon), walk west along the Via Salvatore Giustiani which ends at the Corso Rinasimento. Cross the street, take a left then a right through the first alleyway into the fabulous Piazza Navona. This oval square once held chariot races.Check out the beautiful fountains and be sure to spend some time at an outdoor café, people-watching and soaking up the ambience of the Eternal City.\nExit to the south (at the open end of the piazza) and soon cross the major thoroughfare, Corso Vittorio Emanuele II. Continue southward several blocks to the Campo dei Fiori, Rome’s old flower market where locals still shop for various foods and sundries.\nTurn right and follow the Via del Pellegrino, then turn right on Via Dei Bianchi which changes names several times and crosses the Corso V Emanuele II on its way toward the Tiber River.\nCross the Ponte Sant Angelo to Hadrian’s Tomb (Castel Sant Angelo). After a brief visit, head west along the regal Via della Conciliazione which leads to the Piazza San Pietro and Saint Peter’s Cathedral, in Vatican City.\nVisit the Vatican Museum first – entrance can be reached by turning right at the Piazza and following the line of people (be sure to get tickets online prior to arrival to avoid a long wait), then check the incredible cathedral whose dome was also designed by Michelangelo.\nFountains, Steps, and Parks\nBeginning at the Piazza della Rotonda (in front of the Pantheon), walk eastward along the Via Seminario to Rome’s premier shopping street, the Via del Corso. Take a left, then a right onto the Via della Muratte which empties at the most famous fountain in Rome, the Trevi Fountain. After throwing your coins and taking the obligatory photos, return to Via del Corso and turn right. Continue north to Via Condotti, famous for its expensive designer shops. Turn right and run the gauntlet past these enticing shops to the Piazza di Spagna, which contains the Spanish Steps, one of Rome’s most popular gathering places.\nClimb the steps and emerge on the Viale della Trinita dei Monti, take a right, then left on Via Francesco Crispi, which leads to the entrance to the Villa Borghese.

{"question":"What are the key differences in longevity and growing conditions between the Japanese Zelkova and Colorado Spruce when planted outside their native regions?","answer":"When planted outside their native regions, these trees show marked differences in longevity and adaptation. The Japanese Zelkova adapts well to various conditions, thriving in USDA zones 5-8, tolerating drought, and requiring minimal supplemental watering once established. The Colorado Spruce, while capable of living over 100 years in its native area, often lives no longer than 25 years when planted outside its natural range. Additionally, when the Colorado Spruce is planted in areas with higher moisture and humidity than its native low-humidity environment, it becomes susceptible to serious fungal diseases like needle cast and canker, which can severely impact its health and appearance. Both trees prefer full sun, but the Colorado Spruce specifically performs better when planted in open, sunny, and windy locations to reduce disease problems.","context":["The Japanese Zelkova (Zelkova serrata) has come to some fame as a stand-in for the disease ravaged American Elm. While it can never truly replace the American Elm, it is a lovely tree on its own merits.\nThis tree is a native of East Asia that has been in use in ornamental horticulture in the west since the 19th century. It has only been in the past fifty years or so, however, that the zelkova has skyrocketed to popularity due. This is largely due to its similarity in form and stature when compared with the American elm and the fact that it is highly resistant to Dutch Elm Disease and the Elm Leaf Beetle.\nBoth trees are vase-shaped and can grow to have a 100-foot spread while offering pleasing fall color. The two trees are also in the family Ulmaceae but from different genera. When looking to replace the stately American elm as a shade tree or street tree, people look towards the Japanese Zelkova, and it does well enough, but it lacks in some significant areas.\nThe primary concern that Japanese Zelkova presents is how easily it breaks. A habit the species has is the tendency to grow multiple leaders while having very fragile wood. Having multiple leaders is a genetic weakness in the species that is somewhat solved in some available cultivars but not in the wild type. If searching for a Japanese zelkova, it is crucial to buy a tree with a single trunk or leader, or the tree will eventually experience breakage at the tree’s crotch later in its lifespan.\nAnother area the tree falls behind the American Elm in is ecology. As a non-native tree, Japanese Zelkova doesn't support native caterpillar species, isn't a host for the larvae of pollinating butterflies or moths, and doesn't provide food for birds.\nIf you are passionate about supporting native wildlife and ecology, as a substitute, consider planting a disease-resistant variety of American Elm or another native like a Black Cherry or Red Oak instead.\nHowever, growing a Japanese Zelkova as a specimen, shade tree, or street tree is a good idea if the right tree is chosen and cared for properly. It can provide a beautiful shady location and a dazzling burst of color in the fall.\n|Botanical Name||Zelkova serrata|\n|Common Name||Japanese zelkova|\n|Mature Size||50-80 ft. tall.|\n|Sun Exposure||Full Sun|\n|Soil Type||Average, Good Drainage|\n|Soil pH||Prefers Neutral Soil|\n|Hardiness Zone||USDA 5-8|\n|Native Area||East Asia|\nJapanese Zelkova Care\nAlthough this is a versatile tree, be prepared to put in the maintenance, particularly when it comes to pruning. You will want to keep your Japanese zelkova from becoming damaged as this can cause more significant issues down the road.\nThe Japanese Zelkova thrives in full sun to partial shade. The sunnier the location, the better the fall colors will be.\nOne positive aspect to the Japanese Zelkova, and a reason it makes a terrific street tree, is that it tolerates drought very well and does not need much supplemental watering after it has been planted.\nTo establish the tree, give it a good thorough soaking weekly for the first season to the point of ground saturation. Infrequent, deep saturation is better than quick and often when watering newly planted trees.\nTemperature and Humidity\nThe Japanese Zelkova is relatively cold hardy and can thrive in most temperate regions of the United States. The ideal USDA zones for the zelkova are 5 through 8.\nJapanese Zelkovas require no regular supplemental fertilizer. If the tree is not performing well, it might be wise to amend the soil to provide a bit of a boost. Test your soil to establish the best type of amendments to handle any soil deficiencies that may be occurring.\nThe zelkova requires pruning to develop the structure to avoid breakage. While in the nursery, it is essential to select a tree that has a single leader. The species will continue to grow branches that bunch and split inward towards the leader, creating deep “V-Shaped” crotches. These branches need to be pruned yearly in the late fall through late winter to eliminate these extreme V-shapes.","Growzone: 2 - 7\nYou are currently in growzone:\n|Bare Root Prices|\n|12\" - 18\"||$2.75||$2.00|\n|24\" - 36\"||SOLD OUT||SOLD OUT|\n|18\" - 24\"||SOLD OUT||SOLD OUT|\n|2' - 3'||$25.00||$23.00|\n|3' - 4'||$35.00||$35.00|\nThe Colorado Spruce is a slow growing (6-12 inches per year) evergreen that has a needle that can be green, bluish, or bluish silver that are about 1 inch long. Color can be very variable and the needles are very sharp and can really “poke” when mowing around larger plants. It does not shed its needles but keeps them for 10 years or longer, with its branches extending to the ground. This tree is a native of the high plains, low humidity areas from New Mexico to Wyoming.\nIt will grow to 60 ft tall and 15 ft wide and is very wind firm due to its large spreading root system and tough flexible wood. This tree can live a long life (100 years+) in its native area, outside of that it varies greatly and many times live no longer than 25 years. In the wild around Durango, Colorado many spectacular species grow over 100 ft tall. Due to its shape, heavy snow and ice storms cause little damage. Deer will not normally eat this species unless nothing else is available.\nIt will grow well in hardiness zones from 2-7 and will do quite well in poor soils that other spruce do not like. It is very drought resistant needing only 15″ or less per year of rain and can tolerate hot dry summers better than many other spruce species. It seems not to care about soil PH as will grow slowly in all of them.\nThe Colorado Spruce as been extensively planted throughout the USA and is hard to find a landscape without at least one plant in it. Has been planted for windbreaks in the past because many nurseries carried only this evergreen. When planted by itself out in the sun and wind, the disease problems are reduced but not eliminated. When this tree is taken out of its natural range of low humidity and rainfall and planted in a windbreak, problems occur.\nWith more moisture, and less sun and wind present, this species develops 2 serious disease problems: needle cast and canker which are fungal diseases. It usually starts at the bottom with dead branches and spreads up the tree, with white sap oozing out of the trunk. I have seen trees as small as 3ft having this disease. Does not seem to completely kill the tree, many times a 30 ft tree has only 3 ft at the top that is green. With no windbreak protection and being totally ugly, most people cut them down.\nI have seen beautiful Colorado Blue Spruce windbreaks get about 25 ft tall and then in only a couple of years they are all dead from needlecast.\nA 2ft tall-potted tree can be 5 ft tall in 5 years, in good soil, with adequate moisture, and weed and grass control around the base.

{"question":"What are the key differences between Romanticism and Dark Romanticism in terms of their views on human nature and morality?","answer":"Romanticism and Dark Romanticism have fundamentally opposing views on human nature and morality. Romanticism believes that the individual is primarily good and emphasizes emotions, intuition, and the worship of nature over logic and facts. In contrast, Dark Romanticism emphasizes human fallibility and the predisposition to sin, taking a more pessimistic view of human nature. Dark Romantic works often deal with themes of judgment, guilt, sin, and self-destruction, as exemplified in works like Moby-Dick and The Scarlet Letter, while traditional Romantic works focus on individual freedoms of expression and reject strict religious traditions and moral rules.","context":["We're not talking love novels here. Romanticism is an influential genre that caused many subsequent genres to emerge. We hope this guide is particularly helpful for students and teachers to teach and learn its roots and exemplary works.\nRomanticism is totally different from Romance novels. Inspired by the German Strum und Drang (storm and stress), the movement was a reaction to the constraints of rationalism and scientific thought from the Enlightenment. Romanticism is the belief that emotions and intuition are more important than logic and facts; the individual comes first and is primarily good, and nature is meant to be worshipped. Contrast this with Realism (its polar opposite) and Dark Romanticism-- both emphasize human fallibility (they are pessimists). Lyrical Ballads (1798) by William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge marked the beginning of the Romantic Age. Soon followed Sir Walter Scott with his chivalrous, medieval tales about King Arthur and his Knights, in The Talisman. To be considered a Romantic author, one must be an optimist, focus on feelings, the senses, imagination, and generally enjoy describing his/her experiences in the natural environment, particularly enjoy individual freedoms of expression. Romantics reject strict religious traditions and prescribed moral rules.\nThe genre of Romanticism in art, literature, and music emerged in Europe in the late 18th century to early 19th century and migrated to America, influencing politics, art, and particularly American literature between 1830-1865. Romantic writing styles focused on the effects of events (spiritual forces) rather than facts or details, created imaginery worlds, relied on contrasts (e.g., good vs. evil, light vs. dark), and saw God as an external force. Romanticism led to the Transcendental Movement, very similar in their embrace of the innate goodness of man, except Transcendentalists felt man had a personal relationship with God and could achieve perfection. This prompted a reaction: Dark Romanticism (we are predisposed to sin) and its even darker cousin, Gothic Literature (torment, graphic morbidity, and the supernatural).\nExemplary Romantic Prose Authors: James Fenimore Cooper (The Last of the Mohicans), Nathaniel Hawthorne (The Scarlet Letter), Herman Melville (Moby-Dick; or the Whale), Alexandre Dumas (The Count of Monte Cristo), Hans Christian Andersen (The Little Match Girl), Victor Hugo (Les Miserables), Oscar Wilde (The Selfish Giant), and Louisa May Alcott (Little Women).\nMany of the works referenced above cross into the genre of Dark Romanticism, as their characters confront self-destructive forces and societal norms.\nMoby-Dick; or, The Whale by Herman Melville is one of the most recognized novels in the genre of Dark Romanticism. Melville's Captain Ahab is the prototype of human fallibility, and he draws upon amble Biblical allusions (including his character names) centering on themes of judgement, guilt, sin, souls, and the end of the world. See Moby-Dick - Study Guide\nThe Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne exemplifies Dark Romanticism in its themes of imposed judgement and punishment for those who commit sin, resulting in alienation and self-destruction. Hawthorne's most famous novel examined the human soul and our morality-- certainly a cautionary tale about the dangers of well-intended social reform and blind religious fervor. While Hawthorne dappled in numerous genres, including Transcendentalism and Romanticism, he found his niche in Dark Romanticism, albeit on the less pessimistic side. He believed that for all of our weaknesses, hypocrisy and suffering, \"the truth of the human heart\" usually prevails.\nEmily Dickinson challenged the definitions of poetry and exemplify Romanticism, particularly Dark Romanticism. It's well-known that she led an increasingly reclusive life, afflicted by severe depression, and never saw success during her lifetime (she died at 56). Yet, her creative energy, willingness to fight conventions (no titles, short lines), and prolific writing (she published nearly 1,800 poems in her lifetime) established her literary prowess and blazed a trail for other poets and women writers to follow.\nTwo American short story authors whose works were published after 1870 deserve inclusion as part of the American Romantic Movement: O. Henry and Kate Chopin. Their respective canons offer characters with emotional complexity, intuition, and an ability to express individual freedoms in the face of repressive forces or social conventions.\nThe etymology of the word \"Romanticism\" is from the Latin word \"romant\" which means \"in the Roman manner.\" It became known as a style of art, literature, and music that drew on emotions, intuition, and imagination, rather than rationality and science.\nAmerican authors embracing the Romantic Movement were most prolific between 1830-1870. The country was in its infancy as an independent nation, the industrial revolution brought many practical and efficient inventions, and \"manifest destiny\" was on full-tilt. Americans wanted to break away from European thoughts and philosophies to create unique forms of emotional expressions. Two opposing sub-genres emerged that were uniquely American: the optimists who believed in human goodness and spirituality, grew in to the Transcendentalism Movement; the pessimists, who embraced human fallibility and our predisposition towards sin, grew into the Dark Romantic Movement. Authors such as Nathaniel Hawthorne wrote about free choice and the wrongful persecution of minorities in America, as in The Scarlet Letter.\nDuring the American Romantic Movement, the short story emerged as a particularly well-suited American form of writing, celebrating the freedom of individuals, the rise of the common man after industrialization, and expressions of hope and promise, in a compact story, rather than a lengthy, laborious novel. These stories were often published in serial form in newspapers and magazines, making them more accessible to a broad range of American readers.

Romanticism is an influential genre that caused many subsequent genres to emerge. We hope this guide is particularly helpful for students and teachers to teach and learn its roots and exemplary works.\nRomanticism is totally different from Romance novels. Inspired by the German Strum und Drang (storm and stress), the movement was a reaction to the constraints of rationalism and scientific thought from the Enlightenment. Romanticism is the belief that emotions and intuition are more important than logic and facts; the individual comes first and is primarily good, and nature is meant to be worshipped. Contrast this with Realism (its polar opposite) and Dark Romanticism-- both emphasize human fallibility (they are pessimists). Lyrical Ballads (1798) by William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge marked the beginning of the Romantic Age. Soon followed Sir Walter Scott with his chivalrous, medieval tales about King Arthur and his Knights, in The Talisman. To be considered a Romantic author, one must be an optimist, focus on feelings, the senses, imagination, and generally enjoy describing his/her experiences in the natural environment, particularly enjoy individual freedoms of expression. Romantics reject strict religious traditions and prescribed moral rules.\nThe genre of Romanticism in art, literature, and music emerged in Europe in the late 18th century to early 19th century and migrated to America, influencing politics, art, and particularly American literature between 1830-1865. Romantic writing styles focused on the effects of events (spiritual forces) rather than facts or details, created imaginery worlds, relied on contrasts (e.g., good vs. evil, light vs. dark), and saw God as an external force. Romanticism led to the Transcendental Movement, very similar in their embrace of the innate goodness of man, except Transcendentalists felt man had a personal relationship with God and could achieve perfection. This prompted a reaction: Dark Romanticism (we are predisposed to sin) and its even darker cousin, Gothic Literature (torment, graphic morbidity, and the supernatural).\nExemplary Romantic Prose Authors: James Fenimore Cooper (The Last of the Mohicans), Nathaniel Hawthorne (The Scarlet Letter), Herman Melville (Moby-Dick; or the Whale), Alexandre Dumas (The Count of Monte Cristo), Hans Christian Andersen (The Little Match Girl), Victor Hugo (Les Miserables), Oscar Wilde (The Selfish Giant), and Louisa May Alcott (Little Women).\nMany of the works referenced above cross into the genre of Dark Romanticism, as their characters confront self-destructive forces and societal norms.\nMoby-Dick; or, The Whale by Herman Melville is one of the most recognized novels in the genre of Dark Romanticism. Melville's Captain Ahab is the prototype of human fallibility, and he draws upon amble Biblical allusions (including his character names) centering on themes of judgement, guilt, sin, souls, and the end of the world. See Moby-Dick - Study Guide\nThe Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne exemplifies Dark Romanticism in its themes of imposed judgement and punishment for those who commit sin, resulting in alienation and self-destruction. Hawthorne's most famous novel examined the human soul and our morality-- certainly a cautionary tale about the dangers of well-intended social reform and blind religious fervor. While Hawthorne dappled in numerous genres, including Transcendentalism and Romanticism, he found his niche in Dark Romanticism, albeit on the less pessimistic side. He believed that for all of our weaknesses, hypocrisy and suffering, \"the truth of the human heart\" usually prevails.\nEmily Dickinson challenged the definitions of poetry and exemplify Romanticism, particularly Dark Romanticism. It's well-known that she led an increasingly reclusive life, afflicted by severe depression, and never saw success during her lifetime (she died at 56). Yet, her creative energy, willingness to fight conventions (no titles, short lines), and prolific writing (she published nearly 1,800 poems in her lifetime) established her literary prowess and blazed a trail for other poets and women writers to follow.\nTwo American short story authors whose works were published after 1870 deserve inclusion as part of the American Romantic Movement: O. Henry and Kate Chopin. Their respective canons offer characters with emotional complexity, intuition, and an ability to express individual freedoms in the face of repressive forces or social conventions.\nThe etymology of the word \"Romanticism\" is from the Latin word \"romant\" which means \"in the Roman manner.\" It became known as a style of art, literature, and music that drew on emotions, intuition, and imagination, rather than rationality and science.\nAmerican authors embracing the Romantic Movement were most prolific between 1830-1870. The country was in its infancy as an independent nation, the industrial revolution brought many practical and efficient inventions, and \"manifest destiny\" was on full-tilt. Americans wanted to break away from European thoughts and philosophies to create unique forms of emotional expressions. Two opposing sub-genres emerged that were uniquely American: the optimists who believed in human goodness and spirituality, grew in to the Transcendentalism Movement; the pessimists, who embraced human fallibility and our predisposition towards sin, grew into the Dark Romantic Movement. Authors such as Nathaniel Hawthorne wrote about free choice and the wrongful persecution of minorities in America, as in The Scarlet Letter.\nDuring the American Romantic Movement, the short story emerged as a particularly well-suited American form of writing, celebrating the freedom of individuals, the rise of the common man after industrialization, and expressions of hope and promise, in a compact story, rather than a lengthy, laborious novel. These stories were often published in serial form in newspapers and magazines, making them more accessible to a broad range of American readers. Expanding literacy to \"the masses\" fit within America's political and moral values as well.\nExplain the specific qualities of each quote as an exemplar of Romanticism:\nI sang of the dancing stars, I sang of the daedal earth, And of heaven, and the giant wars, And love, and death, and birth.” -- Percy Pysshe Shelley's Hymn of Pan\nAnd of his fame forgetful! so his fame Should share in nature's immortality, A venerable thing! and so his song Should make all nature lovelier, and itself Be lov'd, like nature!\" -- Samuel Taylor Coleridge's The Nightingale, A Conversational Poem\nFor you bouquets and ribbon'd wreaths-for you the shores a-crowding; For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning; Here Captain! dear father!

{"question":"Could you explain why the governance of water infrastructure and women's participation in decision-making are crucial for sustainable development outcomes?","answer":"The governance of water infrastructure and women's participation in decision-making are crucial because when women are not in positions of power, decisions often don't benefit them. For instance, in many areas, water infrastructure is controlled by male cartels who inflate prices, creating accessibility barriers. Additionally, without women's involvement in project design and deciding infrastructure placement, critical safety and accessibility concerns may be overlooked. This connects to the broader human rights framework where States are obligated to work towards universal access to water without discrimination. The documents emphasize that infrastructure projects must be examined from a gender perspective from the start, and that water should be treated not just as a resource to be managed, but as a fundamental human right requiring inclusive governance and decision-making processes.","context":["Notes of meeting, Washington DC, September 23\nSponsors: Roger Morier and Robert Bisset, Sustainable Development Network – World Bank Group\nPanellists: Haifa Abu Ghazaleh (Minister of Tourism and Antiquities, Jordan), Michelle Bachelet (Executive Director, UN Women, United Nations), Gunilla Carlsson (Minister, International Development Cooperation, Sweden), Jane Weru (Executive Director and Founding Member, Akiba Mashinani Trust, Kenya)\nTopic: Infrastructure is a critical component in economic growth and poverty reduction. So are policies to promote gender inclusion in policy making and implementation. Yet the issues surrounding the intersection of gender and infrastructure are not often examined. This session used real-world examples to explore how gender and infrastructure impact each other for the benefit of both, and development in general.\nKey questions addressed included: What is the symbiotic relationship between gender and infrastructure? How can the international development community take this agenda further for better development outcomes? How is gender main-streaming currently taking place in the work of sustainable development at the World Bank, particularly in the wake of the World Development Report 2012 on gender equality and the IDA 16 targets?\nWhen I first asked someone at a public works about their gender work, they looked at me like I was crazy. If we could provide clean energy to women, they would have time freed up. Infrastructure is important because for instance if you put facilities for boys and girls, parents are in refugee camps, it is important where water and sanitation is placed to keep women safe. If you build a road, will it give rural women producers better market access and make them more comfortable sending girls to schools? Too often women are not being included in design of projects and deciding what type of infrastructure they want and where. If women are included and have ownership over a project they will take care of it.\nIf women are not in positions of power decisions are made that don’t benefit women. But we should also acknowledge that not all women are gender sensitive. We also can’t leave all gender issues to a gender affairs person. We need finance ministers and others to bring up and support this. Women do not just speak about gender- we have ideas on many issues. For example, I was a health minister. But no one thought of me as a possible president until I was in charge of the military.\nHaifa Abu Ghazaleh\nMost infrastructure projects all over the world are gender blind. But when we look closely women benefit in some specific ways but are also impacted as well. These projects must be looked at from a gender perspective from the first moment.\nNeed to spur growth to combat poverty. Water and sanitation is not just about the needs of a family but makes life easier for women and gives them more dignity when they have good sanitation. Information and communications technology- new innovations are enabling women to participate more politically and economically.\nInfrastructure is key especially when it comes to the urban poor. In many areas you have water controlled by a male cartel and they charge 4 or 5 times the normal price and it is a barrier to women. We must look at putting in infrastructure and the governance of it. Who benefits? Is it the woman or the cartel running it? We have to target infrastructure that really makes a difference to households. It is not straight forward, many live in squatter communities and it is complicated to do things like laying pipes.\nThe issue of land tenure goes together with infrastructure. In Kenya we are working with the World Bank on a relocation action plan. We have had to interact with every household. We discovered that the railroad line was the main way in and out of the area and people walked on it. Thousands of houses have been set up along the railroad lines","“Water is a basic human right and is fundamental to human dignity… Today, three in ten of the world’s people have no access to safe drinking water. Six in ten lack safely managed sanitation services. If people cannot enjoy their right to water, they cannot enjoy their right to life.”\nMichelle Bachelet, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights,\n19 March 2019, Statement at World Water Day: “Leave No One Behind”\nGlobally, 2.1 billion people lack access to safe, readily available water at home, and 4.5 billion people lack safely managed sanitation. Despite progress, significant challenges still remain for the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goal 6 and in addressing huge inequalities between and within countries in accessing basic water and sanitation services.\nAchieving the 2030 Agenda and its promise of ‘leaving no one behind’ requires a people-centred focus grounded in international human rights; an integrated approach among the social, economic and environmental dimensions of sustainable development; and partnership among all stakeholders. Addressing the challenges of the SDG 6 requires a paradigm shift – water should be regarded not just as a natural resource to be managed and used, but as a fundamental human right to which all people are entitled without discrimination.\nKey aspects of human rights to water and sanitation\nAccess to safe, affordable and reliable drinking water and sanitation services are basic human rights. They are indispensable to sustaining healthy livelihoods and maintaining people’s dignity. Human rights to water and sanitation are essential for eradicating poverty, building peaceful and prosperous societies, and ensuring that ‘no one is left behind’ on the road towards sustainable development.\nInternational human rights law obliges States to work towards achieving universal access to water and sanitation for all, without any discrimination, while prioritizing those most in need. The key elements of the rights to water and sanitation are:\n- quality and safety; and\nLearn more about the human rights to water and sanitation.\nOur work on water and sanitation\nUN Human Rights works, in line with the\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the\nSecretary-General’s Call to Action for Human Rights, to promote the practical realization of human rights to water and sanitation and the human rights-based approach to the implementation of SDG 6.

This technique is particularly beneficial for greenhouses that want to reuse soil and for farmers with expensive crops. It's also especially helpful when growing seeds, stem cuttings, or transplanting juvenile plants, as it eliminates harmful organisms and fungal diseases that could infect the garden.","context":["How To Sterilize Soil: 6 Ways To Eliminate Diseases And Bugs\nWhether growing small plants in a pot by your window or preparing for your new outdoor crops season, you might wonder how to protect your soil against potential diseases and bugs. If this is the case, sterilization can be the answer to your question.\nSterilizing eradicates harmful microorganisms in the earth and keeps your plants healthy. If you don’t know how to sterilize soil properly, read on to discover gardening101.net!\nSoil Sterilization – An Overview\nWhat Is Soil Sterilization?\nSoil sterilization is a farming technique that eradicates weed roots, fungus gnats, mites, and other diseases and bugs. Sterilization protects your crops from being destroyed by plant diseases and allows healthier plant growth. This process is popular among commercial greenhouses, farmers, and agricultural sectors.\nThere are pros and cons specific to each sterilizing method. But as long as you carefully follow the procedures, you can minimize the harm and bring the most out of sterilization for the entire garden.\nWhat Are The Benefits Of Soil Sterilization?\nFirst and foremost, sterilization is cheaper and less time-consuming. It costs less than disease treatments and reduces the need for regular soil replacement. This technique is especially helpful for greenhouses that want to reuse earth and for farmers with expensive crops.\nIf you need to grow seed and stem, cut shoot, or transplant juvenile plants, the last thing you want is harmful organisms and fungal diseases in non-sterile soil infecting your garden. In such cases, sterilization for fresh soil comes off as a big help.\nDoes Soil Sterilization Harm Your Garden?\nIn short, yes, it does. Sterilization doesn’t discriminate, so it also wipes out the good bacteria and beneficial soil organisms that bring nutrients to the plants. Besides, strong and mature plants can withstand unsterilized earth, making sterilization redundant for gardens of this crop type.\nHow To Sterilize Soil – The Six Ultimate Methods\nSterilizing Soil Using Chemical Treatment\nThe basis for chemical sterilization is gas: you let the unsterilized soil absorb the gas from the chemical to kill the bacteria. This method takes less effort and works well on outdoor fields. However, it can be harmful and ineffective if not done carefully.\nThe two most popular chemicals used for this technique are hydrogen peroxide and formalin.\nHydrogen peroxide, though relatively safe, can still harm your skin and therefore requires careful use. It needs to be watered down before applying to the earth, and the denser the solution is, the less you should use.\nNevertheless, this method is advantageous for its simplicity. You will only need two steps to carry it out:\n- Mix hydrogen peroxide with plenty of water. How much hydrogen peroxide you need depends on how much water you have and how dense the solution is. Several HP solutions are on the market, but the most popular ones come with 3% and 35% concentrations.\n- Apply the solution to the layers of soil.\nFormalin is diluted formaldehyde, which works well against fungus but not as much against pests like gnats. Like the previous chemical, formalin-based sterilization is pretty straightforward, with only three steps:\n- Add formalin to hot water using the ratio of 1 part formalin 38%-40%, 49 parts water.\n- Apply the mixture to the houseplant soil. The more thoroughly it’s done, the better it is. Ideally, you should aim for 5 gallons of diluted formalin per square yard.\n- Wait for 20-40 days for the sterilization to take part.\nKeep in mind that you should use formalin under warm conditions since this chemical does not fumigate at low temperatures.\nSterilizing Soil Using Heating Methods\nHeat-based sterilization is an environment-friendly, effective and accessible method for anyone. However, it’s more tedious than chemical sterilization and doesn’t work well with large outdoor fields.\nThe four popular devices used in this category are microwaves, ovens, steams, and the sun.\nFor this method, you will go through 5 steps:\n- Place some cups of water in a stockpot or pressure cooker.\n- Fill a container with earth and use aluminum foil to cover the top. Then, put the container on a rack in the pot with water beneath.\n- Put the lid on the pot or close the steam valve of the pressure cooker. Then, begin boiling the water.\n- If you’re using a stockpot, wait for 30 minutes. If you’re using a pressure cooker, let it sit at 10 pounds of pressure for 15-30 minutes.\n- Turn off the heat and wait until the soil has cooled down to remove it.\nThese are four steps to sun sterilization. If you are working on an outdoor garden, you can skip steps 1 and 2.\n- Identify a land area that receives at least 8 hours of sunlight per day.\n- Put a large sheet of plastic on the area and spread the dirt onto the sheet.\n- Moisturize the soil and place the second sheet of plastic on it. Hold down the sheet with rocks to make a seal. For gardeners, burying the sheet corners can work as well.\n- Wait several weeks for sterilization to take place. The hotter the weather is, the less you will have to wait.\nUsing An Oven\nThere are seven steps for this method:\n- Preheat the oven to 180 degrees Fahrenheit.\n- Put the ground on the roasting pan or baking sheet until it reaches 3-4 inches deep.\n- Moisturize the soil until it can be rolled into a ball. Break up the clumps to create a smooth surface.\n- Poke a hole in the aluminum foil and use it to cover the baking sheet. The hole makes space for the thermometer later in the process.\n- Heat the ground in the oven until it reaches 180 degrees. You should use a thermometer to track the temperature. Make sure not to let it get over 180 degrees since it will burn and produce toxins.\n- Leave the ground in the oven for 30 minutes. Occasionally adjust the temperature or open the door to control the heat.\n- Take the ground out of the oven and let it sit at room temperature.\nThe steps for microwave sterilization are as below:\n- Put damp soil mix into a container or a thick plastic bag.\n- For the container, cover it with a lid with ventilation holes. For the bag, keep it open. Put both into the microwave.\n- Microwave for 90-150 seconds.\n- Measure the ground’s temperature, which should be around 180-200 degrees Fahrenheit.\n- If it has reached the right temperature, take it out of the microwave. Then, seal the bag or the container lid’s holes.\n- Let the ground sit under normal temperature.\nMicrowaving is perfect if you want to sterilize a small amount of earth, but not if you’re working on large gardens.\nSome Final Tips For Better Soil Sterilization\nBefore sterilizing, don’t add fertilizers to your ground since this might reduce the effectiveness of the process and potentially harm your garden. After the process, there are also a few things you can do to keep your soil free of diseases and bugs:\n- Rotate crops regularly to prevent pests.\n- Take up healthy garden maintenance habits like testing the ground pre-fertilization, using sufficient compost, and avoiding disrupting the earth.\n- Sterilize your equipment at the start and end of each season.\nSterilization eliminates bugs, pests, and bacteria harmful to your garden through chemical or heat treatment. This technique is useful for every outdoor and indoor plant hobbyist, particularly those who need fresh land to germinate plants.\nHealthy ground makes for healthy crops.

{"question":"What are the early signs of dehydration in elderly people, and which demographic groups are most at risk for becoming dehydrated?","answer":"Early signs of dehydration in elderly people include confusion, poor skin turgor (elasticity), dry oral mucosa and furrowed tongue, decreased blood pressure, increased pulse, and concentrated urine. The elderly are particularly vulnerable because they have about seven liters less water content than younger people of the same weight. As for demographic groups at highest risk, seniors, Blacks, and Hispanics are especially susceptible to dehydration. Other high-risk groups include people with conditions like diabetes, dementia, kidney disease, and those with mobility issues who cannot easily access water.","context":["|The Importance of Water\nto oxygen, water is the nutrient most needed for life. A person\ncan live without food for a month, but most people can survive\nonly three or four days without water. All of us start life\nin a watery cradle of amniotic fluid and to this day remain\nwater's creature. Water makes up 85% of the blood, 70% of\nthe muscles and about 75% of the brain, and is present in\nand around each of our cells.\nIn the body, water acts as a solvent, coolant, lubricant,\nand transport agent. It's needed to regulate body temperature,\ncarry nutrients, remove toxins and waste materials, and provide\nthe medium in which all cellular chemical reactions take place.\nFluid balance is vital for body functions and adequate blood\nvolume. A significant decrease in the total amount of body\nfluids leads to dehydration. Dehydration occurs when the amount\nof water you take in is less than the amount you are losing.\nFluids can be lost through the urine, skin, or lungs. Along\nwith fluids, essential electrolytes, such as sodium and potassium,\nare also perilously depleted in a dehydrated individual.\nDehydration and the Elderly\nElderly individuals are at a heightened risk for dehydration\nbecause their bodies have a lower water content than younger\npeople. An elderly person weighing 150 pounds has about seven\nliters less water than a young person of the same weight.\nAs a result of this lower water content, elderly individuals\ncan become dehydrated more quickly.\nBecause of visual, cognitive, or motor impairments, elderly\npersons may have difficulty getting fluids for themselves.\nThey also may have only a muted perception of thirst. Unfortunately,\nmany symptoms of dehydration do not appear until significant\nfluid has been lost. Practitioners in the field know that\ndehydration can happen very rapidly, in less than an eight-hour\nshift. The consequences of dehydration among the elderly can\nbe life threatening and the symptoms are alarmingly swift.\nNursing facility residents are particularly at risk for dehydration.\nAccording to the article \"Preventing Dehydration in the\nElderly\" published in the September 1996 edition of Provider\nmagazine, as many as 75 percent of residents have average\nfluid intakes below 1,500 cc per day, while a minimum recommendation\nis between 1,500 to 2,000 cc of fluid intake per day. These\nresidents may need more opportunities and reminders to drink.\nThose with disabilities may be unable to get a glass of fluid\nwithout assistance. However, disability is not the only risk\nfactor. Residents who are not dependent on staff also need\nencouragement for sufficient fluid intake.\nEven when offered water, residents will refuse the offer\nbecause \"I'm not thirsty\" or \"I've already\nhad too much to drink today.\" Many elderly individuals\nalso exacerbate their risk of dehydration by limiting their\nfluid intake in the incorrect belief that they will prevent\nincontinence and decrease the number of needed trips to the\nbathroom. Residents and staff should be taught that decreasing\nfluid intake does not decrease incontinence, nor does it decrease\ntrips to the bathroom. In fact, as the urine becomes more\nconcentrated, it irritates the bladder and may increase the\nurge to void resulting in frequent small voidings.\nSigns and Symptoms of Dehydration\nIt is important that staff members be able to recognize the\nsigns and symptoms of dehydration to promptly assure correction\nand prevention of complications. Without timely correction,\ndehydration can lead to decreased functional ability, predisposition\nto falls due to orthostatic hypotension, constipation, predisposition\nto infection, and death. According the chapter on \"Dehydration:\nPrevention and Recognition\" published by Long Term\nCare Educator, staff members should be alert to the following\n• Confusion can be an early sign of dehydration.\nCaregivers who work regularly with a resident may be best\nable to detect subtle changes in mental status that are present\nwhen dehydration develops. Dehydration should be one of the\nfirst problems suspected when a resident has a sudden change\nin mental status.\n• Poor skin turgor (elasticity) accompanies\ndehydration, but this can be a difficult sign to assess because\nmost older residents have an age-related reduction in skin\nturgor under normal circumstances. If skin turgor is to be\nused in assessing for dehydration, the best areas to test\nare the skin over the sternum and forehead because these areas\nmaintain better skin turgor than other areas. Generally, skin\nwill feel warm and moist with dehydration.\n• An inspection of the oral cavity can yield useful insight\ninto a resident's hydration status. A dry oral mucosa\nand dry furrowed tongue are good indicators of dehydration.\nStaff should be cautioned that residents who are taking certain\nmedications (such as anticholinergic drugs) may have dry oral\nmucosas in the absence of dehydration.\n• An assessment of vital signs will reveal a decrease\nin blood pressure and increase in pulse\nwhen dehydration is present.\n• A review of bowel elimination patterns can assist in assessing\ndehydration. Recent diarrhea can offer an explanation for\na dehydrated state, while constipation is a\ncommon occurrence when dehydration exists. Likewise, bladder\nelimination patterns can provide useful insights: excess voiding\ncan contribute to dehydration while scanty output\ncan indicate insufficient fluid intake. Concentrated\nurine is a common sign.\n• Because such a large percentage of the body is comprised\nof fluid, weight loss is often present.\nIf any of the above symptoms are noted, steps should be taken\nas soon as possible to further assess the resident for dehydration\nand take corrective action as necessary.\nTaking a Proactive Approach to Preventing Dehydration\nThe best defense against dehydration is prevention. Illinois\nCouncil facilities are utilizing a variety of proactive\nstrategies to identify residents at risk for dehydration,\nmonitor their fluid balance, and establish institutional policies\nand programs to ensure that all residents receive adequate\nhydration. The following are some of recommendations that\nhave been suggested by Illinois Council homes:\n• Routinely monitor residents for signs of dehydration such\nas cracked lips, dry oral mucous, poor skin turgor, and dark\nurine color. Observe the residents' consumption of fluids\nto determine if they have reduced the amount of liquids they\nusually drink. Pertinent observations should be recorded in\nthe nursing notes.\n• Keep a list of residents at high risk of dehydration in\nthe nurses' station and other strategic locations to remind\nothers to monitor residents' fluid intake. Consider placing\na symbol, such as a drop of water, near the beds of those\nresidents at risk of dehydration as a sign for staff members\nto encourage fluid intake.\n• Establish hydration protocols to be instituted immediately\nwhen acute symptoms or illness threaten fluid and electrolyte\n• Schedule fluid administration at least three times a day\nbetween meals. Older people tolerate frequent administration\nof fluid in smaller quantities better than infrequent larger\n• To maintain hydration, note the residents' preferences\nfor type and temperature of fluids, and individualize the\nhydration plan to encourage compliance.\n• Review residents' medications to assess possible impact\nof fluid and electrolyte levels.\n• Leave filled, fresh water pitchers at residents' bedside\nand assure that residents are able to easily reach\npitchers and glasses. Supply straws and special\ndrinking glasses to assist residents as necessary.\n• Staff should offer a variety of fluids at a variety of\ntimes and tell residents what the purpose of this procedure\nis. For example, the dietary staff could add a glass of water\nto each meal. Activities such as discussion or music groups\nshould include the offering of beverages.\n• Arrange for residents to eat meals and have snacks with\nother residents. Residents typically consume more food and\nfluids in a social setting.\n• Offer at least a full glass of fluid with medications.\nStudies have shown that residents tend to drink the entire\namount of fluid offered.\n• CNAs can offer small amounts of fluid every time they interact\nwith a resident during care delivery; i.e., toileting, after\na transfer, after getting dressed, after rehab or therapy\nor range of motion exercises.\n• Instruct residents, staff, and families about the importance\nof hydration. Involve the resident and family in establishing\nand meeting hydration goals.\n• Teach staff to use a direct, positive approach when administering\nfluids. Avoid asking: \"Do you want something to drink?\"\nInstead say: \"Here is some cool, refreshing water for\nyou Mrs. Jones.\" Older people may not feel thirsty and\nmay not recognize their need for fluid.\n• Consider giving residents water bottles (such as those\nused by athletes) to carry with them around the facility.\nOn a regular basis, be sure to fill the residents' water bottles\nwith their favorite cool beverages.\n• Offer residents a variety of delicious beverages on a beverage\ncart. Have a staff member provide drinks from this cart to\nresidents on a daily basis.\n• Sponsor a cocktail hour for residents to enjoy their favorite\nbeverages and socialize. Facilities might consider having\na bar with different bottles and attractive colors where residents\ncan come up and order their drinks.\n• Make drinks more appealing by the use of \"props\"\nthat are colorful and inexpensive, such as lemonade pitchers\nand glasses, cocktail decorations, or a fruit garnish.\n• During activities, use a blender to mix juice combinations\nfor the residents to enjoy such as kiwi and strawberry; vanilla\nand root beer soda; ginger ale in cranberry juice; and orange\nand pineapple juice.\n• Ask the residents for their ideas on delicious drink ideas\nthat can be created during activity programs. Consider the\ncreation of frozen liquids such as lemon ice, popsicles, and\ngelatin desserts. Try developing a \"juice bar\" with\na variety of juices, Italian ices, and snow cones.\n• For residents with disabilities, the occupational therapist\nmay be able to recommend self-help devices such as long flexible\nstraws and spouted or two-handled cups. For residents with\nincreased stiffness, commonly seen in the later stages of\nAlzheimer's disease, a cup with a cut-out on the upper rim\nfor the nose allows the cup to be tilted enough for the resident\n• Ask surveyors if they will offer something to drink to\nresidents they interview during the survey, as part of the\noverall facility efforts to prevent dehydration.\n• When offering fluids, avoid offering beverages that contain\ncaffeine or alcohol since both have dehydrating properties.\n• Educate families about the importance of promoting hydration\nwhile they visit in and/or out of the facility.\n• Take ice water and other beverages on all outings and offer\nat frequent intervals.\n• Before walking through the zoo, museum, park, etc. provide\neach resident with a personal water bottle. These are easy\nto carry and refill and should be marked with the resident's\nname before distribution.\n• If residents refuse fluids on an outing, give them a salty\nsnack. This will increase their tendency to accept a drink.\n• Make sure that water fountains in the facility are low\nenough to facilitate use by residents in wheel chairs. Include\na cup dispenser and wastebasket next to the drinking fountain.\nFor easier use, adaptive \"handles\" can be purchsed\nto make dispensing easier.\nActivity Ideas that Encourage Hydration\nThe activity professional is in a unique position to encourage\nresidents to increase their fluid intake. The social structure\nof interactions used by these professionals offer many opportunities\nto offer \"liquid refreshments\" as a natural part\nof the activity. The following are some simple ideas to add\nto any current activity program:\n• Decorate a cart and stock it with a variety of juices and\nwater when making room visits. Begin the visit by sharing\na beverage of choice. In many instances this will trigger\nfond memories of going to the soda fountain for a cherry Coke\nor sipping lemonade at a church picnic. This same idea can\nbe utilized when staff or volunteers take the \"library\ncart\" from room to room.\n• Incorporate a \"juice break\" into small group\nactivities held on each floor or unit. The residents appreciate\nthis time to rest and socialize with those around them.\n• Use specific beverages as part of a reminiscing group.\nFor example, have the group squeeze lemons and make lemonade.\nYou'll be surprised at the many stories connected with this\n• Have a \"taste-test\" and have the residents guess\nthe flavor of the juice, soft drink, tea, coffee, shake, etc.\nthey are drinking.\n• Hold an afternoon \"tea\" where small groups can\ngather over a cup of tea or other beverages and just visit\nor discuss a specific topic.\n• As the residents wait for the dining room to open, use\nthe opportunity to provide a liquid appetizer such as tomato\njuice, orange juice, V-8 juice, etc.\n• Have a Happy Hour before the evening meal and offer non-alcoholic\ndrinks. Almost any mixed drink can be made without alcohol,\ni.e., a virgin Bloody Mary.\n• Always have water and/or a variety of other beverages available\nwhen on outings or when sitting outside with the residents.\n• Using \"real\" cups and glasses makes beverages\nmore appealing; when living in the community, this is what\nthe residents used.\n• During cooking group, have glasses of water with floating\nslices of lemon and ice cubes at each resident's place when\nthe activity begins. Keep refilling their glasses as the meal\nis prepared and eaten.\nDehydration in nursing home residents is a common and dangerous\nproblem requiring the involvement of the entire interdisciplinary\nteam. Every opportunity to encourage residents to drink should\nbe used, not only by nursing staff, but dietary, activities,\nsocial services, volunteers, and family. By taking a proactive\napproach to preventing dehydration, staff members can make\ngreat progress in reducing unnecessary hospitalizations and\nmaximizing resident health and well-being.","When Antoinette Wilson, 69, had dry mouth, felt tired, headachy, and experienced short spurts of dizziness throughout the course of her workday, she sloughed off the symptoms. “How do you spell s-t-u-p-i-d? ME!,” she jokes. “Luckily, I was at work when I finally passed out! I was taken to a hospital, and the diagnosis was dehydration. I could have really caused some serious health issues for myself especially since I am diabetic. I will never jeopardize my health again by ignoring symptoms that are new for me. Now, I am drinking more than enough fluids. Lightning does not have to strike me twice!”\nDehydration is serious business, especially for older adults and should never be taken lightly. Seniors, Blacks and Hispanics are especially susceptible to dehydration. The elderly are among those most vulnerable to dehydration, according to doctors and hospitals. And African American and Hispanic adults are more likely to be dehydrated than whites.\nWhat is dehydration?\nDehydration takes place when you lose more fluids than you actually take into your system. Since the human body is comprised of 75 percent water, without this liquid, we simply cannot exist. We lose water when we sweat, breathe, urinate, defecate, and we replenish the fluids when we drink liquids.\nSymptoms of dehydration\n- Dark yellow and strong smelling urine\n- Dizziness or lightheadedness\n- Feeling tired\n- Dry mouth, lips, eyes\n- Urinating very little\nSymptoms of extreme dehydration\n- Lack of sweating\n- Sunken eyes\n- Shriveled and dry skin\n- Increased heart rate\n- Low blood pressure\n- Confusion (this is most noticeable in seniors)\nIf you suspect dehydration in an elderly loved one, you can check for a decrease in skin turgor by pulling up the skin on the back of the hand for a few seconds; if it does not return to normal almost immediately, the person is dehydrated.\nWho gets dehydrated?\nAnyone can become dehydrated, young and old, but some folks are more prone to it:\n- Older people are less able to conserve water in the body and may also suffer from conditions or take meds that can increase their risk of dehydration\n- People who suffer from illnesses like diabetes, dementia, kidney disease; seniors who have mobility issues and cannot easily access water to quench their thirst\n- If you’re an athlete, work or exercise outdoors when it is hot and humid, dehydration can occur because the body’s temperature can increase and as a result, there is a need for more fluids\n- Certain medications like diuretics and a few blood pressure meds can make you urinate more which can lead to dehydration\n- Vomiting can cause a loss of fluids\n- Diarrhea is the most common cause of dehydration and causes the body to excrete way too much fluid\nHydration is vital for every single bodily function and process in order to remain active and healthy. Depriving the body of fluids can lead to serious complications and can even be life-threatening in some cases.\n- Kidney issues like urinary tract infections, kidney stones or eventually kidney failure\n- Low blood volume shock which is life-threatening\n- Heat-related injury resulting in cramping, exhaustion or heat stroke\nWhen dehydration is the diagnosis, replenishing lost fluids is the way to go. Usually, when someone is dehydrated, a physician will recommend the consumption of clear liquids like water, broths, frozen water or ice pops, or sports drinks like Gatorade.\nIf the dehydration is related to an illness, a doctor should treat the underlying condition in order to prevent dehydration. If a patient has diarrhea, they might be given an anti-diarrheal medication. If someone is vomiting, an anti-emetic drug can help them stop.\nSevere cases of dehydration will require intravenous fluids to fulfill the body’s need for fluids.\nHow to prevent dehydration\nThe key to preventing dehydration is to consume not only fluids but foods that have a high concentration of water like fruits and veggies. Beverages such as coffee, tea, soda, and alcohol are not recommended as cures for those who are dehydrated, even though these liquids can hydrate, they only do so to a very small extent.\nSeniors should be carefully watched to make sure they are consuming enough fluids because they are prone to dehydration. Dehydration in older adults is a frequent cause of hospitalization (one out of ten most frequent admitting diagnoses for Medicare hospitalizations according to the Health Care Finance Administration), and it can be life-threatening, if severe.\nIf your loved one is in a nursing home, make sure that there is a hydration program in place that includes assisting them with drinking fluids not only with meals but in-between as well!\nHow much fluids are enough to prevent dehydration? The Institute of Medicine determined that an adequate intake for men is roughly 3 liters (about 13 cups) of total beverages a day. The adequate intake for women is 2.2 liters (about 9 cups) of total beverages a day."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"format_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:74ca7df2-5361-43d5-8544-881eb7f66f52>","<urn:uuid:1c6a816b-5c45-4bdb-8821-c45a14f15433>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What advantages do plant priming techniques offer compared to conventional pesticide use, and what risks do they help mitigate?","answer":"Plant priming techniques offer a more sustainable approach to crop protection compared to conventional pesticides. Through priming, plants can activate their innate immunity and natural defense mechanisms against threats like viruses, bacteria, and fungi, as demonstrated in studies with crops like okra. This approach avoids the serious risks associated with chemical pesticides, which include harm to human health (especially children), pets, beneficial insects, and aquatic ecosystems. Conventional pesticides can contaminate waterways through runoff, persist in the environment for long periods, and even enter homes through contaminated shoes and clothes. By contrast, priming works with plants' natural defense mechanisms, potentially eliminating the need for harmful chemical pesticides that pose risks to both environmental and human health.","context":["Plant stress takes shape in different forms. There are biotic sources of stress such as munching herbivores, viruses, fungal diseases, and bacteria. There are also abiotic sources of stress such as unfavorable temperature, deficiency or excess of water, soil salinity, and other non-living factors. Stress inhibits plant metabolism, which translates to reduced yields and quality. Understanding how plants tolerate and resist stress is important so farmers can get a better yield from their crops.\nResearch has shown that both biotic and abiotic stresses trigger a series of reactions in plants to help them protect themselves against those stresses. According to a study co-authored by Dr. Ravi Pottathil, biotic and abiotic stresses “activate several transcription factors and effector proteins,” which then induce the production of metabolites that help improve and protect the plant.\nDr. Pottathil spoke in a seminar organized by fertilizer trader SaraVentures on July 15, 2022 to talk about this defense mechanism which has been called priming. Scientists like Dr. Pottathil have been studying this behavior not only to understand how plants cope with stress but also to take advantage of this process. Dr. Pottathil is particularly interested in “defense priming” which uses priming to take advantage of the benefits that plants get from stress without exposing them to the source of stress in the first place.\nDr. Pottathil said that defense priming, in a way, is similar to tricking a plant into thinking that it is stressed when, in reality, it is not. Priming works through chemicals known as elicitors. Explaining the process in layman’s terms, Dr. Pottathil said in the seminar, “When an insect, fungus, or bacteria attaches to the leaves, plants cannot see them but they can smell what chemicals they secrete. These are called elicitors. Plants can smell them so correctly… that they can now recollect a few million years ago when this particular smell hurt the plant… This elicitor activates the innate immunity of plants. Once it is activated, plants can now be resistant to virus, bacteria, and fungus.”\nAccording to his paper, defense priming can make use of agents such as live organisms like microorganisms or arthropods; chemicals such as vitamins or plant hormones; or components thereof. Once primed, a plant can defend itself more readily and effectively. For Dr. Pottathil’s study, he investigated the use of a chemically-defined elicitor on okra (Abelmoschus esculentus). The findings of his study showed that treating okra plants with the elicitor solution displayed high potential in priming the plants’ defense mechanisms.\nFarmers have been used to mitigating pests through chemical pesticides, but such practices are unsustainable not only for the soil but also for the entire planet. Understanding how priming works could lead to the invention of products that can more sustainably protect and nourish plants.\nThe information provided here was taken from a seminar entitled “Priming: Crop Solution for Climate Uncertainty” organized by SaraVentures and Zero Gravity Solutions on July 15, 2022. Part of the event was the launching of BAM-FX in the Philippines. It is a plant mineral solution composed of zinc and copper that uses the mechanisms of priming to improve plant growth.","The Grow Smart, Grow Safe® consumer guide to lawn and garden products is a project of Thurston County Environmental Health in Olympia, Washington.

Rain and irrigation wash pesticides off of yards and carry them to streams, sometimes in amounts that can harm salmon or the aquatic organisms that are their food.\nPesticides and children\nIn 2009, United States poison centers had over 90,000 incidents related to acute exposures to pesticides - about 45% involved children under the age of six. Children are vulnerable to repeated, very small, unintended exposure to pesticides. Per pound of body weight, pesticides have a greater effect on children’s growing bodies and developing nervous and hormonal systems and organs.\nDanger to pets\nMany pesticide products are toxic to dogs, cats and other pets. The risks can be similar to the human health risks. Pets with access to treated landscapes may pick up pesticide residues on their paws and fur, licking it or tracking it into the house. Slug bait containing metaldehyde poses a special risk because dogs are attracted to it and may eat enough to be seriously injured or even die.\nToxicity to birds and bees\nMost insecticides are toxic to beneficial insects, bees and other pollinators, and some insecticides are toxic to birds. Insecticides can kill bees directly when they eat or even just land on treated plants. Foraging bees can carry pesticides back to their hives, threatening the entire colony. Some researchers believe that pesticide use may be implicated in honey bee colony collapse disorder.\nMany insecticides and herbicides are toxic to fish, amphibians and other aquatic organisms. Aquatic organisms come into contact with pesticides and fertilizers through irrigation or stormwater runoff from yards and other landscapes. Pesticide ingredients that don’t bind well to soil and are persistent in the environment pose the greatest risk to water pollution. Monitoring studies in the Puget Sound region have found common pesticides and fertilizer nutrients in many of our waterways.\nThe longer a pesticide remains in the environment, the more likely it is to do damage. Older products, like DDT, are still in the environment and in our bodies almost 40 years after their last uses were banned. Many modern pesticides breakdown faster, however most pesticides are not gone after a month or two, and may not be harmless just because the treated area has dried. Some pesticide residues may remain in soil, sediment or water from weeks to over a year or more, and sometimes they breakdown to chemicals that are toxic and persistent.\nHow do I know which products are safer?\nLearn how to read a pesticide label, which chemicals are lowest risk, how to handle and dispose of pesticides, and how to avoid the need for pesticides altogether at www.growsmartgrowsafe.org."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:457a157d-02cb-460a-b7f1-dab6cdbf4a74>","<urn:uuid:ecd62e19-7b14-4024-93f6-ba091430d7c5>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do research interests in climate change adaptation compare between continental US watersheds and the Himalayan region?","answer":"In the continental US, research focuses on how climate change affects watershed runoff through soil moisture, evaporation, and vegetation patterns, with findings showing that a 1% increase in soil moisture can cause a 5% increase in runoff. In contrast, research in the Himalayan region emphasizes adaptation practices in flood plains, drought-prone areas, and river basins, with particular attention to rural livelihood adaptations and community-level responses to changing water discharge patterns. Both regions study hydrological responses to climate change, but the Himalayan research has a stronger focus on social and community adaptation strategies.","context":["Date of Award\nOpen Access Dissertation\nDoctor of Philosophy (PhD)\nTimothy O. Randhir\nJohn T. Finn\nEcohydrology, Hydrograph, Land use, Watershed\nEnvironmental Sciences | Hydrology | Other Environmental Sciences\nMaintaining flows and quality of water resources is critical to support ecosystem services and consumptive needs. Understanding impacts of changes in climate and land use on ecohydrologic processes in a watershed is vital to sustaining water resources for multiple uses. This study completes a continental and regional scale assessment using statistical and simulation modeling to investigate ecohydrologic impacts within watershed systems.\nWatersheds across the continental United States have diverse hydrogeomorphic characters, mean temperatures, soil moistures, precipitation and evaporation patterns that influence runoff processes. Changes in climate affect runoff by impacting available soil moisture, evaporation, precipitation and vegetative patterns. A one percent increase in annual soil moisture may cause a five percent increase in runoff in watersheds across the continent. Low soil moisture and high temperatures influence runoff patterns in specific regions. Spring runoff is increased by the influence Spring soil moisture, Winter and Spring evaporation, and Winter and Spring evaporation. Spring runoff is decreased by increases in Winter and Spring temperatures and increases in the vegetation index. Winter runoff is affected by maximum vegetative index, temperature, soil moisture, evaporation and precipitation. Contributing factors to runoff are influenced by geomorphic and seasonal variations requiring strategies that are site-specific and use system-wide information.\nRegional scale watershed analysis investigates the influence of landscape metrics on temporal streamflow processes in multiple gauged watersheds in Massachusetts, U.S.A. Time of concentration, recession coefficient, base flow index, and peak flow are hydrologic metrics used to relate to landscape metrics derived using FRAGSTAT software. Peak flow increases with increasing perimeter-area fractal dimensions, and Contagion index and decreases as Landscape Shape Index increases. There was an increasing trend in the fractal dimension over time indicative of more complex shape of patches in watershed. Base flow index and recession coefficient fluctuated from low to high decreasing recently. This could be indicative of open space legislation, conservation efforts and reforestation within the state in the last ten years.\nCoastal systems provide valuable ecosystem services and are vulnerable to impacts of changes in climate and continental land use patterns. Effects of land use and climate change on runoff, suspended sediments, total nitrogen and total phosphorus are simulated for coastal watersheds around the Boston Bay ecosystem. The SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) model, a continuous-time, semi distributed, process-based model, is used to simulate the watershed ecohydrologic process affecting coastal bodies. Urbanization in watersheds increased runoff by as much as 80% from the baseline. Land use change poses a major threat to water quality impacts affecting coastal ecosystems. Total nitrogen increased average of 53.8% with conservative changes in climate and land use. Total phosphorus increased an average of 57.3% with conservative changes in land use and climate change. Climate change alone causes up to 40% increase in runoff and when combined with a 3.25% increase in urban development runoff increased an average of 114%. Coastal ecosystems are impacted by nutrient runoff from watersheds. Continued urbanization and changes in climate will increase total nitrogen, total phosphorus and suspended sediments in coastal ecosystems.\nContinental scale runoff is affected by soil moisture and vegetative cover. Cover crops, low tillage farm practices and natural vegetation contribute to less runoff. Developing policies that encourage protection of soil structure could minimize runoff and aid in maintaining sustainable water resources. Best Management Practices and Low impact development at the national level with continued stormwater legislation directed towards sustainable land use policy will improve water quantity and quality. Fragmentation observed in Massachusetts increases the number of urban parcels and decreases the size of forested areas. Faster runoff patterns are observed but recent land management may be changing this runoff pattern. Municipal and state zoning ordinance to preserve open space and large forest patches will restrict urban growth to specific regions of a watershed. This could improve quantities of water available to ecosystems. Increases in total nitrogen, phosphorus and suspended sediments to coastal ecosystems can be minimized with use of riparian buffers and Best Management Practices within coastal watersheds. Urbanization and climate change threatens coastal ecosystems and national policy to preserve and restrict development of coastal areas will preserve coastal ecosystem services.\nEkness, Paul A., \"Ecohydrologic Impacts of Climate and Land Use Changes on Watershed Systems: A Multi-Scale Assessment for Policy\" (2013).

{"question":"Why do pilots use such concise language in communications, and what are the typical human errors that lead to runway accidents?","answer":"Pilots use concise language because aviation communication must meet three critical requirements: it must be economical, precise, and absolutely unambiguous. There's no time for chitchat in the cockpit, as superfluous syllables or distorted communications can lead to dangerous maneuvers. The principle is 'reduce to the max' - express yourself as clearly, succinctly, and precisely as possible. Regarding runway accidents, they typically occur due to failures in situation awareness - specifically failures to understand where planes, runways, or vehicles are located. These incidents usually involve failures across three different organizations: airlines (pilots), ATC providers (air traffic controllers), and airports (airside vehicle staff). While individual errors may appear to be the immediate cause, the real causes are often at the organizational level, including poor procedures, bad design choices, commercial pressures, and inadequate organizational support for operations.","context":["The language spoken in the cockpit is clear, concise and accurate. For amateurs, it may sound like fantastical gobbledygook, but the parlance of pilots follows a specific system – and has its very own beauty.\nSure, the poems and finely crafted stanzas of a Whitman or a Shakespeare have their own charm – for fans of great literature. But aviation fans prefer to listen to words with a glorious whiff of kerosene – the pilot poetry of couplets like this: 248° at D6.3 FFM/D3.5 FRD (MNM 800) RT intercept R140 TAU inbound RT intercept R084 TAU/R264 MTR climb to 5000.\nThe lyricism of aviators thrusts deep into the soul. Its stark, clipped majesty needs no flowery embellishment. Instead, this language relies on abbreviations, precision and accuracy. By the way, mysterious as they may sound, the lines above are nothing more than the command for a go-around maneuver over Frankfurt Airport, reduced to the essentials. It’s a lingo every pilot needs to be fluent in; a rough translation goes something like this: “Fly straight ahead on a course of 248 degrees up to 6.3 miles’ distance from FFM beacon or 3.5 miles from FRD beacon at a height of at least 800 feet. Then fly a right curve on the 140-degree radial toward the Taunus beacon. After passing the Taunus beacon, fly on the 084-degree radial toward MTR beacon or the 264-degree radial toward Metro and ascend to 5000 feet.”\nSpoken in the original, this is music to the ears of aviation enthusiasts. Anyone who has listened in on pilots communicating with air traffic control will have heard some of these phrases. When the pilots of a Lufthansa A380 request pushback at the gate in San Francisco, they don’t say: “Hi there, tower folk! Can we please leave the gate now?” They will say: San Francisco ramp golf tower, Lufthansa 455 Super requests push from position 101. Once the huge Airbus reaches the runway, tower clearance will be given using syllables and acronyms that instantly conjure up visions of the inside of a cockpit. : Lufthansa 455 Super wind 290 degrees 13 knots RWY 28R cleared for takeoff.\nTo amateurs, the lingo of the sky is an incomprehensible string of sounds, the ultimate jargon. That’s because pilots face a particular challenge. In aviation, perhaps more than in any other field, language has to meet three sometimes very tall -orders: It has to be economical, precise and absolutely unambiguous.\nThere’s no time for chitchat in the cockpit; elaborate, finely turned sentences are not only pointless, they can even be dangerous in certain circumstances. A superfluous syllable or verb, or a string of letters distorted by the microphone can lead to an unnecessary or wrong maneuver. Communication in aviation depends entirely on meticulous accuracy. Fast, clear and to the point: “Reduce to the max” is the motto – express yourself as clearly, as succinctly and as precisely as possible.\nPay attention and you will soon see that this is no easy task. The most complicated tool in the cockpit is perhaps not the artificial horizon, altimeter or autopilot but “aeronese,” the language used to communicate between earth and sky. It starts with the endless abbreviations – a particular characteristic of this language, and one that predominates here more than in any other area of life. In aviation, every pilot knows that ACARS refers to the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System, that TCAS is a collision warning system and that PFD stands for the Primary Flight Display – the arrangement of the six most important instruments that, back in the early days of flying, were dubbed the “sixpack”: altimeter, air-speed indicator, variometer, compass, artificial horizon and turn indicator.\nEven common English words take on odd meanings in pilot speak. Who knew that “threshold” was the start of the landing runway? An apron isn’t only something you wear in the kitchen, it’s the bit of the airport where aircraft park. And just before the aircraft leaves the ground, when the pilot pulls back the sidestick, the cockpit crew will be saying “rotate,” not takeoff, which is more accurate because at this point, the plane is actually rotating around its lateral axis. Takeoff occurs a few seconds later.\nFewer words, more concentration, less language, fewer errors\nThe alphabet also plays a key role in aeronese. In radio communications between pilots, air traffic control and ground control, everyone uses the international ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization) phonetic alphabet: It begins with Alpha, Bravo, Charlie and ends with X-Ray, Yankee and Zulu. These code words are used to avoid confusion when spelling parts of a message containing letters. Of course, the phonetic alphabet was no chance development but the result of many years of fine tuning. The military used to use different versions to communicate. A and B were spelled like “Apples” and “Butter,” and during World War I, English soldiers also used “Ack” and “Beer.” On March 1, 1956, the ICAO put an end to the confusion and introduced a new list of code words, also called the “NATO Alphabet,” which was easy to pronounce in all the world’s languages and dialects. The words that stood for each letter were easy to distinguish, thus avoiding misunderstandings, even in crackly radio communications. The alphabet was developed by the Canadian linguist and phonetician Jean-Paul Vinay, and it is still used today in aviation and marine radio communications to identify positions, reporting points or identifiers.\nIn fact, a great deal of aeronese comes from the military, and particularly the navy. “The condensed language of commands is the only way to communicate with precision,” explains Cord Becker, who for many years trained pilots for Lufthansa. The principle is simple. For instance, when retracting the landing gear after takeoff, the Pilot Flying (PF) will only give the order to “Gear up” once the Pilot Monitoring (PM) confirms with “positive climb” that the plane is ascending. The PM executes the command and replies briefly “Gear up.” Nothing else is said. Only in the event of a technical malfunction will the electronic systems on board report a fault with visual and acoustic signals. “Technical surveillance systems eliminate the need for much verbal interaction,” says Cord Becker, “and further reduce communication in the cockpit to what is absolutely necessary.” This is all part of the perfectionist approach of aeronese: fewer words, more concentration; less language, fewer errors.\nModern aircraft, by contrast, are very communicative. A computer voice will announce “Terrain ahead” if the aircraft is approaching a dangerous obstacle in the air. It will also count down the plane’s height indicated by the altimeter shortly before landing: “1000, 500, 400, 300 …” The plane also provides other alerts, for instance when the permitted sink rate is exceeded before landing. In the latest-generation aircraft, the systems will also alert the pilots when maximum reverse thrust is required after landing. In a loud and clear command spoken not with long words, but with minimalist precision, the aircraft will demand “Max reverse! Max reverse!”\nOf course, aviators are capable of banter when they’re not busy concentrating on work. For instance, pilots will refer to the cockpit as the “pointy end” whereas “donkey” refers to an engine. Old-fashioned cockpits full of analogue instruments are fondly referred to as a “watchmaker’s shop” and the autopilot is affectionately called “George.”These terms display the joy of neologism, hyperbole and gentle self-mockery, as evidenced in the following flying instructions – boiled down to the basics: “If you push the stick forward, the houses get bigger, if you pull the stick back they get smaller.”","Presentation on theme: \"Human Factors in Runway Incursion Incidents Patrick Hudson Centre for Safety Studies Leiden University The Netherlands.\"— Presentation transcript:\nHuman Factors in Runway Incursion Incidents Patrick Hudson Centre for Safety Studies Leiden University The Netherlands\nStructure The major factor in runway incursion - Human Error Case studies Superficial causes - How incidents happen Underlying causes - Why incidents happen Where to look, what to do Conclusion\nThe Human Factor Runway incursions are usually failures to understand –Where the plane is –Where the runway is –Where a vehicle is Classically failures of Situation Awareness Failures involve three different organisations –Airlines - Pilots –ATC providers -Air traffic controllers (arrivals, departures and ground) –Airports - Airside vehicle staff etc. The individual pilots/ATCOs are seen as the problem The real causes are at the organisational level\nWhy do Accidents Happen?

The pilots failed to look at all their instruments (ND) and actively ignored inconsistent information (PVD) They taxied far too short a distance to have gone from NP to 05L Therefore pilot error - BUT The airport lighting and defences did not meet ICAO standards 05R was probably lit as if it were functional and the taxiway lights on N1 were totally inadequate to form a line (gestalt) They were given T/O clearance one runway too early The visual picture was therefore compelling - one last runway, therefore the right one A typical example of an accident waiting to happen?\nAn accident waiting to happen extra information On 23rd October a freighter nearly started to take off from 05R On 30th October another freight aircraft repeated that near miss, having known about the 23rd October incident - and having recognised it as such after having nearly started on 05R as well There was no system for effective incident reporting (e.g. CHIRP) CKS did not have a Safety Management System –There is no evidence that the hazards of the work program were identified, assessed or actively managed –There is no evidence of an audit program\nWho should have prevented the accident? Everybody Pilots should have stopped and asked the way –But they had to trust Boeing instrumentation - and mistrust CKS CKS - and mistrust Boeing instrumentation Airport should never have allowed such a situation to arise –Having discovered problems, should have corrected them (accidents usually have ‘hidden’ precursors)\nThe SQ 006 event scenario Airport decides to change Runway structure Holding positions not marked clearly Taxiway lights And runway signage do not meet ICAO standards Pilots decide to take off on the ‘only’ runway No ICAO standard barriers erected\nDAL 39 A Delta 76 aborted take-off at Amsterdam Schiphol on discovering 747 being towed across the runway Reduced visibility conditions (Phase - B) The tower controller was in training, under the tower supervisor There was another trainee and of the 11 people in the tower five were changing out to rest The incident happened between the inbound and outbound morning peaks\nDAL 39 continued The marshalling vehicle called in unexpectedly as Charlie-8 with a towed KLM 747 from a parking apron Radio communications were unclear and C-8 did not state exactly where he was C-8 was given clearance The stopbar light control box confused everyone in the tower (it was a new addition) The controller, thinking that the tow had crossed successfully, gave DAL 39 clearance The DAL pilots saw the 747 and stopped in time\nDAL 39 Initial Analysis Tow failed to report exact position or destination Tow not announced in advance (as per procedures for phase B) Assistant ATCo believed tow from right to left (did not know that a tunnel was in use) Controllers completely unfamiliar with new control box Ground radar pictures set up to cover different arrival and departure runways meant tow not visible on one screen Controller was meshing the tow between both take-offs and landings The tow, given clearance 1m 40 sec earlier, started off once the stopbars went out\nWhy did all this happen - 1?

No briefings about alterations at Schiphol (It has been a building site for years) Too many trainees in the tower in rush hour under low visibility conditions Differences in definition of low visibility between aerodrome and ATC No management apparent of the change in use of the S-Apron No operational audits by LVNL or Schiphol, of practice as opposed to paper Schiphol designed requiring crossing and the use of multiple runways for noise abatement reasons\nThe DAL 39 event scenario Airport decides to change airport structure Tunnel brought into use without briefings Tower combining training and operations during difficult periods Pilots see 747 and abort take-off Controller gives clearance without assurance of tow position Routine violation of tow procedures Airport structure\nSK 686 D-IEVX Linate A SAS MD-87 collided with a Cessna 525A business jet while taking off from 36R Visibility at (local) was m (Fog) All 114 occupants and 4 ground staff died The Cessna was on the wrong taxiway crossing 36R The pilots of the Cessna were confused They thought they were on a different taxiway (R5, to the North) The MD-87 did nothing wrong There was no ground radar\nThe details - the Cessna “Delta Victor Xray taxi north via Romeo 5 QNH …, call me back at the stop bar of the … main runway extension” “Roger via Romeo 5 and … [QNH], and call you back before reaching main runway” The Cessna started off from the GA Apron in dense fog, turned left and then was faced with a split They should have gone left (R5) but went right (R6) If they had used their compass they would have noticed The only taxiway lights visible at that point led to R6 The markings were worn and not ICAO compliant The pilot went through a STOP line, a stop bar and a final yellow line on the taxiway\nATC ATC was using non-standard terms Read-back confirmation did not check the details SK 686 and D-IEVX were on different frequencies The next aircraft on ground frequency was spoken to in Italian (as were many transmissions) D-IEVX reported “approaching the runway … Sierra 4” S4 is on R6 and the equivalent on R5 would have taken much more than 2 1/2 minutes The controller appears to have believed they were on R5 and gave permission to taxi after stop-bar to proceed and “call me back entering the main taxiway”\nProblems with T/O Clearances Both Taipei and Amsterdam had long-standing clearances D-IEVX had an apparent clearance to continue taxi-ing A 747 at Anchorage was given immediate clearance with 6 minutes taxi time and one runway crossing Should clearances be valid for more than 15 seconds?\nICAO SARPs ICAO sets standards for runway signage –Runway signs –Stopbars and Holding Points –Taxiway lighting Problems with ICAO compliance at all airfields –Taipei - lights, barriers, stopbars –Amsterdam - traffic lights instead of stopbars –Linate - markings on taxiways, lighting If these had been complied with fully would there have been any problems?\nVisibility and Taxiway lighting All these incidents occurred under poor visibility conditions Pilots were forced to look out at where they were going Taxiways were visually compelling and there was no visible alternative at CKS or Linate Are airfields sufficiently well marked to be unambiguous under conditions of poor visibility?\nATC Language Two incidents involve the use of more than one Language - not best practice Many incidents are associated with failures to use aviation English ATC usage is nearly, but not quite, accurate enough to prevent most incidents Calls and read-backs are prone to confirmation bias Would strict adherence to established protocols have prevented these incidents?\nConsiderations for runway safety Initial analyses show both pilots and controllers to have been at fault - situation awareness failures The problem was that the situation was the problem, expecting awareness is expecting too much Deeper investigation begins to show that all cases were accidents waiting to happen The individuals were victims of systemic failures In no case was there any effective safety management as expected in other high hazard industries Few (if any) extra technical solutions would have been necessary if what should have been done was done\nConclusion Runway incursions appear to be due to individual errors Those individual errors are caused by system weaknesses Most major incidents have minor precursors Technical improvements may reduce low potential incidents - but these incidents would have been easily prevented by doing what already should have been done Most problems can be avoided by application of safety management principles (c.f.

{"question":"Could you explain how both complex numbers and matrices are applied in modern electronics and engineering? I'd like to understand their practical uses.","answer":"Both complex numbers and matrices have important applications in engineering and electronics. Complex numbers are used in electronics to describe circuit elements, where the state can be expressed as z = V + Ii, combining voltage (V) and current (I). This makes it easier to work with circuit elements that have capacitance and inductance. Similarly, in electromagnetism, complex numbers can represent electric and magnetic field strengths as real and imaginary components. As for matrices, they are crucial in engineering for modeling physical systems and performing calculations needed for complex mechanics. In robotics and automation, matrices serve as basic directional components for robot movements, enabling precise control through matrix calculations. They're also used in electrical circuits, quantum mechanics, and optics.","context":["Complex numbers are numbers that consist of two parts — a real number and an imaginary number. Complex numbers are the building blocks of more intricate math, such as algebra. They can be applied to many aspects of real life, especially in electronics and electromagnetism.\nThe standard format for complex numbers is a + bi, with the real number first and the imaginary number last. Because either part could be 0, technically any real number or imaginary number can be considered a complex number. Complex does not mean complicated; it means that the two types of numbers combine to form a complex, like a housing complex — a group of buildings joined together.\nReal numbers are tangible values that can be plotted on a horizontal number line, such as fractions, integers or any countable number that you can think of. Imaginary numbers are abstract concepts that are used when you need the square root of a negative number.\nAdding & multiplying complex numbers\nBecause a complex number is a binomial — a numerical expression with two terms — arithmetic is generally done in the same way as any binomial, by combining the like terms and simplifying. For example:\n(3 + 2i) + (4 - 4i)\n(3 + 4) = 7\n(2i - 4i) = -2i\nThe result is 7-2i.\nFor multiplication, you employ the FOIL method for polynomial multiplication: multiply the First, multiply the Outer, multiply the Inner, multiply the Last, and then add. For example:\n(3 - 2i)(5 + 3i) =\n(3)(5) + (3)(3i) + (-2i)(5) + (-2i)(3i) =\n15 + 9i + -10i + -6i2 =\n15 - i - 6(-1) =\n21 - i\nThe reason that i2 simplifies to (-1) is because i is the square root of -1.\nDividing complex numbers\nDivision, however, becomes more complicated and requires using conjugates. Complex conjugates are pairs of complex numbers that have different signs, such as (a + bi) and (a - bi). Multiplying complex conjugates causes the middle term to cancel out. For example:\n(a + bi)(a - bi) = a2 - abi + abi - (bi)2\nThis simplifies to a2 - b2(i2) = a2 - b2(-1)\nThe final result is a2 + b2\nWhen dividing complex numbers, determine the conjugate of the denominator and multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate. For example,\n(5 + 2i) ÷ (7 + 4i)\nThe conjugate of 7 + 4i is 7 - 4i. So, multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate:\n(5 + 2i)(7 – 4i) ÷ (7 + 4i)(7 - 4i) =\n(35 + 14i – 20i – 8i2) ÷ (49 - 28i + 28i – 16i2 ) =\n(35 - 6i + 8) ÷ (49 + 16) =\n(43 - 6i) ÷ 65\nAbsolute value of complex numbers\nThe absolute value of a number is considered its distance from zero on the number line. Because complex numbers include imaginary numbers, they cannot be plotted on the real number line. However, they can be measured from zero on the complex number plane, which includes an x axis (for the real number) and the y axis (for the imaginary number).\nUses of complex numbers\nComplex numbers can be used to solve quadratics for zeroes. The quadratic formula solves ax2 + bx + c = 0 for the values of x. If the formula provides a negative in the square root, complex numbers can be used to simplify the zero.\nComplex numbers are used in electronics and electromagnetism. A single complex number puts together two real quantities, making the numbers easier to work with. For example, in electronics, the state of a circuit element is defined by the voltage (V) and the current (I). Circuit elements can also have a capacitance (c) and inductance (L) that describes the circuit's tendency to resist changes in V and I. Rather than describing the circuit element's state by V and I, it can be described as z = V + Ii. The laws of electricity can then be expressed using the addition and multiplication of complex umbers.\nAs mentioned before, this can also be applied to electromagnetism. Instead of being described as electric field strength and magnetic field strength, you can create a complex number where the electric and magnetic components are the real and imaginary numbers.","Matrixes come in various form and shapes. But there is one matrix whose usefulness extends to a wide array of fields from physic to engineering.\nMatrixes, just like people, come in all shapes, sizes and forms. There are many different kinds of matrices, depending on the rank, order and even what the matrix contains within it. If you’ve taken high school linear algebra, then you have a decent idea of what the different types of matrixes are, based on various parameters. Now, the primary function of a matrix is to help us simplify calculations; ironically, most complex calculations performed by computers are also broken into matrices. Now to understand the nuances of a Jacobian Matrix, we first need to understand Vector Calculus and some basic Matrix properties.\nWhat is Vector Calculus?\nVector calculus can be defined as the branch of mathematics that deals with the differentiation and integration of vector fields. A vector field can be thought of as a set of vectors that all align in a particular direction in space (or more precisely, Euclidean space). Vector calculus plays a vital role in differential geometry and differential equations. Differential geometry is a mathematical discipline that uses the techniques of differential calculus, integral calculus, linear algebra and multilinear algebra to study problems in geometry. Differential equations, on the other hand, are equations that consist of multivariables, which signify a certain rate of change.\nThe primary application of vector calculus is in the field of physics. To make a generalized statement, vector calculus is used in all strata of physics. It is employed in classical mechanics, especially fluid mechanics, and is also the foundation for electrodynamics. More high-end topics such as General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics also use aspects related to simple vector calculus, primarily tensor calculus and vector spaces. Another subject that comes as a surprising related genre is computer programming and graphics.\nWhat is a matrix?\nA matrix can be defined as a rectangular array of numbers or other mathematical objects in which operations such as addition and multiplication are defined. Matrices primarily come in two forms: real and complex matrixes. The difference in these matrices lies in the fact that the elements present within the matrix are either real numbers or complex numbers. However, the kinds of matrices we’ll be dealing with are a bit unique and a something of an anomaly to the family of matrices.\nMatrices are used much more in daily life than people may realize. They are in front of us every day when going to work, at school and even at home! A square matrix can represent the linear transformation of a geometric object. In physics-related applications, matrices are used in the study of electrical circuits, quantum mechanics and optics. Engineers use matrices to model physical systems and perform accurate calculations that are needed for complex mechanics to work. In robotics and automation, matrices are the basic directional components for the robot’s movements. The inputs for controlling robots are obtained based on the calculations from matrices, which result in very accurate movements.\nCharacteristics of a Jacobian Matrix\nNow that we have a basic understanding of vector calculus and matrices, we will be able to more accurately define and explain a Jacobian Matrix. A Jacobian Matrix can be defined as a matrix that contains a first-order partial derivative for a vector function.\nThe Jacobian Matrix can be of any form. It can be a rectangular matrix, where the number of rows and columns are not the same, or it can be a square matrix, where the number of rows and columns are equal. Let’s try to represent a Jacobian Matrix in a more rigorous mathematical sense.\nThe f: ℝn → ℝm is a function that takes as input the vector x ∈ ℝn and produces as output the vector f(x) ∈ ℝm. Then, the Jacobian matrix J of f is an m×n matrix, usually defined and arranged as follows:\nThe entry for this matrix is usually a variable like x. Knowing this is highly imperative, as this indicates that the function is differentiable at the point x. Being differentiable at a point indicates that the matrix can be mapped and given a geometric and visual approach to understanding the equations at hand. The most important kinds of Jacobian Matrix are the Polar-Cartesian and Spherical-Cartesian. These matrices are extremely important, as they help in the conversion of one coordinate system into another, which proves to be useful in many mathematical and scientific endeavors.\nThe importance of the Jacobian Matrix is critical in all fields of mathematics, science and engineering. One prime example is in the field of control engineering, where the use of Jacobian matrices allows the local (approximate) linearization of non-linear systems around a given equilibrium point, thus allowing the use of linear systems techniques, such as the calculation of eigenvalues (and thus allowing an indication of the type of the equilibrium point). Jacobian matrices are also used in the estimation of the internal states of non-linear systems in the construction of an extended Kalman filter. Basically, we can conclude by saying that Jacobian matrices maintain a truly unique and important place in the world of matrices!"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:eb7eb00d-fac4-402a-a054-333e7ad2a7cb>","<urn:uuid:7596c42a-3c33-4cc7-afad-7a7ee0e95882>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How does dementia progress through its different stages, and what behavioral changes can family members expect to manage?","answer":"Dementia typically progresses through five stages: mild cognitive impairment, mild dementia, moderate dementia, severe dementia, and profound dementia. In mild stages, people need help with daily activities but can live somewhat independently. As it progresses to moderate stages, severe memory issues develop, communication problems arise, and they require assistance with most activities. In severe stages, they need constant care and may not recognize family. Throughout these stages, family members must manage various behavioral changes, including angry outbursts, physical manifestations of behavior, and potentially disruptive actions. To manage these behaviors, caregivers should identify triggers, look for patterns, consider environmental factors, and ensure all basic needs are being met. It's important to understand that these behaviors are not deliberate but are manifestations of the disease.","context":["When a loved one begins to experience memory loss and other cognitive issues, it is only natural to wonder whether he or she is exhibiting signs of dementia.\nWarning signs that one’s mental capacity may be diminishing can include:\n- Forgetting significant dates or previous life events\n- Asking for the same information repeatedly\n- Difficulty concentrating or keeping track of recurring bills\n- Taking much longer to complete certain tasks than before, or the inability to complete daily tasks in general\n- Getting lost when driving to a familiar location\n- Losing track of time\n- Inability to recognize one’s own reflection\n- Problems following a conversation or finding the right words to express one’s thoughts\n- Frequently misplacing possessions and sometimes accusing others of stealing them\n- Mishandling money\n- Paying less attention to grooming and hygiene\n- Losing interest in favorite hobbies or social activities\n- Changes in behavior or personality, such as becoming anxious, confused, depressed or easily irritated when deviating from routine.\nIf your loved one is exhibiting these signs, you should encourage him or her to see a physician for testing, diagnosis and treatment.\nDementia is a term used to describe a decline in memory and other thinking skills resulting from damage to nerve cells, or neurons, in the brain. Such cognitive impairment can be brought on by a number of medical conditions, including Alzheimer’s disease, which is estimated to account for 60 to 80 percent of dementia cases, according to the Alzheimer’s Association’s “2014 Alzheimer’s Disease Facts and Figures” report. Other conditions that can cause loss of capacity include vascular dementia, a reduction in blood flow to the brain because of narrowing arteries or blood clots; dementia with Lewy bodies, which are protein deposits in deteriorating nerve cells; Parkinson’s disease; frontotemporal dementia, in which sufferers experience a shrinkage of the frontal and side lobes of the brain; or a combination of conditions known as mixed dementia.\nRegrettably, there is no cure for dementia: Current treatment can only slow the condition’s progress. (To be clear, certain causes of cognitive dysfunction, such as depression and chronic substance abuse, may be reversible with treatment; not all cognitive dysfunction is dementia.) Dementia typically progresses in five stages: mild cognitive impairment, mild dementia, moderate dementia, severe dementia and profound dementia.\nTechnically, doctors do not consider mild cognitive impairment to be a stage of dementia, because the impairment may never reach the later stages. With mild cognitive impairment, a person may experience a small but noticeable decline in memory and other thinking skills. However, the person can continue to live independently.\nA person suffering from mild dementia may need assistance with some of the activities of daily living (which medical professionals often term “ADLs”). These basic activities required to live autonomously include eating, bathing, grooming, dressing and undressing, toileting, maintaining continence and transferring from bed to chair or wheelchair and back without assistance or supervision. Someone who lives alone and struggles with ADLs may need a home aide or need to move to an assisted living facility. Someone with mild dementia may also become confused in public and may require help handling finances.\nWith moderate dementia, a person may experience severe memory issues and have problems communicating. At this stage, he or she cannot live alone and needs assistance with most or all ADLs. A person with moderate dementia may forget the names of relatives and friends, and mistake one family member for another. He or she may also forget short-term information, such as something cooking on the stove or leaving the gas pilot on but unlit, which can pose a threat to the person’s safety and that of others. He or she may also be more prone to wander outside and become lost if unattended.\nWhen a person suffers from severe dementia, he or she requires constant, hands-on care. At this stage, he or she may be unable to recognize family or friends. The person may also have difficulty walking and may eventually need to use a wheelchair. He or she may also experience uncontrolled movements and behave aggressively, especially when feeling threatened. Those with profound dementia often become bedridden.\nInteracting With Those Suffering From Dementia\nIt is never easy to see the bright light of a loved one’s personality dim as dementia worsens. However, it is important to not treat your loved one any differently, even if he or she no longer recognizes you.\nThe January 2013 issue of the Arizona Center on Aging’s “Elder Care” contained a short article titled, “Communicating With Patients Who Have Dementia.” Written by Jake Harwood, Ph.D., a member of the University of Arizona’s Department of Communication, the article provides tips on the most effective ways to interact with people suffering from dementia. Harwood recommends speaking in simple sentences so as not to confuse the person. He warns against using “baby talk,” however, as it might seem disrespectful or patronizing and make the person less cooperative.\nRepetition helps when trying to convey information that your loved one finds difficult to understand, though it is better to rephrase the message, Harwood says, rather than to repeat it. Elaboration can also improve comprehension, and pausing during conversation allows your loved one time to gather his or her thoughts before responding. When asking questions, Harwood suggests giving your loved one simple choices if possible to provide a sense of control. Harwood also suggests using objects such as photos or songs to encourage communication with a person suffering from dementia. Nonverbal cues can also be very effective at stimulating communication. Maintain eye contact with your loved one and face him or her at the same level; if he is sitting down, sit down across from him. Use appropriate physical contact and facial expressions to convey your point, smiling and staying calm when speaking.\nMaking Decisions For Yourself And Your Loved One\nAccounting for the possibility of your own eventual mental incapacity is an important consideration for any estate plan. In 2014, it was estimated that more than 5 million Americans age 65 and older suffer from Alzheimer’s disease. This statistic is projected to more than triple by 2050 because of an aging baby boomer population and longer life expectancies, assuming that no medical advancements arrive to cure, prevent or stop the progression of the disease. If you also consider other forms of dementia, the number of those who will suffer significant memory loss and cognitive issues in the coming decades likely will be even higher.\nA health care proxy and a durable power of attorney are two legal documents that allow you to appoint another person to make medical and financial decisions on your behalf once you are no longer able to do so. Of course, the agent you choose should be someone you trust to respect your wishes and to make decisions in your best interest. Often this person will be a relative, such as a spouse or adult child, or it may be a friend or trusted adviser.\nThe health care proxy and durable power of attorney can take effect immediately or upon the occurrence of a particular event, such as when your physician determines that you lack capacity to make medical and financial decisions. The latter option is called a “springing” power of attorney, and it is especially appropriate for individuals who may be concerned with giving decision-making authority to someone else while they are still able to make decisions for themselves. Note, however, that a springing power may not work in all states. Florida, for example, deems a power of attorney ineffective if the power becomes active at a future date or is contingent on the occurrence of a future event.\nIn conjunction with the health care power of attorney, you will want to create a living will or advance directive. This legal document will give your agent and your physician instructions as to whether to administer life-sustaining medical treatment if you are in the late stages of dementia, are terminally ill or are otherwise near death. The living will relieves loved ones of the burden of difficult medical decisions such as whether to keep you on life support if you have no possibility of regaining consciousness.\nOnce you create such documents, be sure to make their existence known to your loved ones. Also, provide copies of the executed documents to your appointed agents to present to medical and financial institutions when acting on your behalf. It is likewise a good idea to give copies of your health care proxy and living will documents to your health care providers. If your doctors know your wishes ahead of time, it will be easier for them to help ensure that those wishes are respected.\nIf you find yourself on the other side of the issue and your loved one appears to be showing signs of diminishing mental acuity, ask if he or she has medical and financial durable powers of attorney in place. If so, ask your loved one who he has appointed as his agent or agents, so that you can alert them of problems.\nIf no such documents are in place, encourage your loved one to meet with an estate-planning attorney to have these and any other documents such as wills or trusts drafted and signed as soon as possible. Diminishing capacity does not necessarily mean that your loved one already is unable to execute estate-planning documents. For example, someone with mild cognitive impairment, or even mild dementia, can be deemed to have the acuity necessary to execute these documents as long as he or she is lucid and understands his or her actions at the time the documents are signed.\nIt is always difficult to watch a loved one’s mental capacity decline, or to consider the possibility of one’s own future incapacity. However, it is important to be certain that you and your loved ones have appointed the appropriate agents to make health and financial decisions once that capacity is limited or gone. And it is crucial that you continue to interact with your loved one, treating him or her with dignity and respect no matter how the decline progresses.","When most people think of someone with Alzheimer’s disease or dementia, they picture a senior with a benign, slightly confused demeanor who repeats themselves. But, there is a whole spectrum of other types of behaviors associated with the disease that most of us wouldn’t describe as slightly or “pleasantly confused” by any stretch of the imagination.\nFrom angry outbursts to more physical manifestations of behavior, understanding and dealing with our loved one’s dementia behaviors may be one of the most stressful parts of being a caregiver. Fortunately, these tips listed below can help you get through the moment.\nNew Approaches to Difficult Dementia Behaviors\nWhen dealing with difficult behaviors from someone with dementia, it’s important to remember that they are not deliberately being difficult.\nOur loved one’s sense of reality may now be different from ours, but it is still very real to him or her. As caregivers, we can’t change the person with dementia, but we can employ strategies to better accommodate any problem behaviors. Both the environment you create at home and the way you communicate with your loved one can make a significant difference.\nThese tips may help get you through some difficult moments using the “What, When, Where, Why, How” technique shared in: “When Caring Takes Courage: A Compassionate and Interactive Guide for Alzheimer’s and Dementia Caregivers.”\nIdentify the causes of Alzheimer’s or dementia behavior problems.\n- Examine the behavior objectively. Are your loved one’s actions truly a problem behavior? Problem behaviors are typically those that can result in an adverse outcome for your loved one or others. For example: can they result in harm to self or others?\n- Some behavior can be embarrassing, disruptive or uncomfortable to be around, but may not actually be harmful. Avoid correcting, intervening or unintentionally escalating situations by knowing when to let some things go. If Mom would rather wear four layers of pants at a time and rummage through her closet non-stop, let her. Protect your loved one from harm and then allow some sense of freedom and control by creating space for your loved one to make their own choices when possible.\nLook for patterns that help you predict and prevent problem behaviors.\n- Ask yourself what happened just before the problem behavior started. Did something specific trigger that behavior?\n- Is there a certain time of day that seems to be more difficult on your loved one? Sundown for example? Or bath/shower time?\n- Are certain times of the year more difficult? Winter, when days are darker and nights longer, for instance?\nWhat effects are environmental changes having on your loved one?\n- What did the environment look, smell or sound like? What did they see?\n- Were there new or different stimuli introduced? Noise, people, places or even your requests of them?\n- Does changing their atmosphere or environment help to comfort your loved one?\nIdentify the causes of Alzheimer’s and dementia behavior problems.\n- Remember to focus on the “why” when approaching someone with dementia. Seek first to understand why your loved one may be behaving this way, rather than what it is they are actually doing. For example, a person who disrobes may be feeling that their clothing is too tight, too hot or too itchy, or may need to use the bathroom.\n- Understand that your loved one’s behavior can often be a reaction to stress or a frustrated attempt to communicate. If you can establish why they’re stressed or what is triggering the discomfort, you should be able to resolve the problem behavior with greater ease.\n- Try to put yourself in your loved one’s place. Look at their body language and imagine what he or she might be thinking and what they might be feeling or trying to express.\n- Are all of your loved one’s basic human needs being met? Could they be tired, need to use the bathroom? Be hungry, thirsty, or in pain? Meeting an unmet need can quickly resolve the reason for the behavior in the first place.\nOkay, you’re in the thick of it now. This is definitely a problem behavior… now what? Here’s how to get through some difficult moments:\n- Validate your loved one’s feelings. If I have dementia and I’m upset, I have likely lost the ability to reason. The more you try to explain to me why my thinking is “wrong” or I don’t need to be worried, the more agitated I’m going to be, because it feels like you are not listening to me. Let your loved one know you understand that they’re upset and that you want to help.\n- Remember, your loved one responds to your body language, facial expression and tone of voice far more than the words you choose. Use eye contact, a smile, or reassuring touch to help convey your message and show your compassion. Try not to take problem behaviors personally and do your best to maintain your sense of calm.\n- Be accepting instead of contradicting. Instead of correcting or arguing, look for opportunities to agree. If your loved one is insisting on the keys, instead of saying “No” for example, try: “Yes, I’ll make sure you get your keys as soon as the mechanic is done with the car. Where should we go first?”\n- Introduce pleasant stimuli into the situation: a favorite song, food, drink, photo, texture, scent, collectible or other items that you know they enjoy.\n- Use familiar music, favorite scents and items that evoke positive feelings. Often caregivers will gather these things ahead of time and keep a “behavior bucket” full of needed items on hand, so you can grab them the moment you need them.\n- Try to engage your loved one in a favorite hobby or interest, or try looking at photographs of familiar people and places.\n- Use a cooling off period if needed, when possible. If safe to do so, give your loved one some space or breathing room.\nThings to Keep in Mind When Dealing With Difficult Behaviors\nWhat’s not okay? People with Alzheimer’s or dementia often exhibit behaviors that are unpredictable and may be outside the bounds of what others consider “normal” or socially acceptable. It may be tough to know when to worry and when to be flexible.\nIn general, try to remember that these behaviors do not define the person, they are just a product of the disease. If your loved one had the ability, they would probably choose to act differently.\nAlso, remember to practice patience and forgiveness. The disease, not the person, is likely causing these things to occur. Try to let things go and avoid holding a grudge over something they may not have meant to do or say, or even remember doing. The exception is if your loved one becomes a physical danger to themselves or others. Physically abusive behavior is not okay. Even a one-time occurrence should be communicated to your physician or other healthcare or mental health provider immediately to ensure your loved one’s safety as well as your own.\nFinally, there are so many more behavior interventions, treatments and specialty care providers now than ever before. Don’t be afraid to reach out.\nTelling someone what’s really happening at home doesn’t mean a one-way ticket for your loved one into a behavioral unit or a “no questions asked” prescription for more medications. It’s just the start of a needed conversation with professional providers who may be able to add some value by identifying more ways of helping you and your loved one have better days.\nWhat approaches do you use when dealing with difficult dementia behaviors?

{"question":"What scientific evidence supports the safety of MMVF insulation products, and how should these materials be properly installed beneath concrete slabs?","answer":"Multiple scientific studies have confirmed MMVF insulation safety. In 2001, IARC reclassified MMVFs from 'possibly carcinogenic' to 'not classifiable as to carcinogenicity to humans' after reviewing epidemiologic studies that showed no increased cancer risks from occupational exposure. This conclusion was supported by over 60 years of research by government and independent organizations. For installation beneath concrete slabs, specific precautions must be taken. When using foil-faced polyisocyanurate boards, manufacturers recommend protecting the panels during backfilling with rigid materials like fiberboard sheathing. All joints and edges below grade should be covered with aluminum tape, and good drainage around the foundation is essential to prevent water immersion. These installation requirements are critical for maintaining the insulation's effectiveness and preventing water absorption that could compromise its R-value.","context":["\" . . . cold and heat . . . summer and winter . . . shall not cease.\"\n– Genesis 8:22\n\"Warmth, warmth, more warmth! for we are dying of cold and not of darkness.\"\n– Miguel de Unamuno\nThe Tragic Sense of Life\nThe North American Insulation Manufacturers Association (NAIMA) and its member companies have promoted, with steadfast confidence, the usefulness and safety of its insulation products since the 1930s. The industry’s faith in its fiber glass and rock and slag wool (\"man-made vitreous fibers\" or \"MMVFs\") insulation products has never wavered. Even in 1987, when the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) identified MMVFs as a \"possible human carcinogen,\" the industry retained its same message of assurance: \"Fiber glass, rock wool, and slag wool products are safe to manufacture, install, and use when recommended work practices are followed.\"\nThat 1987 IARC opinion on a cancer risk associated with MMVFs is now history.\nOn Oct. 16, 2001, after reviewing all available studies and publications addressing man-made vitreous fibers, a panel of leading, international medical and scientific experts appointed by IARC concluded their health and safety evaluation of these fibers by re-classifying MMVFs from a Group 2B category (\"possibly carcinogenic to humans\") to a Group 3 category (\"not classifiable as to carcinogenicity to humans\").\nIARC based its decision upon the evidence of \"Epidemiologic studies published during the 13 years since the previous IARC Monographs review of these fibers in 1988 provide no evidence of increased risks of lung cancer or of mesothelioma (cancer of the lining of the body cavities) from occupational exposures during manufacture of these materials, and inadequate evidence overall of any cancer risk [emphasis added].\" Other fibers reviewed in 1988 retained their original classification. IARC further stated that \" the more commonly used vitreous fiber wools including insulation glass wool, rock (stone) wool and slag wool are now considered not classifiable as to carcinogenicity to humans (Group 3).\"\nIARC’s decision marks a historic victory for the industry because it affirms what NAIMA and its members have been saying for years and continue to say today.\nA Firm Foundation Supported Industry Confidence\nWhile NAIMA enthusiastically applauds IARC’s reclassification of MMVFs, the agency’s action is no surprise in that it’s in sync with conclusions reached by scientific groups in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Holland, Australia, and New Zealand that concluded, in the past five years, that MMVFs don’t pose a cancer risk to humans. For instance, the U.S. National Academy of Sciences found in 2000 \"no significant association between fiber exposure and lung cancer or nonmalignant respiratory disease in the MVF manufacturing environment.\"\nThe abundant information relied upon by these reviews appeared in print as early as 1930, when research on man-made vitreous fibers found an absence of any chronic adverse health effects in man. By 1942, initial investigations conducted by Dr. W.J. Siebert on fibrous glass manufacturing workers demonstrated \"no respiratory disease could be attributed to inhalation of fibrous glass.\" Studies from the 1950s and 1960s corroborated the findings of earlier research efforts. In 1977, the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) conducted an extensive investigation into the health and safety of fibrous glass home insulation and concluded that scientific evidence did not support a finding that inhalation of fibrous glass home insulation posed \"an unreasonable risk of injury from cancer,\" and, therefore, the commission declined to regulate fiber glass and found that \"a mandatory safety standard was unnecessary.\"\nMMVF insulation products rank as one of the most thoroughly tested building materials in use today. More than 60 years of research by government and independent research organizations supported the statements made by industry that MMVFs are safe when manufactured, installed and used following recommended work practices. This ongoing product stewardship sustained the industry’s confidence in its products and established that workplace exposure to respirable fibers consistently registers below 1 f/cc and airborne fibers in insulated buildings are not significantly different from the level found in the outdoors or in uninsulated buildings.\nWith this substantial scientific database as a backdrop, in 1999 NAIMA partnered with the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to form a voluntary Health and Safety Partnership Program. As a result of this partnership program, OSHA removed MMVFs from its list of priorities.\nHealth Benefits of MMVF Insulation Products\nMedical professionals identify a home as a critical element in gaining and persevering good health: \"A house should protect its occupants from extremes of heat and cold, moisture and dryness\" and maintain \"a comparatively constant interior temperature.\"\nSuch an indoor climate, doctors reminded patients, was attainable due to the \"development of a lighter wall with some good insulating material in it.\" Modern insulation proved so fundamental to good health that the Modern Medical Counselor in 1945 urged readers to follow this advice: \"If modern insulating materials are used in the building of a new home, it will be better protected against the extremes of heat and cold and will conserve fuel.\" Dr. Hubert Swarthout’s book even featured a photograph of MMVF insulation being installed. Insulation, Swarthout advised, also reduced vermin, insects, and germs. The health benefits derived from a controlled indoor climate provided yet another rationale for NAIMA’s unwavering confidence in MMVF products.\nSurviving Weather and Climate\nPlagues once brought a blight upon humanity, but even Black Death itself stopped when even slight improvements in housing generated \"spectacular results\" to human health, argues William McNeill, professor emeritus of history at the University of Chicago. Housing, due to its insulating concepts, helped to end epidemic contagions: \"Invention of clothing and housing did the trick, insulating the human body from extremes of climate and assuring survival despite freezing temperatures.\" Weather injures normal and diseased people more, according to cardiology studies, \"than all air and water pollution combined.\" Indeed, cold ranks as the gravest threat to the body.\nIn her fascinating book, \"Freezing Point,\" Lucy Kavaler explains that \"man has not evolved in ways that help him to endure the cold. . . he has been battling cold as if it were an enemy for all history.\"\nCold kills people even today. Heat kills people, too. Technology eventually achieved stabilized temperature control with the development of efficient insulation, which, according to historian James Burke, came with the breakthrough discovery of glass fiberization, that led, ultimately, to the creation of \"glass wool, an extremely light-weight insulation blanket.\" As history and literature document, insulation played a pivotal role in bestowing comfort and well-being upon the human race.\nIn 1860, a Washington, D.C. woman wrote: \"I can no more stand cold weather than can a tomato plant.\" Indeed, \"[m]an as a species has not developed a race that can naturally survives in cold regions. Only technology has enabled him to do so.\" Technology prevents heat loss by providing insulation [like] \"[f]eathers and furs . . . match the processes that would . . . carry heat away from the body. In houses man has done the same thing by walls, fiber insulation, and storm windows.\"\nIn Dr. Stephen Rosen’s, \"Weathering,\" he explains how the body \"rel[ies] upon unconscious behavioral thermoregulation – . . . But body temperatures above 110 [degrees fahrenheit] or below 82 [degrees fahrenheit] for extended periods of time can inactivate thermoregulation and prove fatal.\"\nA striking illustration of Rosen’s statement, occurred in the early 1960s in Great Britain when fatalities among elderly and infants rose sharply enough for the British Ministry of Health to appoint a special committee to investigate. In its 1964 report, published in the British Medical Journal, the committee’s findings attributed all deaths to accidental hypothermia. Accidental hypothermia differs from the hypothermia caused when a victim is stranded in Antarctica. In contrast, accidental hypothermia claims its victims within the walls of their own homes. The age of the victims also contributes to accidental hypothermia, because \"old people are… vulnerable to cold… and many… lay unprotected for long periods in cold rooms.\"\nInfants suffer similar susceptibility, as a 1932 report from President Hoover’s Commission on Home Buildings stated: \"We recommend particularly that investigations be made upon the relation of housing to infant mortality . . .\" In short, dwellings occupied by the victims lacked capacity for sustained temperatures needed to maintain proper body warmth. Without equivocation, the committee blamed indoor exposure to cold as cause of death.\nThe Ministry of Health’s recommendations centered on implementation of measures that would correct loss of heat from a room. To achieve temperature stability, the committee recommended that flats and apartments install insulation in attic spaces to attain a persistent room temperature. In a follow-up article, \"Cold the Killer,\" to the committee’s official report, British Medical Journal editors characterized cold’s deadly toll as a \"medical emergency\" and demanded social and governmental intervention: \"The old people should be given help, with insulation of their houses and provisions of warm clothing and fuel, by official or voluntary services and should themselves be warned of the danger.\"\nBefore modern innovations in home construction, the cold threatened everyone, not just the aged and new-born, as illustrated in Willa Cather’s classic American novel, \"My Antonia,\" with its depiction of pioneers fighting nature’s brute force in Nebraska, where \"man’s strongest antagonist is cold.\" Not complaining, just stating the facts, one pioneer remarked that \"[n]ext to getting warm and keeping warm, dinner and supper were the most interesting things we had to think about. Our lives centered around warmth and food.\" Securing warmth remained elusive for many as exemplified by a farm house where wintry winds whipped beneath door seams and through wall crevices, and burlap bags stuffed between the cracks and crannies to stop glacial-like air proved fruitless as temperature dropped to deadly degrees.\nHot climates present mankind with hazards almost as lethal as cold. Indeed, torrid temperatures prove fatal to mankind with regularity as even today heatstroke stalks the inhabitants of the upper half of the Mississippi River region, where more lives have been taken by heat-related injuries than in any other location in the world. While medical dissertations reveal that \"heat is much more difficult at the two extremes of life, making the elderly and babies most susceptible to heat,\" American soldiers fighting overseas during World War I and World War II succumbed to the heat with regularity.\nAfter both world wars, the Medical Department of the U.S. Army prepared an extensive evaluation of all heat-induced medical problems-hospitalized illnesses and death-in an effort to prevent such devastating losses if future American military conflicts arise in tropical climates. In the report, the Army recognized that a shelter, where cool temperatures might abound, could have circumvented both sickness and death affiliated with over-exposure to heat during both World Wars. Once again, insulation protects against climate’s extremities.\nEnergy Efficiency Equals Better Health\nEnergy-efficiency technologies contribute towards reducing pollution-sulfur dioxide and carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide contributes to global warming and sulfur dioxide constitutes a major component of acid rain, so insulation possesses the capacity to diminish the threat of climate change and reduce health risks linked with acid rain.\nIn addition, air pollutants provoke allergic symptoms, and exacerbate respiratory distress among asthma sufferers. Asthma is on the increase among people who live in urban areas because of the intensified levels of airborne pollutants and allergens. Air pollution has also been linked to emphysema, hay fever, other respiratory ailments, headaches, constricted breathing passages, or health hazards that remain hidden from medical knowledge. Scientists suggest exposure to pollutants can worsen existing health conditions, and, combined with all other factors, accelerate disease and allow air toxins, like arsenic, to accumulate in the body and contaminate the blood stream.\nInsulation use decreases the emission of pollutants with dramatic results. Insulation currently in place in U.S. buildings alone reduces the amount of carbon dioxide emissions by 780 million tons each year. A savvy environmentalist, Paul Hawken, stated that \"ceiling insulation and double glazed windows can produce more oil than the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge at its most optimistic projections, at about one-twentieth the cost, with four times the employment per unit of energy converted versus the energy consumed by burning it.\"\nIn a study conducted by the Alliance to Save Energy, Hawken’s optimism gains authentication: \"10,444 Btu’s of energy are required to produce one pound of insulation. One pound of insulation saves 125,3289 Btu’s of energy per year.\" Hawken’s \"The Ecology of Commerce\" justified heavy reliance upon energy efficiency because present efforts have eliminated \"hundreds of billions of tons of pollution from the air, ground, and water, and improved health world wide.\"\nMMVF insulation products earn the lion’s share of credit for energy savings and pollution reduction, because, as A.M. Watkins states in \"The New Complete Book of Home Remodeling, Improvement, and Repair,\" of the many types of insulation, fiber glass and mineral wool are the most common. And \"the most recommended.\" Watkins justifies his praise by listing distinctive attributes embodied in fiber glass and mineral wool: \"high performance rating . . . inorganic . . . naturally fire resistant, rot proof, bug resistant, versatile, and not high priced.\"\nInsulation Noise Absorption Offers Health Benefit\nScientists have linked \"sensations of sound\" to negative impacts on human health. When President Hoover’s Conference on Home Building and Home Ownership published its report, experts pinpointed noise as a injurious presence that needed resolution: \"Noise has a detrimental effect upon health, and houses should be so constructed as to minimize\" the noise. Indeed, psychological and physiological ailments results from noise that disturbs peace and quiet and prevents restful slumber or loss of sleep and inflicts stress related diseases upon its victim. Medical sources support the conclusion that sustained exposure to noise is contributing factor in impaired hearing chronic fatigue, neurasthenia, increase blood pressure and decreased working and mental efficiency.\nThat explains why acoustical expert Paul Close stated that there \"is ample justification for classifying noise as an occupational hazard along with gases, fumes, dust, toxic liquids, and bacteria.\"\nMMVF insulation absorbs noises that cause detrimental health effects. In fact, specialists in acoustical problems recommend insulation as an effective tool for reduction of sound through walls, floors and ceilings and absorption of reverberations. The result is improved health, yet another insulation health benefit resulting in NAIMA’s confidence.\nInsulation transformed standards of comfort and living for all classes, and has ushered a comfort and well-being that historians call \"a tremendous advance\" for humanity. Health and happiness are closely related, and it would be difficult to deny that a more varied diet, better protection against cold and damp (indoors and out) and cleanliness have been facilitated by modern technology and are directly responsible for happiness as well as health.\nCertainly, the impact of technology is clearly apparent in the realm of architecture, structures made to control the natural world for the benefit and, ultimately, for the survival of humanity.\nMMVF insulation products, the preferred insulation choice for decades, have not only been extensively used, but have been extensively studied, researched, and scrutinized. Now, supported by IARC’s significant landmark decision, NAIMA and its members reassert its consistent message once again:\n\"Fiber glass, rock wool, and slag wool products are safe to manufacture, install, and use when recommended work practices are followed.\"","Question?

(See photo at left).\nExcept for Owens-Corning literature that recommends use of its Energy Shield sheathing, foil-faced polyisocyanurate foam insulation use below slabs seemed to be ignored in the 1980's - why? -- Steve Scheller, Falls Church VA\nIn 1984 the only published research to date on underground applications of rigid foam insulation was a study by Dow Chemical, in which samples of insulation were buried for extended periods and later unearthed.\nIn those tests, foil-faced polyisocyanurate foam insulating board did not fare so well, absorbing on average 5 percent water by volume and losing 40 percent of its R-value.\nManufacturers of the foil-faced products argued that the tests were not valid because\nThe major manufacturers of foil-faced polyisocyanurate foam insulating board, Owens-Corning and Celotex, both recommend its use below grade for foundation wall and underslab applications, but in general they recommend taking extra care while backfilling so as not to puncture the foil facing.\n[Additional foil facing punctures would be caused, for example, by a radiant heat floor contractor who installs the tubing by stapling it or nailing it to the foil-faced sub-slab insulation before the concrete is poured. See RADIANT HEAT FLOOR MISTAKES. --DF.]\nThey also recommend good drainage around the building foundation so the insulating polyisocyanurate foam board panels are never immersed in water.\nSpecifically, Celotex recommends that the insulating foam board panels be protected during backfilling with a rigid material such as fiberboard sheathing.\nOwens-Corning recommends that all polyisocyanurate foam board joints and edges below grade be covered with aluminum tape.\nComparing Polyisocyanurate Sub Slab Insulation with Polystyrene Foam Insulation Below a Concrete Slab\nFor comparison's sake, extruded polystyrene (see POLYSTYRENE FOAM INSULATION) has higher compressive strength than polyisocyanurate, but both have similar water absorption properties as measured by standard tests. Both are over 90-percent closed-cell foams.\nOur photo (left) shows polystyrene foam insulating board below a concrete slab being poured in Two Harbors, MN.\nIn 1984 Owens Corning was currently monitoring samples buried over the summer and was expected to produce data results by 1985 when the samples were dug up. But in the mid 1980's builders had to rely on scanty published data and on manufacturer's recommendations.\nAlso remember that each foil-faced insulating board product has its own chemical makeup and facing material.

{"question":"What are the environmental benefits of urban trees in cities, and why do they often struggle to survive in urban environments?","answer":"Urban trees provide several environmental benefits: they increase air quality, mitigate the urban heat island effect, help with storm water remediation, increase oxygen production, and reduce carbon-based pollution. However, trees in urban environments face significant survival challenges. They struggle due to poor soil conditions, including compaction, pollution, inappropriate pH levels, and lack of oxygen. Additionally, urban trees lack the beneficial tree-mycorrhizal associations found in rural areas (37% lower in cities), and cannot form nutrient-sharing networks with other trees. They also face challenges from insufficient soil volumes, dog urination, smog, and bad pruning practices, leading them to 'live fast and die young' compared to their forest counterparts.","context":["Urban Releaf founder and Director Kemba Shakur has joined the Environmental Justice Advisory Committee (EJAC), a group committed to helping the state of California develop its 5-year scoping plan around AB32, the Global Warming Solutions Act.\n“After 15 years of advocating for trees in communities of color and poor communities, we at Urban Releaf are well-suited to play a role in helping to shape the future of California’s environmental policy,” Shakur says, adding, “These are exciting times. California is on the cutting edge of a national push toward a clean energy economy, and urban forestry can play a big role in that socioeconomic shift.\n“Urban forestry is an integral part of a healthy ecosystem – it relates to air, land, water, energy and people. The benefits of urban forestry include increased air quality and mitigation of the urban heat island effect, as well as creating green jobs which can be part of youth workforce development efforts.”\nIn inner-city communities, Shakur adds, “the lack of trees affects people’s lives, particularly poor people, who are living in toxic, polluted, and otherwise unhealthy environments, next to the port, freeways, and diesel trucks routes.” To address this, Shakur maintains, “urban forestry needs to be instituted into every city’s climate action plan.”\nEJAC’s mission is to assist Sacramento legislators and state employees in developing best practices recommendations for the implementation of SB535/AB1532, which mandates that a portion of revenues generated by the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF) be allocated to “disadvantaged” communities (as identified by CAL-EPA’s Enviro-Screen), also known as EJ, or Environmental Justice, communities.\nThe forming of the EJAC committee is an indication, Shakur says, that “the benefits of trees are beginning to be more widely known, as more emphasis is placed on policy around climate change and global warming.”\nUrban Forestry is one of five priority areas identified by the SB535 Coalition (Urban Releaf, Greenlining Institute, Asian Pacific Islander Environmental Network, Climate Change Action, and Public Advocates) to be targeted according to the criteria identified in the California Air Resource Board (CARB)’s Draft Investment Plan (available as a .pdf here) for the GGRF, also known as Cap-and-Trade auction proceeds. In addition to urban forestry, priority areas include energy (energy efficiency/renewable energy), transportation, and affordable housing next to transit.\n“We need to green communities most affected by poor air quality and the urban heat island effect,” Shakur says. Projects Urban Releaf would like to see developed under AB32 and SB535 include green jobs, training programs, research, partnerships, and collaborations, specifically:\n- Reforestation in low-canopy urban zones\n- Planting trees along transit corridors and high-traffic areas\n- Increased investment in urban gardening/farming/landscaping\n“An urban reforestation plan can be the centerpiece of a community-based environmental health campaign in disadvantaged/ EJ communities,” says Urban Releaf Program Manager Kevin Jefferson. This includes storm water remediation, heat island reduction, tree canopy increase, and a total tree count increase, as well as urban farming and small-scale renewable energy, such as rainwater catchment.\nIn addition to creating much-needed jobs for the community, the results of such campaigns, Jefferson notes, would include “increased oxygen, and a reduction in carbon-based pollution, as well as improving the quality of life, providing psychological benefits, raising property values, and supporting plant, insect, and animal life. Lastly, Jefferson adds, “there is a need for more education and research, which allows for more informed policy decisions to be made.”","Are you curious about how to connect technology with nature to bring urban green to life?\nBlogBack to blog\nTalking Trees — Part 2: What are the trees trying to say?\nImage by © Stephen Chambers\nPublished by RA Editions\nIn my new series, Talking Trees, I’m translating findings from my PhD dissertation, called the \"Internet of Nature\", into seedling-sized blogs. My research advances ecological engineering by exploring the potential of novel technologies to monitor urban ecology, particularly urban soils and forests. I believe technology can be a powerful tool—and in this series, I hope to illustrate how digitising our urban ecosystems into useful data can help us build healthier, happier, and more resilient places to live.\nIn Part 1 of Talking Trees (read here if you missed it), we asked: Do city trees talk to each other? In short, they probably don’t talk, and when they do, it’s a whisper. Even when there are tree-mycorrhizal associations, there typically aren’t enough of them to support the tree’s health.\nIn Part 2, I want to unpack why the life of a city tree is so difficult. There is a lot to unpack. For one, Bainard, Klironomos, and Gordon (2011) found mycorrhizal associations to be 37% lower in urban areas, as compared to rural areas . Why? Mycorrhizae are elusive and prefer not to ‘deal’ with urban soil issues like compaction, pollution, nutrient content, pH levels, or a lack of oxygen. For example, if polluting aluminium levels establish in the soil, the pH of the soil may be too low for effective tree–mycorrhizal associations to establish.\nTree-mycorrhizal associations may be the least of our worries, though. Even to apply the term ‘soils’ to the earth I sampled during my fieldwork is to be awfully polite. The urban soils I saw can only be described as highly variable. Often due to soil compaction, the varying contents of organic matter, or the patchy distribution of coarse natural or human-made materials such as coarse gravel or construction waste, as often even the parent material is anthropogenic in origin. In general, urban forest soil health has been little investigated due to the complexity of urban environments (e.g., variations in soil cover, land-use history, pollution, and degradation) and the difficulties of soil monitoring (e.g., limited training in accurate methods, lack of investment, and tedious and time-consuming work). Nevertheless, urban-forest soil health is the primary determinant of urban-forest health, and vice versa.\nAlthough healthy soil is fast becoming a limited commodity in cities, healthy soil, with ample microbes, should provide the foundation for healthy urban forests. However, urban trees face very different growing conditions than do forest trees; as a result, urban trees live for only a fraction of the time forest trees do. Many studies have catalogued the plight of dying urban trees, and inadequate soil quality is an important cause of this premature mortality.\nOnce the healthy-soil foundation has been established, water availability is the next consideration. Everyone knows that trees need water to live: the question is, how much?\nIf a tree has too little water during a period of drought, the tree becomes stressed. It may wilt for a little while and then bounce back—or the tree could permanently wilt. When this happens, the tree has to use more energy to recover—or it may die back completely. Watering newly planted trees is especially important, as the root zone of such a tree is not as large as that of an established tree.\nTrees that get too much water and have ‘wet feet’ for long periods can also be severely damaged. The tree will not be able to access oxygen from the soil, and the roots may begin to rot.\nPhillip Craul, a Harvard landscape ecologist once said: ‘street trees die for many reasons, but the best place to start looking for causes is in the soil.’\nIn cities, trees live fast and die young  for a number of reasons: not only smog, dog urination, insufficient soil volumes, compacted soil, and bad pruning practices, but also the fact that there is no network of fellow trees to share nutrients and information with via their roots, as mentioned above. Tree health is severely impacted by the absence of a network of close family nearby to communicate with and supply nutrients to. Some urban trees are orphans; we must foster these trees. If only we could find a way to hear what the trees had to say...\n Bainard, L. D., Klironomos, J. N., & Gordon, A. M. (2011).

{"question":"What are the key warning signs of gum disease to watch for?","answer":"The key warning signs of gum disease include bleeding gums when brushing (which is never normal and indicates inflammation), bad breath (especially common in those who don't floss), redness and slight swelling of the gum tissues at the gum line, receding gums, sensitivity of gum tissues when brushing, and sensitivity to hot or cold if roots become exposed. As the disease progresses, symptoms can include loose teeth, tooth movement, and ultimately tooth loss. It's important to note that you can have periodontal disease with no easily recognizable warning signs, especially if you are a smoker.","context":["Warning Signs of Periodontal (Gum) Disease\nDon't wait until it's too late\nI'm scared of losing my teeth like both my parents because of gum disease especially because they never seemed to be in any pain. Even though I always see my dentist regularly, am I at risk for gum disease and what should I look for?\nThis is an important question; generally speaking periodontal (gum) diseases (peri-around, odont-tooth) are chronic diseases and sometimes described as silent — silent in the sense that they don't cause any symptoms that might be readily associated with disease or a problem.\n|Figure 1: Gum tissues bleed because of dental (bacterial) plaque or biofilm, caused by inadequate daily oral hygiene practices. You might notice a redness of the gum tissues at the gum line and this may also appear as slight swelling.|\nFor example a lot of people get bleeding gums when they brush and erroneously think they're brushing too hard or it's normal. But actually any bleeding of the gum tissues is not normal and should be considered a warning sign of gum disease. You'd actually have to brush quite hard and damage healthy tissue in order to get bleeding. Gum tissues bleed because of dental (bacterial) plaque or biofilm, caused by inadequate daily oral hygiene practices. When left around the gum line for prolonged periods of time, anywhere in excess of twenty four hours or more, the gum tissues respond by becoming inflamed — this quite rapidly becomes a chronic inflammation [Figure 1].\nChronic inflammation, or as it is sometimes called “frustrated” healing, results from persistent inflammation because the bacteria are still present and continue to perpetuate the inflammation.\nFor some people this chronic situation may minimize gum tissue breakdown, but for those prone to periodontal disease, the inflammation may win over the attempts at healing. The tissue attachment to the teeth (the ligament or membrane that connects the teeth to the bone) “unzips” for want of a better expression, creating pockets of infection. As bone is slowly (chronically) lost around the teeth, if left unchecked it will ultimately lead to tooth loss. It's actually a little more complicated, but this gives you the general picture.\nWhile bleeding gums is often a first warning sign, bad breath is one of the most common signs especially for those who hate or refuse to floss. Plaque just loves to collect in the protected areas between the teeth making them especially prone to gum inflammation.\nBleeding of the gum tissues is not normal and should be considered a warning sign of gum disease.\nThat leads to the next sign, if you're really looking you might notice a redness of the gum tissues, at the gum line. This may also appear as slight swelling of the gums and in time this might lead to receding gums especially if the tissues are thin. Some people may experience varying degrees of sensitivity of the gum tissues when they brush, or if there is recession the exposed roots may be sensitive to hot or cold.\nAs this silent disease progresses over time, maybe years, bone loss will cause looseness of the teeth, movement or migration into a new and unstable position, and ultimately tooth loss. The rate of progression will depend on the particular type of periodontal (gum) disease you have. That's where the genetic aspect comes in since you inherit disease resistance factors from your parents. It is possible to test for “genetic susceptibility” to periodontal disease today and to assess your risk factors.\nSometimes dental plaque (bacterially) caused gum diseases change in nature and become “acute.” That means they are no longer silent but become suddenly painful and sore. This is usually when a periodontal abscess develops which I'm sure you read about in the last issue. When bacteria get walled off inside a periodontal “pocket” the body's defenses get overwhelmed — a little localized war ensues between the bacteria in the pocket and the body's defense mechanisms. This results in a localized collection of pus and extra bone loss — and then it's not silent anymore — you'll know because the area becomes painful, swollen, red and may even discharge pus.\nSo there you have it, these are the most common warning signs and symptoms. It's also important to note that you can have periodontal disease with no easily recognizable warning signs, especially if you are a smoker because smoking tends to mask the effects of gum disease.\nBut it really does sound like you're doing the right thing. Unquestionably a family history of gum disease may put you at greater risk for periodontal (gum) disease, but that doesn't mean that it's inevitable. Regular dental checkups, excellent oral hygiene techniques like brushing and flossing and good general health (good nutrition, not too much stress and not smoking) will keep you on the road to healthy teeth for a lifetime, just like they're supposed to be.\nDon't wait until it's too late. For further questions or concerns be sure to see your general dentist or a periodontist (a dentist who specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of disorders of the periodontal tissues — the gums, periodontal membrane and bone connecting the teeth to you!)"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:6560ace7-db73-4431-bcd0-67343673837b>"],"error":null}

{"question":"How I can tell difference between major and minor key in music piece?","answer":"Music in a major key often sounds cheerful, though it can be gentle and plaintive. Minor key music typically sounds sad or gloomy, though it can be lively. A key difference is in the third degree of the scale - for example, in D major the F is sharp, while in D minor the F is natural. Listening to many examples and practicing with major and minor arpeggios is helpful for distinguishing between them.","context":["There are four tests. At Grade 5 the pieces have a melody and an accompaniment:\n5.1 – Clap the pulse and time signature\nYou will hear a short piece played twice on the piano. Listen to the melody the first time, then clap the pulse the second time it is played, stressing the strong beat.\nThen the examiner will ask you to name the time signature.\nAt Grade 5 you need to be able to tell the difference between 2/4 time, 3/4 time, 4/4 time and a type of 2 time called 6/8 time (or compound duple time). In 6/8 time the beats may easily be divided into two groups of 3, making it sound 'swingy'.\nBy the time you get to Grade 5 you will have practised clapping in time and showing the strong beat for all these time signatures.\nListen to this example in 2/4 time:\nListen to this example in 3/4 time:\nListen to this example in 6/8 time:\nListen to this example in 4 time:\nIf in doubt you could go back and practise earlier grades in your E-MusicMaestro Aural Test Training programme.\n5.2 – Major or minor key and cadence\nAfter you have listened twice more to the piece, you'll be asked to describe the tonality and then to say what the cadence was.\nTonality means major or minor key. The best way of knowing if music is in a major or minor key is to listen to lots of examples. Music in a major key is often cheerful sounding, but it could still be quite gentle and plaintive. Music in a minor key often sounds sad or gloomy, but it could still be lively.\nListening carefully to the different sound of major and minor arpeggios is a good idea – it is the third degree of the scale that makes the difference e.g. the F in D major is sharp but the F in D minor is natural.\nThe tonality of the pieces at Grade 6 will do either of these two things - begin in a major key, change to minor then change back to major, like this piece:\nor, begin in a minor key, change to major, then change back to minor, like this piece:\nAn imperfect cadence sounds as if the piece has not yet ended and needs to be completed. This is because it ends with Chord V (e.g. G major chord in the key of C major).\nThis is an imperfect cadence:\nAn interrupted cadence also sounds unfinished, but like a musical surprise – just when you expect the music to end with a perfect cadence the last chord sounds unfinished. The chords are Chord V to Chord VI (e.g. C major chord to A minor chord in the key of C major). Another name for an interrupted cadence is a 'deceptive' cadence.\nA perfect cadence sounds as if the piece has definitely finished. The chords are Chord I followed by Chord V (e.g. G major chord, then C major chord in the key of C major).\nThis is a perfect cadence:\nA plagal cadence is Chord IV to Chord I (e.g. F major chord then C major chord in the key of C major). It also sounds finished, but perhaps not quite as decisively as a perfect cadence because you do not hear the leading note (7th note of the scale) in chord IV.\nA plagal cadence often used to be described as the sound of 'Amen' in Christian religious music, but this is not much help if you don't sing or listen to that kind of music!\nThis is a plagal cadence:\n5.3 – Describe the interval between two notes\nListen to two notes and then describe the interval between them. An interval in music is the distance in pitch between two notes. You count both notes, for example from G to F involves two notes, so it is called a 2nd.\nMajor and minor intervals\nWhere intervals are described as major or minor, this means that the major interval is a semitone bigger than a minor interval, for example C to Db encompasses just C and Db notes whereas C to D encompasses C, Db and D.\nAt this grade, an interval of a 4th will be a perfect 4th for example between C and F, and an interval of a 5th will be a perfect 5th for example between C and G.\nHere are examples of the intervals you need to know:\n- C – Db is a minor 2nd\n- C – D is a major 2nd\n- C – Eb is a minor 3rd\n- C – E is a major 3rd\n- C – F is a perfect 4rd\n- C – G is a perfect 5th\n- C – Ab is a minor 6th\n- C – A is a major 6th\n- C – Bb is a minor 7th\n- C – B is a major 7th\n- C – the next C is an octave\nAn easy way of remembering intervals is to play two notes, lowest first, on your instrument (use a piano or keyboard if you are a singer). Sing the notes back and think of a song that starts with these two notes. Remember which song goes with which interval!\nListen to the examples of each interval:\n5.4 – Changes in rhythm and pitch\nThe examiner will give you a printed copy of the piece you have been listening to. When the examiner first plays the piece, it will be correct but the second time there will be one change in rhythm and also one change in pitch. The changes will be to the top line only.\nFirst you have to say in which bar the rhythm changed. Then you'll say in which bar the pitch changed. In the exam you could point to the bars to show where each change was made, or give the bar numbers. In your E-MusicMaestro Aural Test Training you need to tell us the bar numbers where each change happened - first rhythm, then pitch.\nA rhythm change is an alteration that you could show by clapping because it does not affect how high or low a note sounds.\nPitch means how high or low a sound is. Remember that high is like bird song or a child's voice and low is like a lion's roar or a man's voice and it's nothing to do with volume.\nHere is an example of a rhythm change and a pitch change.
