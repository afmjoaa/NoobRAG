{"question":"What are the geographical constraints and habitats for Brontosaurus and Argentinosaurus? Where did these massive Sauropods live and why?","answer":"Brontosaurus was constrained to beaches, valleys, and low hills that didn't rise much above sea level air pressure due to physiological limitations in their blood-pumping mechanism - their blood would begin to boil at heights above 12-14 meters. Argentinosaurus, on the other hand, lived in what is now Argentina, specifically in the Patagonian region, which during its time (about 95 million years ago) was a lush paradise rather than the desert it is today. This area was particularly suitable for massive dinosaurs, as evidenced by it being a hot-spot for some of the world's biggest dinosaurs.","context":["Neuroscience Explains Why Dinosaurs Couldn't Get Any Bigger\nLong-necked Sauropods, like Brontosaurus, were the largest animals on earth, but their brain, not their leg strength, is what kept them from getting any bigger.\nWith their heads soaring 60 feet above the ground, Sauropods were gigantic animals, about the same height and length of The White House. Imagine the tremendous bone strength and muscle force required to support their 65 ton mass, equivalent to the crushing weight of a stack of 30-40 automobiles. The necks of long-necked Sauropods were 30 to 40 feet long (10-12 m), the length of the extended arm of the Statue of Liberty bearing the torch (42 feet). A massive heart would have been required to produce the 700 mm Hg pressure needed to pump blood to the Sauropod’s head; the same pressure that is exerted on your body by diving in the ocean to a depth of 30 feet (10 m). It has been calculated that the left ventricle of the dinosaur’s heart would have to weigh 2 metric tons to pump blood that high. That is 15 times heaver than the left ventricle of whales. Such an enormous heart muscle would have consumed 64% of the dinosaur’s energy (basal metabolism), leaving the creature little energy for everything else.\nTo overcome the problem of pumping blood to their brain, Sauropods may have been aquatic, but this outdated view is no longer accepted. Alternatively, Sauropods may have slinked around on land with their heads held low, grazing on grass with their noses in the turf, but if they raised their heads at the sound of an approaching Allosaurus (a forerunner of T. rex), or to nibble high in the trees, they would have fainted. A 65 ton dinosaur going belly up and crashing to the ground every time it stretched its neck up would fit its name, “thunder lizard” (Brontosaurus), but it is hard to believe that such a design flaw would have survived natural selection (or intelligent design).\n[Note that some experts prefer the name Apatosaurs to Brontosaurus, but the most recent research favors Brontosaurus.]\nAnother possibility has been suggested that Sauropod dinosaurs may have had a series of hearts along their neck, to bucket brigade blood to their brain, but there are no other vertebrates with a series of pumping stations running up their necks.\nA recent paper in the Journal of Experimental Biology explores a different possibility for how blood could have been pumped six stories high into Brontosaurs’ brain—a siphon. As everyone knows, a siphon can make fluid flow magically uphill and back down again with no force other than that necessary to overcome the friction of the fluid flowing in the tube. Did Sauropods siphon?\nAct One—Dinosaurs on Stage\nTo test their theory, an Australian team of biomedical engineers and neuroscientists including, Stephen Hughes, John Barry, Jeremy Russell, Robert Bell and Som Gurang, left the lab and ventured onto the theater stage. A theater is the perfect place to perform the experiment, because the stage ceiling is 15m high and equipped with ropes, catwalks, and pulleys to raise and lower curtains and props—all the apparatus one needs to elevate a model Sauropod jugular vein and carotid artery to any desired elevation.\nThe researchers made a vat of artificial dinosaur blood by adding red food coloring to a tub of water. Then they filled clear plastic tubing with the fake dino blood, being careful to exclude any bubbles, which would break the siphon, and they hoisted the middle of the tubing 12 meters into the air using the stage apparatus. The apex at the bend in the tube represents the Sauropod’s head. At one end of the tube, the researchers attached a small submersible pond pump, which delivered the same pressure as that produced by the heart of a giraffe. Voilà! The blood flowed freely to the head of the model dinosaur brain—no need for a massive pump or a series of pumping stations.\nBut, the experiments uncovered two very interesting problems; one caused the siphon to fail if they raised it any higher than 8 m, and the other failure occurred if they hoisted the tube higher than 12-14 meters. Using careful measurements and mathematical equations modeling the hydrostatics of blood flow in the simulated Sauropod brain, the researchers pinpointed the physical laws that explained both mechanisms of failure.\nAct Two: The Physics of Fluid\nThe reason a siphon works is that the column of water on the ascending side is equally counterbalanced by the same mass of water on the descending side. This is much like hoisting a heavy mass easily by using a pulley balanced by a counterweight. But as the column of fluid rises, the mass of the water inside the tube increases and it exerts a greater downward force from the pull of gravity. This creates a negative force (suction) of equal amount on the descending line increasing proportionally as the tube is elevated. The walls of the tube must be able to withstand the suction created by the siphon or they will collapse. No problem when a rigid pipe or pressure-resistant hose is used, but when a plastic tube similar in strength to a jugular vein was used in the experiment (dialysis tubing), the walls of the tube collapsed, pinching off the siphon. When the researchers hoisted it 8 meters in the air, the dialysis tubing snapped and drenched the stage with puddles of fake dino blood.\nAfter that life-size failure on stage, the researchers decided to scale down their experiment and return to the lab. They used a beaker of red water and thin dialysis tubing that was threaded through a strong-walled PVC tube filled with water, all designed to reproduce the appropriate fluid pressures in their scale model. In doing this, the scientists’ theory was that if a relatively flimsy tube, like a jugular vein, was surrounded by fluid that was encased in a more rigid material, the thin vein walls would be able to withstand the necessary negative pressure to prevent the vein from collapsing. Cerebral spinal fluid, interstitial body fluids and connective tissue surrounding veins, they conclude, could well have prevented collapse of the intracranial veins when Brontosaurus raised its head above 8 m, and their scale model supported this conclusion.\nThis brought them to a second, insurmountable limit, which prevented the siphon from working above 12-14 m. Back in the theater, the researchers found that when they raised the thick-walled tubing higher than 12 m, the dino blood began to boil at the apex bend in the hose, representing the dinosaur’s brain. Had this been a real Sauropod, the dinosaur would have lost consciousness and the bubbles in the blood would have caused an embolism and stroke. This is much like a SCUBA diver ascending from high pressure at depth and suffering the bends as dissolved nitrogen bubbles in the diver’s blood. Temperature is only one factor determining the boiling point of fluids; the other factor is pressure. Anyone who has tried to cook in the mountains knows that water boils at a much lower temperature at high altitude. In fact, at the low atmospheric pressure reached at 66,000 feet, which is well within the maximal altitude of the U-2 spy plane, blood boils at room temperature. Thus, pilots must wear pressure suits or the cabin of the aircraft must be pressurized to near sea level. When the researchers raised the tube to a height of 13.4 to 14.2 m, the fake dino blood boiled at the apex of the siphon sufficiently to break the siphon and the fluid flow stopped.\nAct III: Into the Past and Future\nThis new research explains why no long-necked Sauropods have been found with necks longer than 12 m, and it also gives insight into Sauropod habitat and migration. These dinosaurs had to have been beach goers, or at least they had to stay in valleys and low hills that did not raise much above sea level air pressure.\nRecently a new species of Sauropod,Dreadnoughtus, was found in Argentina that is much bigger than any previously known dinosaur. All of the neck bones in this gigantic specimen were not recovered, so we do not yet know if its neck length exceeded the 12 m limit predicted by this new study. Dreadnoughtus may have had a shorter stubby neck than other Sauropods, because of the limitation imposed by siphoning blood to its brain. If Dreadnoughtus‘ neck is eventually found to be longer than 12 m, it must have had arterial pumps in its neck or it had to hold its neck lower to the ground. “Some of the Sauropods do seem to have held their necks horizontal or close to horizontal,” says Dixy State University paleontologist Jerald Harris, whom I interviewed at the Johnson Farm Dinosaur Museum in St. George, Utah, for comment on this study by the Australian team of researchers. This inference about keeping the neck low is supported by anatomical features of the neck and skull bones, but it is difficult to know for sure. “Sauropods are a really interesting conundrum,” he says. “They are very difficult group to work with because of their size. It can take four or five people just to get one bone off of the shelf to study it, and they are so unlike anything that is around today.”\nThis research is a delightful example of how careful observation combined with scientific experimentation can give deep insight into intriguing scientific mysteries, using simple equipment, clever thinking, and scientific reasoning.\nThe Society for Neuroscience and its partners are not responsible for the opinions and information posted on this page.

How the Brain Limited the Size of Dinosaurs Huffington Post Science 06/06/2016 http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-douglas-fields/how-the-brain-limited-the_b_10308098.html","Argentinosaurus was a Huge Cretaceous Sauropod\nArgentinosaurus lived during the late Cretaceous period about 95 million years ago and comes from the Titanosauria family of Sauropods, meaning armored giants. Occasionally known as the “Dino Don” the Argentinosaurus is one of the most famous sauropods of huge proportions that was discovered in the 1990’s.\nThe name Argentinosaurus refers to the country in which it was discovered, Argentina, and comes from the Greek language which when translated literally means “Argentina Lizard”. Named in 1993 by Rodolpho Coria and Jose Bonaparte, Argentinosaurus is pronounced ahr-gen-TEEN-oh-SAWR-us.\n|Prehistoric Era||Late Cretaceous|\n|Weight||80 – 110 Short Tons (72.57 – 99.79 Tonnes)|\n|Length||120 feet (36.58 meters)|\n|Height||70 feet (21.34 meters)|\n|Maximum Speed||Approximately 6 MPH|\n|Territory||Argentina, South America|\nWhat did Argentinosaurus Look Like?\nArgentinosaurus was a very large dinosaur which had a long neck extending more than 29 feet, a relatively small head, a long tail and four rather short muscular legs.\nPalaeontologists know very little about Argentinosaurus as only a few fossilized bones have been recovered from a single individual. But basing their estimates on similar Titanosaur Sauropods, that of the Saltasaurus and Raperosaurus, they have estimated it’s size to be in the region of 72-120 feet long with a height of about 70 feet. Estimates of around 80 tons were recently given for Argentinosaurus weight though by the implementation of a new formula for calculating dinosaurs weight – this is now likely to be much less than previously thought.\nUntil a complete skeleton of Argentinosaurus is found Palaeontologists can not know for certain how large this dinosaur actually was, nor exactly what it looked like though the bones discovered, along with comparing other Sauropods, prove that this dinosaur was one of the largest ever discovered (though not the largest as is often mistakenly thought.)\nPhysical Attributes of Argentinosaurus\nPalaeontologists measured a single vertebra (back-bone) from Argentinosaurus at more than 5.24 feet tall, its tibiae (the joints between knee and ankle) measured 4.9 feet long, the humerus (the bone of the forelimb which would have joined the shoulder and elbow) measured almost 5.9 feet long and an incomplete femur shaft measured 3.87 feet making this dinosaur extremely large and quite intimidating.\nScientists have worked out that this dinosaurs back worked like a bridge made from bone, strong enough to support the weight of the animal but still light enough to produce a dinosaur of such immense size.\nResearchers have also discovered that Argentinosaurs bones were hollow, a very interesting characteristic. It is thought that this served as an evolutionary strategy for maximizing strength and size in relation to its weight.\nWhat did Argentinosaurus Eat?\nArgentinosaurus was an herbivore. This large sauropod had good teeth for grinding and chewing the tough plant material found in Cretaceous period Argentina.\nSome biologists believe that dinosaurs, particularly this large Argentinosaurus, were able to reach such a massive size due to the rate of their metabolism. It is thought that at the height of adolescence an Argentinosaurus would have been able to gain roughly 100 pounds per day – That’s a lot of plant matter!\nHow did Argentinosaurus Move?\nArgentinosaurus walked on four legs but little else is known about its method of locomotion due to a lack of fossil evidence. Some say that because this dinosaur was so big and heavy with rather short legs it may have had trouble moving and certainly wouldn’t have been able to run, but until more evidence is uncovered this is just speculation. We do know that close relatives to Argentinosaurus in the Titanosaur family with similar body shapes were slow movers so it is likely that Argentinosaurus was too.\nWhere did Argentinosaurus Live?\nArgentinosaurus lived about 95 million years ago on the super continent of Gondwana in an area that we recognize today as Argentina, South America. During that period the Patagonian desert was a lush paradise for dinosaurs such as Argentinosaurus.\nThe Patagonia region is one of the world’s hot-spots for the biggest dinosaurs, the 45 foot long carnivorous Giganotosaurus having also roamed here during the same time. It is possible that Giganotosaurus may have preyed on young or sick Argentinosaurus’ and that multiple Giganotosaurus’ may have hunted full-grown Argentinosaurus.\nThe Discovery of Argentinosaurus\nThis dinosaur was only recently discovered in the mid 1990’s at a farm in Patagonia, Southern Argentina, alongside a Giganotosaurus and not much is known about it.\nA shepherd called Guillermo Heredia discovered what he thought was a massive piece of fossilized wood from a tree trunk on his farm and called in palaeontologists from the nearby Carmen Funes Municipal Museum to take a closer look. It was discovered that this was no piece of wood, this was a huge shin bone (tibia) from a very large dinosaur who lived in the Cretaceous age, and a new species at that – A. huincelensis of the new genus Argentinosaurus.\nPalaeontologists went on to discover in total 3 anterior dorsal vertebrae, 3 posterior dorsal vertebrae (back bones), the 1st to 5th sacral vertebrae (the part of the backbone which is attached to the pelvis), sacral ribs of the right side, a major piece of fragmented dorsal rib and the right tibia (lower leg bone).\nBecause only a few fragmentary bones have been found, making up only 5% of the skeleton and the fact that no skull has been found, palaeontologists still have a lot of unanswered questions about this dinosaur and have very few clues to go on as to what it looked like.\nHopefully another Argentinosaurus specimen will be discovered in the future along with more pieces from the holotype, perhaps a skull, to enable palaeontologists to shed more light on this mighty long neck.\nThe Importance of Argentinosaurus\nThe discovery of a new dinosaur is always important as it helps palaeontologists to learn more about what was roaming the land in prehistoric times, shedding light on how future dinosaurs species evolved.\nThe Titanosaur Sauropods were one of the most successful dinosaur families to live after the decline of their predecessors and the discovery of Argentinosaurus hollow bones may fill in some of the missing data on how the Sauropods evolved over time. Unfortunately however without a complete skeleton or at least a skull it is difficult to know exactly what Argentinosaurus really resembled."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:544432b2-ef81-4fef-a45b-caf2859c2f2a>","<urn:uuid:b3713a21-f19f-4461-9776-5c9d8ab8134b>"],"error":null}
{"question":"As a Polish theatre student, I'm curious - what differences exist between Grzegorzewski and Grotowski's approaches to stage design and props use? Proszę o szczegółowe porównanie.","answer":"Grzegorzewski and Grotowski had contrasting approaches to stage design and props. Grzegorzewski created elaborate, grotesque but uniform scenic worlds, designing his own sets and favoring collage-style staging. He used props and set designs deliberately to deconstruct cultural myths and play with theatrical traditions. In contrast, Grotowski developed 'Poor Theatre' which eliminated all extraneous theatrical elements, using minimal to no props, sets, or costumes. He relied primarily on actors' physical skills to transform objects and create meaning, with actors sometimes even playing the role of props themselves. When props were used in Grotowski's work, they became highly symbolic after transformation.","context":["Producer, director, stage designer. Born in 1939. Along with Krystian Lupa and Jerzy Jarocki, he was one of the most outstanding Polish theatre directors. Died April 9, 2005 in Warsaw.\nA producer, director and stage designer.\nHe graduated from the Academy of Fine Arts in Łódź and from the Faculty of Direction of the National Academy of Theatre in Warsaw. In 1963, he assisted Kazimierz Dejmek with his productions at the National Theatre. After graduation, he began a collaboration with the Stefan Jaracz Theatre in Łódź, where he staged, among others, Bertolt Brecht's The Caucasian Chalk Circle, Stanisław Ignacy Witkiewicz's Daemoniac Super-Cabaret, Zygmunt Krasiński's Iridion, Anton Chekhov's The Pewit and his first production of Stanisław Wyspiański's The Wedding Party. Grzegorzewski created his own set designs for these productions, conjuring up a grotesque but internally uniform scenic world.\nIn 1967, Jerzy Grzegorzewski began a collaboration with the Old Theatre (Stary Teatr) in Krakow, where he created a second version of The Wedding Party, Variations, based on his own script and Ten Portraits with the Pewit based on Chekhov. Two years later, while continuing his work in Łódź and Krakow, Grzegorzewski became the artistic director of the Polish Theatre (Teatr Polski) in Wrocław, where he staged outstanding productions of Witold Gombrowicz's Wedding, Zygmunt Krasiński's Non-divine Comedy, and America based on Franz Kafka's novel. In 1982, Grzegorzewski moved to Warsaw and became the artistic director of the Studio Theatre (Teatr Studio) replacing Józef Szajna. Here, he staged his most mature productions, among them: Jean Genet's Screens, Tadeusz Różewicz's Trap, Bertold Brecht's The Threepenny Opera, Slow Darkening of Paintings, So Called Humanity Gone Mad and City's Counting Dog News based on his own scripts, Leo Tolstoy's Death of Ivan Ilyich, Anton Chekhov's Uncle Vanya, La Boheme based on Stanisław Wyspiański's rendering, and Molière's Don Juan.\nGrzegorzewski's Łódź productions outlined the scope of his theatrical interests. He would return to many authors and plays staged at the Stefan Jaracz Theatre. The plays of Witkacy, plus the authors of Polish Romanticism, Juliusz Słowacki, Adam Mickiewicz and Zygmunt Krasiński, Stanisław Wyspiański, Anton Chekhov, Jean Genet and Tadeusz Różewicz were interpreted many times. Returning to the same subjects and problems but always from new angles became a characteristic feature of Grzegorzewski's theatre, a theatre deconstructing cultural myths, including Polish romantic myths, while toying with theatrical traditions. For a long time, Grzegorzewski favoured collage, both on the textual level and in terms of the set design. Most of the productions based on his own scripts are compilations of plays by Lowry, Shakespeare, Wyspiański, Witkiewicz and Mickiewicz.\nUsually, Grzegorzewski was not faithful to the text. He would change the script and place the words in provocative new contexts.\nGrzegorzewski believed in a vision of theatre as an autonomous art and that is why his theatre survived the shocks of the turn of the 1980s. 'I was stubbornly, but maybe not effectively realising my version of understanding art as an independent field, and if there was any relation to reality, it resulted from what literature and the pressure of the times brought', he said in 1990. From the beginning, he was interested in existential problems, the death of culture, and of human beings, the theatricality of life, the motives of dream and memory,\nIn 1997, Grzegorzewski was appointed director of the main Polish theatre, the National Theatre in Warsaw. This appointment was controversial among critics who claimed that Grzegorzewski's previous productions were mannered and hermetic. These critics were against trusting a principally academic theatre to a principally avant-garde artist. Roman Pawłowski wrote:\nAfter twelve years, Poles got their National Theatre back. But the first premiere did not allow us to hope that this coexistence would be easy. Jerzy Grzegorzewski did not surprise his fans, did not shock his adversaries. His 'Night of November' is another puzzle of literary motifs, fascinating but difficult to understand because, as usual with this director, not all the pieces fit together.\nSoon, however, Grzegorzewski changed his approach a little. Instead of relishing theatrical games, he decided to use the national stage to speak about contemporary Poland, the fate of artists and spectators after the changes of 1989, and of history and the present. These were the subjects of Stanisław Wyspiański's Night of November, Halka Spinoza based on Witkacy, Witold Gombrowicz's Wedding and, in particular, his third staging of Wyspiański's The Wedding Party and Gombrowicz's Operetta.\nHe wants us to look at ourselves and his diagnoses are pitiless. In his 'Wedding party' there are no good characters: impotence, resignation and posing attack arrogance and primitivism. (...) Who will then rule the souls and lead them to action? Some are incapable of doing that, others can only wave their scythes, but that is definitely not enough. Are we then supposed to give up and continue considering our weaknesses or stir up reciprocal accusations? How current are the questions asked in Grzegorzewski's production? wrote Jacek Marczynski in \"Rzeczpospolita Daily\".\nMost important awards:\n- 1976 - the award for the direction and staging of Wedding in the Polish Theatre in Wrocław at the 17th Festival of Polish Contemporary Plays\n- 1981 - the second grade award for his entire artistic output in the field of direction awarded by the Ministry of Culture and Art\n- 1984 - the first grade award for the direction of Trap in the Studio Theatre in Warsaw at the 24th Festival of Polish Contemporary Plays\n- 1987 - the first grade award for outstanding artistic achievements in the field of direction and set designing for theatre awarded by the Ministry of Culture and Art\n- 1991 - the Konrad Swinarski award for the staging of Death of Ivan Ilitch based on Leo Tolstoy in the Studio Theatre in Warsaw and in the Old Theatre in Krakow.\nPrepared in June 2002; updated by James Hopkin, August 2010 .","Jerzy Grotowski -Theatre Practioner - Acting Method\nJerzy Grotowski was one of the most important European theatre practitioners of the 20th Century.\nIf you are currently preparing for LAMDA Acting Grade 8 you will need to know and understand the key principles and influences in the process of acting for one of the following practitioners: Constantin Stanislavski, Bertolt Brecht or Jerzy Grotowski. Here we look at Jerzy Grotowski.\nJerzy Grotowski was a theatre director, educator and creator of acting methods. He was born in 1933 in Rzeszów in Poland and died in 1999 in Pontedera, Italy. He is considered to have been one of the great reformers of 20th century theatre.\nHe was known for his intense actor training in Poland in the 1960s and 1970s.\nJerzy Grotowski and his small groups of actors were known for experimenting with many different aspects of theatre: spiritualistic, ritualistic and physical and also the nature of role and the relationship between actor and spectator. His acting system is probably the most complete approach to role since Stanislavski.\nHe invented the term 'Poor Theatre': a style of performance that got rid of all extraneous parts of theatre. This meant there were no lavish costumes, complicated props or detailed sets.\nRelied on skill of actors and required only a few props.\nGrotowski enjoyed working in unconventional spaces. He liked the audience to be all around the performance area or in amongst the actors.\nHe used the physical skill of his performers rather than costumes and minimal props to become other significant objects; building on Brecht's thoughts and ideas on performance.\n- Main influences: Brecht, Stanislavsky and Meyerhold.\n- Focused on actor training and probably most intensive actor training since Stanislavsky\n- Poor Theatre gets rid of excesses of theatre\n- Opposite to commercial theatre - the complete antithesis of the star-led shows you often see in the West End\n- Grotowski believed theatre could never compete with television and film so it shouldn't attempt to\n- The majority of Poor Theatre works never made it to performance\n- The ones that did were performed only once to a very small audience\n- The word 'paratheatre' is often used in relation to Grotowski - 'para' meaning 'beyond'\n- With 'paratheatre' Grotowski experimented with actors in training programs and other non-performed pieces.\n- The 'paratheatrical' phrase is generally believed to be between 1969/70 and 1975/1976\n- The Poor Theatre phase was between 1959 and 1970\n- 1975 marked the end of all Grotowski performances\n- Grotowski often experimented with classical works\n- He often updated them for a modern audience\n- He changed the setting to make them more relevant\nSpace and Actor/Audience Relationship\n- Traditional theatre spaces were ignored in favour of small rooms and buildings\n- He didn't believe in a traditional stage dedicated to acting or a purpose built theatre for performances\n- Grotowski's work focused on the relationship between the actor and spectator\n- The aim of his work was to eliminate the divide between audience and actor and create a union between the two\n- The audience were often on all sides of the actors and performance space\n- The actors performed around the space and audiences, placing themselves strategically amongst them\n- The acting area was often bare with little set and few props\n- Object transformation was an important part of Poor Theatre - props becoming different things\n- After a prop was transformed it became incredibly significant/often symbolic\n- The lighting was often just a general wash of the stage, no specific spotlights or focused areas\n- If costumes were used at all they were not character specific, they were completely anonymous\nActing and Characterisation\n- The actor and his/her skill was at the core of all Poor Theatre performances\n- Sometimes no 'real' props were used at all and other actors were employed to play important objects\n- The actor training was incredibly intense and took place over long periods of time\n- Grotowski wanted the acting to be completely authentic, much like Stanislavsky, but more physical\n- He used a version of Stanislavsky's emotion memory technique with his students.\nGrowtowski's main theories, training and techniques\n- Acting through focus and awareness\n- His actors were so physically and vocally skilled they could communicate clearly through just sounds and movements.\n- The actors kept healthy mentally and physically aiming to have inner peace and focus\n- They believed that acting was a search for self knowledge and awareness\n- The training taught them to break free from limitations and reach their full potential\n- Working in silence\n- Grotowski said an actor must begin by doing nothing\n- He believed that if a group of actors could remain completely still for several minutes without distractions then they would be able to concentrate more intensely and use it as a 'creative passage'\n- Physical training\n- The actors were extremely physically skilled\n- They developed a technique of movement which allowed them to control every move they made, even the smallest detail.\n- Grotowski believed that our bodies expressed everything about us. Everything we think and feel is expressed through our bodies and everything we experience is felt in our bodies.\n- He gave actors the skills to be able to fully express their emotions and imaginations.\n- Voice training was essential\n- They focused their voices as if they were coming from different parts of their bodies.\n- Range was incredibly important - they used all parts of their register from the lowest point to the highest.\n- Grotowski believed in the important of clarity - he used poetry, singing and chanting to impress this.\n- All of the actors were incredibly vocally strong - they were able to imitate nature sounds, animals and even thunder.\n- Grotowski thought of the voice as an instrument and treated it as such.\n- Human contact\n- He believed in real contact between human beings\n- He believed that human relationships only developed when people really looked and listened to each other.\n- He wanted actors to be aware of the impact they had on other people.\n- 'Poor Theatre' used the simplest of sets, costumes, lighting and props. This meant actors had to use all their skills to completely transform a space into other imaginative worlds.\n- Symbolism was incredibly important\n- The most important element was the relationship between actors and the audience.\n- Like Brecht, Grotowski used emotion memory to recall and experience and recreate the feeling and emotion that went with that memory.\n- He wanted total honesty and truth from the actors about their memories - the more truthful the memory the more genuine and authentic the performance.\n- Only by using their genuine memories would the actors find themselves on the oath to self discovery.\n- Evoking silence\n- Grotowski stated the actor should begin by doing nothing - he called this creative passivity.\n- By experiencing external silence they would begin to learn internal silence.\n- They could then use this for intense creative concentration.\n- Grotowski warned his actors to avoid what he called 'the beautiful lie' both on stage and in their every day lives.\n- By this he meant they should avoid doing things on stage, and in real life, just because they look good or it was what people expected them to do.

{"question":"How do TV production designers recreate historical locations when they can't access the original sites?","answer":"TV production designers work within practical parameters to create approximations of historical locations when they can't access original sites. For example, in 'The Pacific,' the entire series was shot in Australia rather than at actual Pacific battle locations. Production designers rely on available historical references and creative ingenuity to recreate period settings. When exact historical examples aren't available, they consider whether particular elements could have existed based on the raw materials and manufacturing techniques of the time. They focus on creating a convincing on-screen reality rather than achieving perfect historical accuracy.","context":["Designers on historical dramas live with an ever-present danger: sharp-eyed viewers ready to pounce on any anachronisms — real or imagined.\nProduction designer Tom Conroy chuckles over criticism from a British blogger objecting to what appeared to him to be radiators visible in the chambers of King Henry VIII during an episode of Showtime’s “The Tudors.” “We placed columns behind the king’s throne that were fluted and painted gold,” says Conroy. “They resembled radiators from a certain angle.”\nConroy’s experience is typical for designers on TV’s handful of period shows, including “Tudors,” Starz’s “Spartacus: Blood and Sand,” HBO’s “The Pacific” and AMC’s “Mad Men.” They sometimes veer from perfect historic recreations but insist their departures from historical accuracy are focused on enhancing the drama.\nThus, some costumes in “Tudors” more accurately resemble Italian and French era garb than less ornate English finery. In “Spartacus,” historically accurate drawings from ancient Rome are delicately, but inaccurately, etched onto leatherwear, and so on.\nOften it’s simply impossible to flawlessly replicate certain things. On “Pacific,” for instance, filmmakers couldn’t visit each battle location — the entire series was shot in Australia.\n“We endeavor to get it right, but it is within parameters how we deal with particular logistics,” says production designer Anthony Pratt. “At the end of the day, it’s an approximation; that’s inevitable.”\nSometimes the sniping is misguided. “Tudors” costume designer Joan Bergin has been accused of taking liberties with women’s plunging necklines but insists she found comments on low-cut dresses in an obscure ancient diary.\n“We have many different references,” she says. “I based Anne of Cleves’ wedding dress on the painting of Holbein (Henry’s court artist), but for Anne’s family, I went with the influence of Cranach. They are much different perspectives.”\n“Mad Men” production designer Dan Bishop says simple cost savings were the reason he built a barbershop out of Masonite rather than laminates used in the period.\nRefereneces to the ’60s on “Mad Men” are plentiful but sometimes contradictory, and details can be murky. “In those cases, you rely on creative ingenuity of our ancestors,” Bishop says. “If raw materials and manufacturing techniques were there, then you decide the particular thing could have existed, even if you don’t have an exact example in your research.”\nDesigners sometimes also take liberties for thematic reasons. Bergin says one important idea in “Tudors” was that Henry grows wealthier over time. So she purchased a collection of colorful vintage fabrics for the show at a charity auction. The fabrics were not Tudor but they were “so sumptuous that they fit the grandeur of the Tudors,” she says.\n“Spartacus” is largely a fantasy, so costume designer Barbara Darragh has leeway to mix and match liberally.\n“You take elements of history and then add original things,” she says. “Then it’s a question of where do you go from there. (That’s why) we made the leather etchings.” Since the show’s fight scenes are shot with high-speed HD cameras, “that (gives) viewers details of that beautiful work.”\nDarragh says mixing influences from different time periods and regions is often logical. “In Rome, Gauls, Germans, British and North Africans were all mixed up.”\nThe bottom line, the designers say, is there’s really no such thing as a totally accurate TV re-creation of any historical era. “You hope that you create a reality which is convincing onscreen in its own terms,” Pratt says."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:84ff595f-89f4-4302-8bb4-51f8048b645b>"],"error":null}

As for pest risks, wooden puppets can be damaged by various wood-boring insects like beetles that burrow into the wood. Key signs of infestation include holes, frass (insect-created sawdust), and fecal matter. Fresh, light-colored frass indicates active infestation, while dark brown frass suggests old damage. These pests are particularly concerning as they can spread to other wooden items and severely impact structural strength and value.","context":["Interesting facts about Puppet, Puppets, Puppet masters and Puppeteers\nListed bellows are different types of puppet\n1 sock puppets\n2 carnival puppets\n3 body puppets\n4 marionette puppets\n5 glove puppets\n6 rod puppets\n7 clay puppets\n8 objects puppets\n9 tickle bug puppets\n10 string puppets\n11 push puppets\n12 toy puppets and animal puppet\nInteresting facts about Puppet, Puppets, Puppet masters and Puppeteers\nFacts about puppets\nPuppets have been around for a very long time dating far back as fifth century BC (5BC) and can be traced to several ancient texts and works like the Xenophon, different dynasties, cultures and countries have had the puppet tradition well over a thousand years making it one of the oldest art form of expressionism. Early Roman Empire and ancient civilizations all had pupating cultures that were used for entertainment, information and sometimes political satires.\nPuppets are usually given names, characters and personalities to make them more believable, fun and easier for children to relate with, making some puppet characters very loveable are enduring and timeless in their appeal.\nPuppets are mainly models of objects, animals or a person that can be animated through manipulation either directly or remotely, the movement of the puppet is engineered through strings like that of the marionette or direct motions through a hand placed within the object. The person that manipulates the human like actions of the puppet is the puppeteer while puppetry is basically the art and skill of making a puppet.\nThere is no hard and fast rule in making a puppet which gives the puppet makers a blank canvas with many opportunities; early Indian puppets were made from clay dolls while areas that had bamboo created stick puppets, or bamboo puppets. Humanoid puppets have only one characteristic they should have the human form which includes eyes, nose, a mouth which is usually made wide and the head large or big. Some puppets have torso, arms and legs incorporated into the design making them more realistic.\nAnimal puppets need to resemble animals, if they are birds, snakes or lions the only criteria are that animal puppets should be recognizable as a particular animal. The puppet form needs be easy to handle flexible, have definite characteristic should be colorful and fun.\nPuppet master are puppeteers who have the prerequisite skill to maneuver the puppet thereby giving them a life like appearance, with certain kinds of puppet very little skill is required. But others such as string puppets, Muppet puppets like those used by entertainer such as comedians, and ventriloquists need to effectively synchronize mouth and body movement to give a convincing performance.\nPuppeteers learn a whole range of movement depending on the type of puppets he needs to master, some become proficient with stick control panels while others learn the use of rod controls or specific arm movement.\nThe range of movement also depends on the way the puppet is constructed, puppets that are made with joints especially in the arms, neck, and knees often have a wider range of movement than those without adjustable limbs.\nTop puppet master go through many years of training before mastering the technique involved in manipulating certain types of puppet, puppetry is the act of making puppets which range from the simple to the outright complicated puppet.\nTypes of puppets\nThere are many types of puppets and most are categorized by the medium they are built from, they could be made from Styrofoam, synthetic material, plastic, paper, wood, clay, clothing objects or cardboard.\nCarnival puppets are one of the most common puppets around, they are large and usually depict famous television characters and are usually manipulated by two or three puppeteers, Brazilian puppets especially during their yearly carnival are sometimes manipulated by several puppet masters and sometimes motorized equipment because for their huge sizes.\nCarnival puppets can also be made man-sized with an exaggerated head which the puppeteer wears; this carnival puppet is sometimes called a body puppet. Large conglomerates and top entertainment cooperation’s use this kind of puppetry for advertisement purposes, entertainment and merchandising.\nThe sock puppet\nThe sock puppet is also very common because of its practicability, it is very easy to make and requires very little skill to manipulate, and the puppet has a limited scope of movement because it is manipulated by one hand and is subjected to side, up and down movements. The sock puppet is made by getting an old sock; adding buttons for eyes, then gluing a head of hair attach the ears if you wish and outlining the mouth.\nAfter creating the puppet which should take less than ten minutes the puppeteer puts his hand in the sock and presto you have a sock puppet. By moving your fingers inside the sock the sock puppet appears to talk.\nHow to make a glove puppet\nGlove puppets and marionette puppets\nThe arm puppet is quite innovative yet simple to manipulate, the arm puppet needs two puppeteers to operate convincingly, but there are also one armed puppets. In order to manipulate the arm puppet convincingly the puppeteer puts his arm in the puppet which is made to cover the entire arm, then the second puppeteer acts as an appendage which usually is an arm or a foot that has been skillfully incorporated into the arm puppets design.\nThe two puppeteers work the puppet simultaneously offering the audience a wider scope of movement and a lot more realism, arm puppets is very popular and entertaining.\nThe puppeteer that manipulates the marionette puppets needs to have developed a number of skills, the marionette puppets have been used for outdoor entertainment especially in children’s parties for hundreds of years. They are string manipulated puppets that are basically controlled through string attached to the puppets at specific body parts.\nThe strings are attached to the puppet and then fastened to a horizontal control bar which the puppeteer skillfully turns to create the illusion of movement; the control bar can also be vertical but the outcome is the same.\nTo create lifelike movement in the marionette puppet the strings are attached to certain parts of the puppet, the string attached to the head gives the head movements, while the knee string control the legs, the hand strings control the arm of the puppet, the marionette could be made jointed for more maneuverability.\nVietnamese water puppets\nVietnamese water puppet\nThe water puppets originated from Vietnamese rice fields and are entrenched in the culture and traditions of the people, the puppets are very interesting and they act out various social, cultural and economic themes giving life to their art form.\nWater puppets are made out of wood and they are supported by stick or rod under the water which gives them their graceful movement and stability, the depth of the water theater usually does not exceed four feet (4ft) which gives the puppeteer enough room to manipulate the delightful puppets\nThe Muppet puppet\nThe puppet favored by ventriloquist or dummy is a one hand puppet manipulated by the entertainer, the puppet could by a hand puppet, glove puppet or even sock puppet depending on the performer’s preference. The ventriloquist throws his voice while mimicking mouth movements of the dummy to appear as if the puppet is talking.\nThese types of puppet are very common with entertainers and are usually given unique characteristic and personalities, the Muppet puppet is a show business icon. The ventriloquist’s puppets can also be table top puppets giving the comedian or performer the mover ability of placing the dummy on his knees, a table or the edge of a box.\nVentriloquist dummy can be made by trimming a Styrofoam into a big head, spraying adhesive or using glue to gum the fleece or velvet material on the cut eyes and large floppy mouth. The puppet arms are traced out cut, sewn filled with foam and attached to the body. Then the puppet can be fitted with a t shirt or small baby’s cloths and stuffed with foam to add form and realism.\nThe puppeteer can then control the dummy by putting an arm in the back to move the mouth which is now covered in black and red material to look like a real mouth.\nObject puppets, and shadow puppets\nPuppets can be objects\nObject puppets are puppets made out of any available object, they could be a mixture of odds and ends or the same item, and the puppet can also be drawn on a surface or hand. Object puppets are like freestyle art anything goes as long as it is given some characteristic that define the puppet.\nIf you arrange a bunch of tin cans in a particular manner and are able to manipulate them by means of strings, rod or attachment then you have created an object puppet.\nShadow puppets a silhouette forms cast against a translucent screen by a light source which could be diminished intensified or retracted to give the impression of form, structure and detail. The shadow puppet is usually a detailed cut out figure. The silhouette forms performed before an audience in the form of shadows, but Motekar shadow puppets are highlighted with dyes, tainting, colored lightening and other clever gismos.\nThere are the two kinds of rod puppets the complex rod puppet and the simplified rod puppet, the simple ones are just the puppeteer arm which acts as the body and the puppet has a head. More complicated rod puppets have rods attached to specific regions to mimic movement. Both types can also have strings connected to a control stick or rod.\nRod puppets re manipulated by wood or metal rods and have a limited amount of movement.\nTypes of Puppets\nother types of puppets\nVietnamese water puppets\nToy puppets are specially made puppet toys that can be made out of a diverse number of materials such as plastic, foam, synthetic materials, and wood, they may stay true to actual puppetry rules or the manufacturer might introduce new own elements.\nThe performance of the toy puppet could be enhanced through mechanisms or manipulated by hand, the design imagination and practicability rests on the designer’s vision and functionality. Toy puppets can be finger puppets, body puppets, hand puppets, rod puppets or object puppets, the toy maker might even make the parts so you can have the pleasure of assembling them before use.\nFinger puppets are simple puppets that fit unto your finger, they can be made from cloth material paper or any fabric, the puppet should have facial characteristics, which are a mouth, eyes, pinned or painted ears and could have a tiny cap.\nThe puppeteer has limited movement of the finger puppet which is restricted to the total movement possibly by a finger, they are fun easy to make and require a little originality and imagination. A puppeteer can have a finger puppet on all his fingers a single gloved arm if he so chooses.\nOther puppet types\nSome other puppet types include the tickle bug which is more or less a hand painting, the push puppet, the string puppet similar to the marionette, and the toy puppet. The animal puppet is a puppet that represents the image of an animal and can be manipulated by string, hand, glove or rod.\nThere are many types of puppets most of which are made by hand through cutting, using adhesive, stitching, sewing and coloring. The materials used range from wood, bamboo, cloth, foam, velvet, cardboards, and paper.\nConstant innovation in puppetry continually pushes the boundary and redefines the limits of puppet evolution, making them more realist independent of the puppeteer and almost becoming mechanized robots. Each puppet has a different character which makes puppeteer create fun personalities, giving it longevity and enduring favor with its teeming audience.\nPuppets have been here a long time and would be with us for many more years to come.","By Guest Blogger, Arianna Spiller, Art Conservation Intern\nImagine turning over a painting done on wood or a wooden piece of furniture passed down in your family for generations to find that is has now become the home and food of bugs and pests that are not so slowly ruining them without your knowledge. Woodboring pests will have a huge impact on the item’s value, the structural strength and long term preservation. This article will help you deal with this devastation/shock these bugs can bring about that is so common to antiques and artwork.\nImportant tip for you to know: If you bring an infested item into your storage area or display area, the wood pests will spread to other items.\nTypes of wood boring pests that could be a potential danger to your wooded artifacts and keepsakes are a multitude of beetles, moths, lice and cockroaches. These pests burrow and bore into wood and can potentially ruin your precious and expensive wooden antiques, furniture, and art. The majority of these pests are attracted to human food, animal products (furs, pelts, hides, certain upholstered furniture etc.), and a variety of woods. But they are also attracted to natural adhesives used in making the items (or old school restorations) like paste, hide and rabbit skin glue.\nTell tale signs of infestation are any sort of fecal matter, larvae, or bug itself in the area of concern. Others bugs will shed their skin or wings and traces of these will be left in the areas of boring or infestation. Some pests will leave a frass or “insect created sawdust” outside of the holes they have burred into. However, if you see frass it does not mean there has been recent activity… but there has been activity in the past. Another good tip: The color of the frass is important to note: if the color is light and the saw dust looks fresh then watch out! If its dark brown then its probably from an old luncheon appointment. Other signs of infestation are damage, holes and unknown markings to your wooden artifacts.\nInteresting note: wood boring insects usually come to the surface at a 90 deg. angle. If you see tracks of open channels/holes\nNote how insects come directly out of the wood and don't dig or eat along the surface.\nrunning along the surface, then the wood has been trimmed, shaved and modified. It possibly means the wood was taken from another older (infested) item and reused to make a new item.\nIf any of these signs are spotted, take action against these pests right away before the damage is too extensive or the bugs spread to other wood objects. If the pests are active, the situation will not get better by ignoring it and the bugs will not go away on their own.\nWhat the professionals do: Last week in the lab we had come in a painting by Edgar Payne with a newish Richard Toby frame that had holes and frass and we followed these steps: At Fine Art Conservation Laboratories, when an artifact is received with wood damage due to pests, it is immediately wrapped in plastic and sealed. An eye is kept on it to see if new frass or other debris appears to prove that the infestation is active and how bad the infestation is. The infested item is sent through a gas chamber first using a gas called Sulfuryl Fluoride, a pest killing gas, that is made by the company Vikane. Here is what the Vikane pdf handout says: “Drywood termites and other wood-destroying insects can cause significant damage as they feed on materials containing cellulose found in structures, such as wood, paper, textiles, furnishings, and works of art. Because these insects live most of their life cycle within their food source, the exact distribution and extent of infestation is often difficult to determine. Therefore, localized treatments using physical methods or conventional insecticides may not eradicate all wood-destroying insects infesting a structure. To solve this problem The Dow Chemical Company developed sulfuryl fluoride, the active ingredient of Vikane® gas fumigant, to be used exclusively by professional fumigators for structural fumigation (Dow AgroSciences 2010). Vikane is also used to control bed bugs, cockroaches, clothes moths, rodents, spiders, carpet beetles and other structure-infesting pests .”\nThe most frequent question I get when I discuss gassing pests is whether the gas affects art, antiques and other contents in a\nNote channels dug under paint.\nbuilding. The product that used to be used almost universally was called methylene chloride and it was considered safe. But I, personally, has not heard anything about Sulfuryl Fluoride directly associated with museum artifacts and artwork so I called the company. Several references in their literature and the person in customer service say that there has been ample testing and evaluation since 1961.\nThe wood item goes through this gassing process over several days before it is removed from the gas chamber. When it comes back into the lab, the item is then consolidated and sealed with a consolidant (to strengthen the weakened wood structure) that has a low viscosity so it will be able to absorb into the pores of the wood. The consolidant also helps inhibit (prtect against) reinfestation. If nothing is done to the wood after an item is gassed and all the pests are dead, the wood item can be immediately reinfected again if it is exposed to pests.\nHopefully this article encourages you to be aware of how dangerous these pests can be and inspires you to take some preventative actions against them. Some helpful tips are:\n- Wood boring bugs thrive in warm moist places… but to tell you the truth, they live in all climates. But the optimum general temperature and humidity for collection care is 55% relative humidity and 65% deg. Fahrenheit temperature and keep the fluxuations of these numbers to less that 20 points per a 24 hour period. Gor an article on this subject go to:\n- Keep an eye out for fresh frass. Vacuum cracks and crevices, of wood especially, every so often to make sure you see the newly formed deposits.\n- Try and isolate infested items from non infested items: but keeping them all in the same room (even if they are divided) will not work.\n- Pesticides and insecticides may work, especially for items like silverfish/firebrats (not wood boring but bad for items on paper and fabrics).\n- You can also introduce pest traps to an area for certain types of bugs.\n- Call a fumigator and ask about a chamber you can take your infested item to for gassing. After an item is gassed and all the pests are dead, the wood item can be immediately reinfected again if it is exposed to pests.\nTo learn more about what you can do at home to take care of your stuff, download now a copy of Scott Haskins’ book, How To SaveYour Stuff From A Disaster at 50% off!

{"question":"I work in cybersecurity and need to understand the security implications - what's the key difference between using packet crafting tools for penetration testing versus the risks posed by DNS poisoning attacks?","answer":"The key difference lies in their purpose and impact on network security. Packet crafting tools are legitimate security testing instruments used by network administrators to perform penetration testing, check firewall rules, and identify vulnerabilities in a controlled manner. This allows organizations to proactively strengthen their defenses. In contrast, DNS poisoning attacks pose severe security risks since they're malicious in nature - they're harder to detect and resolve because poisoned devices continue returning to forged sites, enabling attackers to steal sensitive data, install malware, and block security updates over extended periods. Additionally, while packet crafting requires technical expertise and specific steps (assembly, editing, replay, decoding), DNS poisoning attacks focus on exploiting DNS resolution to redirect users to fraudulent sites without their knowledge.","context":["Packet crafting is the process of manually creating or editing the existing data packets on a network to test network devices. Hackers and network admins use this process to test a network, check firewall rules, find entry points and test network device’s behaviors.\nNetwork data packets contain various information include data, source address, destination address, version, length, protocol, and few other things depending on the protocol. In packet crafting, one creates a completely new packet or edits the existing packet to change the information packet contains. Then, this packet is sent to the network to see the response of network firewall. By changing values in packet, attackers try to find the entry point in the network to intrude.\nI also want to point out that “packet crafting” and “packet spoofing” are not the same thing.\nPacket crafting is not a simple task for beginners. It consists of following steps:\n- Packet Assembly: Creating a new network packet or capture a packet going over the wire and edit the information as per requirement.\n- Packet Editing: Editing the content of an existing packet\n- Packet Re/Play: Send/Resend a packet in a network\n- Packet decoding: Decode and analyze the content of the packet\nTools for all these different steps are available. In this post, I will write about tools used in these steps. Few tools are step-specific while few can be used for performing all steps. You can try few or all the given tools to see how these tools work.\nI will also recommend you to read our existing article on Packet Crafting. In that article, we have explained packet crafting in detail with explanation of all four steps involved. We have also shown how to use a few packet crafting tools. That article will help you to understand the packet crafting the usage of those tools. Once you understand clearly, you can read this article to see the available packet crafting tools. Some tools are very old but still work fine. Other tools are actively in development, while still others are no longer in development.\nI will also recommend you to learn about network packets, packet structure of different protocols and network layers. If you do not know these things, you will not be able to understand how to do packet crafting and how the things work with these tools. For learning purposes, you must understand the basics of networking before proceeding with the list of these tools. You must know about data packets of different protocols, different fields in packets, the meaning or purpose of those packet fields, and how those packets are used in the network communication. Once you know about those things, you will be able to change those values to see desired effect in the network. So, do not try these tools without learning the previously-mentioned skills. You will end up wasting your time and effort.\nThese are the 15 best but free packet crafting tools.\nHping is one of the most popular and free packet crafting tool available.

If you know everything about these, you will be able to perform better attack and create better defenses against these attacks.\nPacket crafting is one of the best ways to perform network penetration testing. You can try creating layer of security and then try again to break your own security. In this way, you will be able to prevent hackers to exploiting vulnerabilities in the security mechanism you created. Hackers always try to intrude into the internal network of companies. In recent months, we have seen so many attacks against big companies. In most of the cases, internal network hacked to access confidential information. Therefore, network security is one of the most important tasks in any business. So, learn packet crafting and learn these tools. The more you learn, the better security person you will become. All these tools are created for special purposes. You can try these tools to modify packets to test the firewall rules and break the security.\nNote: We do not encourage use of these tools to test the security of a network without getting prior permission. Most businesses use proper security and tracking. If you caught attacking a network, you may be booked under cyber-crime laws in most countries.

It imitates another device, user, or client. It acts as a cover, which makes it easier to disrupt the regular flow of traffic or reach protected information.\nThe attackers remodel a Domain Name System (DNS) into a spoofed one. So, when a client wants to visit a website, they will be directed to a completely different site, rather than opening the legitimate destination they requested to visit. Users usually don’t even understand that they have reached a fake site. That is because they are designed as same as the original site without any major differences.\nAfter the attack is initiated, the traffic is directed to the non-legit server. Therefore hackers are capable of performing malicious actions, such as man-in-the-middle attacks and steal sensitive information. Another scenario is installing a virus to the victim’s computer and cause a lot of damage. Even further, they can place a worm to expand the harm to more devices.\nHow is DNS poisoning so dangerous?\nDNS poisoning poses risks to organizations and also to individuals. Maybe the biggest risk is that once a device has become a victim of DNS poisoning, it is very challenging to solve the issue. This is because the poisoned device will continue to go back to the forged site. Besides, the DNS poisoning attack is very hard to be detected by a user. The attackers direct the traffic to a very similar website. In this situation, the visitor doesn’t identify that there is something wrong. The user inputs their sensitive information as usual and doesn’t realize that they exposed themselves to severe risk.\nHere are some of the severe dangers that this type of attack includes:\nWith DNS poisoning, it is easy for attackers to steal sensitive information. For example, logins for protected sites – banks, organizational systems, or information about house proprietary. The personally identifiable information is also valuable, like social security numbers or information details about payments.\n- Malware and viruses\nAfter a visitor is led to a forged website, for the attackers is possible to access and install a host of viruses and malware to the users’ device. It includes a virus designed to harm their device and also other devices with which it interacts. On the other hand, the malware provides the attackers continuous access to the device and the information inside it.\n- Security blockers\nWith DNS poisoning, malicious actors can cause critical damage in a long time period. This happens through redirecting the traffic from security providers to block devices from getting essential updates and patches that keep the strong security. In this way, the devices are becoming more defenseless through time. So like that, the door is open for various other kinds of attack, such as Trojans.\nWhat are appropriate protective measures against it?\nThere are possible ways to protect the resolution of the DNS name from being tampered with. As an example, by implementing DNS cookies that secure the integrity and authenticity of clients, DNS queries can be protected. Also, the servers and the information which is transferred between them. Another thing that can help with protecting against DNS spoofing is implementing a DNSSEC technology.\nTo create DNS tampering even more difficult, it is essential to use well-maintained and up-to-date software on routers, name servers, and all kinds of devices. This is because the weaker points for attack performed by attackers and malware are far less on the patched system."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"language-ambiguous"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:2d071935-79f4-4ebd-98ff-280693b0649c>","<urn:uuid:f044075f-9cbe-4cc5-8d39-e2f5bb9971eb>"],"error":null}

Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium perfringens, and Listeria monocrytogenes frequent people’s hands and kitchens. And unlike bacteria that cause food to spoil, these bacteria cannot be smelled or tasted. Safe food handling is necessary for prevention.\nStaphylococcus (“staph”) bacteria are found on our skin, in infected cuts and pimples, and in our noses and throats. They are spread by improper food handling. Prevention includes washing hands and utensils before preparing and handling foods and not letting prepared foods- particularly cooked and cured meats and cheeses ass well as meat salads- sit at room temperature more than two hours. Thorough cooking destroys “staph” bacteria, but the toxin it may produce is resistant to heat, refrigeration, and freezing and can make you sick.\n“Perfringens” is called the “cafeteria germ” because it may be found in foods served in quantity and left for long periods at room temperature. Prevent it by dividing large portions of cooked foods such as beef, turkey, gravy, dressing, stews, and casseroles into smaller portions for serving and cooling. Keep cooked foods hot or cold, not lukewarm.\nListeria bacteria multiply, although slowly, at refrigeration temperatures. Therefore, these bacteria can be found in cold foods typically served on buffets. To avoid serving foods containing Listeria, follow “keep refrigerated” label directions and carefully observe “sell by” and “use by” dates on processed products like deli meat. Thoroughly reheat frozen or refrigerated processed meat and poultry products before eating.\nIf illness does occur, contact a health professional and describe the symptoms.\nWhich is better at preventing a foodborne illness outbreak—a wooden or plastic cutting board? This is a long-standing food safety question. Some research suggests wood is a better option, because the pores in the wood can trap and immobilize bacteria, which then die. Other studies, however, suggest bacteria absorbed in wooden boards can in fact survive and could possibly multiply and recontaminate the surface in the future, making plastic seem superior.\nThe take-away message is that all cutting boards, plastic or wooden, can be sources of contamination. To help prevent contamination, your cutting board needs to be clean and in good condition.\n- After each use, scrub your cutting board in hot, soapy water, then rinse and allow to air dry.\n- Using the dishwasher to clean plastic and solid wooden boards is fine, but laminated boards can crack in the dishwasher.\n- Wooden and plastic cutting boards can be disinfected with a bleach solution (1 tablespoon traditional regular chlorine bleach [6% sodium hypochlorite] per gallon of water or 2 teaspoons concentrated bleach per gallon of water). Pour solution over the surface and let sit for at least one minute; then rinse well and air dry.\n- It is time to get a new cutting board if your board has cracks, crevices, chips, or grooves where bacteria can hide.\n- Designate one cutting board for raw meat, poultry, and seafood, and another for vegetables, fruits, breads, and other ready-to-eat foods to avoid cross-contamination.\nFor more information, visit the Iowa Food Safety website: http://www.extension.iastate.edu/foodsafety/\nSources: University of California, Berkley Wellness Letter (December 2014) Food Safety Tips for Food Event Volunteers SP 452: https://store.extension.iastate.edu/Product/Food-Safety-Tips-for-Food-Event-Volunteers\nCross-contamination is a potential risk when preparing a variety of foods. It happens when harmful bacteria from one food, especially raw meat, is transferred to another food. It usually happens when cutting boards, knives, counter tops, and your hands are not washed after handling each food item.\nSteps to prevent cross-contamination include:\n- When shopping, keep produce and meats separate by putting each in plastic bags. Make sure the grocery bagger keeps them separate as well.\n- Always use a clean cutting board. If possible use different boards for fresh produce and raw animal products. Also, do not use excessively worn cutting boards; replace them.\n- Wash dishes and counter tops with hot soapy water before and after preparing each food item. When refrigerating food, make sure juices from raw meat and other animal products do not drip onto other foods. Keep them in sealed plastic bags or containers and stored below ready-to-eat food items.\n- Wash your hands before and after handling food, allowing about 20 seconds while using soap and warm water.\nGet more information on how to avoid cross-contamination.\nCutting boards are one of the most common kitchen items that can cause cross contamination. A different cutting board should be used for raw meat, poultry, and seafood than is used for preparing ready-to-eat foods like salads and fruits.\nProduce may not be cooked before serving, so contaminants will not have a “kill step” prior to consumption. Consider purchasing different color cutting boards and designate each color for a particular food. For example, red for meat, yellow for poultry, white for grain products, green for vegetables."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:59d08332-4e3d-48ee-904a-fa17b978d5e4>","<urn:uuid:d9fd56ca-fc8c-4e4d-8f05-8e91c60fa8ac>"],"error":null}

{"question":"What innovations have emerged to improve accessibility in public bus transportation, comparing physical infrastructure changes at stops versus technological advances on buses themselves?","answer":"Public bus transportation has seen accessibility improvements both at stops and on vehicles. At bus stops, initiatives like the installation of fiberglass seating cubes provide essential rest spots for seniors, disabled passengers, and parents with children who previously had to stand while waiting. These 2'x2'x2' cubes offer a permanent, weather-resistant solution that fits in compact spaces. On the buses themselves, sophisticated air management systems have evolved significantly, offering features like rapid kneeling capabilities that lower buses for easier boarding. Modern systems like the Smart Air Management System (SAMS) can automatically adjust ride heights for different boarding situations, from curbside to platform height, and can complete kneeling and recovery cycles in as little as three seconds. These technological advances represent significant progress from the early, slower air suspension systems of the 1980s.","context":["When Tom Hingson took a position as a part-time driver for King County Metro in Washington State in 1983, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) would not be signed into law for another seven years. However, even in ’83, some buses were equipped with kneeling capabilities, but the technology was designed simply as a convenience, not compliance. Those early air suspension systems allowed transit buses to lower their boarding threshold for easier entry, but they were noisy and slow to respond.\nWhile “The air escaping from the air bags when you manually triggered the kneeling feature was loud,” says Hingson, now transportation services and transit director for Everett Transit in Everett, Wash., “After the passengers boarded, it would take a good deal of time for the air suspension to reinflate to normal ride height so we could depart — you could hear and feel the air system labor at the task.”\nThe inflation time lapse meant that Hingson had to wait until the suspension was fully at ride height before proceeding. The whole process took a bit of time and added another friction point whenever the kneeling feature was used, but Hingson’s early air suspension system still beat the alternative.\nBetter than the alternative\nBack in the day, most buses were riding on steel spring suspensions, and some continue to do today. The springs are factory adjusted to provide the optimal ride when a bus is full of passengers and become progressively more reactive the fewer passengers there are. Steel springs simply cannot isolate a chassis and everything and everyone riding upon it, from uneven road surfaces — and they certainly cannot kneel.\nOver the years, Hingson has watched air suspensions and air management technology advance. Today’s air suspension and ride control systems make the bus ride experience much smoother, more comfortable, accessible, and convenient for everyone involved.\nNot only have transit bus air suspensions become far more sophisticated, but they are also being called upon to do a lot more. Many systems offer front and whole-side kneeling and can be manually or automatically adjusted above ride height, if necessary, to accommodate platform entry. Some systems even offer a tilt feature for basic maintenance access.\nWhy electromechanical ride control is important\nMost air suspension systems use a mechanical valve and lever system that toggles as the vehicle’s wheels and suspension moves up and down in relation to the chassis. As the lever moves, it either opens or closes ports that likewise inflate or exhaust air from the system’s air bags, also known as bellows, mounted on both sides of the suspension.\nWhile they provide a generally comfortable ride over a variety of surfaces, mechanical valves can overreact to more dramatic surface inputs, like a large pothole. A temporary imbalance can occur while the mechanical system recalibrates itself after a concussion, resulting in increased fuel use to support longer and more frequent compressor run times.\nLike most other technologies, air suspensions have progressed over time. Computer-controlled air management and ride control systems have been evolving over the last two decades and are now more effective and versatile than ever before. Using controllers with sophisticated algorithms, the systems make precise corrections to air bag inflation in milliseconds, smoothing out the ride of buses operating on even the worst of roads.\n“When everything is working properly, you get an exceptionally smooth ride,” says Hingson, referring to the Proterra Catalyst buses and other similarly equipped vehicles currently serving the Everett Transit fleet.\nBut ride control and air management systems aren’t only about ride quality, they provide so much more. Not only are driver and passenger comfort and safety enhanced by superior ride characteristics, but the ability also to manually and automatically control and manage onboard air systems means buses can more safely and effectively serve a broader segment of the riding public.\nCompassion, convenience, and compliance\nThough ADA mandates were originally enacted to assure accessibility for those coping with disabilities, many of the innovations developed to meet those requirements, particularly within the field of mass transit, offer wide-ranging benefits to passengers and drivers alike.\nThe speed and recovery of bus kneeling is a good example of the advancements in air management technology that have resulted in greater convenience for the broader ridership. Gone are the days when kneeling a bus challenged both schedules and patience.\nBuses now quickly lower to kneeling height and return to ride height within as little as three seconds after the doors are closed. The swift kneeling and recovery cycles remove friction from the system and allow the feature to be used more liberally.\n“Our customers come in all shapes and sizes, ages, and physical capabilities,” says Hingson. “So, anything that we can do to make it easier to ride the buses on our system we will do.”\nHingson explains that Everett Transit has trained all its drivers to kneel their buses close to the curb. They are also instructed to offer ramps, even to persons who are merely walking slowly.\nEverett serves routes where passengers exclusively board at curb height and do not have to contend with platform loading and unloading. The buses generally make stops every two to three blocks and the drivers manually control the kneeling feature.\nAccording to Hingson, the county has a larger transit system and that system overlays Everett’s. The county’s system does serve passengers who board via platforms and dealing with this variability is where air management has made some of its greatest strides.\nSmarter Air Management Systems\nDigitally-driven air management systems, like Link Manufacturing’s Smart Air Management System (SAMS), now bring the promise of greater safety, increased operational efficiency, superior ADA compliance, and far more sophisticated levels of automation.\nLink is the maker of the SmartValve, a patented, integrated height control system that can take the place of mechanical height control valves and offers automated and manual ride adjustment features. The company incorporated SmartValve as an integral component in its SAMS technology.\nWith SAMS, precise kneeling, elevation, and wheelchair ramp operation performance is possible, allowing drivers to accommodate passengers boarding from curbside — to platform height — and anything in between. Buses can lower and raise to enable zero-angle and flat ramp access where necessary, and drivers can even control individual air bags when desired.\nParatransit buses can benefit from SAMS technology. Depending on passenger placement, when these vehicles begin forward movement, there is often significant pressure placed on the rear suspension, which can cause the front suspension to elevate as the rear drops. Many paratransit bus bodies are tapered in the rear to compensate for this, and to avoid potential contact with the pavement. With SAMS, the system actively monitors the vehicle’s load in real time. As a SAMS-equipped bus moves forward, it can sense any imbalance and can elevate the rear suspension override height, leveling-out as the bus reaches speed, all while maintaining equilibrium.\nDepending on route and boarding characteristics, and on what levels of automation a transit authority wants to achieve, buses can also be outfitted with geotagging technology to maintain exact and repeatable ride heights that require little, if any, human operation by drivers.\nSay for instance that during a certain portion of its route, a bus is making frequent stops at several platforms with a uniform height. A smart system can allow the bus to stay at that pre-programmed ride height between stops, without further inflation or exhaustion. By minimizing the inflation and deflation cycles on specific routes, a smart air management system can reduce wear-and-tear on air suspension components.\nConversely, geotagged routes consisting of mixed passenger loading heights can be individually tagged for optimal bus arrival heights. Under these circumstances, a bus will automatically adjust its ride height as it approaches its stop, saving time and reducing the need for manual operation or adjustment once the bus arrives.\nSAMS offers transit fleets total air management capabilities with diagnostic monitoring, LED indicator, touchscreen interface, and USB connectivity. With the SAMS user interface, drivers can also override a vehicle’s set ride height to raise and lower its chassis at low speeds, when desired.\nThe automation-rich capabilities of SAMS technology also set the table for enhanced pneumatic operation in future semi-autonomous, and ultimately, autonomous vehicles. These modes of transportation will rely even more heavily on intelligent support systems to keep them up and running safely and smoothly with little or no human intervention.\nIn the last few years, silicone oil-based hydraulic systems have also been introduced. However, their more complex suspension architecture and high cost of entry can make them prohibitive to many transit fleets. Their reputation within the transit industry for exorbitant maintenance, repair, and replacement costs can also make hydraulic systems less attractive in the long run.\nUnlike air management systems like SmartValve and SAMS, which have five decades of heavy-duty commercial suspension application experience behind them, hydraulic suspension systems have only recently migrated from the automotive sector and are not truly rated for commercial use. Even the use of hydraulic oil is counter to the lower carbon direction that much of the transit industry is moving.\nIt is no secret that U.S. transit fleets are migrating away from oil- and carbon-based vehicles. Following the macro-trend toward zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs), forward thinking fleets are purchasing hydrogen, natural gas, and electric buses in record numbers.\nDecarbonization is happening and it is happening fast. The trend will put additional pressure on bus manufacturers to move away from hydraulics and traditional air suspensions with mechanical valves, because they use more compressed air to operate, and thus, more energy than electronically-controlled systems.\n“We purchased our first Proterra Catalyst electric buses 30 months ago,” says Hingson. “Our nine buses have a projected lifespan of 12 years each, so we’re still in the early stages, but we plan to be operating an almost all electric fleet by 2024.”\nLink’s SAMS system has significant experience with ZEVs, including Everett’s Proterra Catalyst buses. SAMS has the capabilities to provide broad and sophisticated performance with low power consumption overhead.\nUsing smart air management systems like SAMS, transit fleets using ZEVs can achieve enhanced driver and passenger safety, while increasing power savings and operational efficiencies, including reduced compressor run times. In short, as we move into the future, ZEVs will perform better and travel longer distances between charges with smart air management.\n“So far, just our small number of electric buses have reduced our fleet’s carbon footprint by about 626 tons of carbon dioxide,” says Hingson. “And if things go as planned, our majority electric fleet will reduce our carbon dioxide output by 6,628 tons over the next 15 years — we won’t be alone in this shift to reduce carbon pollution.”","Anyone who has ever used public transportation in Rochester is painfully aware of two things: At some point you will have to wait for your bus, and when you do, you will probably be standing.\nFor senior citizens, people with disabilities, and parents with young children, being made to stand for any length of time can be less than ideal. Even for those passengers who are physically capable of standing, having no place to sit while waiting on the side of a busy roadway can cause anxiety and discomfort.\nWhy is our bus system the only transportation mode that requires its passengers to stand while waiting for the service? The single biggest issue is the sheer scale of the system. There are thousands of bus stops in the RTS network, and the resources of the transit authority are already spread thin.\nIf this issue could be remedied, not only would we make the lives of current riders a little easier, but we might also encourage more people to use public transportation. This is why Reconnect Rochester has decided to make bus stop seating a priority for our community.\nIn 2014, Reconnect Rochester set out to find a solution. What we came up with was a design for a bus stop seat that is a simple 2’x2’x2’ cube. Our bus stop seating cube comes in 4 primary colors (red, green, yellow, and blue) that add beautification and brightness to the street landscape. The compact size allows the seat to fit easily within areas where space is at a premium – such as tree lawns or that little bit of space between the street curb and sidewalk.\nIn 2017, after 3 years piloting seasonal bus stop cubes made from high-pressured wood, Reconnect Rochester set out to find a permanent, year-round amenity for bus riders. In our research, we came upon a local manufacturer of fiberglass — a nearly indestructible, weather resistant material that was perfect for the job!\nIn September 2020, Reconnect Rochester installed the first 15 fiberglass cubes on Parsells, Lyell and Monroe Avenues (read more in this blog post). Stay tuned to our blog and social media for updates on our current efforts.\nCubes for Your Community\nReconnect Rochester will continue to work with RTS, local municipalities and community organizations throughout Monroe County to add bus stop cubes at stops that are well utilized but lack seating.\nWould you like to see bus stop cubes at stops in YOUR neighborhood or community? Contact us and we’ll do our best to work with you to secure funding and make it happen.\nAre you from outside the Monroe County area and interested in purchasing bus stop cubes for your town or city? Contact us and we’ll put you in touch with the manufacturer. Reconnect Rochester receives a sales commission that helps fuel our effort to put more bus stop cubes on the ground locally.\nThe Bus Cube Birth Story\nThe bus cube was born in 2014, when Reconnect Rochester set out to come up with a temporary solution to the dearth of seating at local bus stops. Here’s how we did it…\nWe spent countless hours brainstorming. We scoured the internet. And we even met with a local furniture designer, Staach (we really admire the way those guys balance form, function, and sustainability). But we needed something that would be relatively inexpensive and easy for regular people like us to build and duplicate. It would also need to be compact, sturdy, and weather resistant.\nWe could have simply taken a page from the guerilla bus stop seating playbook and chained a plastic patio chair to a bus stop sign, but to be honest, we’re not fans of plastic furniture. And we really didn’t think the neighbors would appreciate this look very much.\nThen one day, almost like it happens in the movies, the solution hit us like a lightning bolt…good old-fashioned children’s blocks! It’s amazing how sometimes the best ideas are inspired by the simplest things. Children’s blocks. Durable, easy to use, easy to construct – and what could possibly be more fun? Quite fitting for Rochester, the home of the National Toy Hall of Fame!\nWe put pencil to paper and designed a simple 2’x2’x2’ cube. The compact size allows the seat to fit easily within areas where space is at a premium – such as tree lawns or that little bit of space between the street curb and sidewalk. Our prototype was constructed using pressure-treated lumber and decking materials for a total cost of about $100 per cube.\nWe tested the prototypes at two locations within the city of Rochester: The PriceRite at Dewey & Driving Park and N. Union St. at the Public Market. The results were very positive. Interviews with transit riders and passersby can be viewed in this video.\nThe idea quickly won community support as well as accolades from RTS which encouraged the effort. Over the next three years (2014 – 2017), in partnership with the City of Rochester, Flower City Habitat for Humanity and many neighborhood and community organizations, we built and placed a fleet of over 30 bus stop cubes at bus stops all around the city.\nThe seasonal cubes go out on the street in May and are brought back in and stored in October. As the fleet grew, the job performed by Reconnect Rochester volunteers of placing, removing and storing the cubes each season, became harder to manage. That’s when we decided it was time for a permanent, year-round solution.\nIt took about three years (2017 – 2020) of stops-and-starts to research, design and manufacture the fiberglass model that you see today. But we’ll save THAT story for another day."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:b118fd75-d7e0-4e84-a645-9de0bbe3979f>","<urn:uuid:8c0f0c5d-b054-4819-bc2a-31c2ee4f7f40>"],"error":null}

The four layers have distinct physical and chemical properties that are influenced by their position from the Earth’s surface. The layers are the crust, mantle, inner core and outer core. These layers have both a direct and indirect impact on the Earth’s surface. A boundary known as the Mohorovicic (or simply Moho) discontinuity can be found in between the crust and the mantle.\n5. Inner core\nThe inner core is the central layer of the Earth, composed of dense materials that are thought to have accumulated during the formation of the Earth. Unlike the outer core, the inner core exists in a solid form due to the increased pressure which solidifies iron in the layer. The core has a radius of 750 miles. Temperatures within the core can reach over 10,000 Fahrenheit and the layer contains mostly iron and nickel elements with heavier mineral deposits of gold, silver, platinum, palladium and tungsten.\n4. Outer core\nThe outer core is a liquid layer that has a width of 1,430 miles and a depth of 2,100 miles. Temperatures can reach 10,345 Fahrenheit which is hot enough to melt the iron that composes the layer. The outer core has a very high velocity, spinning at rates higher than the rate of the Earth resulting in the formation of the Earth’s magnetic field.\n3. Lower mantle\nThe lower mantle is larger than the upper mantle and it reaches a depth of 400-1,800 miles. When compared to the upper mantle, the lower mantle is less dense and is mostly solid due to high temperature and pressure. Little information is known about the lower mantle.\n2. Upeer mantle\nThe upper mantle is the second layer below the crust with materials existing in a semi-molten to solid state. The mantle has convectional currents within it which are responsible for tectonic movements of the Earth’s crust, seafloor spreading, mountain formation, and temperature regulation. Scientists believe that these movements were instrumental in the formation of the Earth’s crust. Temperature and pressure within the mantle increase with depth. The mantle is divided into two layers. The upper mantle is separated from the crust by the Mohorovicic discontinuity or Moho. It extends to a depth of 200-250 miles from the crust. Most of the materials in the upper mantle exist in a semi-molten state (magma) and are brought to the Earth’s surface through tectonic movements such as volcanicity. The pressure in the upper mantle is responsible for different chemical and physical properties. Rocks in the upper mantle have less silicon and more iron and magnesium than those of the crust.\nThe crust is the uppermost and thinnest layer of the Earth made up of mainly sial (silica and aluminium) and sima rocks. The crust extends to a minimum depth of 3.1 miles and a maximum depth of 43.5 miles. The crust has two different varities: the continental crust and oceanic crust. The continental crust supports the solid land mass we live on and is less dense and thicker than the oceanic crust. It also has a higher level of elevation due to its low density and impact from seismic waves. The oceanic crust supports oceans and is composed of dense rocks such as magnesium and silicate igneous rocks. In areas where the continental crust meets the oceanic crust, the physical and chemical properties of the two become similar.\nWhat are the Layers of the Earth?\nThe Earth is made up of four primary layers that exist in a spherical structure resembling an onion. The four layers have distinct physical and chemical properties that are influenced by their position from the Earth’s surface. The layers are the crust, mantle, inner core and outer core."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:ceab9dfd-6934-4045-b610-1a3afad6fd08>","<urn:uuid:13d36d12-930e-4dbf-b301-a3907f6d5d8f>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I've heard about new helmet safety technologies - how do MIPS helmets compare to traditional fire helmets in terms of head protection?","answer":"MIPS and traditional fire helmets offer different types of protection. Traditional fire helmets focus on protecting against direct impacts and heat, but have faced criticism due to their weight causing head and neck strain issues. The MIPS system specifically addresses rotational motion protection, which is important since the brain is more sensitive to rotational forces than linear impacts. MIPS works by incorporating a low-friction layer that allows 10-15mm of movement to redirect rotational forces during impacts, while adding only 25-45 grams of weight. This technology has been proven through testing to reduce rotational acceleration transmitted to the brain, while maintaining protection against vertical impacts. Traditional fire helmets, in contrast, have been criticized for their heavy weight causing physical strain and potential long-term injuries to firefighters.","context":["Millions of firefighters are facing head and neck injuries due to the weight of fire-helmets. These helmets are the rescue helmets that are a part of their protective clothing. This research will focus on the main three issues:\n1) Any upper limit of the weight that can be safely supported by the head with regards to both short- and long-term injury?\n- Is there an optimal distribution of mass that would minimize the risk of head and neck injury?\n- Are different design criteria, in terms of loads and load distributions, required for helmets intended for women?\nMany studies have been conducted to understand the accurate weight of the head gears that are comfortable and safe for firefighters.\nFor the literature review of the topic the resources are searched through various sources like internet and library. The resource list contains Journal articles, Text books, technical reports, websites and patents.\n1-The study by Ainsworth, Batty & Burchielli revolves around the issues that women face in the firefighting occupation. In this article the problems can be understood, specifically the gap originated due to the gender differences. It discusses that how women deal with heavy helmets and its physical, as well as psychological strain (Ainsworth, Batty & Burchielli, 2014).\n2-In the article of Barker, author identifies the area that requires enhancements in protective fire gears. Article emphasizes on the functioning, comfort and protection provided by the gear (Barker, 2013).\n3-Again a milestone in the research of protective head gears while firefighting. This research is a trial case study that evaluated the structural specifications the made several recommendations to industry for making protective helmets comfortable and light in the accordance with OSHA regulations (Davis, 2001).\n4-A study conducted on Sixty-one male fire workers presented comparative study of traditional versus enhanced protective clothing with lighter helmet. The study offers a detailed analysis of performance of firefighter. This article clarifies many relevant issues of the proposed research (Hur, 2013).\n5-Based on a descriptive research a research proposal by Gray targets the size and shape problem of fire helmets. Statistical analysis based this study will help in the proposed research topic considerably (Gray, 2010).\n6– The article investigates the personal as well as the physiological responses of the firefighters’ helmet from various countries according to the international standardisation. Experimental based this evaluation focuses on the weight and mass of the protective fire clothing and impact on performance after mass reduction. This research will directly boost our research work (Lee et al., 2014).\n7– The article suggests required adjustments in fire helmets to make it more comfortable for the person wearing it. It covers the futuristic specifications like safety, design, shape, material, etc. Author also considers the perceptual and psychological characteristics and analyses the shape and structure of the helmet (Li, Li & Yang, 2011).\n8– Due to technological advances more tools are being mounted on the helmets to improve the efficiency. This study reveals that this head-supported mass results in an altered head and neck\ndynamics. This study targets these alterations and related risks (Manoogian, Kennedy, Wilson, Duma & Alem, 2006).\n9-This study is conducted on Army personals focusing on the neck and head injuries due to heavily centered mass on upper body. This study again relates the risk area of the fire fighting employees facing due to helmet designs and weight (Merkle, Kleinberger & Uy, 2005).\n10– Article authored by Newman describes the physics of motion and how the head injury can turn into brain trauma. From the basics of helmet to the dynamics of impact, it covers the helmet designs, material and future of head protection (Newman, 1993).\n11– Study describes the test conducted to investigate the ventilation of fire helmets through analyzing its designing facts. According to this study, the design and suspension system can not impact the heat stress in fire helmets. This study can be valuable for the research in developing an improved helmet (Reischl, 1986).\n12– This article addresses the issues of personal protective equipment in the line of defense especially in hazards workplaces. It deals with issues faced by high risk occupations such as firefighting and protective gearing involved for females in the front lines (Ontario Women’s Directorate, 2006).\n13– This article gives a good insight of how women are protected against thermal hazards in terms of gear which is particularly designed for them as compared to men. A three dimensional body scanner was used in the research to measure the size and distribution of air gaps between a female mannequin and thermal protective coveralls. It talks about head protection and how it varies from men to women (Song & Mah, 2010).\n14– This article talks about the lack of personal protective clothing and work clothing that is specifically designed for women. It investigates the use of PPE and work clothing among tradeswomen and to examine attributes significantly related to PPE/work clothing satisfaction using the Functional-Expressive-Aesthetic (FEA) consumer needs model. This research indicates it is logical to suggest wearing proper PPE and work clothing creates a more positive work experience for women within the building trades (Wagner, J. Kim & Gordon, 2013).\n15– This article talks about the physiological and subjective responses of the European, Japanese (JPN) and US firefighters’ helmet, gloves and boots for international standardisation (Son & Yutaka, 2010).\n16– This article focused on a comparison of commercial off the shelf helmet and boots that could be used in the ensemble. A requirements correlation matrix was generated and sent to industry detailing objective and threshold measurements for both the helmet and boot. The helmet and boots were measured and weighed to determine differences in shape and mass compared to the baseline used in the current JFIRE. One helmet and boot were recommended for incorporation into the modified JFIRE (Schroeder,2010).\n17-The present study explicates the responses of firefighters wearing aluminized and non-aluminized protective equipments. This study was conducted for Japanese firefighter’s equipments. In this survey based study authors try to find out the material choice of wearers (Son, Lee & Tochihara, 2013).\n18– This article presents a trial based study to evaluate the pressure on workers of both genders due to their heavy layered protective equipments. The results obtained in intense and steady states to observe the flexibility in reducing head gear weights will aid the concept of our research (Taylor, Lewis, Notley & Peoples, 2012).\n19– In a male dominant work area, this analysis brilliantly covers the key concerns of female firefighters. A questionnaire based study reveals that how women firefighters face challenges when it comes to physical differences, especially related to ill fitted uniforms and helmets. The\nfeedback from participants will help to understand the needs of female firefighters (Bendick, Thomas & Moccio, 2007)\n20– This book covers a broad spectrum of database on injuries occurred during firefighting incidents. This collection of data and graphs will help in understanding the reasons, causes, facts and probabilities of accidents that may take place during the fire operations (Karter & Molis, 2011).\n21– In this book author describes the biomechanics of brain injury and how it starts with basic skull injury. This research may relate and explain the basic of head injury due to heavy head gears during a stressful condition of fire fighting (Viano, 2012). .\n22– This published patent by United States proposed a lightweight headgear made up of protective outer shell. This shell comprises of polybenzimidazole and aramid materials with a touch of super fine glass clothing (Lane & Hetzel, 1991).\n23– It is a very descriptive piece of relevant research. It elaborates each topic linked to the effectiveness and safety of fire hoods. An analysis of literature followed by survey-based research and a thorough evaluation makes this report significant (Johnstone, 1996).\n24- This article from website helps to understand the standard for helmet designs, set by NFPA: National Fire protection Association, a government authority to verify all safety regulations for structural and proximity fire fighting. Through this web link the safety standard can be followed in designing improved fire helmets (Nfpa.org).\n25– The following article provides the technical specifications of ‘USTM™ Traditional Series Structural Fire Helmet, manufactured by Bullard, the leading manufacturers of fire helmets. The\narticle describes the designing criteria of helmet under NFPA 1971 Standards (www.bullard.com).\nThe above resources are published and selected after a thorough analysis. These 20 resources will be highly beneficial to the proposed research topic as they cover the research aspects. The resources will be helpful in creating a final report that answers all the three questions that are main basis of the research.\nAinsworth S, Batty A, Burchielli R.

Available from:","frequently asked questions\nMIPS stands for Multi-Directional Impact Protection System.\nThe MIPS system is designed to add protection against the rotational motion (or kinematics) transmitted to the brain from angled impacts to the head. The rotational motion is a combination of rotational energy (angular velocity) and rotational forces from angular acceleration that both affect the brain and increases the risk for minor and severe brain injuries. MIPS’ added protection system has been proven to reduce the rotational motion when implemented in a helmet by absorbing and redirecting energies and forces otherwise transmitted to the brain.\nInitially, the MIPS layer was found between the helmet’s shell and the EPS/foam helmet filling. More recent and common versions have the MIPS layer underneath the EPS, between the helmet and the head. This is the most common low friction layer on the market today.\nIn 1995, the Swedish brain surgeon Hans von Holst from the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm began to explore how helmets in general were constructed based on the belief that the inferior protection helmets offered led to consequences for too many people who had suffered head trauma wearing helmets. Hans von Holst contacted the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) in Stockholm in order to initiate biomechanical research on head and neck injury prevention. As a result, student Peter Halldin initiated his PhD on head and neck injury biomechanics, being the first PhD within this field. Peter Halldin initiated the work from a technical perspective, with assistance from Hans von Holst and his clinical background, with the goal of understanding the complete picture from accident to potential injury.\nDuring the initial years of research, Peter Halldin and Hans von Holst also analyzed the need for a system that reduced the rotational acceleration to the brain. In 1996, Hans von Holst and Peter Halldin came together up with the idea of the MIPS technology, mimicking the brain’s own protection system. The first prototype of a MIPS equipped helmet was tested at the University of Birmingham in 2000, and resulted in the first scientific publication in 2001, showing that MIPS significantly could reduce the rotational acceleration.\nNo, MIPS was started by scientific and medical researchers with a passion for safety and making a product that possibly could make helmets safer.\nThough MIPS has grown very fast over the last couple of years, it started as a team of researchers focused on research and development. The success behind the sudden rise of MIPS is due to the ongoing focus on research, development, and communicating the dangers of rotational motion injuries. We invest in materials that help our partners and their consumers understand the benefits of MIPS so that we tell our story in the best possible way. This, along with a rise in general awareness of the dangers of rotational head trauma, is why we believe MIPS has grown in the last couple of years.\nMIPS is designed to have the ability to be fitted into almost any helmet on the market. Our team of engineers work closely with the brands to produce a low friction layer that has minimal impact on the basic functionality of the helmets such as ventilation, comfort, and fit. Once fitted into the helmet, we at MIPS perform a thorough and demanding test procedure to ensure that the helmet passes the MIPS approval tests. MIPS has implemented low friction layers with proven results in bike, snow, equestrian, motorcycle, motocross, auto, ice hockey, football, and military helmets with demonstrated improvements to head protection.\nRotational motion, in these cases, is the result of an angled impact to the head. A quick, sudden, abrupt stop, will cause the brain to move or stretch. This happens mainly due to the brain’s suspension in the cerebrospinal fluid and because the brain itself has shear properties similar to water.\nIt is known that the human head is more sensitive to rotational motion than linear motion.\nFrom an engineering perspective, rotational motion is a combination of rotational energy (angular velocity) and rotational forces (angular acceleration) that both affect the brain and increase the risk for minor and severe brain injuries. The reason that the brain is more sensitive to rotational motion is that the brain is very much like water or a gel when it comes to its shear properties. The brain, like water, is also incompressible. Therefore, a linear motion will not affect the brain as much as a rotational motion.\nSeveral researchers have linked severe brain injuries like Diffuse Axonal Injury (DAI) and Subdural Hematoma (SDH) to rotational motion transmitted to the brain from angled impacts.\nMild Traumatic Brain Injury (MTBI) or concussion is also believed to be caused by rotational motion.\nThe MIPS low-friction layer is designed to add minimal volume and weight. Each model of helmet gets a layer that’s custom designed and engineered to fit the ventilation, shape, and other features of the helmet style.\nThose helmets that are retrofitted with MIPS might see a reduction in helmet size by one size. New models will not be affected in this way.\nThe MIPS’ low friction layer weights from 25 to 45 grams, depending on the helmet model.\nYes, MIPS works independent of impact direction. It is a Multi-Directional Impact Protection System.\nThe force between the head and the helmet is very high at the event of an impact. To get a relative motion between the helmet and the head, a low coefficient of friction is needed. The scalp may help to reduce the rotational motion to the brain in a small way, but not to a substantive degree.\nThe current standard adequately addresses skull protection. But the protection against a brain injury is not measured in current official test standards.\nNo, all the tests done with MIPS-equipped helmets and non-MIPS-equipped helmets show that they perform the same under vertical impacts. In some cases, the helmet with MIPS may show slightly better results due to having more material between the skull and the impact surface.\nThe MIPS´ low friction layer moves about 10-15 mm in any direction. You can feel the movement by placing your hand inside the helmet and rotating the MIPS layer.\nMIPS has been proven to reduce the rotational motion from angled impacts when implemented in a helmet by absorbing and redirecting energies and forces otherwise transmitted to the brain. By a small movement in the low friction layer relative to the helmet (10 – 15 mm) at the brief moment of an angled impact ([5 – 10] milliseconds), MIPS lets the head continue in the direction to which it was originally heading without transferring the rotational energies to the brain. The absorption is due to friction heat and also that MIPS will spread the load to a larger area of the helmet liner.\nA helmet is approved by testing the helmet at between 6.0-7.5m/s at a 45 degree impact angle against grinding paper. Three different impact sites are tested. The same helmet model is compared with and without the MIPS system.\nThe impact speed chosen for bike, snow, and equestrian helmets are 6.2m/s and 7.5m/s for motorcycle helmets. Impact angle is always 45 degrees. The speeds for bike helmets were chosen based on real accident reconstruction studies (Verschueren et al 2009).\nWe use a Hybrid III dummy head made out of aluminium covered with a rubber skin. This type of dummy head is the same as used in testing within the automotive industry.\nThe Swedish insurance company Folksam has performed its own third party tests of snow, bike, and equestrian helmets and the results have supported MIPS’ safety claims.\nConsumer Reports in US and SP, the Technical Research Institute of Sweden, joined forces with Test Fakta, an independent editorial entity that tests all kind of consumer products, to perform a third party test. MIPS equipped helmets performed in the top here as well."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:c7a8cb18-f9f6-427a-994e-47f8498b6cf2>","<urn:uuid:0d4ede9c-d7f2-4bcc-a430-322b850138e6>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the different phases of clinical trials, and what potential risks do participants face when taking part in them?","answer":"Clinical trials have four main phases plus pilot studies. Phase I trials test new treatments in 20-80 people to evaluate safety and identify side effects. Phase II trials test treatments in 100-300 people to assess effectiveness and further evaluate safety. Phase III trials involve 1,000-3,000 people to confirm effectiveness, monitor side effects, and compare to existing treatments. Phase IV trials are post-marketing studies for additional information about risks and benefits. Regarding risks, participants may face both short-term and long-term effects. Common short-term side effects include feelings of sickness, headaches, drowsiness, and possible blood pressure changes. Some risks may occur immediately during the trial, while others might not appear until years later. All risks should be detailed in the Informed Consent form and explained by researchers. If risks change during the study, participants must be notified.","context":["What are Clinical Trials?\nResearch on humans is known by many names: research study, clinical trial, experimental treatment, etc.\nClinical Trials Are Research, Not Proven Treatment\nParticipating in clinical trials is primarily meant to benefit future patients, not necessarily participants in the trial. Typically researchers hope that participants will benefit from a trial, and there may be information from other clinical trials to suggest that a benefit is possible or likely. However, it is not known if you will benefit by participating in a clinical trial – that is why they are doing the research (for example, the Women’s Health Initiative study of Estrogen Plus Progestin in Postmenopausal Women noted an increased risk of stroke).\nParticipating in a Clinical Trial Is Voluntary\nYou may choose not to participate in a trial or to discontinue your participation in a trial at any time without it affecting your relationship with the researcher, other medical staff, Shands hospital, and/or the University of Florida.\nFor more information about the rights of people who participate in clinical trials, please contact the University of Florida Health Science Center Institutional Review Board at (352) 273-9600.\nInformation about Clinical Trials\n- What is a clinical trial?\n- According to the government’s web site, ClinicalTrials.gov, a clinical trial is defined as “A research study to answer specific questions about vaccines, new therapies or new ways of using known treatments. Clinical trials (also called medical research and research studies) are used to determine whether new drugs or treatments are both safe and effective. Carefully conducted clinical trials are the fastest and safest way to find treatments that work in people.”1Back to top\n- Are clinical trials proven treatment?\n- No, clinical trials are not proven treatment. Clinical trials are research and the purpose of all clinical trials is to learn more about what is being studied in the trial.Back to top\n- Why participate in a clinical trial?\n- According to the government’s web site, ClinicalTrials.gov, “participants in clinical trials can play a more active role in their health care, gain access to new research treatments before they are widely available, and help others by contributing to medical research.”1Back to top\n- What is a protocol?\n- A protocol is the study plan which the clinical trial is based. The plan is designed to protect the participants and to answer specific research questions. The protocol details who may participate in the trial, what will be done to participants, how long the study will be conducted, and everything that is required for the study.Back to top\n- What are the different types of clinical trials?\n- Five of the typical types of clinical trials are listed below. Some trials may be more than one type of trial. For example, a treatment trial may also have screening tests in it.\n- Treatment trials\n- These trials test new treatments, new combinations of drugs, or new approaches to surgery or radiation therapy.\n- Prevention trials\n- These trials look for better ways to prevent disease in people who have never had the disease or to prevent the disease from returning. Approaches may include medicines, vitamins, vaccines, minerals, or lifestyle changes (exercise, diet, etc).\n- Screening trials\n- These trials try to find a better way to detect certain disease or health conditions.\n- Quality of life trials\n- These trials explore ways to improve comfort and quality of life for individuals with chronic illness.\n- Nontherapeutic trials\n- These trials hope to answer specific research questions without using any type of treatment on participants. This may be accomplished by reviewing medical records, doing certain types of medical tests (such as a blood draw), and/or asking participants questions in a survey.\n- What are the phases of clinical trials?\n- There are four phases of clinical trials, along with pilot studies. The trials at each phase have a different purpose and help scientists answer different questions.\n- Phase I trials\n- test a new drug or treatment in a small group of people (20-80) for the first time in order to evaluate the treatment’s safety, how much can be given safely, and to identify possible side effects from the treatment.\n- Phase II trials\n- typically test the treatment in a larger group of people (100-300) in order to see if the treatment is effective and to further evaluate the safety of the treatment.\n- Phase III trials\n- typically test the treatment in a large group of people (1,000 to 3,000) to confirm that the treatment is effective, monitor side effects, compare the treatment to other commonly used treatments, and collect additional information which should help allow safe use of the treatment. Patients are usually randomized between different treatments.\n- Phase IV trials\n- are usually post marketing studies that establish additional information about the treatment’s risks, benefits, and best use of the treatment.\n- Pilot studies\n- are usually Phase II studies but use a much smaller group of people (10-30) in order to determine if the study should be conducted on a much larger scale (enroll more subjects).\n- What is a control or control group?\n- A control and/or control group are patients that typically do not receive the experimental drug or treatment. Instead, in many clinical trials, one group of patients receives the experimental drug(s) or experimental treatment(s) while the control group receives either the treatment currently used for for the illness or receives nothing at all. The information obtained from a control or control group is what is used to compare what happens to the people who receive the experimental drug or experimental treatment.Back to top\n- What is a placebo?\n- A placebo can be any form of a medication or a device which may look like the experimental drug or device that is being studied, except the placebo provides no treatment value and should not affect you in any way. Therefore, subjects assigned to receive placebo will not be exposed to any of the risks of the experimental treatment and will not receive any of the benefits of the experimental treatment.Back to top\n- What is randomization?\n- Randomization is the process where more than one type of treatment is available and the researcher wants to compare how people do receiving one treatment to the other. The treatment a study subject receives is determined by chance. Randomization is similar to flipping a coin or rolling dice. Neither you (the study participant) nor the researcher may select which group you are assigned to.Back to top\nProtecting Clinical Trial Participants\nThe government, the Institutional Review Board (IRB), and the Informed Consent process\n- Is the government involved in all clinical trials?\n- No, the government is not involved in all clinical trials. However, according to our agreement with the government (called an Assurance), all clinical trials conducted at University of Florida / Shands will comply with federal regulations. These regulations include the Office of Human Research Protections (OHRP) Code of Federal Regulations 45 CFR 46 (also known as the “Common Rule”), the FDA’s rules and regulations applying to the use of investigational drugs or devices; and the FDA’s Good Clinical Practice guidelines.Back to top\n- How is the government involved in clinical trials at UF, Shands, or North Florida/South Georgia Veteran’s Health System (NFSGVHS)?\n- UF, Shands, North Florida/South Georgia Veteran’s Health System (NFSGVHS) each have an agreement with the government called an Assurance. These Assurances detail that clinical trials conducted by our faculty and staff, at our facilities, or with our patients will comply with appropriate federal regulations as stipulated in 45 CFR 46. FDA regulations (21 CFR) are applicable any time an investigational drug, device, or biologic are being tested.Back to top\n- How do UF, Shands, and the NFSGVHS protect research subjects?\n- All clinical trials conducted at UF, Shands, and the NFSGVHS must be reviewed and approved by an Institutional Review Board (IRB). Institutional Review Boards are required by the government in order to review research to insure the protection of research participants.Back to top\n- What is the Institutional Review Board (IRB) and how does it protect research participants?\n- IRB stands for Institutional Review Board and consists of a committee of physicians, statisticians, researchers, community advocates, and others. The United States government requires all research involving human subjects to be reviewed and approved by an IRB (1) prior to any subject participation and (2) periodically thereafter in order to protect the rights of human participants.Back to top\n- What is Informed Consent and how does it work?\n- Informed Consent is the process of (1) educating people about the key facts of a clinical trial and (2) allowing people to voluntarily decide whether or not to participate in the trial. There are typically three steps taken in order to inform potential participants about the study prior to taking part:\n- Someone who is involved in and familiar with the trial explains the details of the study.\n- Potential participants are provided with two copies of the IRB approved Informed Consent form. The potential participant should keep one of these forms for their records. The other form would be signed and returned to the investigator if the subject choose to take part in the trial.\n- Potential participants should have an opportunity to ask questions about (a) the trial, (b) their condition/illness, and (c) alternatives to participating in the trial.\nInformed Consent does not end once someone agrees to participate in a trial. According to federal regulations Informed Consent is an ongoing process which continues throughout the trial in order to insure that participants remain fully informed about the trial. For example, participants should be informed about any new information discovered during the trial, whether it is about the trial itself, the condition/illness being studied, or possible new alternatives to the trial.\nThe Informed Consent document is reviewed and approved by the IRB and describes the rights of study participants, details about the study (such as the study’s purpose, duration, required procedures, risks, benefits, alternatives, and key contacts). You are not required to sign the Informed Consent document unless you want to participate in the trial. The Informed Consent document is not a contract – participants may choose to withdraw from the trial at any time after agreeing to participate.\nParticipating in a Clinical Trial\nWhat You Should Ask and Know About a Particular Trial before Participating\n- What trial specific information should you know?\n- You should be provided with the following information\n- What is the official title for the trial.\n- What phase trial is it?

Back to top\n- What is the significance of “risks vs. benefits”?\n- Participating in a clinical trial may expose people to known and/or unknown risks. Risks can consist of physical side effects from the study such as headache, nausea, hair loss, skin irritation, or a wide variety of other physical problems. Other types of risks could be financial or psychological. Some risks may occur immediately while participating in the trial while other risks may not occur until much later, sometimes years after participating in the trial. The risks should be detailed in the Informed Consent form and should be described to you by a knowledgeable researcher affiliated with the trial. If you choose to participate in a trial you should be notified of any changes in the risks associated with the study.The primary benefit of participating in a trial is that the knowledge obtained from the study may help other people in the future. Previous studies or other information may indicate that study subjects might benefit directly by participating in a research trial, but this can never be guaranteed.Thus, when participating in a clinical trial participants should compare the risks of participating to the benefits. Participants may decide that the potential benefits are not worth the risks.Back to top\n- What should you know about Conflict of Interest?\n- Sometimes people or institutions might benefit if the results of a clinical trial are positive. For example, a physician or the university might make money if they own the patents for a drug or device studied in the trial and the trial shows that the experimental treatment is effective. The University of Florida and the IRB try to ensure that any conflicts are not too large as to effect how well a clinical trial is conducted. The Informed Consent form potential subjects receive contains information about any conflicts in order to help potential subjects decide if they want to participate in the clinical trial.Back to top\n- Are there alternatives to the Clinical Trial?\n- First and foremost, no one is ever required to participate in a clinical trial. Participation in a clinical trial is voluntary, and potential subjects may always decide not to participate without it affecting their relationship with the researcher, other medical staff, the hospital, and/or the university. Most times there are alternative treatments that people can receive rather than participating in the clinical trial. Sometimes you can receive the same therapy without enrolling in the clinical trial. Other times the only way to receive a certain drug or device is by deciding to participate in the clinical trial.Back to top","|Home > Participating in trials > Volunteer FAQ's|\nFrequently asked questions\nWhat kind of medication will I have to take? Clinical trials units help the world’s leading pharmaceutical companies develop existing and potential new medicines. Each study is different and volunteers may be asked to trial an existing medication that requires further testing or they may be asked to trial a new medication that has not been tested in humans before. If you decide to put yourself forward for a clinical trial you will be given a patient information sheet (typically at the screening visit, although this can be requested before you attend a screening visit) that will give you detailed information on the medication being tested. This information will include what the intended use of the medication, the trials that have already taken place, (if any) and the known potential side effects.\nWill I be told everything that is involved in the study? Yes you will initially eb provided with a patient information sheet (typically at the screening visit, although this can be requested before you attend a screening visit) that will give you detailed information on the medication being tested. This information will include what the intended use of the medication, the trials that have already taken place, (if any) and the known potential side effects. If you are happy to move forward you will then be given an opportunity to speak to a doctor working on the study. In this meeting the doctor will explain the study in detail and you will have an opportunity to ask any questions you may have. Remember if you are not satisfied with the information you are provided at the meeting with the doctor, you do not have to progress this enquiry any further.\nCan I drink alcohol? Usually not for 24 to 48 hours before each session of a study, and whilst on a study. You may be allowed alcohol between sessions, but this will be outlined in the protocol and discussed at the pre-study information session.\nWhat happens at a pre-study medical? You meet a doctor first who will answer any questions you may have. You should then be asked to sign a consent form to give your permission to undergo the screening procedures to determine if you would be suitable to take part in the study. If you decide to consent to the screening procedures, the doctor will then ask you about your medical history and give you a thorough medical examination. You will then have certain procedures performed, usually urine and blood samples, blood pressure, height and weight and ECG (Electrocardiogram – a heart activity tracing). Each study is different, so there may be additional tests to the above, which may require additional visits and procedures at the information session.\nWhy do we have to eat at set times? In studies where you are asked to stay in a clinical trials unit each person on the same study must eat at the same time so that consistent results regarding absorption of the drug from your “stomach” are obtained. The timepoints are set by the pharmaceutical company sponsor and must be adhered to. In some studies you are not required to be resident in the clinical trials unit for the duration of the clinical trial and therefore it is harder to control what volunteers eat and when. However if you take part in a study that does not require you to be resident in the clinical trials unit for the duration of the clinical trial there will eb certain foods and drinks you will be asked to avoid until you have completed the clinical trial. These include eating foods containing poppy seeds and drinks containing caffeine.\nWill the insertion of the small plastic tube (cannula) into my vein through which you draw blood hurt? The insertion of the cannula should not hurt. A cannula can be left in the vein for 24-48hrs and is used to avoid having to continuously puncture veins to get blood samples on days where multiple blood samples are required, (PK days). On days where only a few samples are required, and no cannula has been inserted into the vein, a member of the clinical team will insert a needle attached to a blood collection tube only for the duration of the blood collection.\nWhat short or long-term side effects might there be? Each medication is different and will have different side effects affecting different people. The common short-term side-effects are short term feelings of sickness, headaches, drowsiness and possibly a slight change in blood-pressure (feeling faint). Any expected side-effects will be explained at the pre-study information session with the research physician. Usually, any side-effects are short-lived and will have disappeared prior to your post-study medical examination. If you are suffering from a longer lasting side effect, the clinical trials unit you did the trial with will monitor your situation until the side effect has resolved or they will refer you to specialist if this is needed.\nHas anyone died or become seriously unwell due to their participation in a study? Over twenty years ago there were two fatalities. In both instances the fatalities were a consequence of the volunteers withholding information of drug/medicine use from the study doctor. More recently in 2006 some volunteers became ill at a clinical trial taking place at a clinical trials unit within Northwick Park. None of the volunteers affected died, however some were very ill. Since this case, the regulation regarding the conduct of clinical trials and those units that can perform clinical trials has become much stricter. Clinical trial’s units are regularly assessed by the Medicines and products Healthcare Regulatory Agency, (MHRA) to ensure they meet the requirements to perform clinical trials. Ensure you ask if the trials unit you are approaching to do a clinical trial with has been accredited by the MHRA. Also be honest about your medical history and recreational / prescribed drug use.\nAre all studies reviewed by an Ethics Committee and who are they? All clinical study protocols are reviewed by an Ethics Committee and the Committee should be entirely independent from the clinical trials unit conducting the trial for whom you are doing the study. Typically the advertising of a trial and the patient information sheet will state that the trial has been approved an independent ethics committee, however if this is not clear you should ask the doctor when you meet with them to discuss the study initially. The Committee is responsible for ensuring that the information provided to you is fair, balanced and accurate and that your rights as a volunteer are maintained. The Committee should consist of technical people (including doctors and pharmacists) and non-technical people such as lawyers and teachers. The mixture of technical and non-technical people means that both scientific and medical information is thoroughly reviewed and that the information is put in clear, non-technical terms for potential volunteers. The Ethics Committee also reviews all volunteer advertising material.\nWill taking part in the study have any effect on an application for health or life insurance? There is no evidence that anyone has been refused cover because of participation in a clinical trial. Different insurance companies have different rules and should you have concerns you should discuss this with your insurer.\nWhen can I do my next study? Usually 3 months after the post-study medical, although this can be more or less depending on the rules of the next study you wish to take part in.\nDo CROs have a financial interest/share in the companies (sponsors) developing medications? In most cases the clinical trials units will have no financial interest in sponsors, other than the fees charged for conducting the study, and these are dependent on the scientific outcome. In some situations the trials unit will be owned by the pharmaceutical sponsor, however they will still act impartially.\nWill I be paid for taking part in a clinical trial? The answer is yes. You will be paid for the time you give up for a clinical trial and this payment is only for time and NOT linked to risk or inconvenience. You will be paid for the time you spend with the clinical trials unit and payment is proportional to the time you spend on a study. For example, you will be paid a lot more if you take part in a 2-week study with lots of extra visits than if you take part in a single overnight study. You should not view participation in clinical trials as equivalent to employment and under no circumstances should you participate in more than one clinical trial at a time.\nWhat is a placebo? A placebo is an inactive, fake, or \"dummy\"\nmedication or treatment designed to resemble a drug or treatment and\ngiven in the same way. Any improvement in health that is measured,\nobserved, or felt after the placebo is given is called the \"placebo\neffect\". In clinical trials, a placebo may be given to one group of\nparticipants instead of the active drug or treatment in order to\nassess whether the latter is actually effective"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:65922c59-334c-41ad-bfde-ced8228811e2>","<urn:uuid:33c7d331-5550-40e6-b946-533ac3c68916>"],"error":null}

Ideally these should be easily accessible, at all times, to anyone visiting and using your website.\nTerms of trade are the basis on which suppliers and customers agree to do business. They set out each party’s expectations, rights and obligations regarding the supply of goods or services.\nFor suppliers, they are a risk management tool. They allow suppliers to limit exposure to liability. For customers, they provide clarity and certainty around the trading process.\nImportant note: Terms of trade contain the ‘general’ or ‘standard’ terms and conditions of an agreement between supplier and customer. The ‘specific’ terms and conditions of an agreement – for example, the parties’ names, description of specific goods or services supplied and price payable – will usually be contained in a separate document, such as an invoice, a purchase order or application form.\nTo watch our video on this topic, click here.\nThis article sets out some of the key things you should think about when putting together your online terms of trade:\nIdeally, terms of trade should include, as a bare minimum:\no Ordering: how does the customer go about ordering the goods or services, if not through the website?\no Price: when and how must payment be made? Is there a discount for early payment? Is there a penalty for late payment?\no Liability: is the parties’ liability under the contract limited and, if yes, how is it limited?\no Disputes: how are disputes resolved?\no Termination: who can terminate and on what basis?\no Website: Are there any conditions in using the website, even if you don’t place an order? It’s also worth thinking about whether the customer can purchase through an ‘app’ or social media, in which case the term ‘online system’ or similar should be used instead of the term ‘website’.\nSUPPLIERS OF GOODS – ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS:\nSuppliers of goods have additional considerations to think about, including:\no Delivery: how, where and when are the goods to be delivered and who is responsible for delivery costs?\no Risk / Title: when does risk in, and title to, the goods pass to the customer? This will have implications for the parties’ insurance arrangements.\no Security: what kind of security (if any) is the supplier taking to secure payment for the goods? A supplier will likely want to take a ‘security interest’ over goods supplied and the proceeds of their sale (and, in some cases, over the customer’s personal property). The supplier should register a financing statement(s) on the Personal Property Securities Register to ‘perfect’ that ‘security interest’.\no Returns / Refunds: what are the business’s policies regarding returns or refunds for damaged or incorrect goods?\nNOTICE AND ACCEPTANCE:\nTo be enforceable, your customer must be aware of your terms of trade and the customer must also agree to or ‘accept’ them. These concepts are discussed in-depth in a separate ProAct article covering the basics of contract law, something that’s often overlooked but essential that every business understands.\n• Force majeure / COVID-19: Suppliers should consider whether their terms should specifically excuse performance because of unforeseen events (e.g. strikes, natural disasters etc) or because of foreseeable events (e.g. COVID-19 or a similar type of outbreak arising), and how liability is apportioned in those circumstances.\n• Consumer protection and privacy laws: Some legislation, like the Fair Trading Act, needs to be followed whether supplying to business or individuals. If supplying to individuals (as opposed to businesses), suppliers should also be particularly mindful of their obligations under the Consumer Guarantees Act and the Privacy Act (among many other laws!). These laws are discussed in-depth in a separate ProAct article, but to summarise:\no Fair Trading Act: the Fair Trading Act protects purchasers against being ‘misled’ or being ‘treated unfairly’ – it prohibits businesses from misleading or deceptive conduct, making false representations, using unfair contract terms and employing unfair practices. This Act covers claims about products and services before they are purchased.\no Consumer Guarantees Act: the Consumer Guarantees Act implies a series of statutory guarantees for goods or services ordinarily purchased for personal, domestic or household use – among other things, they include guarantees of acceptable quality, fitness for purpose, reasonableness of price etc. This Act covers claims about products and services after they are purchased.\no Privacy Act: if a business collects ‘personal information’ (i.e. information about an identifiable, living person) in the course of its business, it must abide by the requirements under the Privacy Act in relation to the collection, use, disclosure, storage and access to such information.\nThis is a just a snapshot of some of the general issues associated with online terms of trade.\nIf you need help or guidance with your terms of trade, please contact us.\nThe above overview has been provided for general information purposes only.

{"question":"As a medical researcher, I'm studying diagnostic methods. What are the specifics of both the standard and modified two-tiered testing approaches for Lyme disease, and how do they utilize ELISA technology? 🧪","answer":"The standard two-tiered (STT) approach begins with an initial enzyme immunoassay (EIA/ELISA) to measure antibody response to Borrelia antigens, followed by a Western blot if positive/equivocal. The modified two-tiered (MTT) approach replaces the Western blot with a second immunoassay. The ELISA component works by detecting specific antibody-antigen interactions, utilizing the lock-and-key specificity principle. The MTT shows improved sensitivity for early Lyme disease (~50%) compared to STT (~40%), while both approaches maintain high sensitivity for later stages (>89%) and similar specificity (~99%) for all stages.","context":["The enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is a gold standard method for protein and antibody detection. It is routinely used for clinical lab work and is often used in research and development. The assay is based on the lock-and-key specificity between an antibody-antigen pair. Antibodies are naturally made by the adaptive immune system to recognize a specific piece of an antigenic protein. This is what allows the body to identify and fight invading pathogens so effectively. Since antibodies have such a fundamental role in most biosensing and diagnostic systems it is very easy to purchase them or have them custom-made to recognize a protein of interest. The ELISA assay is performed in 96- or 384-well plates that are treated to favorably adsorb antigen or antibody depending on the type of ELISA being performed. The ELISA assay is built up from the bottom of each well; it doesn’t float freely in the well. As a result, the unbound proteins are easily washed away and only the target remains to be quantified.\nThe four types of ELISA\nThe competitive ELISA is one of four methods. Each method is used for a different purpose. Some are good at detecting antigen while others are used to detect antibody. All of them require the use of a fluorescent, chemiluminescent, or colorimetric tag. These tags are called reporters; they are used to quantify the assay.\n- Direct ELISA: The antigen is immobilized on the surface of the plate and is detected by an antibody conjugated to a reporter. A higher signal equals more target.\n- Indirect ELISA: The antigen is immobilized on the surface of the plate and two antibodies are used for detection. The primary antibody binds to the antigen and the secondary antibody binds to the primary antibody. The secondary antibody is conjugated to a reporter, and it cannot recognize the antigen. Therefore, without any primary antibody the secondary will be washed away and there will be no signal to quantify. Therefore, the indirect ELISA is used to detect primary antibodies in a sample. A higher signal equals more target.\n- Sandwich ELISA: An antibody is immobilized on the surface of the plate. The antigen is added and it binds to the antiboy Then, another antibody, which recognizes a different epitope of the antigen, is added to the well and it also binds to the antigen. Finally, a third antibody with a reporter is added to recognize the second antibody. This method is used to detect antigen in a sample. A higher signal equals more target.\n- Competitive ELISA: A reference antigen is immobilized on the surface of the plate. The sample antigen is pre-incubated with labeled reporter antibody and added to the wells. Any free antibodies unbound with antigen during the pre-incubation step will be able to bind to the reference antigen. All other labeled antibodies will be unable to bind to the immobilized antigen and will be washed away. This method is used to detect antigen in a sample. A higher signal equals less target.","Lyme disease, or Lyme borreliosis, is an increasingly prevalent illness caused by several bacteria in the Borrelia genus. Lyme disease is an increasingly common bacterial illness that exists throughout the world. Current diagnostic methods for Lyme disease are ineffective at detecting the illness during its early stages - when it is easiest to treat; thus, the improvement of Lyme diagnostics is a popular area of research in many scientific fields.\nWhile several species can cause Lyme disease, Borrelia burgdorferi is the predominant pathogenic species in North America; B. garinii and B. afzelii are responsible for most infections in Europe and Asia. The transmission of Borrelia is facilitated by ticks within the Ixodes genus, which serve as the primary vector and reservoir host for the bacterium. Borrelia is transferred to a mammalian host when an infected tick attaches to and feeds on the blood of the host. During blood-feeding, Borrelia, located in the salivary glands of the tick, enter the mammalian host via the tick’s saliva, transmitting the Lyme bacteria and causing the disease. By exploiting the natural feeding relationship of ticks on mammals, Borrelia is easily transmitted to deer, livestock, and humans.\nSince Burgdorfer’s seminal paper realizing Borrelia as the causative agent of Lyme disease, the wide range and inconspicuous nature of the disease have become clear. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there are approximately 30,000 reported cases of Lyme disease in the United States each year; however, more recent estimates place this number as high as 300,000, owing to frequent misdiagnosis and under-reporting. Not only is Lyme disease the most common vector-borne illness in the US, but recent studies suggest that it is on the rise in other locations as well. With climate change leading to the northern expansion of temperate conditions, reservoir and vector hosts of Lyme disease stray further and further from their original habitats. Because of this, B. burgdorferi is expected to expand its territory northward by 250–500 km in the next 30 years. Increases in Lyme disease incidence are already occurring in many parts of Canada and are expected to continue into the next decades. As well, Lyme disease continues to rise steadily throughout Europe (e.g., Germany, Sweden, Austria) and is beginning to take hold in Asia, particularly in regions of China.\nThe earliest manifestation of Lyme disease is the appearance of a typically bullseye-shaped rash, known as an erythema migrans, at the site of infection. While this rash is generally sufficient for Lyme diagnosis, it only occurs in 70–80% of cases, making it unreliable as a main indicator. Other than the erythema migrans, the most common symptoms are headaches and arthralgia, but these are far too general to indicate Lyme disease. As the disease progresses, Borrelia disseminate from the site of tick attachment and travel throughout the body, causing early disseminated symptoms that can include multiple erythema migrans, carditis, and meningitis. If left untreated for a prolonged period, Lyme disease may progress to a more severe late stage that can include encephalitis and arthritis, among other serious symptoms. While Lyme disease is easily treated with antibiotics if caught early, delayed diagnosis and/or treatment can prove more difficult to treat and lead to more serious health effects.\n2. Current Methods of Diagnosis\nIn cases where an erythema migrans is not present or proves inconclusive, a global consensus of guidelines recommends the use of a standard two-tiered (STT) serology approach for the diagnosis of Lyme disease. This approach involves an initial enzyme immunoassay (EIA) or immunofluorescence assay (IFA) to measure antibody response to Borrelia antigens — often in the form of a whole-cell Borrelia sonicate. If this EIA/IFA returns a positive or equivocal result, then a follow-up Western blot is used to verify the presence of antibodies for a panel of specific Borrelia proteins. A meta-analysis of thirteen two-tiered serology studies across North America estimated the sensitivity of the approach at 46.3% for those with early-stage Lyme disease (symptoms for less than 30 days), 89.7% for those with early disseminated Lyme disease (30+ days), and 99.4% for those with late-stage Lyme disease. Specificity estimates for the two-tiered methodology were approximately 99% for all disease stages.\nRecently, a modified two-tiered (MTT) approach, in which the western blot of the STT is replaced with a second immunoassay, was approved for use in the United States. Compared to the STT, the MTT demonstrates increased sensitivity for early Lyme disease, similar or slightly higher sensitivity for later stages of the disease, and similar specificity for all stages. A comparison of the STT and MTT approaches on several collections of sera from patients with erythema migrans and early Lyme disease estimated the sensitivity of the MTT test to be approximately 50%, while the sensitivity of the STT test on the same samples was approximately 40%.\nWhile the sensitivity of the current two-tiered serology approaches is very high for disseminated Lyme disease, it remains quite difficult to detect the disease in its early stages. The development of anti-Borrelia antibodies can take upwards of three weeks to reach sufficient detection levels in the blood. Since the current standard relies on these antibodies, it is evident that a more direct method of detection is necessary to diagnose Lyme disease prior to its dissemination. The necessity of improved diagnostics is underscored by the recent and expected increases in Lyme disease, the potential for serious health difficulties, and the current diagnosis difficulties (e.g., misdiagnosis, false positives).\nThe entry is from 10.3390/bios10100137\n- W Burgdorfer; A G Barbour; S F Hayes; J L Benach; E Grunwaldt; J P Davis; Lyme disease-a tick-borne spirochetosis?.

{"question":"Could you explain the exact margin requirements for patent drawings in both the EPO and USPTO systems? I need to ensure full compliance for my technical illustrations. ¡Necesito saberlo con precisión!","answer":"The EPO and USPTO have different margin requirements. For EPO, the margins must be: top margin of 2.5 cm, left side margin of 2.5 cm, right side margin of 1.5 cm, and bottom margin of 1.0 cm. For USPTO, the margins must be at least 1 inch on the top and left sides, 3/8 inch on the right side, and 5/8 inch on the bottom. Additionally, USPTO requires scan target points (cross-hairs) on two catercorner margin corners.","context":["EPO Patent Drawing Rules\nAll patent offices have their patent drawing rules that should be followed stringently while filing the patent applications. We will discuss the EPO Patent Drawing Rules requirements of the European Patent Office.\nEPO (European patent Office) has set patent drawing rules for drawings, photographs, diagrams, and flowsheets that you must follow while generating drawings for the patent application. If you do not follow the patent drawing rules, you might get the unnecessary objections from the examiner. These unnecessary objections will increase grant time for your patent. A great patent drawing is one that doesn’t raise any examiner query. And for a set of great patent drawings, you need an expert patent illustrator.\nAlso Read: Germany Patent Drawings Rule\nEPO Patent Drawing rules: Important Points\nYou must follow EPO Patent Drawing Rules for cutting down office actions, saving costs, time, and efforts. Following patent drawings rules are the source for first-hand rejection of the patent drawings and thus your patent application:\nColor Drawing Rules of European Patent Office\nBlack and White Patent Drawings:\nAs per the EPO patent drawing rules, the EPO requires black and white drawings. You can use black printing ink such as India ink when you are printing the drawings on paper. You need to make sure that when the drawings are made using any software, the drawings are generated using only black color. It is to be noted that the other colors when printed in black and white can give different shades of grey color.\nBlack and White Photographs:\nPhotographs are possible as per the EPO Patent Drawing Rules solely when they are the only available medium for illustration of the invention. The examples of photograph eligible patent illustrations could be chemical structures, cell structures, or beauty products, etc.\nIt is to be noted that the photographs should be of high quality so that they can print every detail when they are printed in black and white format.\nA Color photograph is acceptable only when you satisfy the conditions for the acceptance of black and white photographs.

Further, try to keep one view on a sheet. However, you are permitted to include more views on a sheet. We do not recommend more than 2 views on a sheet for better clarity. In addition, try to avoid wasting sheets, keep the position, and maintain a proper gap between the views.\nNOTE: Do not use similar sheets for views and claims.\nSome other important views are included below. These views become important when you need to give more specific details about your invention.\nExploded views show the working, order, or relationship of an assembly of different parts. You must place an exploded view within the brackets. Read Patent Drawing Exploded Views for more information on exploded views.\nA sectional view is used to show a hidden area or part of an object by cutting/removing some of the parts of that object. The cutting line is termed as cutting plane. Read Patent Drawing Sectional Views for more details.\nUse of Scale in Patent Drawings\nYou must create a drawing with a scale that shows the mechanism of the invention without crowding. Further, you cannot use indications like actual size or scale 1/2 on the drawings.\nDrawing Surface Shading requirements:\nDrawing Surface Shading indicates the surface conditions or shape of any object. Spaced lines are preferred for shading. They must be thin, few in number and must contrast with the rest of the drawing. Further, you can also use stippling shading, however, that shading is generally recommended for design patent drawings.\nIn addition, you must assume the Light coming from the upper left corner at an angle of 45° for shading. Pitch black shading is prohibited. However, you may represent bar graphs with them.\nConsider Reading: Patent Drawing Symbols for Draftsmen, the topic includes symbols for surface shading.\n- Use the English alphabet for references. However, to depict wavelengths, angles, and formulas, etc. you may use other kinds of alphabets.\n- Keep legible reference characters such as sheet or view numbers. You should avoid using brackets or inverted commas.\n- Keep the size of Numbers and letters to a minimum of 0.32 cm in height. You must place them at a clear surface and avoid placing them over figures and shades.\n- Orient the references in the direction of the drawing view.\nYou can consider using Graphical drawing symbols for conventional elements. You must use symbols to illustrate devices that bear a conventional meaning around the world and acceptance in the art. The capital letter of the symbol must have a height of 0.21 cm.\nUse of Arrows in Drawings\nYou are allowed to use the arrows at the end of the lines. These arrows are used to indicate the following:\n- At the tip of the lead line to indicate the entire section in the direction of the arrow.\n- Indicating the direction of movement.\nLeadline connects the reference characters and referred details. You must keep the leadlines as small as possible. Lead lines can be straight or curved. It is important to note that the leadlines must not overlap with each other.\nCopyright/Mask Work Notice:\nIf you wish to place a copyright/mask work notice, use it just below the relevant figure. You should keep the size of the letters from 0.32 to 0.64 cm.

Other Considerations\n8. On Your Own vs. Trained Professionals\n9. Common Mistakes\n10. Steps to File a Patent With Correct Patent Drawings\nWhat Are Patent Drawing Rules?\nPatent drawing rules are the requirements set by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for drawings, pictures, flowsheets, and diagrams that go with a patent application. Most patent applications contain drawings. In fact, for a nonprovisional patent, a drawing must be provided to explain better and outline the subject matter associated with the patent request. To increase the likelihood of having a patent request accepted, it's important to follow the patent drawing rules outlined by the USPTO.\nWhen you want to submit a patent to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, it's not as easy as filling out a patent application, paying a fee, and waiting for a response. Though provisional patents don't need drawings, a nonprovisional patent needs at least one drawing to show how the invention works.\nWhen creating your drawings, stay within the rules described in the Manual of Patent Examining Procedures, such as:\n- Draw in black and white unless color is the only way to show a part of the invention.\n- Use India ink on all drawings.\n- Make sure drawing is to scale when the illustration is reduced to two-thirds the size.\n- Include identification above each drawing, including the invention name, name of inventor, and application number.\n- Submit all drawings on 11-inch by 8.5-inch white paper or A4 paper. This paper must:\n- Be non-shiny, flexible, free of creases or folds, durable, and white.\n- Be free of erasures, alterations, overwritings, and interlineations.\n- Make the margins at least 1 inch on the top and left sides, 3/8 inch on the right, and 5/8 inch on the bottom.\n- Include scan target points (cross-hairs) on two catercorner margin corners.\n- Never superimpose one drawing over another.\n- Use symbols and a legend if necessary to describe the invention.\n- Avoid solid black shading except on bar graphs or to represent color.\n- Use lead lines that guide the reader from the drawing to the associated symbol in the description.\n- Number each page and view in order with Arabic numerals.\n- Avoid holes in the paper.\n- Photographs must follow the same rules regarding the type, size, and margins of the drawing.\nA complete list can be found in Title 37 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), specifically § 1.84. Remember that drawings aren't limited to illustrations and can also include charts and diagrams. In some instances, a photograph may work better than a drawing. However, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office only allows photos for utility patents and design patents. Photographs must be in high definition to show the details of the invention.\nChemical compounds are the only type of non-provisional patent that doesn't require any drawings.\nColor drawings are rare among patent applications, and they are only allowed for design and utility patents. If you think color drawings are necessary, you must file a petition and pay the specified fee of $130 under Title 37 (CFR) 1.17(h) for permission to use them.\nIf you send your petition in the mail, be sure to include two sets of color drawings and one photocopy that shows the same subject matter in black and white. If you are filing online, only one set of drawings is needed. You also need to add the following language to your patent's specification (the written description of the invention): \"The file of this patent contains a least one drawing executed in color. Copies of this patent with color drawings will be provided by the United States Patent and Trademark Office upon request and payment of the necessary fee.\"\nWhen creating your color drawings, make sure the quality is high enough that they can be reproduced in black and white on the printed patent without losing any details.\nGraphic Forms in Drawings\nTables, formulas of a mathematical or chemical nature, and waveforms are subject to the same rules as any other type of drawing. Formulas and waveforms also have specific requirements:\n- Formulas: Each formula must be labeled as a separate figure and include brackets to show any necessary information.\n- Waveforms: Waveforms must be presented in a single figure that uses a vertical axis and a horizontal axis that shows time. Each individual waveform must have a letter designation adjacent to the vertical access for identification.\nWhy Is It Important to Follow Patent Drawing Rules?\nIf you don't include patent drawings or don't follow the patent drawing rules, your application is incomplete. Because it's incomplete, the date of filing will be delayed. This could end up costing you a patent, especially if competitors are trying to patent the same type of invention. Photographs and color drawings have their own rules, so take care to follow those, too.\nFollowing the patent drawing rules will also help the patent officer determine whether the invention is non-obvious and novel. These standards are two of the main hurdles to getting a patent.\nFiling with quality patent drawings also helps establish priority of invention with an earlier filing date, which is important in a first-to-file country like the United Staes. To fully benefit from an earlier filing date, the patent application must cover the invention and all of its permutations, and quality drawings make this process easier. The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has frequently used patent drawings to help determine what a skilled person would have considered disclosed at the time of application.\nIn addition, a patent drawing may save you if you leave something out of the written description. For this reason, a quality drawing is often the norm, and a professional patent illustrator to draft the drawing is a valuable asset.\nGuidelines to Follow for Patent Drawings\nProcesses, machines, and designs are three of the most popular patent types. Each follows the same general patent drawing guidelines:\n- Clearly show features, including text and illustration.\n- Keep the drawing neat with no signs of erasure or errors.\n- Maintain legibility throughout.\n- Always use the metric system, as it is the preferred measurement throughout the world.\n- Make the drawing visually appealing to grab attention.\nAlthough these guidelines aren't strict rules, following them will help the patent officer better understand your invention. At the application stage, you don't need to fit all the requirements of a formal patent drawing. However, less technical components still apply, such as the correct font to label aspects of the drawing, as well as the margins of the drawing.\nWhat Views Do I Need?\nTo show how your product looks and works, use several viewpoints in your drawings. If applicable, include the following views of your invention:\n- The standard six views (front, back, right, left, top, and bottom). Unornamented surfaces can be omitted.\n- Perspective views with three dimensions.\n- Only the front and back views of a flat object.\n- Sectional views to show function.\n- Exploded views to show how a single part works during operation of the invention.\nShading is another key part of patent drawings. It shows depth, contour, and texture. To do this, you can use dots, lines, and distinctive patterns.\nArrows and lead lines are also important in the patent draw. There are three times to use arrows:\n- On a lead line, a freestanding arrow shows the entire section which it points to.\n- On a lead line, an arrow touching a line shows the surface indicated by the line.\n- To show movement direction.\nEven with all these rules, there are also considerations you should be aware of. Some of these include:\n- Copyright or Mask Work Notices: These can be placed in the drawing directly below the portion they pertain to. However, they must only be 1/8 inch by 1/4 inch. These are only to be used in cases applicable to law and must be included in the specification.\n- Numbering of Sheets: Drawings must be numbered in Arabic numerals in the middle of the top of the sheet, but not in the margin. Numbers can be moved to the top right if they interfere with the drawing. Numbering must also include two numerals separated by a line to show the page out of the total number of pages. Make sure that numerals are also larger than the numbers used to identify portions of the drawing.\n- Numbering of Views: Views must also be numbered with consecutive Arabic numerals, independent of sheet numbering. Partial views must also use Arabic numerals, followed by a capital letter. Numbers and letters must also be clear and not used with brackets, circles, or inverted commas. These numbers must also be preceded by \"FIG.\" When there's only a single view, \"FIG\" is unnecessary.\n- Security Markings: Security markings can be used but must be in the center of the top margin.\n- Corrections: All corrections submitted with the patent drawing must be permanent and durable.\nOn Your Own vs. Trained Professionals\nAs long as you follow the patent drawing rules, making professional charts, illustrations, and diagrams isn't as hard as you may think. You can stick with a pen and paper, or you can use patent drawing software. Options range from free but limited software to expensive, versatile programs. The quality of each depends on your skill in using it.\nIf you don't have the patience to draw, don't have the skill, or don't want the added pressure of making complex drawings, a professional patent illustrator is a great choice. These highly trained professionals will make each page for around $100 to $125. Although this may seem expensive, it's a fair price to pay for the most important part of your patent application.\nMany inventors don't take enough time or care with their drawings. This could result in an incomplete patent application, or the patent office may not have enough information to make a decision. That's why it's always important to include as many drawings as are needed to fully explain the invention.\nOther inventors don't want to shell out the extra cash to hire a draftsman or patent illustrator. Instead, they rely on their own hand. For moderate to strong artists, this isn't a terrible idea. However, poor drawers may be denied a patent without the help of a trained expert.\nSteps to File a Patent With Correct Patent Drawings\nOnce you've filled out the basic patent application and written a full description of the product, it's time to add the drawings. Remember that only provisional and chemical formulas can be submitted without a drawing. For all other patents, include as many drawings as possible to show how the product works.\nIf you need help with patent drawing rules, you can post your question or concern on UpCounsel's marketplace.

Born in Florence in 1360, he founded an important bank with branches all over Europe, lending money to kings and popes.\nGiovanni di Bicci de Medici – the dawn of power\nThe achievements of Giovanni di Bicci had great repercussions throughout history. Not only in Florence but the whole of Italy. His father known as “Bicci”, was a well-to-do wool merchant, but Giovanni had other ambitions. He aimed high. He learned the trade working in his uncle’s bank, eventually buying it and building it into the most powerful bank in Europe.\nThe dowry of his newly married wife Piccarda helped him to start his business. She turned out to be the perfect match, a strong woman from a wealthy family who gave him two sons who brought forward the Medici dynasty and fortune: Cosimo (he will be known as Cosimo the Elder) and Lorenzo.\nA powerful friend – the antipope Baldassarre Cossa\nGiovanni di Bicci needed powerful connections to achieve his ambitions. One of these was his good friend Baldassare Cossa.\nCossa (1370-1419) was elected pope as Giovanni XXIII, with the help of Giovanni’s money. He was a controversial character, who loved women and money more than religion. But most important for Giovanni was the fact that he granted the Medici bank the right to collect Vatican taxes, and taking a percentage of them.\nCossa’s fortune didn’t last long however. He was deposed and incarcerated in 1415, but Giovanni didn’t desert him in his misfortune. He paid for his liberation. The ‘antipope’ died in Florence, where Giovanni’s son Cosimo paid for his grand tomb in Florence’s Baptistry. A beautiful tomb by MIchelozzo and Donatello that can still be seen today.Sailko, CC BY-SA 3.0, Link\nGreat ambition and civic duty in Florence\nGiovanni di Bicci de Medici got involved in Florentine politics late in life. Though he never had a major political role, his money and connections did give him enormous power. Politically he opposed the more ‘conservative’ Albizzi family, and contributed to a more just and proportional system of taxation.\nHe offered a significant contribution to the betterment of his beloved city. His generosity included charitable projects such as the Spedale Innocenti (a hospital for orphans) employing Filippo Brunelleschi for the job. Brunelleschi was Giovanni’s favourite architect, and he chose him for the renovation of San Lorenzo Church, which at that time was falling into ruins.\nThese are just some examples that show how the Medici family shaped the city of Florence throughout the centuries.\nBy the time he died of natural causes in 1429, the 69 year old Giovanni had succeeded in redeeming the image of the Medici, and created a solid base from which the fortune of the Medici dynasty would grow. He is buried in the Church of San Lorenzo in Florence.\nGiovanni di Bicci de Medici – legacy\nGiovanni’s children sired the two historical branches of the Medici family that ruled over Florence and Tuscany for three centuries. The first branch (being from Cosimo the Elder and Contessina de’ Bardi, grandparents of Lorenzo il Magnifico) died out at the end of the 16th century. The second branch (that of Lorenzo the Elder) would survive through the first half of the 18th century.\nThere’s much more to know about the Medici family: if you’re interested, check out some facts and curiosities about this famous dynasty, and how it features in the TV series Medici: Masters of Florence."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:3ba92edc-54f8-4d69-a0a1-efd26947fb65>","<urn:uuid:1deb62c7-cda1-494e-9c26-029235325ffd>"],"error":null}
{"question":"¿Podría alguien explicarme la diferencia entre el mensaje inspirador de 'A is for Activist' y la campaña 'I Will What I Want' de Under Armour?","answer":"'A is for Activist' is an ABC board book that focuses on teaching young children about activism, environmental justice, civil rights, and LGBTQ rights through alliteration, rhyming, and vibrant illustrations.

If you’ve been looking for good quality historical books about prominent Black people from the past and present, I hope you’ll enjoy this list. Perhaps you’ll find something new or be reminded of some of your old favorites.\nI recommend these books because they are not overly wordy and don’t dwell strictly on Civil Rights, slavery or struggle. I think most are easily digestible for the younger crowd and great for reading aloud at home or with a preschool or Kindergarten class.\nRemember, Black History shouldn’t be limited to the month of February.

{"question":"How do the grass feeding practices differ between Spaander farm and Country Wholesome Creamery?","answer":"At Spaander farm, cows have access to grassland for grazing and are free to go back to pasture after milking. At Country Wholesome Creamery, they follow either a 100% grass-fed diet or 70% grass supplemented with heirloom corn and soybeans, with the grass-only diet resulting in lower milk volume production.","context":["Summer time is coming here in Holland. Shining sun and hot temperature.\nMy parents booked a day to relax. My brother, little sisters and I have to care for the farm when they are away.\nWe are looking forward to that day, because it’s a good experience to take responsibility and care of all the animals, the farm and ourselves.\nOn Thursday morning my parents did the last things and then they were gone.\nSo when we got home from school, we had to do the milking and feeding of the cows, feeding the sheep’s and make a dinner for ourselves.\nWe provide our own tasks, I did milking the cows and made dinner.\nMy brother is feeding all the cows , one of my little sisters is feeding the sheep and the goats, and the other sister has been feeding the calves when we were at school.\nSo a great family farm, if you see!\nAfter we drank a cup of tea, we made the last round over the farm and then it’s bedtime.\nThe cows come in to be milked on their own. After they are milked they are free to go back into the pasture. On the other site of the barn is no rest for some cows. A cow is getting up and down, she´s restless and is nearly due to give birth to her calf. We always hope for a female calf, then she can stay on the farm and gave milk for Beemster cheese.\nBut we leave the cow alone by a hutch with clean straw. She then first starts to have the calf naturally by herself. When the natural birth is taking a long time or it seems like the mother is in any kind of pain, then we help the cow and pull the calf with a rope. Then the cow is quickly relieved and clear to meet her child. After the birth we give the cow energy boost with vitamins and goodies which helps the cow to recover. Then the calf is going to his/her own hutch, to prevent any sickness.\nThe weather is not what it has to be for all the farmers.\nNow the busy time is coming. Every day looking forward what the weather is for the next whole week.\nRainy, rainy, rainy.

But we may not forget: nice weather in Holland, it’s never for a long time!\nBut this weekend nice weather is coming according to the weather station. The grass is high and ready to be mowed.\nYesterday I was cycling, I did see much farmers mowing, spreading and raking the grass with tractors and machines.\nAnd when I was coming home from school, my father said: We are going mowing this weekend!\nThis is a nice period, the nice weather, the smell from the grass, the cows are outside and see the little sheep grow up.\nThe spring was started, all eighty sheep have lambed last month. At the moment we have 161 lambs. When they are born, we separate out the mother with her lambs in a pen for a week, to connect.\nThen the family can go by other families of sheep. Before they go outside with the other families, we must trim their feet. We do it by ourselves, it is good for our relation with the sheep! We trim the sheep’s hooves every year after lambing.\nThe cows are beïng trimmed 60 days and 300 days after the confinement for precaution by problems with their claws.\nWe didn´t do all the cows by our own, the Business assistant comes to trim and check their hooves.\nThese people can do this faster and they have more experience. My father has also experience, but there is a lot to do on the farm, so sometimes he trims a cow when she´s lame.\nNow the sheep have beautiful nails, also we have two goats with their kids.\nCaring dairy is a project for farmers sponsored by the cooperative of Beemster.\nCaring dairy is about sustainability, that means a good balance between:\nHappy cows & Healthy cows, feeling good and living longer. (Welfare)\nHappy Farmers: The farmer has to be able to earn a good sandwich with his farm. (economic healthy farm)\nHappy earth: There is care for the environment where the farmers live and work. (Energy and climate)\nOur cows can go outside, jumping by the grassland, grazing fresh grass. The cows can have a free life and sometimes I talk to them. That’s why Beemster cheese has a special taste.\nThe grass cheese with its special taste, delivers us one eurocent a liter milk extra..\nThis is what makes: Happy farmers and Happy cows.\nBut the cows can only be happy when they are healthy, then she can live longer at the Spaander farm.\nThe cows are very happy here on the farm. We make sure all the baby calves that are inside have a nice big hutch of straw to keep them warm and clean. When they get older they have a skippy ball that hangs by a rope, sometimes they play with it to push it around by hitting their head against it. It is very funny to watch. Then the calvess are going jump because they have fun with it. The cows from two year and older have a rubber mat on the floor, like having carpeting at home, so the cows can walk softly and it’s better for their feet.\nThe cows do have many things to make it comfortable and when the cow is happy: she gives more milk. Their bed is made of a mat between foam, then some clean straw. The cows can lay by a good, softy bed. Sometimes the cows have itch, the itching brush helps the cows.\nSome farmers are happy with a small farm, and some farmers want a bigger farm to be happy, but all the farmers will have much milk, great cows and pleasure in their work on the farm. We have one of the biggest farms in the Beemster cooperative, about 130 cows. The calves are born year round on the farm. They are going away from their mother to a hutch (with straw and a heat lamp) because we don’t want any viruses from the cow to spread to the calves. After a week the bulls are going to a trader, he takes them to the market. The females stay on the farm and are going in a group together.\nI am very excited to introduce myself in my first column. I´m Denise Spaander, a girl 18 years old living in North Holland on a farm with my parents, brother and two little sisters.\nIt´s a nice, quiet place, it can be a dream for all the farmers.\nI like to be on the farm, looking for work that I can do to help my family.\nWhen I come from school, I like to do some chores that keep me busy for a while before completing my homework. I am doing my second year on the secondary vocational education, learning to be a teacher, it´s a course of three years. After this course I want to do an agricultural school.\nI would like to learn more about the cows, the things to be a farmer and maybe technologie.\nMy heart is by the farm and working with the animals. The animals will give you peace and joy, they give you something back.\nMy hobbies are going out, drinking a beer with friends and active things like cycling, walking, shopping and running.","Country Wholesome Creamery\nThis 100% and 70% (supplemented with heirloom corn and soybeans) grass fed non-homogenized creamline milk is produced by the Hofstetter family in Hamptonville, NC. This Amish family has been in the dairy business since 1979 and selling their milk as part of a larger co-op model via a large tanker truck coming to their dairy each week and collecting the raw milk for processing. But as of May 2013 the family decided to bottle their own milk right on the farm! They are using a low temeprature vat pasteurization process in order to preserve the natural probiotic elements of the milk. They do not homogenize their milk, so the milk has a creamline on the top just like the old days. Becasue cows on grass-only diets produce less volume of milk the price for this product must be higher in order to sustain the farm's livelihood. We hope you give it a try! The bottles are food grade plastic not glass. They are biodegradable and the most environmentally friendly bottle the family could find after months of research.\nOur Milk comes from Maple View Dairy\nHistory of the Farm:\nOriginating in Corinna, Maine, the farm existed at the same location from the time the first settlers homesteaded central Maine in the early 1800s. Bob Nutter is the fifth generation of his family to farm land, first in Maine and now in North Carolina.\nAt the turn of the century, Bob's grandfather purchased his first registered Holstein dairy cow. Holsteins are black and white, and produce vast quantities of milk with a moderate fat content. These Holsteins were imported from two provinces in the Netherlands; Friesland and North Holland both sit on the cold shores of the North Sea.\nOver the years, the Maview herd has continued to develop. Milk testing (DHIA) and artificial insemination (using semen from superior bulls) have contributed the most toward the improvement of the herd. In July 1963, the Maview milking herd and bred heifers were sold. A better milk market and climate for double cropping was found in North Carolina. Within two months the calves, farm families and equipment moved 1,000 miles to the present location. Maple View Farm was back in business milking cows in Orange County, NC.\nAbout the Land\nThe total amount of land used for the farming and dairy operations is 400 acres.\nIn December 1995 the first conservation easement on the farm proper (107 acres) north of Dairyland Road was granted to the local Triangle Land Conservancy. This easement designates that Maple View Farm land will be used for agricultural purposes or as open land forever. An additional 80 acres was added to the conservancy after 2005.\nBest management conservation practices were applied to Maple View farmland in the early 1930's. The farm was owned then by Will Suit. Every effort has been made over the years since then to protect the streams which run through or originate on the farm and to conserve top soils for future generations who work the land and live here.\nAbout the Animals\nThe Maview herd is an all Holstein herd.\nMaple View Farm, North Carolina's longest time Progressive Breeders Herd, received its first bronze bar in 1947. Ruth and Fred Nutter were the farm owners at that time. Fred, Bob's father, later became president of the national Holstein-Friesian Association. It is now known as Holstein USA.\nThe Maview Prefix\nEvery animal at Maple View has a name and a herd number. The first name, or prefix, of each animal bred at Maple View Farm is \"Maview\". This is a contraction of the first two words in the farm name. Any registered Holstein with Maview as a first name found anywhere in the world was bred on this farm.\nThis is Maview Pella Supersire\nThere are approximately three hundred (300) animals on the farm in total. Roughly one hundred and thirty (130) cows are in the milking herd at this time. The remaining animals are bred heifers, young calves and 2 bulls. Our Rolling Herd Average (production per cow) is 26,000 pounds of milk, 3.9% butterfat and 3.3% protein. Currently the average Maple View milking cow produces about eight 1/2 (8.5) gallons of milk each day. Comparatively, that's one hundred thirty six (136) glasses of milk daily.\nOur Eggs and Poultry comes from Farside Farms:\nAll of the meat and eggs are from antibiotic and hormone free animals raised at Farside Farms. Products are Appalachian Grown, which means they are certified by an ASAP program that identifies family farm products grown or raised in Western North Carolina and the southern Appalachian mountains. All birds are cage free and all grain is ground up into a special blend right on the farm. Mike Brown is the owner of Farside Farms and is truly an amazing individual. When interviewed Brown said, “I don’t farm for the money, I farm because everybody wants to know where their food comes from. The food I sell comes from my farm—I can tell you that.” Brown has turned down opportunities to scale up his operation. “I could produce more volume, but then I couldn’t keep this level of quality.” His business truly started small. Brown grew up in a housing project in Oteen, NC but that didn’t keep him from farming. While he was still in elementary school, he found an abandoned chicken coop on neighboring land. He restored it to production and peddled the eggs door to door in his neighborhood. Only after buying the farm in Alexander, NC - just north of Asheville, where he lives now, did Brown discover it had belonged to his relatives in the 1800s, a coincidence that might seem to confirm he was meant to be there. Brown says of his vocation, “I’ve loved farming since I was a child, loved to see seeds put in the ground, loved to see animals born and raised.”\nOur Beef and Pork comes from Hickory Nut Gap Farm:\nThe land of Hickory Nut Gap Farm is jointly owned by the six children of James and Elspeth Clarke. In 2008 the land was put into a conservation easement with the Southern Appalachian Highlands Conservancy. Protected for eternity the land will remain managed by the family and their agricultural pursuits. Some of the six children, now grown with children and grandchildren of their own remain here at the farm and close by in the area while, as to be expected, some have moved away and pursued a different course in life. This large farm family gathers often as the draw of the family home and their agricultural heritage is still strong. Many of the 21 grandchildren and 14 great-grand children are involved in various aspects of agriculture.\nAmy & Jamie Ager are part owners of Hickory Nut Gap Farm and currently operate Hickory Nut Gap Meats. 2012 celebrates the 12 Year Anniversary of their grass fed and pastured meats business.\nHickory Nut Gap Meats animals consume only their mothers milk and forages during their entire life while rotationally grazing on pasture. This production model eliminates the need for administering subtherapeutic antibiotics. If an animal were to become sick it would be treated as needed but not allowed to enter the meat supply. Growth hormones are never used here at Hickory Nut Gap Meats. Hickory Nut Gap Meat's animals are handled using low stress handling methods and are minimally hauled to one of the two nearest processors for harvest. Both of the processors have passed reviews by Animal Welfare Approved, meaning they meet the highest welfare standards for the animals processed there.\nOur Salmon comes from Wild Salmon Company:\nHeidi runs the Wild Salmon Company. It is a tiny outfit committed to providing customers with an amazing product—delicious, nutritious, sustainably-harvested wild sockeye salmon. Wild Salmon co. is dedicated to the notion that we all should know where our food comes from; that it strengthens our community and our biosphere when we buy organic, locally-sourced food. An Alaskan fisherman, using the most natural practices in the clean sea of Bristol Bay, Heidi has been doing this since she was fifteen years old. Beginning as her dad’s deckhand, Heidi has been gill netting for sockeye salmon in southwest Alaska for nearly twenty years, and now runs her own operation. We love working with Heidi because she lives right here in Asheville, NC for part of the year. Heidi has her Alaskan catch flash frozen right out of the water and shipped right here to us in Asheville: This is the most local wild sockeye you can get and it is delicious!\nOur Cheese comes from Looking Glass Creamery:\nLooking Glass Creamery is a very small family farm and licensed cheesemaking facility located in Fairview, just outside of Asheville, North Carolina. The business was started by Jennifer & Andy Perkins in January of 2009. They work hard alongside three dedicated employees to handcraft some of the best cheeses the South has to offer. Jennifer spent more than a decade building her livestock and cheesemaking experience that led towards the evolution of Looking Glass Creamery. That experience included an indepth apprenticeship at a small farmstead goat dairy and cheesemaking operation in southern Virginia, cheesemaking and sanitation courses at NC State University, a cheese course with Peter Dixon of Dairy Foods Consulting in Vermont, visiting and studying cheesemakers in North Carolina and the Northwest and finally a position as assistant cheesemaker & dairy technician at Blackberry Farm in east Tennesse. Her experience includes work with sheep, goat, and cow milk. Andy worked outside the business as an Audiologist until spring of 2011 when the business became too much for only one of them to manage. He works in the cheeseroom making cheese for the first half of every week and dedicates the second half of the week (including Saturdays) to sales, distribution and working farmers markets.\nOur Trout comes from Sunburst Trout Farms:\nWhy this Trout Tastes so Good: The pink flesh is the normal color of most trout and salmon. It is not a matter so much of species as it is their diet, which includes NO animal by-products, NO antibiotics and NO growth hormones. Of further importance is the fact that at Sunburst they net the live trout, bleed them, filet them, and pack them at 36 degrees, all within one hour, summer or winter. Finally, the gloss on the filets is sure evidence of healthy fresh trout. A “stale” filet has little gloss. The gloss is their outer protection and is loaded with natural antibodies to protect them from external infection.\nSunburst Trout contain NO mercury, PCB’s or Pesticides. The result is that the fish reach 4 pounds before maturity. Heretofore, this has been done in salt water only, the result being superior and full bodied rainbow trout. Fresh water production of large trout is slower but results in a milder, more delicate flavor.\nOur Carolina Mountain water source is the pristine, federally protected Shining Rock Wilderness Area in the Pisgah National Forest. The water has and never will be touched by industry guaranteeing overall purity and freshness. The water is naturally acidic which contributes to the product’s excellent shelf life. Water flows in at 12,000 gallons per minute enabling Sunburst to maintain up to 20 feet per minute across all ponds and runways. This water volume and flow velocity is double the normal practice in the industry.\nOur Bread and Some Prepared Food Comes from Dough Bakery\nDough was started in North Asheville in 2013 by renowned Chef, Brian Ross. Breads are baked fresh each morning of deliveryespeically for us with the highest quality ingredients - croissants, bagels, sandwich breads and speciality breads. Dough also does many different gourmet meals and soups packaged for delivery and flash frozen for freshness - all you need to do is heat and serve.\nOur Coffee is Roasted at Dynamite Roasting Company\nDynamite is a local Black Mountain, NC coffee roaster. They are certified USDA organic and fair trade for all coffee they use. Their reputation for quality and taste is evident in every cup."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:40760bd4-cd22-4a24-b008-8fb97ef9d90a>","<urn:uuid:8718f2f5-c1d2-4448-a737-dd5956b988d3>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do medieval theories about bodily humors relate to modern understanding of eye anatomy?","answer":"Medieval understanding of humors as bodily fluids (blood, phlegm, choler, and black bile) has evolved into more specific anatomical knowledge. While ancient physiology believed these four humors determined health and disposition, the term 'humor' in modern eye anatomy specifically refers to the aqueous and vitreous humors - specialized fluids that serve distinct functions in maintaining eye structure and operation. This meaning of humor as a bodily fluid is now primarily preserved in these eye-related terms.","context":["from The American Heritage® Dictionary of the English Language, 4th Edition\n- n.

{"question":"What are the key strengths and limitations of the last-click attribution model in digital marketing?","answer":"The last-click attribution model has strengths in being result-oriented, simple to understand, and having readily available measurement tools like Google Analytics. However, its main limitations are that it fails to capture the influence of offline advertising like TV, overlooks the impact of seasonality, strongly overemphasizes search channel impact, and doesn't reflect the intermingling of different marketing channels. This makes it potentially inadequate for developing companies using multiple traffic sources, as it may hinder reaching higher business results by failing to properly value earlier touchpoints in the customer journey.","context":["Advertisers don’t always have a clear idea about how much value each channel or campaign adds to their companies’ success.\nDespite the availability of big data, advertisers don’t always have a clear idea about how much value each channel or campaign adds to their companies’ success. To solve this problem, marketers need a clear methodology to attribute credit to the different marketing channels that correctly measures the value of each marketing contact. While this statement may seem obvious, it is hardly a zero-risk proposition. The wrong attribution methods can lead advertisers to incorrectly assess the value of marketing efforts—driving them to move dollars away from successful channels and toward less-effective ones.\nTo address the attribution question, Neustar MarketShare, conducted a major big data study to identify which of the most common attribution models are the most accurate. The study simulated a year’s worth of advertising on a population the size of the United States (316 million people; hence, in the study, 316 million software “entities”). The aim of the project was to create a complete population in which it was clear how advertising influenced purchase decisions —and then to run various attribution approaches to see how close these approaches came to actually measuring the real influence of ads.\nThe simulated individuals were exposed to online and offline advertising; and were programmed to increase their likelihood to buy after every ad exposure—up to a saturation point. The entities were programmed with varying degrees of innate interest in the product; and many of them went in and out of market to shop over the course of the year. The resulting analysis was huge—generating 2 terabytes of simulated tracking data over two weeks’ time.\nOnce we had created the simulation, we ran attribution analyses on the ways advertising influenced the simulated population’s purchase decisions. We analyzed four of the most common digital attribution models: first click, last click, matched pairs, and discrete choice models. Since the simulation already “knew” exactly how advertising had influenced purchase decisions, we were able to match the various attribution analyses with the actual influence that ads had had on purchases. We then scored the attribution methodologies to see which matched most closely with the ads’ actual influence.* The result showed us which attribution models were the most—and least—effective at understanding the customer’s path to purchase.\nFirst Click attribution gives all credit to the first touch along the conversion chain—based partially on the premise that the first consumer/brand interaction was the one to “kick off” the entire path to conversion.\nComparing first-click attribution with the real influence of ads reveals a number of “fatal flaws” inherent to the approach. The method clearly over-estimates the impact of search and branded display—both which drive high levels of initial awareness—but underestimates lower-funnel channels like retargeting and targeted display. In addition, because first-click is based purely on cookie level information recorded in digital log files, it fails to capture the influence of offline influences—like TV; as well as factors outside of marketing that can have an enormous influence on sales, such as seasonality.\nA “close cousin” of first-click, last click attribution gives complete credit to the touch that immediate precedes conversion. If a customer saw a TV ad, ran a web search that drove her to a site, and then saw a retargeting ad, last-click will give credit to the retargeting ad—and ignore the influence of the TV ad or the search. Both last click and first-click are widely viewed as overly simplified, but are commonly used for a quick “snapshot” of sources of marketing leads.\nComparing last-click attribution with the real influence of ads shows that last click strongly overemphasizes the impact of search—not surprising, as search tends to be the final marketing engagement before a consumer arrives at a site. Last click also was shown to overlook the enormous impact of TV and seasonality—once again unsurprising, as last-click is both bottom-funnel and cookie-based, and so is likely to fail in addressing non-addressable and/or top-funnel influences.\nEssentially a large post-hoc test and control study, matched pairs finds sets that are identical except for one attribute, and compares outcomes both with and without that attribute. For instance, to understand the impact of targeted display, matched pairs attribution might look at conversion rates for consumers who have been exposed to all media including targeted display, as compared to the conversion rate of those who have not been exposed to targeted display but who have been exposed to all other media. According to this approach, the difference in conversion rates between the groups should reveal the effectiveness of targeted display.\nThere were several areas of discrepancy that we observed between the matched pairs approach and the true answer that the simulation provided. Investigating the discrepancies suggested four main problems:\nMatched pairs relies on measuring the impact of consumers’ different experiences—for instance, the impact of being exposed to retargeting versus not being exposed. However, many of the strongest influences on ad effectiveness, such as seasonality and TV exposure, are nearly universal, and so there is simply no difference to measure. For this reason, matched pairs is not designed to measure the impact of these shared experiences. This would largely explain why TV and seasonality are both completely overlooked by the matched pairs analysis.\nOn a related note, matched pairs relies almost exclusively on cookie-level data—which provides insight into who has or has not been exposed to a given type of advertising. Cookie level data alone, however, will not identify the influence of events that are not recorded at the cookie level, such as much of offline advertising and seasonality.\nMatched pairs judges ad effectiveness by comparing conversion rates of populations who have been exposed to an ad with populations that have not. There is an inherent bias problem in this analysis, however—as advertisers naturally tend to target groups who are highly likely to convert. For this reason, it can be extremely difficult to separate the impact of the ad on a group of consumers from the natural tendency of that group to buy the product, regardless. In other words, it’s easy to over-estimate the impact of an ad on a population that needs very little convincing to buy. To address these problems in our matched pairs analysis, we adjusted the data for intention bias—matching groups with like inherent intent to buy, and factoring for behavior that indicates an imminent purchase.\nHowever, it is impossible to weed out all such biases from population-level studies. This likely explains why, even with our adjustments of the sample, the approach still significantly overestimates the impact of targeted display, which obviously favors buyers who are likely to purchase. (It is also worth noting that, in practice, many digital attribution matched pairs practitioners do not account for these biases at all. To learn more about what this study revealed about attribution at consumers’ pre-existing intent to purchase, see our separate brief on attribution and customer intent.)\nMatched pairs asks a binary question—were consumers exposed to a type of advertising, or not?— and measures ad influence accordingly. That approach fails to account for the incremental impact of additional ad exposures. A consumer will respond very differently to one, two, or fifteen ad exposures; since these are not binary distinctions, matched pairs struggles to address that difference.\nA second result of this binary approach is that it leaves recency out of the calculation, even though an ad exposure from today is very likely to have a different influence than an ad exposure from last week. Since matched pairs looks primarily at who was exposed to an ad versus who was not, the approach gives the same treatment to all ad exposures, regardless of when they were delivered.\nThis binary approach likely accounts for the fact that matched pairs under-attributes branded display by a great deal, and also underestimates branded paid search and retargeting. In their own ways, all of these channels serve a branding function—and so they stand to become more effective the more the consumer is exposed, and the more recently the exposure has been. Matched pairs, however, is not designed to register the impact of those factors.\nDiscreet Choice Models\nWidely used in machine learning applications, discrete choice models ask which attributes predict a given action, as well as how changes in those attributes might bring an action closer. Discrete choice models ask “who” the customer is, what actions that customer has taken in the past, and how these may work as predictors of an imminent conversion. The answers to these questions might lie in path data—such as prior interactions with the brand’s advertising and website—that suggest a logical next step in a journey. It could also use segmentation data, such as demographics and psychographics—as different populations will be more or less likely to take specific actions.\nThe high degree of accuracy that we see in the discrete choice model can be attributed to a number of factors:\n- Because the model takes offline factors into account, the models are not inaccurately biased toward online media alone.\n- Because discrete choice models operate at the individual consumer level, they can fully control for sampling and intention. As mentioned above, matched pairs can adjust sampling, but only at the segment level. Inevitably, accuracy will be lost in the blunter approach. Discrete choice modelling examines individual consumer paths, not group behaviors—and so can create a much more precise picture of ad effectiveness.\n- The model takes both the frequency and recency of exposures into account—again, both enabled by tracking and analysing customer journeys at the individual level\nIn short, discrete choice modelling provides a more complete and exact understanding of what drives individuals toward conversion. This, in turn, produces a more accurate understanding of which marketing investments work, and how. These are amongst the reasons MarketShare employs the discrete choice approach to digital attribution.","Data-Driven Attribution Vs Other Attribution Models - Which Attribution Model Is The Best?\nAttribution (Latin attributio) - a term with many meanings. Most often, attribution is used in the context of ascribing something to someone/something else. It also means inference, explaining someone's behaviour. In psychology, attribution is defined as people recognising attitudes, phenomena and situations around them. In the latter sense, the concept of attribution was introduced in 1958 by Fritz Heider (1896–1988), an American psychologist of Austrian origin.\nIn marketing, attribution, allows us to assign an appropriate value to selected metrics. In online marketing, metrics apply to all sorts of data collected, e.g. by an online store during customer visits, as well as to the sources of visits to the page. It is possible to identify direct traffic, e.g. when the customer enters the domain name directly in the browser, organic traffic coming from the search engine, traffic from social media, traffic from links e.g. when the customer simultaneously visits both a specific website and clicks links on other pages and paid traffic e.g. during Google Ads advertising campaigns.\nMetrics are therefore a tool to increase website traffic. However, for these actions to bring real benefits, the data must be carefully analysed and appropriate action must be taken to increase sales.\nThe interest in attribution in marketing activities is increasing every year. This is evidenced by numerous presentations or blog entries. In this article, we will discuss the most popular attribution models in the context of their capabilities and the Google Analytics tool.\nAttribution models make up a rule or a set of rules that determine how sales and conversions are attributed i.e. the actions of the recipient—potential customer in response to a dedicated advertising campaign posted on the web or initiatives attributed to SEO, and to clicks, i.e. touchpoints.\nPopular attribution models include: the last and first-click models, the linear model, the time decay model, and the position-based model. In the era of the development of technology and the growing popularity of increasingly complex customer journeys, more advanced data-driven models have appeared, e.g. Data-Driven Google Ads, DoubleClick Search, Google Analytics Premium (Shapley value model). Currently, the Markov model which has interdisciplinary applications has also become a very well-known complex model.\nLAST-CLICK ATTRIBUTION MODEL\nOur observations show that the most popular model is the last-click attribution model, which assigns a value (revenue, acquired contacts) to the user's last interaction (campaign, source/medium). The reason for the popularity of this model may be its uncomplicated nature because it is the simplest tool to understand and measure.\nAdvantages of the last-click attribution model\nUp to a certain stage of business development, this model seems to be sufficient. The positive features of the last-click attribution model are: result orientation, simple principles of operation and availability of measurement tools (e.g. Google Analytics).\nDisadvantages of the last-click attribution model\nThe last-click attribution model may not be fully authoritative for developing companies that use many opportunities to bring traffic to their online ecosystem. This model does not reflect the possible intermingling of channels, and thus hinders the analysis, as well as the process of assigning value to each of the actions. As a consequence, this situation may hinder reaching a higher level of business results. It is important to realise that the last-click attribution model is heavily based on post-click results and cost optimisation. Therefore, in a growing company, solely relying on this method of rules determining the attribution of sales and conversions may turn out to be reckless and short-sighted.\nFIRST-CLICK ATTRIBUTION MODEL\nThe first-click attribution model assigns 100 percent of the value to the channel (e.g., traffic source) that first occurred on the path to generating value (revenue, conversion), bypassing the last interaction (last-click), as well as the interaction between the start of the user's journey and the last interaction.\nAdvantages of the first-click attribution model\nThe first-click attribution model may be beneficial when looking for marketing channels that are more valuable in terms of acquisition (project scaling, searching for new customers).\nDisadvantages of the first-click attribution model\nThe first-click attribution model does not take into account the further user journey and the most popular last-click model, i.e. the channels at the end of the sales process. Therefore, marketing specialists may have a problem justifying the results based solely on first-click attribution.\nLINEAR ATTRIBUTION MODEL\nThe linear attribution model is characterised by the fact that each touchpoint on the conversion path has the same share in the sale.\nAdvantages of the linear attribution model\nThe undoubted benefit of the linear attribution model is the optimisation of advertising budgets along the entire customer journey, and not just at one touchpoint. This attribution model allocates the same proportion of conversion value to all funnels the customer came in contact with before the purchase.\nDisadvantages of the linear attribution model\nBecause the linear attribution model assigns the same proportion of conversion values to all channels, there is a risk that both valuable and insignificant channels are treated the same way. This situation may lead to falsified analysis and underestimating the most important touchpoints.\nPOSITION-BASED ATTRIBUTION MODEL\nThe position-based attribution model takes into account the entire conversion path, assigning the largest contribution for its creation to the user's first and last traffic source.\nAdvantages of the position-based attribution model\nThe undoubted benefit of this model is the appreciation of the first and last touchpoints and not just one touchpoint. This is especially helpful in promotional activities that use remarketing. This is because the first touchpoint with a potential customer will provide information on where to look for new users. In turn, the last touchpoint informs us on where to increase the visibility of a given advertisement to translate the acquisition into success.\nDisadvantage of the position-based attribution model\nThe first and last interaction are evaluated equally. Not every channel can finalise the sale and initiate it to the same extent.\nTIME DECAY ATTRIBUTION MODEL\nThe time decay attribution model assigns the highest value to the nearest conversion point. The further the touch point is, the lower its value (in line with the distance from the point of conversion). Subsequent points are assigned smaller values according to the distance from the conversion. The time decay model can be used in advertising campaigns based on various promotion channels.\nAdvantages of the time decay attribution model\nThis model can be an alternative to the last-click attribution model because it includes the entire path and also assigns a high value to the last-click. The advantages of the model include its result orientation and simple operating principles, similar to the last-click model.\nDisadvantages of the time decay attribution model\nThe risk resulting from the time decay attribution model is the marginalisation of the value of touchpoints initiating the path. This must be taken into account when scaling business and analyse the sales initiation channels.\nPROJECT MANAGEMENT, MILESTONES\nIt is worth noting that milestones allow for coordinating and controlling the project.\nIn the context of attribution, there are two key stages, i.e. milestones. Achieving them involves answering the following questions:\nHow can technological and tool restrictions be overcome?\nWhich attribution model should be chosen? Which attribution model is the best and most effective?\nATTRIBUTION AVAILABLE IN THE GOOGLE ANALYTICS TOOL\nGoogle Analytics Conversion Report—the most important conversion paths.\nThis graphical report presents the user journeys leading to the purchase. This gives you the ability to determine which channels most often increased sales. These channels are: organic traffic, direct traffic and paid traffic from search engines. It should be noted that due to the pictorial nature of the above statement, we will not find in it a grouping of paths and values (e.g. in the form of revenue for a group of paths).\nVALUE OF INCOME FOR A PATH AND ATTRIBUTION - GOOGLE ANALYTICS CONVERSION REPORT - COMPARISON OF ATTRIBUTION MODELS\nLAST-CLICK ATTRIBUTION MODEL\nFIRST-CLICK ATTRIBUTION MODEL\nIn the popular tool, it is possible to compare some of the attribution models (last-click attribution model, first-click attribution model, linear attribution model, time decay attribution model, position-based attribution model). This situation is proof that attribution data does not require high financial expenditures, both in terms of technology and the use of dedicated tools.\nWHICH ATTRIBUTION MODEL IS THE BEST IN THE CONTEXT OF THE ENTIRE PATH?\nIt is worth noting that there are many attribution models. Therefore, deciding which of them is the best is a challenge. However, the answer to this question is simple. **No model is optimal and the best results are achieved by comparing attribution models with each other. **\nThis issue will be discussed in the example below, in which we will compare free direct traffic and paid search engine traffic.\nIn first-click attribution, the direct traffic channel generated over 378,000 fewer entries than in last-click attribution. This may mean that the direct traffic channel is successfully completing the sales process, but other channels had some involvement. In contrast, the paid search engine traffic channel was more important in terms of generating demand. It is an activity that supports the acquisition because in the first-click attribution, it generates 109,000 more entries than in the case of the last-click attribution.\nThe Google Analytics module allows for collecting very valuable data partially solving both milestones (i.e. access to the attribution tool), as well as the problem of choosing the attribution model. However,\nit should be understood that the free version of Google Analytics has several disadvantages. They include:\n- An inconvenient form for data comparison—to present the above comparison, it is necessary to transfer data into a spreadsheet and make a calculation.\n- No complex attribution models: data-driven model, Markov model and Shapley value model.\n- Impossible to use attribution on data outside the network (data from a CRM, business data). The Google Analytics Premium version, which was described in the report presented above, provides an additional attribute method that refers to the Shapley value model; however, bear in mind that the tool version is paid, and thus the barrier to entry becomes quite high because of the cost. The tool is made available from selected resellers who also offer onboarding for an employee to prepare them for new duties in such a way that they are able to effectively use Analytics Premium (streaming) as soon as possible.\nFUNNEL-BASED ATTRIBUTION WITH REGARD TO ENHANCED E-COMMERCE (OR IMPROVED E-COMMERCE VERSION) AND OTHER EVENTS (FUNNEL-BASED ATTRIBUTION MODEL)\nIn traditional attribution models, we focus on the following two topics:\n- Conversion (analysed in this text);\n- The order of the traffic sources of users coming to a given website before converting.\nIt is worth noting that none of these attribution models takes into account the interaction of a potential customer with a given website using traffic sources in such a way as to assess their quality and contribution to the implementation of a given transaction.\nAnalysis of the following diagram will show that each traffic source plays a different role in the user's journey.\n- Source A (awareness stage)—starts the user's journey with the website, but in no way leads to purchase because the customer leaves the website almost immediately. The role of the source that generated the exit from the site is only to build user awareness about the existence of a given company or product.\n- Source B (reflection stage)—located in the middle of the funnel, arousing the user's interest in a given company or product as a result of browsing the catalogue of offers/articles.\n- Source C (decision/conversion stage)—located at the end of the user's journey, associated with adding the product to the cart as well as making the purchase.\nTherefore, the question arises: Is the information about the order in which individual sources of user/customer traffic appear sufficient information to assign the right value to the conversion?\nThe solution for those who consider that each traffic source ought to be assigned an individual\nconversion value depending on the actions that the user made is the funnel-based attribution model. This model takes into account more information than what results from customers' visits and conversions. Funnel-based attribution takes into account specific actions that a user performs when passing through the entire shopping funnel.\nAn example of a shopping funnel in an online store is as follows:\n- A user/customer enters the website;\n- The user becomes familiar with product categories on a given website or uses a search engine for this purpose;\n- The user visits the page of a specific product;\n- The user adds a product to the cart;\n- The user/customer makes a purchase\nBased on the above purchase funnel, the following steps are implemented:\n- Individual steps/actions that users took in the shopping funnel are assigned weights, i.e. a scoring system. If the given source/medium was the first in the funnel to lead to a given event, then it is assigned the appropriate conversion value based on a previously established scoring system.\n- Revenues are attributed according to assigned weights, i.e. the scoring system of individual events, and added to traffic sources or other dimensions.\nWhat are the necessary elements required to use this attribution model?\nData Warehouse database software)—own data set located in one ecosystem e.g. Google Cloud Big Query or Google Analytics Premium database. Because each user/customer goes through their own shopping funnel, the data analysis process is extremely complex and varied, and above all, individual and dependent on the nature of the project, hence the need to create a database that allows for easy data migration and for performing operations on the database that match our needs.\nWhat else is worth including in this attribution model?\n- Custom goals – having a database allows you to write advanced SQL queries, and thus facilitates the\ncreation of an unlimited number of custom goals and segments created by users. Example goals are provided below:\n- Purpose of the attribution model: engaged users staying on the website at a certain time who generate a certain number of events.\n- Purpose of the attribution model: users browsing products that cost over PLN 1,000 on the website\nIt is worth realising how important it is to create an integrated attribution model combining online and offline data, which would be a bridge between marketing activities and offline purchases with data on the Internet.\n- Online data – considering integrating your database with the data available online, and marketing expenses in various systems. Google Analytics files only provide information about the costs of Google Ads. Therefore, the challenge for analysts is the integration of costs from affiliate systems, financial expenses for advertising placed on Facebook, as well as the costs of website positioning and many others.\n- Offline data – the last important element for attribution analysis is offline data, i.e. business data processed after the transaction on the website,\ne.g .: returns of products in the online store, order status from the system for customers who leave an email for contact, status after talking to a consultant on the hotline.\nThe following is an analysis of the results of the practical application of the funnel-based attribution model on the example of an online store.\nThe data presented in the table contains Google Analytics implementation and configuration errors. The quick payment domain (https://platnosci.bm.pl/), which is marked in the funnel as a new source of traffic, making us lose track of the true source, has also not been excluded from the data. It is worth looking at how individual attribution models deal with such an error.\nAttribution and its models, which, based on data from traffic analysis on a given website, logically assign transactions to the appropriate sources (in this case they tell us that the source/medium did not start generating revenue) and thus comes to the rescue. The emphasis here is that the basic models in Google Analytics are available in the free version. However, for a better illustration and comparison of the phenomenon, the first-click attribution model that best handled the error detection was taken into account. This is justified because traffic is lost along the way and a new source/medium is created.\nMARKOV ATTRIBUTION MODEL\nThis model detected the problem, but the channel was marginalised to a small extent. The Markov model shows over 20 per cent less revenue. Therefore, the analysis of this model shows that it is not the right tool to detect the anomaly described above.\nFUNNEL-BASED ATTRIBUTION MODEL\nThe model detected the problem of incorrect implementation and marginalised the channel, assigning it a minimum revenue value. Based on the analysis of the purchase funnel and the granular events occurring in it, it appears that this model is perfectly capable of detecting anomalies in the data. It turns out that no previous event was related to a given traffic source. Thus, it confirms the anomaly and an error in the data, because in practice such a situation occurs extremely rarely.\nWhat tools were used to respond to challenges and milestones?\nData integration, database delivery, user journey, custom goals and events, and the attribution model itself were developed using the WitCloud tool that allows for data integration in the Google Cloud system and provides an automated attribution system based on BigQuery. The WitCloud tool is intended for entities and people who do not have programming resources written in R or who do not have the appropriate database."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:f4aa27bc-e573-42eb-90f4-470d0551e53c>","<urn:uuid:c8676a6a-47ca-4dec-9006-273c8ccd604e>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What ecological adaptations do Melicytus drucei and Echinacea purpurea have for surviving in their respective environments?","answer":"Melicytus drucei has developed a tangled mass of crooked branches with a latticework of rigid grey-brown stems and spiny tips, which helps protect against browsing, wind abrasion, and harsh climatic conditions. It can also photosynthesize through its stems, not just leaves. In comparison, Echinacea purpurea has adapted to survive in various conditions - it can grow in both dry and moist soil, tolerate drought once established, and thrive in dry open woods, prairies, and barrens, though it cannot grow in shade. It is also adaptable to different soil pH levels.","context":["Melicytus drucei - A Rare Shrub Violet\nScientific name: Melicytus drucei (Melicytus from the Greek meaning ‘honey-cavity’ referring to a nectar cavity found below flower stamens and drucei after A.P. Druce, 1920-1999.)\nFamily name: Violaceae (Violet Family)\nThis unusual tangle-branched (divaricating) subalpine shrub, and relative of the commonly known forest tree, mahoe (Melicytus ramiflorus), is named after leading plant ecologist A.P. (Tony) Druce who first discovered it. It has been recognized as a botanically unique, rare, and threatened species, growing in Egmont National Park and nowhere else in the world. It is in fact currently the only indigenous species known to be truly endemic to the park. It is mainly found growing in a narrow band along the edge of the Ahukawakawa Swamp and in several other places on Pouakai Range. More recent sightings include some plants near the swamp but distinctly on the main cone of Mt Taranaki.\nIt is the only known Melicytus species with a triple arrangement of chromosomes (the first known ‘stable triploid’ within that genus). Most plants have a double arrangement of chromosomes but some have a quadruple set. The triple arrangement results when two species hybridize (one double and one quadruple) and a new species becomes separated from the parent species and is ‘self-compatible’- not needing either of the parent species to reproduce. Melicytus drucei is believed to have originated as a hybrid between two Melicytus species, namely M. flexuosus and a member of the alpinus group, both of which are no longer found in Taranaki. The crossing of the two species may have happened during a period of harsh climatic conditions (such as a glacial period of the Pleistocene Ice Age) when the two parent species were more widespread.\nThe plant consists of a tangled mass of crooked branches bearing small linear to oblong leaves, which are to some degree protected within a latticework of rigid grey-brown stems and spiny tips. This is believed to be an adaptive form, which may resist browsing or enable plants to survive and recover more quickly from browsing, and may also help protect growing points and leaves from wind abrasion and other harsh temperature and climatic extremes. In the more exposed or open sites the shrub forms even more tightly compact crowns or hummocks up to 1 m diameter which are often covered with a heavy coating of lichen, moss and epiphytic ferns.\nThe plant has some other unusual features; its stems not just its leaves are able to photosynthesise (convert carbon dioxide into sugars using the energy of sunlight), while the shrub’s flowers, which resemble tiny creamy-yellow bells, are hermaphrodite and set fruit regularly and abundantly but the reproductive process requires further study. Flowering takes place between October and December while between March and May white and purple spotted berries hang down from the stems in abundance. These berries are believed more likely dispersed by lizards because they are not easily visible or accessible to birds.\nSubstantial colonies are found on an alluvial terrace on the Ahukawakawa Swamp margin adjacent to the Stony (Hangatahua) River. It is found here in the canopy layer of mixed scrub/shrubland which includes many other divaricating species (Coprosma tayloriae, Coprosma decurva, Coprosma rugosa, Olearia capillaris, Raukaua (formerly Pseudopanax) anomalus, Myrsine divaricata, and Aristotelia fruticosa) that in combination produce a general appearance of ‘grey scrub’. In another site, on the northern slopes below Pouakai Peak, they seem far less numerous and are in direct competition with the leatherwood (Brachyglottis elaeagnifolia) that dominates the shrubland canopy in that area. More extensive surveys are needed to determine the full extent of population size and distribution.\nField observations in 1991-1992 confirmed that possums and hares were heavily browsing adult plants and that many seedlings and saplings were being destroyed. The species is monitored by the Conservation Department and some plants have also been caged to prevent browsing. Management of pests, including 1080 possum control, have resulted in significant recovery and improved regeneration in the uncaged plants. Monitoring and pest management strategies are reviewed regularly in order to maintain and improve general plant health and habitat protection.\nA fuller description of this interesting plant is at the New Zealand Journal of Botany website.\nMelicytus habitat in Ahukawakawa Swamp","Echinacea purpurea (eastern purple coneflower or purple coneflower) is a species of flowering plant in the genus Echinacea of the family Asteraceae. Its cone-shaped flowering heads are usually, but not always, purple in the wild. It is native to eastern North America and present to some extent in the wild in much of the eastern, southeastern and midwest United States.\nThis herbaceous perennial is 120 cm (47 in) tall by 25 cm (10 in) wide at maturity. Depending on the climate, it blooms throughout spring to late summer. Its individual flowers (florets) within the flower head are hermaphroditic, having both male and female organs on each flower. It is pollinated by butterflies and bees. Its habitats include dry open woods, prairies and barrens, as well as cultivated beds. Although the plant prefers loamy or sandy, well-drained soils, it is little affected by the soil's pH.\nE. purpurea is also grown as an ornamental plant, and numerous cultivars have been developed for flower quality and plant form. Unable to grow in the shade, it thrives in either dry or moist soil and can tolerate drought once established. The cultivar 'Ruby Giant' following has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.\nIt can be propagated either vegetatively or from seeds. Useful vegetative techniques include division, root cuttings, and basal cuttings. Clumps can be divided, or broken into smaller bunches, which is normally done in the spring or autumn. Cuttings made from roots that are \"pencil-sized\" will develop into plants when started in late autumn or early winter. Cuttings of basal shoots in the spring may be rooted when treated with rooting hormones.\nSeed germination occurs best with daily temperature fluctuations or after stratification, which help to end dormancy. Seeds may be started indoors in advance of the growing season or outdoors after the growing season has started.\nOne study shows E. purpurea has antidepressant properties in white rats as it increased the stimulating action of L-DOPA. Echinacea is believed by many people to stimulate the immune system. In indigenous medicine of the native American Indians the plant is used externally for wounds, burns, and insect bites, chewing of roots for toothache and throat infections; internal application is used for pain, cough, stomach cramps and snake bites.\n|Wikimedia Commons has media related to Echinacea purpurea.|\n- \"Echinacea purpurea - (L.)Moench.\".

{"question":"I am trying to understand how project organization works. Can you help me understand what is the difference between how PMBOK and PRINCE2 structure project governance and stakeholder roles?","answer":"PMBOK and PRINCE2 have different approaches to project governance and roles. In PMBOK, project management involves five basic processes (Initiating, Planning, Executing, Controlling, and Closing) with stakeholders being a key knowledge area. The governance enables management to have control over projects and helps align with organizational mandate. In PRINCE2, governance is more specifically structured with a Project Board comprised of three key roles: the Customer (or Executive) who pays for the project, the Senior User who represents those impacted by the project, and the Senior Supplier who provides expertise. PRINCE2 also includes Project Assurance providing independent views from business, user, and specialist perspectives, plus optional Project Support Office for administrative work. Both methods aim to ensure projects are properly organized and controlled, but PRINCE2 provides more detailed role definitions and governance structure.","context":["What is PMBOK best practice?\nThe PMBOK® Guide is an internationally recognized standard and includes five basic Project Management processes; Initiating, Planning, Executing, Controlling and Closing.\nWhy is the PMBOK Guide important?\nFor project managers, a universal set of best practices is vital because PMBOK is the standard by which PMP certification is attained. For employers, PMBOK is crucial because it helps them identify professionals who can step in and apply standardized practices within the business and across departments.\nWhat is the PMBOK Guide is the standard for?\nThe PMBOK Guide provides a globally recognized standard and guide for project management professionals. That standard, in its current form, represents the accumulated wisdom and knowledge of project managers from around the globe.\nIs the PMBOK based on the scientific method?\nCreated and updated by the Project Management Institute, the PMBOK is a manual that identifies the repeated features of the project management process. A good way of understanding the PMI PMBOK is by comparing it to the scientific method.\nWhat are the best practices of project management?\nProject Management Best Practices\n- Build your business case for the project.\n- Develop a project brief.\n- Create a project plan.\n- Establish clear and consistent communication.\n- Maintain a schedule and cadence.\n- Plan for setbacks and how to take corrective action.\n- Closely monitor your project for scope creep.\nWhere is PMBOK used?\nPMBOK is used as a standard through which a PMP certificate can be obtained. The main advantage of a PMP certificate is that project managers and team members, as well as other resources will already have been trained and prepared for work in project management.\nHow does PMBOK define a project?\nAccording to the PMBOK® Guide—Fourth edition (PMI, 2008a, p. 434) the definition of a project is “a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique project service or result.” Projects are temporary and close down on the completion of the work they were chartered to deliver.\nWhat are the key concepts of PMBOK?\nThe 5th edition of PMBOK included Stakeholder Management and was designed around process groups: Initiating, Planning, Executing, Monitoring and Controlling, and Closing. The ten knowledge areas are mapped to the five process groups.\nWhat is PMBOK how do we apply this in organizing events?\nThe PMBOK Guide is an instructional book that includes foundational standards, guidelines, and terminology to help industry professionals manage multiple projects. It breaks project management processes down into five PMBOK process groups, which can be incorporated into your choice of project methodology.\nWhat is Pmbok risk management?\nThe PMBOK® Guide, defines a risk management process as the “systematic process of identifying, analyzing, and responding to project risks”.\nHow can project management help organizations improve business performance?\nThe importance of project management in organizations can’t be overstated. When it’s done right, it helps every part of the business run more smoothly. It allows your team to focus on the work that matters, free from the distractions caused by tasks going off track or budgets spinning out of control.\nIs project management an art or is it a science How can project management help organizations improve business performance?\nProject Management is an Art\nThey are driven by experience of the Project Manager and associated stakeholders. Project management is not purely science as the purpose of science is to build a model of reality.\nWhy do you think it is important for those who manage operations functions to understand project management techniques?\nIt also improves your problem solving, planning, and organizational skills. Learning and understanding basic Project management tools will increase your credibility and may help you edge out your competition.\nWhat are the objectives of project management and why is it so essential in developing information systems?\nIn brief, project management objectives are the successful development of the project’s procedures of initiation, planning, execution, regulation and closure as well as the guidance of the project team’s operations towards achieving all the agreed upon goals within the set scope, time, quality and budget standards.\nWhy is the implementation of projects important to strategic planning and the project manager?\nImplementing projects is important for project managers and the strategic planning process because it can reveal new issues and challenges that planners may not have anticipated, ultimately resulting in more refined strategies, products and processes.\nWhy is it important for project managers to understand the strategy of an Organisation that uses their services?\nUnderstanding the company strategy helps a project manager to frame requests in ways that are more likely to gain them backing and positive feedback. If a project manager can tie value into both their team members as well as senior stakeholders, the chances of project success are much greater.\nWhat is the impact of governance on managing an individual project why Isthis approach important in today’s environment?\nImpact of Governance (G)\nG enables management to have control over all projects being undertaken. G of individual project is very important. G enables the objective of the individual project in aligning with the organization’s overall mandate. It helps in aligning outer environment with internal business resources.","What is PRINCE2?\nBefore we go into the specifics of PRINCE2, there are some general points about the subject of project management, which should help put everything into context…\nWhenever we decide we want to do something, go somewhere, build something, achieve something, we need to know the answer to some questions. What are we trying to do? When will we start? What do we need? Can we do it alone, or do we need help? How long will it take? How much will it cost? These are typical questions asked at the start of any project and the answers are the building blocks of project management – defining what we want to do and working out the best way we can do it.\nStructured project management means managing the project in a logical, organised way, following defined steps. A structured project management method is the written description of this logical, organised approach. PRINCE2 is a structured project management method.\nWe know from experience that projects which aren’t organised and controlled properly usually go disastrously wrong. Some of the big ones hit the press. London Ambulance and Channel Tunnel, for example, both experienced very public problems of systems not working properly and huge overspends. Structured project management methods have been developed to try to prevent such disasters.\nWe have briefly covered what structured project management, and hence PRINCE2, are all about. Now for some more details about the PRINCE2 method.\nPRINCE2 says that a project should have:\n- An organised and controlled start, ie organise and plan things properly before leaping in;\n- An organised and controlled middle, ie when the project has started, make sure it continues to be organised and controlled;\n- An organised and controlled end, ie when you’ve got what you want and the project has finished, tidy up the loose ends.\nIn order to describe what a project should do when, PRINCE2 has a series of processes which cover all the activities needed on a project from starting up to closing down.\nOrganising and controlling a project means that we need to have someone responsible for doing the organising and controlling – this person is called the Project Manager. The Project Manager will select people to do the work on the project and will be responsible for making sure the work is done properly and on-time. The Project Manager draws up the Project Plans that describe what the project team will actually be doing and when they expect to finish.\nThe person who is paying for the project is called the customer or executive. The person who is going to use the results or outcome of the project, or who will be impacted by the outcome of a project, is called the user. On some projects, the customer and user may be the same person. The person who provides the expertise to do the actual work on the project (ie will be designing and building the outcome) is called the supplier or specialist. All of these people need to be organised and co-ordinated so that the project delivers the required outcome within budget, on time and to the appropriate quality.\nEach PRINCE2 project will have a Project Board made up of the customer (or executive), someone who can represent the user side and someone to represent the supplier or specialist input. In PRINCE2, these people are called Customer, Senior User and Senior Supplier respectively. The Project Manager reports regularly to the Project Board, keeping them informed of progress and highlighting any problems he/she can foresee. The Project Board is responsible for providing the Project Manager with the necessary decisions for the project to proceed and to overcome any problems.\nProviding an independent view of how the project is progressing is the job of Project Assurance. In PRINCE2, there are three views of assurance; business, user and specialist. Each view reflects the interests of the three Project Board members. Assurance is about checking that the project remains viable in terms of costs and benefits (business assurance), checking that the users’ requirements are being met (user assurance), and that the project is delivering a suitable solution (specialist or technical assurance). On some projects, the assurance is done by a separate team of people called the Project Assurance Team, but the assurance job can be done by the individual members of the Project Board themselves.\nOn most projects there is a lot of administrative work needed, keeping everyone informed, arranging meetings, keeping plans up-to-date, chasing things up, keeping files, etc. Project Managers often do all this work themselves, particularly on smaller projects. But if there are a number of projects going on at the same time, a Project Support Office can be setup to help the Project Managers with this work.\nApart from describing the different people involved on a PRINCE2 project, and what they are each responsible for, the method also explains how to manage risk, how to manage quality, and how to control change on the project. Risk Management is about working out what could go wrong and planning what to do if it does. Quality Management is about checking the quality of work done on the project, either by testing it or reviewing the work in some way. There are always lots of changes during the life of a project; people change their minds, other things happen, which affect what the project is doing. PRINCE2 has a technique of controlling the way changes impact the project in order to prevent the project going off in the wrong direction.\nSo, PRINCE2 is a method for managing projects. It helps you work out who should be involved and what they will be responsible for. It gives you a set of processes to work through and explains what information you should be gathering along the way. But PRINCE2 doesn’t do the work for you, it cannot guarantee that your projects will be successful. Good projects, which deliver quality results, on-time and within budget are dependent on the quality of people involved from Project Board down to individual team members."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:bc28f2e1-1d57-441a-b9b7-53893694fd58>","<urn:uuid:1ade8067-3b42-4297-9243-ba028c51d4dc>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do lowpass and median filters differ in their ability to preserve edges while reducing noise in image processing?","answer":"Lowpass filters and median filters have different effects on edges during noise reduction. Lowpass filtering tends to smooth the image by reducing deviations from local averages, which can blur edges since it averages pixel values over a square area. In contrast, median filtering is particularly effective at preserving edges while removing noise, especially for small to moderate levels of Gaussian noise. Median filtering is especially efficient at handling speckle noise and salt and pepper noise (impulsive noise), making it very widely used in digital image processing. However, for high levels of noise, median filtering's performance in edge preservation is not significantly better than Gaussian blur.","context":["Just as contrast stretching strives to broaden the image expression of differences in spectral reflectance by manipulating DN values, so spatial filtering is concerned with expanding contrasts locally in the spatial domain. Thus, if in the real world there are boundaries between features on either side of which reflectances (or emissions) are quite different (notable as sharp or abrupt changes in DN value), these boundaries can be emphasized by any one of several computer algorithms (or analog optical filters). The resulting images often are quite distinctive in appearance. Linear features, in particular, such as geologic faults can be made to stand out. The type of filter used, high- or low-pass, depends on the spatial frequency distribution of DN values and on what the user wishes to accentuate.\nAnother processing procedure falling into the enhancement category that often divulges valuable information of a different nature is spatial filtering. Although less commonly performed, this technique explores the distribution of pixels of varying brightness over an image and, especially detects and sharpens boundary discontinuities. These changes in scene illumination, which are typically gradual rather than abrupt, produce a relation that we express quantitatively as \"spatial frequencies\". The spatial frequency is defined as the number of cycles of change in image DN values per unit distance (e.g., 10 cycles/mm) along a particular direction in the image. An image with only one spatial frequency consists of equally spaced stripes (raster lines). For instance, a blank TV screen with the set turned on, has horizontal stripes. This situation corresponds to zero frequency in the horizontal direction and a high spatial frequency in the vertical.\nIn general, images of practical interest consist of several dominant spatial frequencies. Fine detail in an image involves a larger number of changes per unit distance than the gross image features. The mathematical technique for separating an image into its various spatial frequency components is called Fourier Analysis. After an image is separated into its components (done as a \"Fourier Transform\"), it is possible to emphasize certain groups (or \"bands\") of frequencies relative to others and recombine the spatial frequencies into an enhanced image. Algorithms for this purpose are called \"filters\" because they suppress (de-emphasize) certain frequencies and pass (emphasize) others. Filters that pass high frequencies and, hence, emphasize fine detail and edges, are called highpass filters. Lowpass filters, which suppress high frequencies, are useful in smoothing an image, and may reduce or eliminate \"salt and pepper\" noise.\nConvolution filtering is a common mathematical method of implementing spatial filters. In this, each pixel value is replaced by the average over a square area centered on that pixel. Square sizes typically are 3 x 3, 5 x 5, or 9 x 9 pixels but other values are acceptable. As applied in lowpass filtering, this tends to reduce deviations from local averages and thus smoothes the image. The difference between the input image and the lowpass image is the highpass-filtered output. Generally, spatially filtered images must be contrast stretched to use the full range of image display. Nevertheless, filtered images tend to appear flat.\nNext, we will apply three types of filters to TM Band 2 from Morro Bay. The first that we display is a lowpass (mean) filter product, which tends to generalize the image:\nAn edge enhancement filter highlights abrupt discontinuities, such as rock joints and faults, field boundaries, and street patterns:\nIn this example, the scene has been radically modified. The Sobel Edge Enhancement algorithm finds an overabundance of discontinuities but we have chosen this program (using Idrisi) to emphasize the sharp boundaries that can result from applying this mode of enhancement.\nThe highpass filter image for Morro Bay also brings out boundaries, but more subdued than above:\nHere, streets and highways, and some streams and ridges, are greatly emphasized. The trademark of a highpass filter image is that linear features commonly appear as bright lines with a dark border. Details in the water are mostly lost. Much of the image is flat.\n1-13: Comment further (evaluate) the three filter images shown above in terms of what information you extract visually. Include detrimental aspects. ANSWER\nYou will note in the answer to this question that the IDRISI filter products leave something to be desired. They can't really convince one that spatial filtering brings about helpfully different imagery. To assuage that criticism, we are adding (in May 2000) five images extracted from the textbook by Avery and Berlin (Macmillan Publ.; see Overview for reference). The Landsat TM 5 subscene shows a plateau landscape north of Flagstaff, AZ, with both sedimentary rocks and volcanic flows. The first image is just a normal contrast-stretched version.\nThe next view shows this scene as a low bandpass image.\nThis is followed by a high pass filter image in which the convolution matrix is 11 x 11 pixels. This is made by subtracting the low pass filter image from the original (unstretched) data set. In this instance, the image is a form of edge enhancement.\nAs the number of pixels in the convolution window is increased, the high frequency components are more sharply defined. That is evident in this image which uses a 51 x 51 pixel matrix.\nThe last image in this set illustrates directional first differencing, analogous to determining the first derivative which establishes a gradient of spatial change as the filter, with its special algorithm, moves (computer calculational-wise) across the pixel array making up the image. Directional filtering from different directions tends to enhance or disclose linear features that lie preferentially near the perpendicular to the traverse direction. In the image below, the array was moved diagonally across the scene. Note the similarity to the third image above.","In signal processing, it is often desirable to be able to perform some kind of noise reduction on an image or signal. The median filter is a nonlinear digital filtering technique, often used to remove noise. Such noise reduction is a typical pre-processing step to improve the results of later processing (for example, edge detection on an image). Median filtering is very widely used in digital image processing because, under certain conditions, it preserves edges while removing noise (but see discussion below).\nThe main idea of the median filter is to run through the signal entry by entry, replacing each entry with the median of neighboring entries. The pattern of neighbors is called the \"window\", which slides, entry by entry, over the entire signal. For 1D signals, the most obvious window is just the first few preceding and following entries, whereas for 2D (or higher-dimensional) signals such as images, more complex window patterns are possible (such as \"box\" or \"cross\" patterns). Note that if the window has an odd number of entries, then the median is simple to define: it is just the middle value after all the entries in the window are sorted numerically. For an even number of entries, there is more than one possible median, see median for more details.\nWorked 1D example\nTo demonstrate, using a window size of three with one entry immediately preceding and following each entry, a median filter will be applied to the following simple 1D signal:\nx = [2 80 6 3]\nSo, the median filtered output signal y will be:\ny = Median[2 2 80] = 2\ny = Median[2 80 6] = Median[2 6 80] = 6\ny = Median[80 6 3] = Median[3 6 80] = 6\ny = Median[6 3 3] = Median[3 3 6] = 3\ni.e. y = [2 6 6 3].\nNote that, in the example above, because there is no entry preceding the first value, the first value is repeated, as with the last value, to obtain enough entries to fill the window. This is one way of handling missing window entries at the boundaries of the signal, but there are other schemes that have different properties that might be preferred in particular circumstances:\n- Avoid processing the boundaries, with or without cropping the signal or image boundary afterwards,\n- Fetching entries from other places in the signal. With images for example, entries from the far horizontal or vertical boundary might be selected,\n- Shrinking the window near the boundaries, so that every window is full.\n2D median filter pseudo code\nCode for a simple 2D median filter algorithm might look like this:\nallocate outputPixelValue[image width][image height] edgex := (window width / 2) rounded down edgey := (window height / 2) rounded down for x from edgex to image width - edgex for y from edgey to image height - edgey allocate colorArray[window width][window height] for fx from 0 to window width for fy from 0 to window height colorArray[fx][fy] := inputPixelValue[x + fx - edgex][y + fy - edgey] sort all entries in colorArray outputPixelValue[x][y] := colorArray[window width / 2][window height / 2]\nNote that this algorithm:\n- Processes one color channel only,\n- Takes the \"not processing boundaries\" approach (see above discussion about boundary issues).\nAlgorithm implementation issues\nTypically, by far the majority of the computational effort and time is spent on calculating the median of each window. Because the filter must process every entry in the signal, for large signals such as images, the efficiency of this median calculation is a critical factor in determining how fast the algorithm can run. The \"vanilla\" implementation described above sorts every entry in the window to find the median; however, since only the middle value in a list of numbers is required, selection algorithms can be much more efficient. Furthermore, some types of signals (very often the case for images) use whole number representations: in these cases, histogram medians can be far more efficient because it is simple to update the histogram from window to window, and finding the median of a histogram is not particularly onerous. \nEdge preservation properties\nMedian filtering is one kind of smoothing technique, as is linear Gaussian filtering. All smoothing techniques are effective at removing noise in smooth patches or smooth regions of a signal, but adversely affect edges. Often though, at the same time as reducing the noise in a signal, it is important to preserve the edges. Edges are of critical importance to the visual appearance of images, for example. For small to moderate levels of (Gaussian) noise, the median filter is demonstrably better than Gaussian blur at removing noise whilst preserving edges for a given, fixed window size. However, its performance is not that much better than Gaussian blur for high levels of noise, whereas, for speckle noise and salt and pepper noise (impulsive noise), it is particularly effective. Because of this, median filtering is very widely used in digital image processing.\n- T. Huang, G. Yang, and G. Tang, \"A fast two-dimensional median filtering algorithm\", IEEE Trans.

{"question":"Between managing rumen health and providing shade/water access, which approach is more critical for preventing heat stress impacts in cattle?","answer":"Both approaches are essential but target different aspects of heat stress management. Optimizing rumen function helps maintain milk fat content and production efficiency by preventing milk fat depression through managing fatty acid biohydrogenation and lipopolysaccharide production. Meanwhile, providing shade (20-40 square feet per animal with 8-14 foot high structures) and adequate water access is critical for helping cattle directly combat heat since they can only sweat at about 10% of the human rate and must rely on respiration and vasodilation for cooling. The comprehensive approach of addressing both aspects is important since cattle generate additional heat through rumen fermentation while already struggling to dissipate environmental heat load.","context":["Heat stressed dairy cows often suffer milk fat depression, which can be costly to producers in the current challenging dairy market. However, ongoing research suggests that optimising rumen function can help sustain milk fat concentrations in cows under heat stress.\nMilk fat synthesis depends on fatty acids from 2 sources:\n- Long-chain fatty acids (greater than 16 carbon atoms per molecule) – derive from the uptake of circulating preformed fatty acids, dietary fat absorbed from the digestive tract, and non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) from the mobilisation of body fat reserves.\n- Short-chain (4 to 8 carbons) and medium-chain (10 to 14 carbons) fatty acids – originate in the mammary gland from de novo synthesis (fatty acids created ‘anew’ in the mammary from smaller molecules).\nThe 16-carbon fatty acids can originate from both sources. For a well-fed cow, an estimated 4% to 8% of milk fatty acids originate from the breakdown of body fat (such as NEFA). However, the proportion of fatty acids from this source could increase progressively as the cow’s net energy balance decreases (Bauman and Griinari, 2001). Under heat stress, there are two potential mechanisms for milk fat depression (MFD). The first one is rumen fatty acid biohydrogenation – inhibiting de novo milk fat synthesis. The second one is rumen lipopolysaccharide – limiting substrate supply and de novo milk fat synthesis.\nOptimising rumen function could help maintain milk fat content and production efficiency of dairy cows under heat stress. Photo: Henk Riswick\nAltered fatty acid biohydrogenation\nAccording to the well-accepted ‘biohydrogenation theory’ (Bauman and Griinari, 2001), MFD results from changes in rumen biohydrogenation of unsaturated fatty acids and the passage of specific intermediates of biohydrogenation out of the rumen (such as trans-10, cis-12 CLA). These biohydrogenation intermediates subsequently interfere with the expression of genes involved in fat synthesis thereby reducing milk fat synthesis in the mammary gland. Furthermore, the increased rate of feedstuffs outflow from the rumen may increase the likelihood of biohydrogenation intermediates passing through the rumen. So the theory identifies how certain feedstuffs can represent risk factors for MFD (Figure 1). Dairy nutritionists sometimes suggest feeding supplemental fat to maintain the cow’s energy intake during heat stress. However, it is important that the source of fat is rumen inert. Otherwise, low rumen pH, which occurs in heat stressed cows, could generate more intermediates of biohydrogenation and increase the risk of MFD.\nFigure 1 – Dietary components can impact the risk of milk fat depression in 3 ways through the rumen biohydrogenation (BH) pathway.\nAdapted from Lock and Bauman (2007).\nAltered rumen LPS production\nThe other potential mechanism for MFD during heat stress involves the concentration of rumen lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which comes from Gram-negative bacteria when they die. Research shows that when rumen pH decreases, the rumen concentration of LPS increases. Also, as rumen LPS concentration increases, milk fat concentration decreases. Zebeli and Ametaj (2009) showed greater concentrations of rumen LPS as the proportion of grain in the diet increased. As rumen LPS increased, milk fat content decreased (Figure 2). This correlation could be due to the ability of LPS to induce insulin production in the pancreas (Waldron et al., 2006). Increased circulating insulin and increased insulin sensitivity of heat stressed cows could reduce body fat mobilisation. This condition could occur even though heat stressed cows are under negative energy balance due to reduced feed intake and increased maintenance demands (Baumgard and Rhoads, 2013). Also, the lack of plasma NEFA, potentially an important precursor for milk fat synthesis under heat stress (Bauman and Griinari, 2001), may contribute to MFD. Other reported negative LPS effects on fatty acid production include: Decrease in activity of lipoprotein lipase (Lopez-Soriano and Williamson, 1994), decrease in expression of lipoprotein lipase and fatty acid transport protein 1 (Feingold et al., 2009) and suppression of enzymes related to de novo fatty acid synthesis in the mammary tissue (Dong et al., 2011).\nFigure 2 – Correlation between rumen lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and milk fat content.\nAdapted from Zebeli and Ametaj (2009).\nOptimising rumen function during heat stress\nResearch to date helps explain how MFD during heat stress relates to depressed rumen health. Given this relationship, optimising rumen function could help maintain milk fat content and production efficiency of dairy cows under heat stress. Heat stress causes physiological and behavioural changes in dairy cows. These changes can lead to suboptimal rumen conditions, resulting in production of fatty acid biohydrogenation intermediates and LPS that inhibit milk fat synthesis in the mammary gland. Today, natural digestive health technologies are available to help optimise rumen conditions through the diet, thereby helping to reduce the negative impact of heat stress on milk fat and maintain the production efficiency of high-producing dairy cows.\nReferences are available on request.","High temperatures and humidity are tough on cattle and productivity. In addition, stress starts to compound in animals, as pink eye, summer pneumonia and flies can also threaten cattle performance.\nAccording to Iowa State University, once temperatures reach above 80 degrees Fahrenheit, beef cattle endure physiological stress dealing with their heat load.\nHeat abatement, or the reduction of heat stress, along with managing other summer stressors, is critical for beef producers to minimize production losses and keep cattle healthy all summer long.\nPreparing for Heat Stress in Cattle\nCattle sweat very little - about 10% of the human rate. To cool themselves, cattle will dissipate heat through respiration or panting, radiating heat from their bodies with vasodilation (pushing blood to the body's surface for heat removal) and reducing feed and forage intake.\nCattle generate heat in their rumen during fermentation, which causes core temperatures to rise even more. They also typically congregate at water troughs or under trees during the summer months, making it hard for heat to escape, escalating the impact of heat stress.\nCattle’s ability to dissipate heat depends on:\nAir temperature and relative humidity\nEnergy level in the feed ration\nAccording to the Journal of Dairy Science, economic losses from heat stress to the United States cattle industry are estimated at more than $370 million a year. The dairy industry experiences more than double that loss at $897 million.\nWhat Are the Signs of Heat Stress in Cattle?\nCattle experience visible and internal signs of heat stress as they attempt to dissipate heat.\nVisible Signs of Heat Stress\nInternal Signs of Heat Stress\nOpen mouth breathing and panting\nProductivity stops as energy is diverting to returning the body to homeostasis, decreasing performance\nInflammation and immune activation\nDecreased feed intake and increased water intake\nLower reproduction rates\nDecreased activity, lying down\nReduced average daily gain (ADG)\nIncreased insulin levels\nAgitation and restlessness\nThe USDA states that production losses have already begun once cattle start experiencing visible signs of heat stress.\nHow to Manage Heat Stress in Cattle\nCattle producers can prepare for and combat heat events with a combination of management practices and tools such as:\nEnsuring cattle have access to plenty of fresh water. Add more tanks before a heat event to help alleviate congregation around main water tanks.\nUsing droplets, not mist. Make sure the droplets of misters are large, not small. If the droplets are too small, they can create added humidity, worsening heat stress.\nProviding shade. Shade structures should be open and 8 to 14-feet tall to allow for proper ventilation. They should provide between 20 and 40 square feet per animal, depending on animal size.\nFresh feed. Heat also impacts feed quality and increases the growth of bacteria, mold and yeast, making feed less appetizing to cattle. Ensure cattle have fresh feed in a feedyard setting.\nSupporting their immune system. Heat stress equals gut stress. More than 70% of the immune system is contained in the gut. As heat stress erodes immunity and gut health of cattle, which can lead to disease challenges and performance losses, it is essential to support their immunity. Research shows that feed additives using essential oils and capsicum can help boost immunity, provide antioxidant support and help cattle reduce the impact of heat stress.\nRelated: Why Heat Stress Equals Gut Stress in Cattle\nControlling Summer Pink Eye\nBeef producers know the threat of pink eye is more prevalent in the summer.\nAlso known as infectious bovine keratoconjunctivitis (IBK), pink eye is a highly contagious disease that severely impacts productivity and is incredibly painful to cattle.\nAccording to the University of Wisconsin, pink eye is primarily caused by the bacteria Moraxella bovis, which produces a toxin that attacks the eye. It is commonly understood that Moraxella bovis is the cause of traditional IBK or summer pink eye.\nWhat Causes Pink Eye in Cattle?\nSeveral things can predispose cattle to pink eye. The eyes have natural defense mechanisms to thwart infection and damage. However, eye irritants or trauma allow pathogens to pass through the eyes’ defenses and get to the cornea.\nPredisposing factors associated with pink eye include:\nDust and sand\nWeeds, tall grass and stalks\nOther animals, overcrowding from heat stress and tails swishing from flies\nPhysical hazards like barbed wire or trauma during handling and transport\nPink eye occurs in stages as the eye tries to repair itself. Stage two occurs when blood vessels spread throughout the cornea to help with healing. The eye becomes bright pink, explaining how the term ‘pink eye’ was derived.\nWhat’s the Impact of Pink Eye?\nThe University of Illinois estimates the cost of pink eye to the U.S. cattle industry at more than $150 million per year due to decreased weight gain, milk production, treatment costs and permanent scarring to the eye that reduces sale price. Recent studies show a 17 – 65 lb. weight loss from pink eye, with treatment costs exceeding $100 per incident.\nHow to Manage Pink Eye in Cattle\nMany beef producers use pink eye vaccines with varying levels of success\nin the summer months. Yet, the best way to reduce the incidences of pink eye is to manage the associated predisposing factors. Face flies can carry pink eye from animal to animal, so fly control methods are critical. Additionally, ensuring animals are not overcrowded or near hazards, reducing heat stress and handling them as little as possible can help. If pink eye cases are discovered, immediately isolate cattle away from the herd and treat until the infection is gone.\nRelated: How Garlic Can Help Minimize Pink Eye in Cattle\nPreventing Summer Pneumonia in Calves\nSummer pneumonia in nursing calves is another challenge for beef producers to watch out for. This problem can come on quickly and be unpredictable, with the first sign often being sick or dead calves.\nThe University of Nebraska identifies summer pneumonia as a respiratory disease in pre-weaned calves on pasture. While the direct cause of summer pneumonia is unknown, researchers and veterinarians have found a few direct correlations between outbreaks and these varying factors:\nPoor colostrum quality from cows lacking in nutrition"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:a8b911e7-d0e7-4893-9a21-bf2091df18be>","<urn:uuid:be8dc216-779b-4023-9d3f-d6d8d37d6787>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do Chicago and New York City differ in their use of data to support Vision Zero traffic safety improvements?","answer":"Chicago and New York City use different types of data to support their Vision Zero initiatives. Chicago relies heavily on IDOT crash statistics, citing 77,000 reported traffic crashes in 2012 that caused nearly 21,000 significant injuries and 145 deaths, with specific breakdowns showing 7% of fatalities were cyclists, 34% pedestrians, and 59% car occupants. New York City, on the other hand, focuses on demonstrating the effectiveness of implemented solutions, showing that protected bike lanes on Manhattan's Ninth Avenue led to a 58% reduction in injuries to all street users, and other engineering solutions resulted in injury decreases of 21-67%. The cities also differ in their data application - Chicago uses data to justify enforcement measures like red light cameras, while New York uses data to support comprehensive street redesign efforts.","context":["Chicago, Ill., March 19, 2015 — Saying that the victims of traffic crashes are being forgotten in the debate over traffic safety and red light cameras, transportation advocates today called on Chicago’s elected leaders and candidates for elected office to support a comprehensive “Vision Zero” strategy to consistently reduce traffic injuries and eventually eliminate traffic fatalities.\nIn addition, they recommended creating an independent taskforce to assess progress toward the Vision Zero goal and examine which safety strategies work best to reduce traffic injuries and deaths, including evaluating the safety impact of individual red light camera locations.\n“The real victims in this debate are being forgotten,” said Ron Burke, executive director of the Active Transportation Alliance. “The real victims are the nearly 21,000 people significantly injured or killed in traffic crashes each year in Chicago.”\nOne of those victims was 24-year-old Amanda “Mandy” Annis, who was killed in a traffic crash in Logan Square in 2008. Annis was riding her bicycle west on Armitage Avenue when she was hit and killed by a motorist who ran a red light.\nHer boyfriend James Bausch, 27 at the time, was riding a bike to visit Annis and rode past the police activity before returning to the scene to learn his girlfriend was the victim. The same hour she was killed, he was picking up an engagement ring and had plans to propose to Annis. Annis was a teacher at Humboldt Community Christian School.\n“Nobody should have to go through what Mandy’s family and I went through in losing someone we loved to a preventable traffic crash,” said Bausch. “We need to be doing more to enforce traffic laws and hold violators accountable to prevent tragedies like this from happening on our streets.”\nVision Zero is an international traffic safety movement guided by the principle that no loss of life on our streets is acceptable. Traffic crashes are not mere “accidents,” but preventable incidents that can be reduced and eliminated with systemic changes. Photo enforcement is one tool that’s been used internationally and across the U.S. to advance Vision Zero goals, along with public awareness and education programs, policy changes, and improvements to traffic engineering and street design.\nThe findings of Chicago’s Vision Zero task force could serve as the foundation for a detailed action plan on how Chicago will achieve progress towards Vision Zero over the next two years. In the past year, the cities of New York, San Francisco and Seattle have all committed to Vision Zero and published detailed action plans that aim to reduce and ultimately eliminate traffic deaths and serious injuries, and several other cities are already working on similar plans. The Chicago Department of Transportation has adopted a goal of reaching zero traffic fatalities by 2022. In pursuit of that goal, CDOT has been implementing various strategies that would contribute to a comprehensive plan.\n“Vision Zero is the right thing to do for kids and all of Chicago’s pedestrians,” said Dr. Kyran Quinlan, who specializes in pediatrics at Rush University Medical Center. “It is far easier and wiser to protect child pedestrians by making our streets safer. Once kids are hit and severely injured, the best medicine may not be enough to save their lives or make them whole again.”\nAccording to IDOT data, in 2012 there were more than 77,000 reported traffic crashes in Chicago that caused significant injuries for nearly 21,000 people and killed 145 people. Because crashes and injuries are often unreported or misreported, the actual numbers are likely higher.\nPeople riding bikes accounted for seven percent of traffic fatalities, people walking 34 percent, and people in cars 59 percent. For non-fatal injuries, about 80 percent were people in cars with the remaining 20 percent that were people biking and people walking. Many more people suffer minor injuries and life disruption.\nChicago advocates said they are worried the debate about red light cameras could lead to the loss of an important traffic safety tool. They said dangerous driving is rampant, and there aren’t enough police officers to combat the problem and enforce traffic safety laws. Photo enforcement can bridge the gap, effectively multiplying the power of the police to enforce the law.\n“Some of the criticism is justified and some is off base, but enforcing traffic laws, whether with cameras or police officers, prevents injuries and save lives when done properly,” said Burke. “Rather than throw the baby out with the bath water, the city should convene an independent group to determine how to improve the program and which cameras should stay or go.”\nThe Federal Highway Administration and other traffic safety experts support the use of red light cameras.\n“Red light violations may seem trivial to violators, but the safety consequences are real,” said traffic safety expert Richard Rettting, who has led studies at the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) that documented reductions in red light running that ranged from 40 to 96 percent after adding red light cameras. “The research is conclusive: red light cameras are effective at reducing crashes that result in serious injuries and fatalities.”\n“As a pediatric emergency medical physician, I’ve seen the devastating impact that traffic crashes have on children and their families,” said Dr. Karen Sheehan, who serves as medical director of the Lurie Children’s Injury Prevention and Research Center. “Research has shown that red light cameras decrease the more serious right angle crashes.”\nIn 2013, more than 1,100 crashes caused by red light violations killed six people and caused significant injuries for more than 700 people.\nAnother one of those victims was James Longfield, who was riding his bike north on Elston Avenue in Chicago when he was struck by a cab driver running a red light. The driver approached the intersection from the east on Courtland, turning right on red without stopping and hit Longfield. Longfield suffered injuries and ultimately settled with the cab company to cover his medical expenses and bike damages, as well as additional compensation.\n“We need increased enforcement of traffic laws on our streets to save lives and prevent serious injuries like mine, and traffic safety cameras are a big part of that,” said Longfield.\nActive Trans supports better enforcement of all traffic laws for all modes of travel. Whether driving, biking, or walking, everyone needs to be safe and respectful. Dangerous behaviors are unlikely to change without a comprehensive strategy that includes ticketing, public awareness and education programs, policy changes, and improvements to street design.\nActive Trans is asking people to sign a petition in support of moving forward with Vision Zero goals throughout the region.\n# # #\nThe Active Transportation Alliance is a non-profit, member-based advocacy organization that works to make bicycling, walking and public transit so safe, convenient and fun that we will achieve a significant shift from environmentally harmful, sedentary travel to clean, active travel. The organization builds a movement around active transportation, encourages physical activity, increases safety and builds a world-class transportation network. Formerly the Chicagoland Bicycle Federation, the Active Transportation Alliance is supported by more than 7,000 members and 1,000 volunteers.

By showing how streets can be re-engineered to prevent dangerous driving and encourage multi-modal usage, it paves a practical way toward creating a city where crashes are preventable and deaths and serious injuries can be eliminated. These street design protocols were developed with the expertise of traffic engineers and urban planners, and are based on solutions already available in the New York City Department of Transportation’s Street Design Manual.\nToday, we see Vision Zero spreading around the world. In the past two years in the U.S. alone, more than 15 cities have launched initiatives to eliminate traffic fatalities and serious injuries. This global trend provides a remarkable opportunity to build a legacy of safety into our road systems. The Vision Zero Street Design Standard is a tool to guide planners, elected officials, and advocates towards creating arterial roads in which safety is the norm. By incorporating the principles set forward in the Design Standard, cities can address engineering flaws that put pedestrians and cyclists at risk, without compromising movement by any mode.\nIn New York City, 239 people were killed in traffic crashes in 2015. The majority of these crashes happened on arterial roads and were caused by preventable driver behaviors such as speeding and failure to yield the right of way. These behaviors are too often enabled by street design that prioritizes driver speed and convenience, with the safety and experiences of cyclists and pedestrians being an afterthought. A standardized design is needed so that safety can be ensured by default, without relying on education campaigns that may not reach all drivers, or the presence of law enforcement. Once built, these streets are not subject to the shifting winds of politics, and require only standard maintenance to retain their effects.\nSimply put, when safety is made part of the fabric of the street itself, behavior is forced to change - sometimes without drivers even having to think about it. This is the most sustainable and effective solution, and an absolute necessity for achieving Vision Zero goals. Without major changes in street design along the lines suggested by this Standard, New York City will not be able to eliminate deaths and serious injuries on its roads. A city with streets that encourage speeding, limit space for pedestrians, treat transit users like second-class citizens, and force bike riders into danger will not reach zero - in fact, it will be enabling dangerous behavior.\nThe good news is, these street redesigns are achievable. Just as most crashes are caused by completely preventable driver choices, our city streets have entirely fixable design flaws. Everything New York City needs to design safer streets is either already included in the DOT’s Street Design Manual, or is currently being piloted by the city.\nAlmost a decade ago, the City of New York began the piecemeal installation of elements of a Vision Zero Street. In these example locations, despite the incomplete nature of the street design, the potential for crash prevention is potent. Impressive strides have already been made using only a fraction of the possible solutions. For example:\nIt may be impossible to eliminate human error. However, in a Vision Zero city, errors do not need to result in a crash. By controlling speed and nudging drivers towards safer behavior, injuries and deaths can be avoided. In other words, street designs can protect road users from the consequences of human error, and critically, those changes are cast in concrete. For this reason, Transportation Alternatives recommends that the City of New York adopt the Vision Zero Street Design Standard as the universal standard for all arterial street design.\nBy employing the Vision Zero Street Design Standard, we cement a lasting legacy of safety into our streets. That legacy will encourage more people to walk and ride bikes, make bus service more efficient and enhance the mobility of the elderly and disabled. If the standard is applied universally, the number of preventable crashes will fall to zero, ending the present reality of inequitable streets, deadly in one borough and lifesaving in another.\nVision Zero Street embodies Vision Zero principles, and in all aspects should reduce motor vehicle traffic, increase accessibility and protect the most vulnerable users of the street. To qualify as a Vision Zero Street, a design must achieve three core functions:\nThese abstract ideas are rendered into a practical application in the 10 elements that make up a Vision Zero Street. Scroll down to learn about the different elements of these streets, how they work, and where you can find them in New York City.\nThere are 10 elements that make up a Vision Zero Street, all present in the NYC Department of Transportation Street Design Manual.\nThe City of New York currently applies these elements piecemeal, prioritizing the level of service for car and truck drivers in decisions about whether to include or omit these elements on streets. On some multi-neighborhood arterial streets, elements are installed in one community but not the next. Even contiguous blocks of the same streets will feature varying quality of design.\nThis lack of standardization is inequitable and endangers millions of New Yorkers. When road design constantly changes, it is difficult to normalize safe driving behavior or encourage more people to walk or bike. Furthermore, when safe streets appear as the rare exception rather than the rule, it feeds the perception that better design is unobtainable and impractical. This is not true: the Department of Transportation has a wealth of engineering resources in its Street Design Manual that are possible to implement and have been proven to reduce dangerous driving. Rather, it is a matter of funding. A doubling of the Department of Transportation’s capital budget would allow New York City to feasibly reconstruct all its dangerous arterial roads within 50 years.\nNew York City must also fundamentally shift how it views its streets and allocates space for different modes. A Vision Zero-worthy street will prioritize the highest-capacity modes of transportation, like walking, biking, and using public transit, over the single-occupancy car. Toronto has already codified this hierarchy, and New York City should also adopt such a model in order to normalize safe street design.\nInverted pyramid created by Transportation Alternatives, 2001.1\nConsider the following 10 elements of a Vision Zero Street as parts of a whole: When redesigning a dangerous street, engineers should consider application of the Vision Zero Street Design Standard as a holistic package before considering the application of individual elements. Not every street will necessarily be suitable for all elements, but the decision to omit any of them must only be made if doing so would have no adverse impact on pedestrian or cyclist safety. In particular, space for car parking must never be allowed to take priority over street design elements that save lives.\nDesign sidewalks to meet full ADA compliance and enable pedestrian access by people of all abilities.\nInstall amenities like wayfinding, benches, bus stops and shelters, greenery and bioswales to enhance the public realm.\nInstall Class 1 Protected Bicycle Paths to reduce speeding and protect people on bicycles.\nReduce road lane width to 10 or 10.5 feet to reduce speeding - the driving behavior most likely to injure or kill.\nInstall pedestrian islands of at least five feet on all two-way multi-lane streets to provide safe harbors for people walking. Crosswalks leading to and from them should be high-visibility.\nExpand sidewalks to offer no less than 8 feet of unobstructed width in order to encourage walking and reduce speeding.\nPrioritize mass transit riders and efficient surface transit operations to encourage public transit use.\nGive pedestrians exclusive crossing time to reduce turning conflicts. Consider hardened centerlines and slow-turn wedges to calm turning traffic.\nMake commercial curb regulation business-friendly with dedicated unloading zones, which reduce double-parking and the disruption it causes.\nThe wide, multi-lane, one-way avenues typical to Manhattan, and their narrower counterparts in other boroughs, are suitable for a variety of street safety improvements. Long, straight one-way streets run the risk of becoming “speedways” without the appropriate traffic calming measures. This is one example of what a one-way arterial could look like if it included all elements of a complete street. Not every arterial road will look like this, but this is a starting point for how to envision better, safer design.\nTwo-way arterial roads can be found all across New York City, and at their widest they can resemble small highways in places. Street safety improvements must take into consideration the complexities of tra c turning in multiple directions, and avoid situations where busy roads become barriers to free pedestrian movement. Again, not every arterial road will look exactly like this, but it provides an example of what is possible when the safety of vulnerable road users is prioritized.\nThe proposed redesign of Atlantic Avenue falls well short of the Vision Zero street standard. While curb extensions, reconstructed medians, and changes to left turns are welcome pedestrian safety improvements, no dedicated facilities for cycling or public transit have been provided. Rebuilding crumbling sidewalks and medians are basic maintenance actions, not centerpieces of a flagship project. Opportunities have been missed to use the DOT Street Design Manual as a toolkit for addressing persistent safety issues. These small improvements are not enough to create a true “Vision Zero Great Street.”\nThe ongoing redesign of Queens Boulevard is more ambitious than most New York City projects, but it still misses opportunities to be a true example of Vision Zero design. The protected bike lane on a notoriously dangerous street is a major improvement, but pedestrian-friendly features are somewhat lacking, bus lanes are missing, and more could be done to reduce speeding by design.\nThe operational phase of the Fourth Avenue redesign has been a missed opportunity to make low-cost safety improvements to a dangerous road. Design flaws that encourage speeding and put pedestrians and cyclists at risk remain apparent. While plans for the capital phase are more promising, they are largely focused on cosmetic changes to medians, they fall short of being truly dedicated to Vision Zero principles, and they under-utilize options available in the Street Design Manual.\nA large-scale program of street redesign would present New York City with its best opportunity to achieve its Vision Zero goals. Because unsafe driving is enabled by the design of so many streets as they currently stand, it will be impossible to significantly reduce the number of traffic injuries and deaths without a comprehensive shift in how City streets are both built and understood. A model of street usage that prioritizes high-capacity modes of transportation like walking, biking, and taking public transit over the private car is what must guide this fundamental transformation of the urban road network.\nAt present, the greatest obstacle to street redesign lies in the lack of resources at the New York City DOT. Reconstructing all of the City’s dangerous arterial roads within the Mayor’s Vision Zero time frame would require hundreds of millions of dollars more in capital funding per year above what is currently being spent. In addition, the DOT’s capacity would have to be expanded, particularly in the areas of planning, resurfacing, road marking, signaling, and outreach.\nBut the statistics show the investment is worth making: On arterial roads where even just a few of the elements of a Vision Zero Street have been implemented, the result has been dramatic increases in cyclist volume and substantial improvements in travel times alongside decreases in casualties - a clear sign that streets become safer when they are redesigned. The simple addition of a protected bike lane on Manhattan’s Ninth Avenue led to a 58% reduction in injuries to all street users, while creative street engineering solutions elsewhere in the city have shown injury decreases of 21%-67%1. In addition, relatively inexpensive treatments can be quickly implemented through the DOT’s operating budget, significantly improving safety while those streets wait for a complete reconstruction. If the DOT had the resources to make Vision Zero-worthy streets the rule rather than the rare exception, then their safety impacts would be normalized and their benefits available to all New Yorkers. It is, simply put, a matter of life and death."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:36374015-4154-43be-b2d9-f5b3a8250920>","<urn:uuid:66a85885-ac8a-4bde-8169-556b756459e7>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I spend long hours both cycling and working at a desk - what are the postural implications for my lower back, y cuáles son las mejores técnicas preventivas for both activities?","answer":"Working at a desk and cycling both involve prolonged flexed positions that can strain the lower back. The postural implications include potential obliteration of cervical lordosis, thoracic kyphosis development, and overall shortened vertebral height. To prevent issues, focus on proper positioning both on and off the bike: ensure correct saddle height to maintain neutral spine position, and use a McKenzie roll at your desk for lumber support. Core strengthening is essential as it provides a stable base for both activities. Additionally, consider postural alignment exercises like cervical and scapular retraction, and be mindful of other flexed positions throughout your day like driving or slouched sitting. These preventive measures help maintain proper posture and reduce the risk of back pain and associated complications.","context":["Forward Head Posture\nPosture is the position assumed by the body either with support during muscular inactivity, or by means of the coordinated action of many muscles working (i.e. during muscular activity) to maintain stability or to form an essential basis which is being adapted constantly to the movement which is superimposed upon it. In an ideal erect posture, the body segments are aligned so that the torques and stresses are minimised and standing can be made with minimum energy expenditure.\nForward Head Posture\nA forward head posture (FHP) or poking chin involves increased flexion of lower cervical vertebrae and the upper thoracic regions, increased extensions of upper cervical vertebrae and extension of the occiput on C1.  The FHP is considered to co-exist with hyper-extension of the upper cervical spine, flattening of lower cervical spine, rounding of upper back, and elevation and protraction of shoulders. FHP may result in craniofascial pain, headache, neck ache and shoulder pain together with decreased range of cervical motion, muscle stiffness and tenderness.\nIn FHP, the head shifts anteriorly from the line of gravity, the scapulae may rotate medially, a thoracic kyphosis may develop and overall vertebral height may be shortened. The features are as follows: there is an obliteration of the cervical lordosis and a compensatory tilting back of the head at the Atlanto-occipital joint. In the posterior cervical muscles there is stretching and weakness of Semispinalis cervicis and overaction with ultimate shortening of Semispinalis capitis. The corresponding flexor muscles in front, namely, Longus cervicis and Longus capitis shorten and lengthen respectively.\n- Effect of gravity: slouching, poor ergonomic alignment.\n- Occupational posture: forward or backward leaning of head for long durations, slouched or relaxed sitting, faulty sitting posture while using computer or screen.\n- Result of other faulty posture like pelvic and lumber spine posture.\n- Sleeping with head elevated too high.\n- Texting posture maintained for long durations.\n- Lack of development of back muscle strength.\nSource of Symptoms\n- Anterior location of line of gravity (LOG) causes an increase in flexion (forward head), which requires constant isometric muscle contraction to support head which may result in ischaemia and pain.\n- Stretch of suprahyoid muscles pull mandible posteriorly into retrusion which my result in temporomandibular joint pain and associated fascial tension.\n- Narrowing of the intervertebral foramina in lordotic areas of cervical region, which may impinge on the blood vessels and nerve roots, especially if there are degenerative changes.\n- Abnormal compression on the posterior zygapophyseal joints and posterior portions of the intervertebral discs.Anterior longitudinal ligament in upper cervical spine and Posterior longitudinal ligament in lower cervical spine.\n- Muscle ischaemia, pain and fatigue\n- Decreased range of motion of cervical spine\n- Early disc degeneration and osteophyte formation\n- Temporomandibular joint pain and inflammation\n- Tension Headache\n- Increase in dorsal kyphosis and decrease in height\n- Decrease in vital capacity and range of motion of shoulder and arm\n- Possible protrusion of nucleus pulposus and nerve compression\nPotential Muscle Impairments\n- Mobility impairment in the muscles of the anterior thorax (intercostal muscles), muscles of the upper extremity originating on the thorax (Pectoralis major and minor, Latissimus dorsi, Serratus anterior), muscles of the cervical spine and head that attached to the scapula and upper thorax (Levator scapulae, Sternocleidomastoid, Scalene, upper Trapezius), and muscles of the suboccipital region (Rectus capitis posterior major and minor, Obliquus capitis inferior and superior).\n- Impaired muscle performance due to stretched and weak lower cervical and upper thoracic erector spinae and scapular retractor muscles (Rhomboids, middle Trapezius), anterior throat muscles (suprahyoid and infrahyoid muscles), and capital flexors (Rectus capitis anterior and lateralis, superior oblique Longus colli, Longus capitis).\n- With temporomandibular joint symptoms, the muscles of mastication may have increased tension (Pterygoid, Masseter, temporalis muscles).\nObservational postural analysis involves locating the body segments in relation to LOG (representative by plumb line). In an anterior or posterior analysis, the LOG should bisect the body into two symmetrical halves. In a lateral analysis, the LOG should passes anterior to the head, vertebral column, or joints of the lower extremities.\n- To Decrease Pain:\n- Pain management advice\n- Postural Alignment, Balance and Gait:\n- Cervical Retraction\n- Scapular Retraction\n- Balance Training ( If dysfunction presents)\n- Range of Motion, Joint Mobility and Flexibility\n- Cervical Range of Motion Exercises\n- Shoulder Range of Motion Exercises\n- Cervical Traction\n- Stretching Exercises of tight structures- Trapezius, Scalenes, SCM, Pectoralis Major and Minor.\n- To reduce spasm\n- Myofacial release\n- Ischemic Compression\n- Positional release technique (to relieve tension headaches)\n- Muscle Strength and Endurance\n- Cervical isometric strengthening exercises (initial phase) progressing to isotonic and dynamic strengtening exercises.\n- Strengthening exercises for scapular retractors (Rhomboids, middle Trapezius).\n- Ergonomic Advice\n- ]Correct the number of pillows used\n- Postural corrections.\n- Gardiner MD.

On top of that, most of us have jobs that require sitting at a desk in front of a computer, making lower back pain one of the most common injuries cyclists suffer.\nBack pain can lead to a whole other set of issues due to altered biomechanics, which can lead to strained muscles, piriformis syndrome, and sciatica symptoms.\nHow to prevent it: It’s important to problem-solve your condition to decrease pain quickly and prevent reoccurrence. Key things to analyze are:\nPosition on the bike: Is your saddle the right height? One that’s too low or high can aggravate low back pain. Be sure the rest of the bike’s anatomy fits you so your spine is as neutral as possible and not excessively rounded.\nPosition off the bike: If you work at a desk, think about your posture. It’s worth investing in a Mckenzie roll (a cylindrical pillow that supports your lower back and helps maintain good posture). Be careful of other flexed positions throughout your day: driving, picking up children (or any weight) with a rounded back, or sitting slumped on a comfortable couch.\nCore strength & breathing: If your core muscles are not strong enough and working together, your lower back musculature and spinal anatomy will not be happy. Working on your core strength and breathing not only will protect your lower back, but also will make you a more powerful rider, as your legs will push the pedals from a more stable base.\nAssessing root causes, treating the symptoms and strengthening the surrounding muscles: Overcoming cycle-related knee pain\nMany take up cycling to ease pain in their knees since the sport is considered “low impact.” Cycling doesn’t always entirely relieve this pain, however, and faulty mechanics or bike fit can make knee pain worse. Common knee problems include: patellofemoral joint syndrome, IT band syndrome, bursitis, or meniscus issues.\nHow to prevent it:\nTreating the knee first involves addressing the “what” (i.e. what’s causing the knee pain itself). This includes stretching, kinesio taping, foam rolling, and the use of ice or anti-inflammatories to help calm it down. Once it’s calmed down, it is imperative to figure out the “why” and get to the bottom of the problem.\nKnee pain often stems from a bike fit issue. If this is the case, there are easy things to look out for. Pain at the front of the knee, called anterior knee pain, often comes from a saddle that is too low, which places excessive pressure on the kneecap. Pain behind the knee (called “posterior knee pain”) commonly occurs when a saddle is too high, which stretches the distal hamstring attachments. Pain on the outside or inside of the knee can be caused by incorrect cleat set up and faulty knee tracking.\nKnee pain is often considered a functional issue and often times is due to weakness around the hips or faulty ankle mechanics. Without strong glutes, the body will do what’s easiest, not what’s best. Other muscles like the piriformis or the tensor fascia latae and IT band take over which ends up getting tight and painful due to taking on more of the work.\nAlign your neck and spine to beat neck pain\nThe average human head weighs about 10 pounds. Add in a helmet and some eyewear and that’s a lot of weight your body must absorb. For every half inch the head juts out in front of our body, the effective (or felt) weight of our head doubles. All of the sudden we’re trying to absorb 50-60 pounds of head weight on the bike. This can lead to neck pain and upper back tightness and strain.\nHow to prevent it:\nAssuming your bike size is correct, your neck and spine should be comfortably aligned on the bike. You should look up the road with your eyes, not by cranking your neck to lift your entire head, which stresses your neck.\nAddress the ergonomics of your workstation. Improper set-up can lead to tight muscles and trigger points. Once in the saddle, these will worsen as those tight muscles absorb the impact of the bumps in the road. Prevent the tightness by massaging out those knots using a lacrosse ball on a wall. Mobilize your thoracic spine with a foam roller to release your upper back, a common tight area for cyclists. Another great exercise to perform to combat that forward head position is a cervical retraction."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:230a392d-847f-4114-b32d-5c6b6fef061e>","<urn:uuid:1cc69c10-f830-4dd2-bda4-9cfbf34dd33e>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the recommended cleaning methods for wooden furniture, and what products should be avoided when maintaining it?","answer":"For wooden furniture, cleaning can be done using warm water with mild dish soap, avoiding soaking the wood. A soft cloth or towel should be used for wiping, and an old toothbrush can help remove stubborn dirt. For protection, a thin coating of high-quality soft paste wax can be applied and polished for a durable shine. However, it's important to avoid wax polishes as they can build up over time, attracting dirt and potentially softening the finish. Silicone polishes should also be avoided as they seep into lacquered finishes and make future refinishing difficult. Additionally, saddle soaps, oils, all-purpose cleaners, and solvents should not be used as they can damage the finish. Modern tanning techniques don't require such products.","context":["Furniture is the most important part of our lives and our houses. Some of these are used on a daily basis and some are used occasionally. But, no matter how frequently we use, it is very important to handle them with care and must maintain them properly so that they can last for a longer duration. After all, you pay a good amount of money while purchasing, thus, you must try to keep it well maintained to avoid any damage to your furniture.\nBefore explaining what all is required to maintain your furniture, it is important to understand the factors that can cause damage to these items.\nFactors Responsible For Damages\n- One of the common factors that can affect your furniture is lighting. Light can actually cause discoloration and fading. Usually, the color coatings can degrade because of bright lights. These can be a permanent damage irrespective of the material whether it is wooden, leather or upholstery textiles.\n- Another environmental factor which can cause damage is relative humidity. With humidity rising or falling, furniture made of wood tends to absorb water which can cause swelling or desorbed water causing shrinking of the furniture. In fact, it can expand or contract unevenly. Such fluctuations in humidity can distort your furniture and you might face issues regarding fittings too. Even the coatings can deteriorate.\n- You must keep a check on insects too because insects can spoil your furniture within a short span. Insects like ants, termites, powder post beetle or carpenter bees can cause severe damages to your furniture.\n- Even rodents can cause deterioration of the furniture.\n- Even dust can spoil the entire look of the furniture items.\nHow to Maintain Your Furniture\n- If you have wooden furniture then you can clean it by using warm water with some mild dish soap. Make sure that you do not soak it else water is absolutely fine for cleaning the furniture. You can wipe off the surface using a towel or a soft cloth.\n- Also, you can use an old toothbrush for removing the dirt which is tough to clean with a cloth. For any stain, it is better to clean immediately so that it requires less effort to remove it.\n- High-Quality soft paste wax can be used to protect the furniture after it is cleaned properly. This is applied as a thin coating layer and after a few minutes, with a soft brush, it needs to be polished lightly. After half an hour, polish it again. This will result in a beautiful shine which will be durable enough for the next few months.\n- Since already mentioned above that light can also cause discoloration. Thus, try to avoid keeping your furniture directly under sunlight. During summers, even the sun rays coming through a window can also have high intensity.\n- You would have often noticed a white hazy spot created from the teacup or if you place a box of hot pizza on the table. This can be removed by rubbing some mild abrasive on it. Abrasive such as baking soda mixed with non-gel toothpaste or ashes and cooking oil mixed together can be used to rub such white spots with the help of fingers or with a soft cloth.\n- Even with the help of a vacuum cleaner, dust can be removed from settling on your couch or table. Dusting is very essential and you must clean the dust on a daily basis or at least 2-3 times in a week. A feather duster can also be helpful in cleaning a large surface area.\n- For preventing insects such as termites from destructing your furniture, you can use medicinal treatments available. Some of the things like lime juice, vinegar, olive oil or linseed oil that are easily available at home can also be used to clean furniture. This can save you some money and also you can have shining furniture.\n- In case, if you have leather furniture, then you must be very careful as leathers are very vulnerable to grease, dust, dirt, perspiration, smoke, etc. This can destroy the leather and discolor it. And if its maintenance is neglected then these toxins can affect the quality of the leather fibers. It will lose its flexibility as well as cracks will appear. This will make the leather hard.","Different types of leather require different care and maintenance product. If you are uncertain about the type of leather you have, check with your sales representative or contact one of the designers at our South Side or Strip District locations. As a general rule of thumb, pretest all of the care products in a hidden area to make sure they are compatible with leather.\nGeneral Leather Care Tips\n- Avoid using or placing sharp objects on leather goods. Leather is very durable but it is not accident or damage proof.\n- Place your furniture a minimum of two feet from radiators and other heat sources.\n- Protect your leather furniture from direct and even indirect sunlight. Some leathers, such as full and semi-aniline, will fade over time.\n- Avoid air pollution such as cigar or cigarette smoke and cooking fumes, which can cause leather to fade or change color.\nLeather Cleaning Instructions\n- Pretest all of the care products in a hidden area to make sure that they are compatible with the leather.\n- Water-based spills and stains such as coffee, ketchup, milk, etc may require the Uniters Leather Cleaner.\n- For oil-based spills and stains such as popcorn grease, salad dressing, or other non-water soluble spills, wipe the leather clean with a clean, dry cloth. Allow for the remainder of the stain to dissipate into the leather over a hour period. Do not use Leather Cleaner, Leather Protectors/Conditioner, water or soaps on oil-based stains.\n- Never use saddle soaps, oils, and all purpose cleaners or solvents. Use of these products could damage the finish. Modern tanning techniques do not require such products. Most spills will blot up easily with a dry cloth or paper towel.\nGeneral Wood Care Tips\nWood furniture represents a significant investment in many homes. To maintain its beauty and help it last, wood furniture needs regular and proper care. Most wood furniture is finished with a fine lacquer or varnish. It has a sheen – or gloss- ranging from high to low, depending on the finishing materials the manufacturer has selected. The finish adds to the beauty of the wood and protects it. No finish is totally indestructible, but with regular care it will last much longer, providing years of satisfaction and enjoyment.\n- Dust frequently.\n- Use a quality furniture polish. It will lessen your chance of expensive refinishing jobs. Polish approximately once a month.\n- Clean up sills immediately. Use a blotting action rather than a wiping action.\n- Use a soft, lint-free absorbent cloth for cleaning and polishing.\n- Avoid placing furniture in direct sunlight, as sunlight causes fading.\n- Avoid extremes in room humidity. Too high or too low humidity can cause wood to warp or the glue lines to fail.\n- Avoid extreme changes in temperature. Arrange furniture away from radiators, registers, and air-conditioning units.\n- Rotate accessories on furniture so they do not sit in the same spot all of the time\n- Avoid placing plastic or rubber objects on a wood finish, as their ingredients react with those of the finish.\n- Use pads, cloth, or felt to protect the furniture surface from plastic, rubber, hot dishes, beverages, bookends, flowerpots, and vases.\n- Use a protective pad when writing with a ballpoint pen.\n- Lift and place objects, do not drag them across the furniture surface.\n- Make minor repairs while they are still small.\n- Use the proper materials or professional help to repair badly damaged surfaces.\n- Avoid wax polishes. Regular use of wax polishes may result in the build of wax film on the surface of the furniture. This build-up may then pick up dirt, smoke, and other pollutants in the air, which may result in smudges and streaks. Used long enough, this may cause the finish to soften, requiring expensive refinishing work. Wax build up over time hardens, making it difficult to remove from the furniture’s finish.\n- Avoid silicone polishes. Silicone oil is an ingredient used by many furniture polish makers to create a high degree of shines. Silicone seeps into even the most lacquered finishes, making it difficult to remove. Should it become necessary to refinish a piece of furniture, silicone makes it a very difficult process, even for a professional. Most furniture manufacturers recommend using a polish that does not contain silicone.\nWood Cleaning Instructions\n- Wood furniture should be dusted as often as needed. Dust cloths can be reused by hand washing up to five times. It is also more efficient and convenient that spray products. Feather dusters scatter the dust particles into the air, which then resettle back on your furniture.\n- Polishing is recommended about once a month. If your furniture is used often, you may want to increase the frequency. However, be aware that over-polishing is the main cause of damaged finishes. Use a soft, lint free absorbent cloth and work with the grain of the wood. Always follow the provided directions.\n- If you do not remove old wax and polish before reapplying furniture polish, you may leave a cloudy surface\nMattress Care Tips\n- Turn and rotate a new mattress every few weeks to help smooth out contours. After a few months, turn and rotate your mattress twice a year to help equalize the wear and tear that normally occurs. Also remember to rotate your foundation as well.\n- Avoid using the handles to support the full weight of the mattress. Typically, handles are designed to help you position the mattress over the foundation. If used improperly, handles may pull out and damage the fabric.\n- Vacuum your mattress and foundation for general maintenance. Use a mattress pad to help keep the sleep set free from stains.\nGeneral Fabric Care Tips\n- Re-arrange the furniture occasionally to ensure even use of the cushions and wear areas. Reverse loose cushions weekly. Vacuum often to remove grit that can cause abrasion.\n- Caution those wearing clothing with transferable dyes, such as blue jeans, that the dye could transfer onto light-colored furniture.\n- Protect fabrics from the sun. Ultraviolet light will cause fiber degeneration and color fade. Fabrics should not be placed in direct sunlight, as this may cause fading.\n- Occasionally, dyes can fade from impurities within the air.\nKeep pets off the furniture. Pet urine and pet body oil can be difficult to remove. Use proper care with structural weave fabrics to protect against snags.\nFabric Cleaning Codes\n- Before attempting to clean a spill or spot on your furniture you should identify the fabric and correct cleaning method recommended by the manufacturer.This information is represented by a cleaning code (W, S, WS, or X) often found under a cushion, on the bottom of the furniture or on the manufacturer’s tag. If you cannot find this information, contact your sales representative at the furniture store where the item was purchased.\n“W” : Spot clean with water-based cleaner.\n“S” : Spot clean ONLY with mild water-free solvent cleaner.\n“WS” : Spot clean with water based or solvent cleaner.\n“X” : Clean only by vacuuming or light brushing.\nFabric Cleaning Instructions\nAs a general rule, when a spill occurs, it is important to clean the fabric immediately. The long the spot remains, the harder it is to remove; it may even become permanent. If you have cleaning directions from the furniture manufacturer, follow those. If none are available, use the instructions provided here.\n- Gently scrape away any excess solid matter or liquid using a dull edge spoon.\n- Pretest the cleaner you intent to use in a hidden area for color loss and fabric compatibility. Look for faded colors, shrinkage or dark rings; these are signs of incompatibility.\n- If possible, place a clean white cloth under the area to be cleaned, such as the inside of a seat cushion. It will absorb the soil and produce better results.\n- Apply a small amount of cleaner to a soft, clean white cloth. Begin at the edge of the stain and work toward the center, turning the cloth often. Blot, don’t rub the stain as rubbing can roughen the delicate fibers and leave the fabric looking worn and faded.\n- After cleaning, “feather” the edges of the spot by brushing gently back and forth with a dry cloth. Quickly dry with a fan. This will help prevent ringing.\n- Keep a small stain small! A cotton swab, dipped into the proper cleaning solution and squeezed out, will wick up the dissolved it, stopping it from spreading (this is a good fix for small ballpoint ink marks).\n- If your first attempt does not remove the spot, you may want to repeat steps three through five a second time.\nRug Care And Cleaning Tips\n- All wool rugs will shed. Shedding will subside over time, depending on traffic and wear. It typically takes 20-25 vacuums, at a minimum, to curtail shedding. Some will shed for the lifetime for the rug.\n- Loose fibers or “sprouts,” are a normal part of the break-in process of handmade rugs. To remove sprouts, use a small pair of scissors to snip them off even with the pile. Do not pull the fiber out, as this can cause a deterioration of the backing.\n- If your rug has been rolled or folded for shipping, it may include creases. Creases should disappear within a week or two once the rug is laid out flat. Reverse rolling the rug overnight will help.\n- Odors are caused by dyes, yarns and shipping for long distances in a sealed wrap. Most odors dissipate within a week once the rug is removed from the shipping wrap.\nIf exposed to direct sunlight, rug colors typically fade over time, even if they are fade resistant.\n- As a general rule, rugs of all materials and constructions should be rotated every 3-6 months to balance color and evenly distribute wear."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:e411ce25-bb4f-48e8-96dd-0caeb2c551c7>","<urn:uuid:8abc4e95-4e5a-4b2d-94e6-8bf7e2934cb1>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What vegetables grow good in alkaline soil conditions, and which companion plants help protect them from pests?","answer":"Members of the brassica family (cabbage, broccoli, kale) grow well in alkaline soil, and a mildly alkaline environment can actually help prevent diseases like 'club root'. For pest protection, these vegetables benefit from companion planting with marigolds, rosemary, mint, thyme, and chamomile. However, they should be planted separately from other cabbage family members as they may compete for nutrients and attract the same pests.","context":["To help you decide what to grow in your garden, we’ve put together this list of the 40 best plants to grow in alkaline soil. If you have alkaline soil in your backyard, this should form a starting point to help you decide which are the best plants for your garden.\nDo I Have Alkaline Soil?\nBefore you begin to choose plants for your garden, it is important to make sure that you know what kind of soil you actually have.\nFirst of all, before you delve a little deeper to discover the pH of your soil, it can be helpful to know what type of soil you are dealing with. Your soil may be:\n- chalky soil\n- sandy soil\n- silty soil\n- clay soil\n- peat soil\nOr you may have a soil that is a mixture of two or more of the above. A perfect loam is a mixed soil that is ideal for growing the widest range of plants. Chalky soils, and some clay soils, can tend towards a problem with alkalinity.\nIf you have a naturally chalky soil, you may see white lumps of limestone or calcium carbonate material in your garden beds. This can be a dead giveaway that you are dealing with alkaline soil. However, the pH of your soil is not usually something that can be detected by eye.\nYou can test the pH of your garden soil using a tester kit, which can be bought at a number of retailers or found online.\nIf your pH is between 7.1 and 8.0 then you are dealing with an alkaline soil.\nPH tester kits are relatively inexpensive – but if you suspect you have alkaline soil, there is another neat trick you can try. Take some of your soil and place it into a jar of vinegar. If it froths up, it is high in lime and alkaline in nature.\nIf you are still in doubt, you may also be able to glean clues about the pH of your soil by looking at the plants that grow naturally in the surrounding environment, or plants that do well in your neighbor’s gardens. You may also be able to find information about the soil type and pH in your area by looking up the information online.\nWhat Causes Alkaline Soil?\nAlkaline soil can be natural, caused by the natural weathering of natural minerals calcium carbonate and calcium bicarbonate in the ground but alkaline soil can also have a range of man-made causes.\nMan-Made Causes of Alkaline Soil\nFor example, it may be caused by:\n- Pollution from coal-fires and coal power plants.\n- Pollution from sodium salts used in many household cleaning products.\n- Pollution from wet cooling towers which use seawater to dissipate waste heat in factories located close to the coast.\n- Water that is treated to soften it being used to irrigate the soil. (Mains water that has been softened contains a relatively much higher proportion of sodium bicarbonates and less calcium and magnesium.)\nWhether the cause is natural or man-made, it is important to take the pH of your soil into account when planning your planting scheme. Alkaline soils can occur anywhere, but are more common in hot places with lower rainfall, where salts and other chemicals are more likely to accumulate.\nThe Pros and Cons of Alkaline Soil\nLike any soil type, and soil of any pH, alkaline soil can have both strengths and weaknesses.\nOn the plus side, an alkaline soil can:\n- Make it possible to grow certain plants that will not thrive in acidic soil.\n- Be less prone to soil-borne diseases, due to the lower level of microbial action than in more rich, moist, more biologically active soils.\nOn the other hand, alkaline soil can also have its disadvantages. It can:\n- Mean that it will be challenging to grow ericaceous (acid loving) plants.\n- Make nutrients needed for plant growth, such as phosphorus, iron and manganese less readily available, especially if the alkalinity is extreme.\nShould I Amend My Alkaline Soil?\nGenerally speaking, unless your soil is extremely alkaline, it is best to work with what you have. This means that rather than amending the soil pH, which can be a rather drastic measure, it is usually best to simply accept the limitations and grow plants suited to where you live.\nMildly alkaline soil can actually be an advantage, and so amending this soil is not usually the best option. Rather, think about the other challenges posed by your soil type (such as poor nutrient retention or water retention). Think about how these, rather than pH, can be overcome. Often,the best way to improve your soil is by improving its structure and fertility with the judicious application of organic matter. Adding organic matter will slowly and gently lower pH subtly over time.\nSometimes, however, extremely alkaline soil may need to be amended. It can be amended with the addition of large amounts of acidifying organic material. For example, this can be achieved with a heavy mulch of pine needles.\nAdding amendments such as aluminium sulfate, diammonium phosphate, ferric sulfate, ammonium nitrate or sulfur is not recommended in an organic garden.\n40 Trees, Shrubs, Edibles & Flowers That Grow In Alkaline Soil\nWhile it is by no means a comprehensive list, the below list should help you find trees, shrubs, edibles and flowers that can cope with, thrive in or overcome the challenges that come with an alkaline soil pH.\nBest Trees for Alkaline Soil\nWhen planning a garden, it is often best to start with the largest plants. Trees, large and small, can be accommodated in almost any backyard. It is with the trees, then, that you should begin. A planting scheme for an alkaline soil garden might include:\n- Cotoneaster Frigida\n- Field Maple\n- Holm Oak\n- Montezuma Pine\n- Sorbus alnifolia\n- Strawberry Tree\nMost traditional garden fruit trees prefer a slightly acidic soil environment. However, if you have a slightly alkaline soil it is worth noting that fig trees and cherry trees are amongst the trees that can best handle those conditions.\nAnother thing to consider is that it is best to source your trees from a local plant nursery, where the specimens are more likely to be suited to the soil conditions where you live, and will be grafted onto rootstocks suited to a more alkaline environment.\nBest Shrubs for Alkaline Soil\nShrubs and bushes are ideal for creating edge beds and borders. They can also be used to create layers of planting beneath your chosen trees. Good shrub choices for an area with alkaline soil might include:\n- Deutzia ‘Pride of Rochester’\n- Santolina chamaecyparissus\n- Viburnum opulus\nBest Edible Plants for Alkaline Soil\nThe limitations of an alkaline soil can make it a challenge to grow certain fruits and vegetables, many of which will do best in a neutral or slightly acidic soil. However, members of the brassica family, legumes and arid-climate herbs can all do well in a slightly alkaline environment.\nA mildly alkaline soil environment can be an advantage for members of the cabbage family, for example, because it makes it less likely that you will develop problems with diseases like ‘club root’.\nSome of the best edible plants to try in alkaline growing areas are:\n- Broccoli/Brussels Sprouts\n- Kale/ Collard Greens\n- Pole Beans\nBest Flowers for Alkaline Soil\nOnce you have established structure in your garden with trees and shrubs, and considered how you can make full use of your garden by growing edible crops, it is time to think about the lower layers of your garden.\nFlowers in the herbaceous layer have a huge impact on the visual appearance of your garden. But flowers are not only good for human beings. Flowers are also very important for garden wildlife. They can help attract pollinators and other beneficial insects.\nSome good flowers for alkaline soil are:\n- California Poppies\n- Lily of the Valley\n- Trifolium (Clovers)\n- Viper’s Bugloss\n- Wild Marjoram\nThinking carefully about your soil, its pH and other characteristics, can help you create a realistic and successful planting scheme for your garden.\nThe above list should have given you a reasonable jumping off point, which will allow you to do some more of your own research and find the very best plants for your particular alkaline soil garden.","Spring is the time to plant vegetables and herbs, and here at Evergreen Nursery we always have lots of variety to choose from. For the average home gardener wanting to plant several types of vegetables in relatively small areas, it’s helpful to know what plants work well together – and which plants don’t. Here are a few tips to keep this year’s vegetable selection in good company.\nBenefits of Companion Planting\nCompanion planting is the selection of plants that benefit one or both plants when planted alongside each other. One plant might repel insects, provide support or shade, or improve soil conditions for another plant. It’s also a great way to maximize garden space and allow more variety in your harvest. By providing a variety of plants that benefit each other, companion planting creates diversity in your garden that can help prevent cycles of pests and diseases from taking hold.\nFor example, tomatoes benefit from having basil and marigolds planted nearby because these plants help repel certain pests. However, tomato plant growth can be stunted when grown in the same bed with cabbage. Knowing which plants to plant together will help promote soil health by creating a diverse environment that helps prevent pest infestations or depletion of nutrients and improves plant growth.\nCompanion Planting: What to Plant with What?\nThe exact reasons some plants seem to benefit others while some inhibit growth is not always known. This can make it tricky to figure out which plants will get along. Don’t worry about getting bogged down with too much information. It’s not always necessary to know the whys of which plants are friends and which are foes – but it is helpful to know whether they’ll get along well if planted in the same bed. The chart below gives guidelines for many popular herbs and vegetables for the home garden (we’ve also included marigolds, which make good pest-deterring companion plants for many vegetables). The last column gives a few examples of how plants may be helped or hindered by other plants.\nVegetable Companion Chart\n|Vegetable Type||Plant With...||Avoid Planting With...||Notes|\n|Asparagus||Tomatoes, Peppers, Lettuce, Basil, Parsley, Marigolds||Onions, Garlic||Asparagus and onions/garlic may compete for the same nutrients.|\n|Beans||Cabbages, Carrots, Celery, Peas, Lettuce, Strawberries, Turnips, Parsley, Zucchini/Summer Squash||Onions, Garlic, Peppers||Beans make soil rich in nitrogen, a necessary nutrient, by a process called nitrogen fixing; onions and garlic inhibit nitrogen fixing by killing beneficial root bacteria on beans.|\n|Cabbage Family*||Beans, Celery, Marigolds, Rosemary, Mint, Thyme, Chamomile||Onions, Garlic, Strawberries, Rue, Peppers, Tomatoes||Plant different cabbage family members separately, as they may compete for the same nutrients and/or attract the same pests.|\n|Carrots||Beans, Leeks, Lettuce, Onions, Garlic, Peas, Peppers, Tomatoes, Turnips, Parsley||Dill, Coriander, Parsnips||Onions help repel carrot rust fly; tomatoes provide shade for heat sensitive carrots.|\n|Celery||Beans, Cabbages, Tomatoes, Onions, Leeks||Carrots, Parsley||Taller plants help shade young celery shoots; celery repels cabbage white butterfly from cabbage plants.|\n|Leeks||Carrots, Celery, Onions, Turnips||Beans, Peas||Carrots and leeks repel each other’s common pests.|\n|Lettuce||Asparagus, Carrots, Strawberries, Peppers, Beans, Garlic, Onions, Radishes, Mint, Marigolds, Potatoes||Parsley, Cabbages||Onions and garlic repel aphids; the texture of radishes is improved when planted near lettuce.|\n|Onions and Garlic||Carrots, Celery, Lettuce, Cabbages||Asparagus, Beans, Parsley, Peas, Turnips||Onions and garlic emit a chemical (ajoene) that inhibits growth in beans, peas and turnips and interferes with nitrogen fixing.|\n|Peas||Beans, Carrots, Turnips, Marigolds||Onions, Garlic||Like beans, peas are natural nitrogen fixers.|\n|Peppers||Asparagus, Basil, Carrots, Cucumbers, Eggplant, Lettuce, Oregano, Parsley, Rosemary, Basil, Squash, Swiss Chard, and Tomatoes||Beans, Cabbages, Fennel||Basil boosts flavor of peppers and repels common pests; leafy plants like lettuces and carrots help inhibit weed growth.|\n|Potatoes||Beans, Strawberries, Lettuce, Marigolds, Basil, Parsley||Tomatoes, Rosemary, Mint, Thyme, Chamomile||Basil and Parsley attract beneficial insects; potatoes and tomatoes are susceptible to the same diseases.|\n|Strawberries||Beans, Lettuce||Cabbages||Cabbages attract pests that will harm strawberries.|\n|Tomatoes||Asparagus, Carrots, Celery, Parsley, Peppers, Marigolds, Basil||Potatoes, Cabbages, Fennel, Dill, Rosemary, Peas||Marigolds and basil help keep parasitic nematodes and hornworms away from tomatoes.|\n|Turnips||Beans, Carrots, Leeks, Parsley||Onions and Garlic||Turnips are natural aphid repellents.|\n|Zucchini/Summer Squash||Beans, Dill, Oregano, Parsley, Peppers, Radishes||Potatoes, Pumpkin||Beans provide nitrogen squash needs; radishes deter squash vine borers and beetles.|\n*Cabbage Family includes: arugula, bok choy, brown mustard, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, collard, kale, kohlrabi, Napa cabbage, and rutabaga."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:d5888e51-adba-42a5-baff-330ee3b02f1c>","<urn:uuid:69715edf-b48f-4a19-868b-c4e5edb69014>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do social construction views of scientific objects relate to quantum technology development, and what practical implications does this have for quantum computing advancement?","answer":"While some scholars like Pickering argue that scientific objects like quarks are socially constructed and that we could have developed physics differently, this view is challenged by the fact that these objects reflect real phenomena that exist independently of our theories. The physical reality behind scientific theories manifests in unexplained properties that require further research. This theoretical foundation has practical implications for quantum technology development, where researchers are actively working to create functional quantum computers. These machines would operate using quantum mechanical principles to process information in qubits that can exist in multiple states simultaneously, unlike classical binary computing. This practical development demonstrates how theoretical understanding leads to concrete technological advancement, even if our knowledge of the underlying phenomena remains incomplete.","context":["Author Information: Elena Trufanova, Institute of Philosophy, Russian Academy of Sciences, email@example.com\nTrufanova, Elena. “A Reply to ‘The Destiny of Atomism in the Modern Science and the Structural Realism’.” Social Epistemology Review and Reply Collective 6, no. 3 (2016): 62-65.\nPlease refer to:\n- Mamchur, Elena. “The Destiny of Atomism in the Modern Science and the Structural Realism.” Social Epistemology 31, no. 1 (2017): 93-104.\nImage credit: Cezary Borysiuk, via flickr\nThe idea of atoms as “basic” elements of matter is one of the classical “thematic structures” as it was put by Holton (1988)—the ever-recurring idea that was present in human thought since ancient Greeks and Indians, disappearing for a while then coming back again. I have always seen Democritus’ atomism as a genius insight ahead of its time. This really shows how science does not always need to be empirical to be productive in the ways of explaining the world. Professor Mamchur warns after Heisenberg against interpreting Greek atomism as an origin of the modern science atomism, however the fact remains: even if the modern scientists do formulate new notion of atoms, they still come back in time in looking for the name itself to the ancient Greeks.\nNowadays atoms, as well as their parts—the particles that we now call elementary (and that can be found out to be not so elementary in a while)—are often referred to as examples of “socially constructed” elements of the modern science. Their very existence is questioned, mostly due to their “unobservable” nature. The main problem is indeed not the question of the atoms in particular, but the question of reality of the scientific objects in general. The unobservables are just a very good example because it is very easy to suggest that such things do not exist. This is in fact a typical naïve realism stance—I do not see or feel them hence they are not real.\nHowever, as I teach my students and explain to them what the objective existence of matter means, I always give them the following example: we don’t feel the radioactive particles “piercing” our body, but our body starts to break apart nonetheless if the radiation level is high enough. That is if something is not given or is not accessible to our perception, it doesn’t mean we don’t have proof for its existence. We may try convincing ourselves that radiation is socially constructed, that what we call our scientific knowledge about radiation is totally wrong and has nothing to do with reality, but still there is some real phenomena behind the word “radioactivity” and the warning yellow-black sign—and this reality can hit us really hard.\nAtoms, Quarks and Social Construction\nProfessor Mamchur starts her paper (2017) with considering the idea of linguistic origin of the atomistic idea which suggests that the idea of atoms comes from the alphabetic structure of Indo-European languages. She is not much convinced by this idea, though it could have added some wood to the flame in the so-called “science wars”. Atoms have since the ancient Greeks lost the status of the indivisible and basic elements, of the last bricks of matter, but we have quarks and gluons and elementary particles instead that have taken their place. Do we have them for real? Pickering (1999) says nay, we have just “constructed” them for our purposes. Pickering’s work became an easy target because the common sense cries to us—come on, for Heaven’s sake!—we know for sure that physics describe matter and matter is composed of atoms and their nuclei are built of quarks. What is more real than physical matter? How can quarks then be socially constructed?\nAccording to Pickering, we have constructed the theory of matter that presupposes the idea of quarks. We could have constructed theory of matter differently, says Pickering, and thus our science could have been developing in the non-quark trend.\nIt is very easy to criticize this point of view without even giving it a second thought: the very idea that the structural elements of matter can be socially constructed seems ridiculous. But that is not exactly what Pickering meant. What he meant is: we do not know the physical reality behind our theories. This is the main challenge for the scientific realism in all its different varieties. This is what “science wars” was about—when we speak about the social processes or mental states most of us will agree that we can allow them to be considered as socially constructed, but the “solid” physical reality, as many would say, should be spared from the constructionist blow.\nI am sympathetic with Hacking’s theory of “experimental” realism, even if, as Professor Mamchur suggests, it can be easily criticized. However, I see some other criteria that can be used when we talk about the reality of scientific objects that suggest that they are not just social constructions. Let us take quarks—if we say that they are purely theoretical, why do we classify them using the terms “flavours”, “colours”, and “generations”? There must be some characteristics that make us do this kind of sorting. The idea is that there are unexplained bits of information about quarks that we can study and explore. If quarks are purely theoretical constructions, if they were born in our minds, why don’t we hold complete information about them? Why is it possible for them to surprise us as we do our further research? Thus, the scientific objects are real if they are able to provide us with new unexplained data about them.\nAs Professor Lektorsky (2015, 21) puts it:\nTheoretical knowledge often uses so-called ideal objects: material point, perfectly rigid body, incompressible gas … The scientists that suggest these objects are completely aware that they cannot be real. For example, the body volume of the object that has a mass cannot be a point. We should distinguish these objects from theoretical objects that refer to real referents: atom, electron, quark. It is useless to suppose that we can discover new qualities of ideal objects: these qualities are determined by the very means of constructing of these objects. But when we take real objects like atom, we can discover their new characteristics, build new theories about them, specify these theories, change them etc.\nI would call these criteria “the criteria of the limited knowledge”—that is, if we have limited knowledge about a certain object, then it is probably real, because if it were our own construction we would have the complete knowledge about it.\nRealism and Mutual Understanding\nWhat is usually neglected by the supporters of the social constructionist approach is the fact that we do not really invent the scientific theories out of thin air, we are trying to explain certain natural phenomena. Our explanations may be faulty, but the phenomena are real anyway—they are “out there” in the world—maybe even beyond our reach, but they are still there.\nAnother very important point is made by Agazzi (2016, 18) when he speaks about the necessity of the clear distinction between\n[T]he “things” of ordinary experience and the “objects” of the different sciences, though recognizing that precise links exist between them. Now, while it would be wrong to say that every science specifically deals with a particular domain of “things” (because any “thing” can become the “object” of several sciences) one can say that every science deals with whatever thing “from its own point of view” and it is owing to this particular point of view that it makes this thing one of its proper “objects”. Therefore, one could say that the objects of a science are the “clippings” obtained in things by considering them from the point of view of that science.\nThat is to say—scientific objects are not identical to the “things” that constitute our reality, but they reflect certain characteristics that exist in those things, they refer to reality.\nAlso, I do not see the argument of pessimistic induction as a substantial threat to realism. The natural phenomena we encounter are still there, they are still real, the change of the ontological set is like a different language: the table doesn’t cease to exist if we start calling it “tavola” or “Tisch”. This might be a crude analogy, but I hope it makes its point.\nWhat I would like to underline in the conclusion of these fleeting remarks is that the question of scientific realism is not purely academic. I see it as a question of the possibility of mutual understanding. If we cannot agree that the physical world around us is real, how can we agree on anything else, how can we understand each other? We have to start from some basic foundations, and I feel like physical world is a good place to start—it shows us that whatever our cultural or social differences are we still live in the same world (Trufanova 2017).\nAgazzi, Evandro. “The Truth of Theories and Scientific Realism.” In Varieties of Scientific Realism edited by Evandro Agazzi, 49-68.

Their breakthrough is reported in today's edition of Science Express, the advanced online publication of the prestigious journal Science.\n\"Building quantum machines is difficult because they are very complex, therefore the testing you need to do is also very complex,\" said Barry Sanders, director of the U of C's Institute for Quantum Information Science and a co-author of the paper. \"We broke a bunch of taboos with this work because we have come up with an entirely new way of testing that is relatively simple and doesn't require a lot of large and expensive diagnostic equipment.\"\nSimilar to any electronic or mechanical device, building a quantum machine requires a thorough understanding of how each part operates and interacts with other parts if the finished product is going to work properly. In the quantum realm, scientists have been struggling to find ways to accurately determine the properties of individual components as they work towards creating useful quantum systems. The U of C team has come up with a highly-accurate method for analyzing quantum optical processes using standard optical techniques involving lasers and lenses.\n\"It is a completely different approach to quantum characterization than we have seen before,\" said post-doctoral researcher Mirko Lobino, the paper's lead author. \"This process will be able to tell us if something is working correctly and will hopefully lead the way towards a quantum certification process as we move from quantum science to making quantum technology.\"\nThe development of quantum computers is considered the next major advancement in computer processing and memory power but is still in its infancy. Unlike regular silicon-based computers that transmit information in binary units (bits) using 1 and 0, quantum computers use the subatomic physical processes of quantum mechanics to transmit information in quantum bits (qubits) that can exist in more than two states. Computers based on quantum physics are predicted to be far more powerful than computers based on classical physics and could break many of the most advanced codes currently used to secure digital information. Quantum physics is also being used to try and create new, unbreakable encryption systems.\nThe same research group at the U of C, led by physics professor Alexander Lvovsky, made headlines earlier this year when they were one of two teams to independently prove it's possible to store a special kind of light, called a \"squeezed vacuum.\" That work is considered the initial step towards creating memory systems for quantum computing.\nNeutron star merger directly observed for the first time\n17.10.2017 | University of Maryland\nBreaking: the first light from two neutron stars merging\n17.10.2017 | American Association for the Advancement of Science\nUniversity of Maryland researchers contribute to historic detection of gravitational waves and light created by event\nOn August 17, 2017, at 12:41:04 UTC, scientists made the first direct observation of a merger between two neutron stars--the dense, collapsed cores that remain...\nSeven new papers describe the first-ever detection of light from a gravitational wave source.

{"question":"What's the connection between Monet's innovative approach to light in landscape painting and modern museum lighting standards for artwork preservation?","answer":"While Monet carefully observed and captured changes in color and light in his landscape paintings like Edge of the Cliff, Pourville (1882), museums today must carefully control light exposure to preserve such artworks. As demonstrated by MOMA's practices, they typically maintain strict illumination levels around 50 lux for 8 hours daily to prevent fading. If displayed in brighter conditions of 2000 lux (40x more intense), artwork would accumulate the same light exposure in just 1.95 years compared to 78 years under museum conditions, potentially causing severe fading and color changes.","context":["Why does Aardenburg Imaging publish\nlight fade data in Megalux hours?\nPhotographers understand light exposure. When capturing images with a camera, they know exposure is not just about time. Technically, exposure is the product of light intensity and time. Light exposure applies the same way to works of art on display.\nHere’s an example. Vincent Van Gogh’s “Starry Night” was acquired by the Museum of Modern Art (MOMA) in 1941. The painting has thus been on display for nearly 80 years! Let’s assume for purposes of discussion that it has been shown to the public for 8 hours per day, six days per week, and the gallery lights are otherwise off.\nTime alone doesn’t describe the painting’s accumulated exposure to light. We also need an estimate of the average illumination level in order to evaluate the accumulated light exposure to which Starry Night has been subjected while on long term display in the museum gallery.\nLet’s assume a 50 lux illumination level on the painting, a value often recommended by museum conservators for the safe viewing of artwork on display.\n- Daily light exposure on Starry Night:\n50 lux x 8 hours per day = 400 lux-hours.\n- Yearly light exposure:\n400 lux-hours x 6 days per week x 52 weeks per year = 124,800 lux-hours.\n- Years on display since MOMA acquired the work:\n2019-1941 = 78 years.\n- Estimated Total Light Exposure since the painting’s acquisition:\n124,800 lux-hours per year x 78 years = 9,734,400 lux-hours = 9.73 Megalux hours!\nNow, what would happen to Starry Night if it were displayed in the lobby of a modern building, one with large skylights and/or liberal use of architectural glass? Light levels in very bright indoor areas easily can reach 2000 lux or greater for sustained intervals of several hours per day. Starry Night might then be illuminated at 2000/50 = 40x greater light intensity (compared to our MOMA example) and for at least as long a daily light/dark cycle. It might be great lighting for a great viewing experience, but the painting would then reach the same 9.73 Megalux hours (or more of equivalent museum gallery exposure) in only 78/40 = 1.95 years on display! Light intensity during display, not just time on display, is the “elephant in the room” when it comes to protecting paintings, prints, and photographs from fading and discoloration, and an essential quantifier in the science of light fading.\nIf we were to continue forward from today with 2000 lux illumination for as much time as Starry Night has already been on display at MOMA, Starry Night will have received a whopping 389 Megalux hours additional light exposure over the next 78 years, far more than enough exposure to cause severe fading in paintings, as well as prints and photographs.\nThat’s how exposure works! Light fading outcomes for artwork on display are all about accrued light exposure, not just accrued time on display!\nTo carry the camera exposure versus artwork-on-display analogy one step further, the higher the camera’s film or electronic sensor sensitivity to light, the less total exposure is required to create a properly exposed image. Photographers know this as ISO speed. The more light-sensitive the artwork, the less light exposure is required to observe noticeable fading and/or discoloration. Van Gogh painted Starry Night in 1889. We don’t know precisely what its color values were when it was new, so we don’t know how much fading has already occurred to Starry Night, but its beauty is still greatly admired today. Thus, in today’s market where artists often use the term “archival” to help sell their work, Van Gogh could have claimed a “130 years” light fastness rating for his painting of Starry Night, and time has now proved him right. Yet this result must be tempered by the fact that MOMA has been taking exceptional care not to display the painting at arbitrary light levels for nearly 80 of those 130 years. The exposure limits where noticeable fading is observed can easily accumulate 10x, 100x, even 1000x more quickly in a bright home, office, or store window compared to a dimly lit room or typical museum gallery! Light fastness ratings expressed merely as “years on display” thus tell an incomplete and misleading story, because the range of light levels encountered in real world indoor environments is too great to assign one value for a “one-size-fits-all” display life prediction.\nAardenburg Imaging reports in Megalux hours because Megalux hours are the technically correct way to rate the light fade resistance of paintings, prints, and photographs.\nThis fact brings us to one final important consideration. Appropriate testing endpoint criteria must also be considered when judging the merits of any light fastness rating. The Aardenburg Conservation Display Ratings (CDR) report the Megalux hour limits, both Lower CDR and Upper CDR, which artwork can withstand and still remain in excellent condition, i.e., where viewers observe “little or no noticeable fading.” It’s easy for anyone, expert and non-expert alike, to agree on the condition of artwork which remains in excellent condition with little or no noticeable fading and/or discoloration, because it still looks essentially like new. However, manufacturers today tend overly to rely on light fastness tests of their products that use more liberal testing endpoint criteria, subjectively described as “easily noticeable fading.” Such claims lead to further debate over how much fading is too much. When a manufacturer offers fading data at a rated limit of easily noticeable and perhaps even objectionable fading, the overall condition of the artwork becomes much harder to describe.\nAardenburg’s more stringent Conservation Display Ratings are thus intended to serve as expert guidance for collectors, curators, conservators, and artists who seek to ensure the highest standards in handling, storage, and display of works of art in their care. The artist’s original intent is thus preserved.\nDirector, Aardenburg Imaging & Archives","Enjoy the Most Calming Scenery Paintings to Contemplate and De-stress\nEven though the scenery paintings date back to the ancient Greeks and the Romans, after the fall of the Roman Empire nature scenes became just a backdrop for religious stories or a mere setting for human activity. It wasn’t until the Renaissance era that artists started painting landscapes as a subject in its own right. These naturalistic elements such as a landscape have sparked a general interest in studying the natural world. Albert Altdorfer’s Landscape with Footbridge is considered as the first real landscape.\nIdealized landscapes first began in the Netherlands as an alternative to the contemporary religious subject-matter, as the rising Protestant middle class sought secular art. The landscape was perfected by the seventeenth century and it portrayed nature as serene and harmonious, where each tree, animal or rock was carefully placed within the composition. Still, it wasn’t until the eighteen century that landscape was recognized by the powerful art academies of Italy and France, which led to its complete supremacy in the century that followed. Gustave Courbet pushed the boundaries of landscape painting with his distinct use of paint and paved the way for the next revolutionary movement – the Impressionism. Inspired by Courbet’s work, painters such as Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cezanne or Sisley have spent the majority of their careers exploring and painting this subject.\nThroughout the 20th and 21st century, the notion of a landscape evolved greatly and broke all boundaries, becoming a subject for experimentation both in the figurative and abstract art. Without further ado, we bring you a selection of our favorite scenery paintings that you can contemplate on.\nFrom the vast world of Western art history, a renowned art historian Nils Büttner has made a selection of paintings portraying nature, as well as dramatic scenes with people and architecture. This broad selection features celebrated works, but also less famous one. Presented chronologically, the book begins with the ancient worlds and the precursors of landscape artists in the Middle Ages and Renaissance including Leonardo da Vinci, Giovanni Bellini and Raphael. Tracing the history of the landscape painting from ancient worlds up to the present day, this richly illustrated book follows the development and evolution of the medium from Albrecht Dürer and Rubens, through Constable and Winslow Homer, to Monet, Rousseau, Georgia O’Keeffe and David Hockeny. Focusing also on individual paintings and circumstances under which they were created, Büttner presents descriptions and analysis of the work’s cultural, historical, and aesthetic context.\nClaude Monet - Edge of the Cliff, Pourville, 1882\nA founder of the Impressionist movement, Claude Monet rejected the traditional approach to landscape and developed his unique style. He carefully observed and captured the changes in color and light during various times of the day or seasons. The painting Edge of the Cliff, Pourville from 1882 features a cliff above the sea Purville that was a recurring subject for Monet and was inspired by his stay at Pourville. Monet has used short and crisp brushwork and a sense of the movement is suggested by painterly calligraphy, a property of Monet’s work in 1880s. It is noted that the secondary cliff was later added to the canvas.\nEugene Von Guerard - Cabbage Tree Forest, American Creek, 1966-68\nJohann Joseph Eugene von Guerard was born in Austria but moved to Australia in 1852. Knowing the art of the European landscape painting from Dusseldorf Academy, he started painting Australia – his new home. For sixteen years Guerard travelled and sketched in the wilds of Victoria, Tasmania, New South Wales, South Australia and New Zealand. He painted grandiose landscapes, real and imagined, seen and remembered. His vision of primeval forests, its dark recesses, live cabbage-trees, bangalow palms, and huge ferns have a fantasy feeling emphasizing the newness and strangeness of these images.\nGeorgia O'Keeffe - Rust Red Hills, 1930\nAs one of the most original American artists of the early twentieth century, Georgia O’Keeffe was one of the first artists to represent the landscapes of the American Southwest. She has developed a very unique and personal style of abstract painting very close to the figuration. The painting Rust Red Hills is a perfect example of O’Keeffe’s unique use of abstraction and stylization. This deeply creviced strata of earth resemble intestines. The painter was fascinated by these hills in the New Mexican village of Abiquiu, and was returning often to find new sources of inspiration as these landscapes revealed in the different light each season.\nHenri Rousseau - The Flamingos, 1907\nOften described as naïve, primitive, savage, the art of Henri Rousseau is arguably one of the most original and uninhibited artistic expressions that emerged after Impressionism. A self-taught painter that became an artist at the age of 49 after retiring from his job at Paris customs office, Rousseau used amateurish technique and unusual compositions that were shunned by the art critics of the time, but praised by Picasso and Kandinsky for ‘the new possibilities of simplicity’. Famous for his lush jungle scenes, his works were imbued with a sense of mystery and eccentricity. His famous painting The Flamingos depicts three flamingos in the pond surrounded by lilies and jungle and is painted with a consistent repetition and flow.\nJoachim Patinir - Landscape with Charon Crossing the Styx, 1515–1524\nOften considered the first landscape painter in the history of Western art, Joachim Patinir created landscapes that were religiously themed. His works have influenced greatly the greatest Flemish and Dutch landscape painters of the following century. The most famous Patinir’s painting, Landscape with Charon Crossing the Styx depicts a human soul who is being stranded between heaven and hell. With a kind of triptychal composition resembling the infamous The Gardens of Earthly Delights, the painting is rich in details and full of different divine and hellish figures. The use of colour is typical of the era.\nKarlo Mijic - Mountain Landscape, 1924\nA famous Yugoslav painter Karlo Mijic was best known for his colouristic landscape paintings. With art nouveau and impressionist influences, Mijic was arguably one of the greatest painters in the 1920s and 30s Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Together with the painter Djoko Mazalic he founded the art association called ‘The Circle’ that had strong urban aesthetics of nature. His famous painting Mountain Landscape is a soft depiction of rough Bosnian mountains.\nPaul Gauguin - Rocks and Sea, 1886\nBefore leaving for Tahiti in search for the primitive, Gauguin studied Impressionist methods for portraying nature and experimented with new colour theories. The landscapes of Brittany have influenced his works greatly as he spent one whole summer there. There, he created works in an intensely colorful style. The painting Rocks and Sea is a depiction of a rocky coast of Brittany in the dusk.\nWayne Thiebaud - Levee Farms, 1998\nBest known for his ‘pop’ paintings of supermarket products or cakes and pies, Wayne Thiebaud has dedicated a significant part of his career to landscapes, both natural and urban. He uses heavy pigment and exaggerated colours and well-defined shadows that are usually characteristic for advertisements. The landscape pictures he painted 15 years ago are inspired by an almost forgotten corner of American countryside. Featuring an image of California that existed a long time ago, the road that goes high above the Sacramento river gives a view of river banks dotted with fishing stations and bait and tackle shops and orchards and farm fields. His painting Levee Farms from 1998 features shifting perspectives and geometric patterns in unexpected hues such as candy pink or baby blue.\nWinslow Homer - West Point, Prout's Neck, 1905\nA famous American landscape painter and a leading figure in American art, Winslow Homer is best known for his marine subjects. Concentrating on the beauty and the force of the sea, he created works with dynamic compositions and rich textures. The painting West Point, Prout’s Neck from 1905 features surging seawater and massive rocks against a rosy horizon. It was painted fifteen minutes after sunset, as Homer himself wrote. He considered it as one of his best paintings that managed to capture such a fleeting moment after many days of careful observation. The painting was created at the Maine coast near his studio in Prouts Neck.\nGrant Wood - Fall Plowing, 1931\nA famous American painter, Grant Wood is best known for his paintings depicting the rural American Midwest. His rolling hills, tiny farmhouses and swaths of country roads draw the viewer in. He painted in the unique style that he has developed through the late 1920s and 30s, stylizing the hills and trees into characteristic swellings and ovals – a style that remained his visual characteristic for the rest of his life. The painting Fall Plowing was painted in a historical district near Viola, and it features the agrarian life of rural Iowa. With fluffy and round trees, curved lines of hills and sharp rows of planting and hay, the painting is his seminal work and a perfect example of his unique style.\nRene Magritte - The Glass Key, 1959\nRene Magritte, a celebrated surrealist Belgian painter, created works that are beautiful in their clarity and simplicity, but also provoke unsettling thoughts. He described his paintings as visible images that conceal nothing, but evoke mystery. Featuring everyday objects placed in unusual contexts and juxtapositions, his paintings challenge the assumptions of human perception and force the viewer to reconsider things usually taken for granted. Magritte pondered his famous painting The Glass Key for three years, dismissing 50 titles before finally calling it after the novel by Dashiell Hammett. This imaginary landscape features a rock sitting improbably on a mountain top that he described as ‘absent of thought – the absolute’."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:5fc741bd-d53f-4062-9363-e731f6f1a331>","<urn:uuid:d4b487d4-0c1e-44b4-8ba0-bed18d3b4ec8>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What legal requirements must be met to establish a trust in the UAE, and what limitations exist on who can serve as an administrator of an estate in Singapore?","answer":"In the UAE, establishing a trust requires selecting licensed trustees, drafting a comprehensive trust deed outlining terms and beneficiary rights, registering with relevant regulatory authorities, and ensuring ongoing compliance with Federal Law No. 4 of 2020. In Singapore, administrators must be at least 21 years old and mentally capable. The court may appoint up to 4 administrators, with specific requirements that at least 2 administrators or a trust corporation must be appointed if beneficiaries are under 21. Administrators are selected according to a priority order including spouse, children, parents, siblings, and other relatives, and they must act unanimously when multiple administrators are appointed.","context":["24 October, 2023\nA trust is a legal arrangement where one party, the “grantor,” transfers assets to another party, the “trustee,” for the benefit of specific individuals or purposes, the “beneficiaries.” It’s a mechanism to safeguard and manage assets, often used for estate planning, charitable giving, or protecting assets. The trustee holds and administers the assets according to the terms set by the grantor, ensuring the beneficiaries’ financial security and fulfilling the grantor’s intentions. Trusts offer flexibility, privacy, and can mitigate estate taxes. They’re vital tools for managing wealth and providing for loved ones or philanthropic causes.\nTrusts can be highly valuable in various situations. They are often used for estate planning, ensuring a smooth transfer of assets to beneficiaries after the grantor’s passing while potentially reducing estate taxes. Trusts can safeguard assets, protect them from creditors, and offer privacy. They’re also instrumental in providing for loved ones with special needs or minor children. Trusts can facilitate charitable giving and grant the grantor control over how their assets are distributed. Their versatility makes trusts an essential tool for managing wealth and realizing various financial and personal goals.\nIn the United Arab Emirates (UAE), trusts offer an effective wealth management and estate planning tool, and the tax treatment of trusts is an essential consideration. UAE does not impose income, capital gains, or wealth taxes at the federal level, which makes it an attractive destination for establishing trusts.\nTrusts in the UAE can be structured as discretionary or non-discretionary trusts, with different tax implications. Non-discretionary trusts, where beneficiaries have fixed entitlements, can face taxation when the assets are transferred to the trust, subject to relevant transfer taxes.\nHowever, discretionary trusts, more commonly used, do not typically face taxation in the UAE, as the income earned and capital gains within the trust structure are not subject to taxes. Furthermore, distributions to non-resident beneficiaries do not incur UAE taxation.\nIt’s essential to engage with professional advisors to understand and navigate the specific tax implications and compliance requirements associated with trusts in the UAE, as they can vary based on the emirate in which the trust is established, as well as the individual circumstances of the trust and its beneficiaries. UAE’s favorable tax regime regarding trusts can offer significant advantages for effective wealth preservation and succession planning\nTrusts in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) are regulated by a combination of federal and local laws, primarily governed by the Federal Law No. 4 of 2020 concerning trusts and the Civil Transactions Law. The regulations provide a robust legal framework for establishing and managing trusts.\nTo create a trust in the UAE, you typically need to adhere to specific procedures, which may vary among the emirates. Trustees must ensure compliance with the trust’s terms and legal requirements. Importantly, UAE’s trust regulations enforce a high standard of professional conduct among trustees and require them to act in the best interests of beneficiaries.\nRegulations also cover the disclosure of trust information, particularly to the relevant authorities and beneficiaries, ensuring transparency. They may also address issues like the duration of the trust, removal and replacement of trustees, and the rights of beneficiaries.\nUAE’s legal environment for trusts is evolving, and it’s crucial to engage experienced legal and financial professionals who are well-versed in local regulations to establish and manage trusts effectively within the UAE.

Review and Update: Periodically review and update the trust to align with changing circumstances or objectives.","Intestacy: Applying for Letters of Administration in Singapore\nIf a loved one has passed away leaving behind property (known as the estate), but without a will, his or her estate may only be administered and distributed in accordance with Singapore’s intestacy laws under the Intestate Succession Act (ISA) for non-Muslims, or in accordance with Muslim law for Muslims.\nThis article discusses the process under the ISA for administering the estate of a loved one who has passed away without leaving behind a will (i.e. died intestate).\nWhat is a Grant of Letters of Administration?\nIn order to start administering a loved one’s estate, you are required to first apply to the court for a Grant of Letters of Administration.\nThis is a legal document that authorises you to be the administrator of the deceased’s estate, and administer and distribute the estate according to the ISA.\nIf the deceased has left behind a will, you generally should apply for a Grant of Probate instead.\nRead our other article for the differences between a Grant of Letters of Administration and Grant of Probate.\nWhen Do I Need to Apply for a Grant of Letters of Administration?\nGenerally, you have to apply for a Grant of Letters of Administration when the deceased person passes away without leaving behind a will, and you wish to administer and distribute his or her estate.\nHowever, you are also required to apply for a Grant of Letters of Administration where the deceased left behind a will, but there is a failure of executors in any of the following situations:\n- There is no executor appointed by the will;\n- The executor(s) appointed by the will are legally incapable of acting as such, or have renounced their right to act as such;\n- The executor(s) passed away before the deceased;\n- The executor(s) passed away before obtaining probate, or administering all the deceased’s estate; or\n- The executor(s) appointed by the will do not appear and extract probate.\nThe person empowered by a Grant of Letters of Administration to administer a deceased’s estate is known as the administrator.\nIn administering the estate, the administrator is required to first pay the debts, liabilities, taxes, funeral and other expenses of the deceased. Afterwards, the administrator will distribute the balance of the estate according to any applicable laws such as the ISA.\nWho Can and Cannot be an Administrator?\nAccording to section 18 of the Probate and Administration Act (PAA), the court may grant Letters of Administration to the deceased’s spouse, next-of-kin, or any of them individually or jointly.\nParticularly, the ISA sets out 7 classes of persons who, in descending order of priority, are entitled to apply for this grant. They are the deceased’s:\n- Nephews and nieces;\n- Grandparents; and\n- Uncles and aunts.\nInfants (i.e. persons below 21 years old) and persons who are mentally disordered are not allowed to be administrators. Where a person entitled to a grant is an infant, such a grant will be made to his or her guardian.\nSimilarly, where a person entitled to a grant is mentally disordered, such a grant will be made to the person who has been legally entrusted with the mentally disordered person’s affairs.\nHow Many Administrators Can be Appointed?\nThe court may appoint up to 4 administrators.\nIf one or more of the beneficiaries of the estate is below 21 years of age, then either at least 2 administrators, or a trust corporation, must be appointed.\nWhere there are multiple administrators, they will act jointly to administer the estate. This means that they will have to act unanimously at all times.\nWhat If I Do Not Wish to be an Administrator?\nIf you are one of the persons who are entitled to apply for, or may become entitled to, a Grant of Letters of Administration but do not wish to do or be so, you may renounce your right to apply for the grant.\nYou may renounce your right to apply for this grant:\n- Orally (either by you or your lawyer) at the hearing for a Grant of Letters of Administration; or\n- In signed writing (attested by your lawyer or by any person before whom an affidavit may be sworn, such as a Commissioner for Oaths).\nHow to Apply for a Grant of Letters of Administration\nYou may apply for a Grant of Letters of Administration yourself, should you wish to. The Family Justice Courts have prepared a Probate & Administration Toolkit to assist individuals in doing so.\nHowever, you may also engage a lawyer to assist you in such an application, and typically the lawyer’s legal fees would be covered by the deceased’s estate.\nThere are a few steps in applying for a Grant of Letters of Administration:\n1. Prepare the required documents\nTo apply for a Grant of Letters of Administration, you will need to fill in the following documents:\n- Service Bureau Form for Application for Letters of Administration (download the “Probate Application / Citation” form from the e-Litigation website and click on the form’s “Probate” tab). This form is an application form with administrative details to fill in, such as the deceased and applicant’s details, in order to start the process of obtaining a Grant of Letters of Administration.\n- Schedule of Assets (Form 226). This form sets out the deceased’s assets in Singapore and overseas, and any outstanding debts in Singapore secured by mortgage. If you don’t know the full extent of the deceased’s assets, you will need to write to financial institutions to obtain information on these assets (see step 4 below).\nIf anyone eligible to apply to for the Grant of Letters of Administration wishes to give up that right to do so, they will need to fill and sign in the “Renunciation of beneficiaries with prior right” form (Form 53).\nSupporting documents that you will need when applying for the Grant of Letters of Administration are the certified true copies of the:\n- Death certificate of the deceased\n- Death certificates of next-of-kin (if applicable)\n- Divorce certificate of the deceased (if applicable)\n- Foreign grant (if applicable)\n- Inheritance certificate (if applicable)\nUnless otherwise stated, all forms can be downloaded from the “Probate” section of this Family Justice Courts webpage.\n2. Conduct a search for existing caveats and probate applications on the estate\nAfter preparing all your documents, bring them to the LawNet & CrimsonLogic Service Bureau. At the Service Bureau, you will need to conduct a search for existing caveats and probate applications on the deceased’s estate, or existing claims to the right to administer the deceased’s estate.\nYou will also need to attach the full and summary reports of the search to your application.\n3. Submit your application for a grant\nWhen you are done with the caveat and probate application search, it’s time to submit all your documents to apply for the Grant of Letters of Administration at the Service Bureau. The Service Bureau will use your documents to prepare the following documents:\n- Originating application\n- Probate statement\n- Schedule of Assets\nIf you are applying for the grant more than 6 months after the death of the deceased, give reasons as to why.\nAfter submitting your application, the courts will usually take 1-3 weeks to accept your application. If there are errors in your application, the court will reject your application and state their reasons for doing so. You will have to correct the errors and re-file the documents.\nYou can be notified by SMS once your application has been approved, so you can go back to the Service Bureau to collect your approved documents.\n4. File the Supporting Affidavit and Administration Oath\nThe next step is to prepare and file in the Supporting Affidavit (Form 225) and Administration Oath (Form 54). These documents must be filed within 14 days of the filing of your application.\nIn the Supporting Affidavit, you will confirm that details of the application are correct. On the other hand, the Administration Oath is for you to undertake that you will faithfully administer the deceased’s estate. Both documents need to be sworn or affirmed before a Commissioner for Oaths.\nPreparation of the Schedule of Assets\nThe Schedule of Assets (Form 226) is to be filed with the Supporting Affidavit. If you need to ascertain what assets the deceased had in order to fill in the Schedule of Assets, you will have to write to banks, the CPF Board and any other financial institutions.\nYou should only write to these institutions after your application for the Grant of Letters of Administration has been accepted. This is because these institutions usually require a certified true copy of the court-approved originating application before they will give you any information.\nHowever, it can take a few weeks or months to hear from all the financial institutions. If you are unable to get all the information from them by the deadline for filing the Supporting Affidavit and Administration Oath, you should file these 2 documents first without the Schedule of Assets.\nThen, once you have heard from all the financial institutions, you can file the complete Schedule of Assets, together with a supplementary affidavit that also needs to be sworn or affirmed before a Commissioner for Oaths.\nIf there are no issues with the application, the court should approve the Grant of Letters of Administration and grant you an “Order in Terms”. You will know the outcome of your application when you receive a letter from the court requesting for you to extract the grant.\n5. Extract the grant\nOnce the court issues the Grant of Letters of Administration, you can apply to extract the grant using the Request to Extract Grant form. To obtain this form, download the same “Probate Application / Citation” form from the e-Litigation website (as mentioned above) and click on the form’s “Extraction of Grant” tab.\nYou will also have to conduct one last caveat and probate search application search. The results of this search will have to be filed together with your request to extract the grant. After extracting the grant, you will have the Grant of Letters of Administration which authorises you to manage the deceased’s estate.\nHow Does the Administrator Distribute the Estate?\nThe following chart illustrates how the administrator may distribute the deceased’s estate. There are 9 simple rules outlined in section 7 of the ISA. After all owed taxes and debts are paid, the assets are distributed in the following order:\n|SURVIVOR||ABSENT||WHO GETS WHAT|\n|Spouse||Children, parents||Spouse gets everything|\n|Spouse, children||Spouse gets half, children gets the other half in equal portions|\n|Children||Spouse||Children get everything in equal portions. Grandchildren can claim their parent’s share in equal portions if their parent is dead|\n|Spouse, parents||Children||Spouse gets half, parents get half in equal portions|\n|Parents||Spouse, children||Parents get everything in equal portions|\n|Brothers and sisters (or children of the deceased brother or sister)||Spouse, children, parents||Brothers and sisters get equal portions. Their children can claim their share for them in equal portions if they are deceased|\n|Grandparents||Spouse, children, parents, brothers and sisters or children of such brothers and sisters||Grandparents take the estate in equal portions|\n|Uncles and aunts||Spouse, children, parents, brothers and sisters or children of such brothers and sisters, grandparents||Uncles and aunts take the estate in equal portions|\n|None||Everyone||Government takes everything|\nIf the deceased has property overseas and died intestate, immovable property like houses should be distributed according to the law of the relevant country where the property is located in.\nOn the other hand, movable property like cash may be distributed according to Singapore law.\nWhat If the Deceased Who Died Without a Will was a Muslim, or Died While Overseas?\nIf the deceased was Muslim\nIf the deceased who has passed away without a will was a Muslim domiciled in Singapore, the Administration of Muslim Law Act and Syariah law would apply instead.\nThe appropriate person to apply for the Grant of Letters of Administration, and administer the estate, would then be the person with the highest number of shares in the estate in accordance with the Inheritance Certificate.\nThe Inheritance Certificate is a document which has to be obtained from the Syariah Court prior to the application for the Grant of Letters of Administration. You can read more about the distribution of estates belonging to deceased Muslims in our other article.\nIf the deceased died overseas\nIf the deceased passed away while overseas, you will need to obtain a death certificate issued by the foreign authorities, and an English translation if the death certificate is not in English.\nLosing a loved one can be emotionally draining as it is, and the process of applying for a Grant of Letters of Administration can be complex in the number of steps to complete and documents to submit.\nYou may wish to get in touch with one of our experienced probate lawyers to assist you with this process.\n- Plan Intergenerational Wealth With a Singapore Family Office\n- 8 Tools You Must Know for Estate Planning in Singapore\n- Guide to CPF Nominations & How to Make One In Singapore\n- What Happens to Your Debts When You Die?\n- Who Pays for the Mortgage Debts and Medical Bills After Death?\n- Is Inheritance Tax Payable When You Die in Singapore?\n- Is Stamp Duty Payable When Inheriting Property in Singapore?\n- How to Donate your Assets to Charity\n- Organ Donation in Singapore (under HOTA, or For Science)\n- Finding Missing Persons in Singapore (or ‘Presumed Dead’)\n- How Do I Make a Will?\n- The Complete Guide to Making Your Will in Singapore\n- Why Should You Make a Will?\n- Checklist for Drafting a Comprehensive Will in Singapore\n- Get An Affordable Will Made By Experienced Lawyers\n- Choosing an Executor for Your Will in Singapore\n- How to Prepare a Schedule of Assets for Your Will in Singapore\n- Appointing a Guardian for Your Children in Your Will in Singapore\n- What is a Mutual Will, Mirror Will and Joint Will?\n- How to Give Away Overseas Assets in a Will in Singapore\n- Can I Use My Will to Distribute Insurance Proceeds?\n- Where Should You Store Your Will?\n- How Can I Change My Will?\n- How to Plan for Mental Incapacitation\n- Mental Capacity Assessment for LPAs and Wills\n- Appointment of Deputies under the Mental Capacity Act\n- How to Appoint a Deputy for Mentally Incapacitated Persons in Singapore\n- Advance Medical Directives in Singapore\n- Making a Lasting Power of Attorney in Singapore\n- Revocation of a Lasting Power of Attorney\n- Advance Care Planning in Singapore: Why and How to Get Started\n- No Executor For Your Loved One's Will: What to Do\n- What is Probate?

{"question":"As a diabetic person concerned about foot care safety, what are the key differences between moist and dry sterilization methods for toenail care tools?","answer":"For diabetic individuals, it's important to note that you should first consult with your doctor or podiatrist before performing any personal toenail care. Regarding sterilization methods, moist heat sterilization is performed under pressure using steam/water and works by coagulating microbes' proteins, taking less time and requiring lower temperatures. In contrast, dry heat sterilization uses direct flame or hot air without water, working through oxidation of proteins and requiring higher temperatures (160-170°C) and longer times (1-2 hours). However, dry heat has the advantage of not causing rust since instruments remain dry. Both methods are reliable and non-toxic, but the specific choice should be made under medical guidance for diabetic patients.","context":["So… you are struggling with thick toenails and have no clue how you are going to trim them?\nAre you embarrassed to go to the spa and get a pedicure with the shape you have allowed your nails to get to?\nHow in the world are you going to fix these ugly nails?\nI have your answers right here!\nWhy trust me? I have been in practice over a decade as a podiatric physician. This is my specialty! I do this on a daily basis. Feel free to read more about me by clicking HERE!\nGo ahead… keep reading and let me tell you just how to trim thick toenails!\nHow To Trim Thick Toenails\nI have also included a link to Treatment Options for Toenail Fungus for a review of the multitude of treatment regimens out there because you HAVE to treat this disorder!\nBut… for now, let’s get down to business.\nLet me show you exactly how to trim your thick toenails.\nTrimming thick toenails is a much more difficult task than trimming normal toenails.\nBecause you want to reduce your toenails in both length AND thickness.\nYou want to try and get them to appearing normal again.\nMost people with thick toenails dread the thought of even beginning to attempt to trim them to an acceptable appearance, but I am here to ensure you that there are some ways to make this challenging task a little easier for you and prevent the condition from getting too far out of hand!\nHere we go…\nSteps to Trimming Thick Toenails\n1. First, soak your feet for about 10 minutes in warm, soapy water! That is easy enough, right? Soaking aids to soften the nail to make trimming easier. Just relax while soaking and enjoy yourself. Everybody needs a little pampering now and then!\n2. Second, after soaking, utilize a towel to dry your feet thoroughly including the toenails and the areas between your toes.\n3. Third, get comfortable by sitting on a chair or in the floor and place an old newspaper or paper towels on the ground under the feet to catch your clippings.\nComfortable? Now…it’s time to start clipping away!!!\nInstruments for Trimming Thick Toenails\nAs far as instruments to use for the next few steps of trimming thick toenails, there are a couple of options.\nWhichever instrument you decide to utilize, hygiene is key!\nMake sure that you sterilize the instrument you decide to utilize by one of two methods: Either wipe with rubbing alcohol or boil the instruments in water.\nMy favorite method is simply rubbing the edge of the instrument that will touch your nails with rubbing alcohol.\nIf mechanical clippers are your method of choice, please read my review of my all-time favorite clipper of choice for thick toenails: The Equinox Heavy Duty Toenail Clipper OR you can simply click the link below to make a direct purchase of these clippers now.\nThese clippers are very inexpensive and will make clipping your toenails a breeze with its double action ability to clip through even the thickest toenail with minimal effort.\nShould you decide to utilize an electric nail file for filing your thick toenails down in both length AND thickness, then the Medicool MED2191 Turbo File 2 Professional Electric Nail Filing System is the best instrument for you!\nYou are a lot less likely to have any cuts or “oopsies” when you use an electric file to reduce the nail in both length and thickness.\nIn fact, this is my personal product of choice as I have experienced that reducing the thickness of the nail is by far easier with this file.\nOf course other files are available, and I have actually tested most of them on the market, but… this particular one is far superior to the others.\nFeel free to read my personal review of this electric nail file by clicking HERE, OR just click the link below to go directly and purchase this awesome machine.\nImportant Tips When Trimming Thick Toenails\nYou have prepared your feet and have your instrument of choice ready, but how EXACTLY do you begin the trimming part?\nWell… continue reading and allow me to tell you!\n1. You never want to cut the toenails too short!\nIn doing so, you both increase the probability of nail infections (we do not want that) and increase the likelihood of the toenail becoming tender and inflamed.\nSo… finding a good length is imperative… not too long, but not too short either! Just past the edge of the skin is perfect!\n2. You always, always, always want to trim the toenails straight across, as opposed to curving the nail!\nThis helps to prevent an ingrown toenail from occurring!\nIf you are really particular and prefer a more rounded-shaped nail, I still recommended initially cutting the nail straight across and then following with a file to give the edges of the nail just a slight curve.\n3. Small clips are key with thick toenails!\nStart at one side of one nail and take small cuts in a straight line across the entirety of the toenail.\nThese small cuts help to prevent splintering or splitting of the toenail.\nAgain, remember not to round the toenail at the corner – cut straight across. Repeat with each toenail.\n4. Upon completion of trimming all of the toenails, it is imperative to remove any sharp edges or corners that could catch on pantyhose or socks.\nDo this by utilization of an emery board or nail file (again… I prefer this linked electric nail file) and gently file the edges!\nImportant note: LEAVE YOUR CUTICLES ALONE!!!\nDo not trim or “push back” your cuticles as this can disrupt the natural barrier between your toenail and skin and lead to further infections.\nLastly, I do want to mention that if you do have Diabetes, Poor Circulation, reduced sensation in your feet, or if you are taking anti-coagulants such as Plavix, it is very important that you talk to your doctor or podiatrist to see if it is safe for you to care for your own toenails!\nContinue to next section: Antifungal Nail Polish – Does it Exist and Can We Use It?","When the process of sterilization is carried out at high -pressure through water (steam) it is called as moist heat sterilization, on the other hand, dry heat sterilization is carried out at high temperature under dry condition.\nThe best way to kill microbes is through ‘heat‘, as it destroys their proteins as well the enzymes present in them. So sterilization (destroying or killing the microbes) process follows this principle of killing microbes, which can be either by giving wet (moist) heat or dry heat.\nAs their name suggests, both the methods have the different mechanism of working to sterilize the types of equipment and it depends on the type of equipment to be sterilized. So this article is to know about the few, though important differences between the moist heat sterilization and dry heat sterilization.\nContent: Moist Heat Sterilization Vs Dry Heat Sterilization\n|Basis for Comparison||Moist Heat Sterilization||Dry Heat Sterilization|\n|Meaning||Sterilization involving lower temperature and high-pressure of water (steam) is known as Moist Heat Sterilization.||Sterilization involving the dry air of higher temperature and for the longer time is known as Dry Heat Sterilization.|\n|Process requires||As the name says, it needs steam and water.||There is no use of steam and water.\n|Sterilization is done by||Coagulating protein of the microbes very effectively.||Oxidation of the protein and other chemical bonds present in microbes.\n|This process is performed under pressure.||It is performed on direct flame.|\n|Autoclaving and Boiling come under moist heat sterilization.||Incerination, Bunsen burner (flame), hot air oven and microwave comes under dry heat sterilization.|\n|Required time to complete the process||Moist heat sterilization takes less time.||This process takes more time comparatively.\nDefinition of Moist Heat Sterilization\nMoist heat sterilization has its importance for sterilizing instruments like custom trays. In this type of sterilization the autoclave is used, where the pressure of the steam with relatively high temperature (though lower than the dry heat sterilization) is used.\nIn this method, the moist heat (steam) sterilize the equipment by denaturating the enzymes and the structural proteins of the harmful microbes present on the equipment and thus killing them. The moist heat destroys the proteins of the microbes by coagulating them. The required timing is about 15 minutes with the temperature of 121°C.\nAdvantages of the Moist Heat Sterilization\n- Requires low temperature.\n- Less time to complete.\n- Easy to control and monitor.\n- Low cost, non-toxic.\nDisadvantages of the Moist Heat Sterilization\n- The heat-sensitive instrument cannot be sterilized.\n- After sterilization, the instrument remains wet, which may lead to rust.\n- Chances of getting instrument damaged, due to repeated exposure.\nDefinition of Dry Heat Sterilization\nDry heat sterilization is one of the old technique to sterilize the glassware and other equipment. In this method, heated air of high temperature and further the process is same as that of conduction method. Heat is absorbed from the surrounding area of the equipment and is moved forward to the next layer, and slowly the whole equipment gets heated and attains sterilization. The time may vary from 1 hour to 2 hours along with the temperature of the 160°C to 170°C respectively.\nThe temperature is higher than the moist heat sterilization process; there are more chances of the microbes to get the kill. Incineration, the high flame are the different types of processes performed under dry heat sterilization.\nThe oxidation process is involved to destroy the microbes. Though this method takes longer time than the moist heat sterilization as due to the absence of water, high energy is required to break the peptide bonds of the proteins present in the microbes.\nAdvantages of Dry Heat sterilization\n- Reliable, nontoxic.\n- Low cost and is easy to install.\n- As the instrument remains dry after sterilization, there are no chances of corrosion.\n- Not harmful to the environment.\nDisadvantages of the Dry Heat Sterilization\n- It requires more time for sterilization.\n- Exposure to the higher temperature may be harmful to the instrument.\nKey Differences Between Moist Heat Sterilization and Dry Heat Sterilization\nGiven below are the points which present the key differences between the Moist Heat and Dry Heat Sterilization:\n- Sterilization involving lower temperature and high-pressure of water (steam) is known as Moist Heat Sterilization, on the counterparts sterilization including the dry air of higher temperature and for the higher time is known as Dry Heat Sterilization.\n- In the moist heat sterilization coagulation of protein and enzymes of the microbes are done very effectively, it also takes less time whereas in dry heat oxidation denaturation or killing of microbes is done by the process of oxidation of the protein and other chemical bonds present in microbes, and it takes more time to complete.\n- Autoclaving and Boiling come under moist heat sterilization, while Incineration, Bunsen burner (flame), Hot air oven and Microwave comes under dry heat sterilization.\nFrom the above article, we conclude that both are the acceptable process and can be performed according to the requirement and the conditions of the equipment to be sterilized."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:1301f831-2b79-4ff5-8624-d63286199166>","<urn:uuid:dd4142de-07ef-40a3-88a4-429ec55aec11>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Could you compare how Wilfred Owen and Isaac Rosenberg expressed their war experiences through poetry? I'm curious about their different approaches to documenting the horrors of WWI.","answer":"Owen and Rosenberg took different but equally powerful approaches to depicting the war. Owen explicitly saw it as his duty to reflect the grim reality of war, stating that 'all a poet today can do is warn' and describing soldiers who 'die as cattle' in his work 'Anthem for Doomed Youth.' Rosenberg, while also depicting the war's horror, approached it through a more complex lens that connected to his spiritual and poetic traditions. His poetry showed continuity between a past experienced through poetry and spiritual tradition, and the intolerable present of war. This is evident in poems like 'On Receiving News of the War,' where he uses mythic diction and religious imagery to convey the horror, speaking of 'God's blood' being shed and an 'ancient crimson curse.'","context":["- The Poems and Plays of Isaac Rosenberg edited by Vivien Noakes\nOxford, 427 pp, £90.00, August 2004, ISBN 0 19 818715 7\nIn June 1914, the 24-year-old Isaac Rosenberg left his home in Stepney, East London, to stay with his married sister Minnie Horvitch in Cape Town in the hope that the climate might improve his health. He was in Cape Town when he heard that war had been declared. He responded in ‘On Receiving News of the War: Cape Town’:\nSnow is a strange white word.\nNo ice or frost\nHave asked of bud or bird\nFor Winter’s cost.\nYet ice and frost and snow\nFrom earth to sky\nThis Summer land doth know.\nNo man knows why.\nIn all men’s hearts it is.\nSome spirit old\nHath turned with malign kiss\nOur lives to mould.\nRed fangs have torn His face.\nGod’s blood is shed.\nHe mourns from His lone place\nHis children dead.\nO! ancient crimson curse!\nGive back this universe Its pristine bloom.\nThere is an absolute command of pace in this poem, a pace as inexorable as the spreading stain of the ‘strange white word’. The slight hesitation, almost syncopation, in ‘Corrode, consume’ allows the demand of the two final lines to unroll with ambiguous splendour. The diction rises to the mythic scale of the horror. In October 1915, Rosenberg, back in London, enlisted, against his pacifist convictions, not out of patriotic fervour but because he wanted his mother (whose heart he feared would break at the news) to have the separation allowance that would be her due and half his pay.\nThe experience of trench warfare did not shock Rosenberg into poetry or make him see more clearly. The war may have accelerated his poetic development as much as it cramped its production, but it did not fundamentally change its course. Like that of his longer lived contemporary David Jones (born five years after Rosenberg, in 1895), Rosenberg’s writing displays a sense of the continuity between a past passionately experienced through poetry and spiritual tradition, and a nearly intolerable present.\nRosenberg’s parents were Russian Jews who had emigrated from Lithuania to England (originally to Leeds, then to Bristol, where Isaac was born, and finally to East London). In his poetry the longing for rootedness that often accompanies deracination leads to a profound sense of the roots that he could claim, and a readiness to reach further (to biblical ancestry and poetic affinity) to claim them than those who feel themselves more easily at home. When, as a student at the Slade, he applied for the first British Rome Prize in 1912, he wasn’t sure whether he was a British citizen and so eligible. He was, but it was not something he had taken for granted. His friend Joseph Leftwich, at the time working in a furrier’s sweatshop in Stepney, wrote of Rosenberg in his diary: ‘It is only in poetry that he feels himself somebody . . . in poetry he feels himself at home.’\nIn November 1915, Rosenberg wrote to Sidney Schiff from the military hospital (he had tripped and cut his hands) in Bury St Edmunds: ‘One might succumb, be destroyed – but one might also . . . be renewed, made larger, healthier.’ This may sound suspiciously like Rupert Brooke’s sense of himself and his fellows going into the war like ‘swimmers into cleanness leaping’; but unlike Brooke (who smacked too much of ‘flag days’ for Rosenberg’s taste), Rosenberg had no illusions about the nature of the element he was entering. He saw clearly the war’s capacity for destruction, but saw too the opportunity it offered for growth. He used the same notion of health when he wrote, before the war, of Milton’s sonnet ‘On His Blindness’: ‘how dignified he is! how grand, how healthy! What begins in a mere physical moan, concludes in a grand triumphant spiritual expression . . . of more than resignation, of conquest.’\nStruggle – to earn enough to live, to get books and drawing materials, to find time to read, draw, think and write – was intrinsic to Rosenberg’s experience. Before 1911, when he was working in Fleet Street as an apprentice engraver, he wrote to his schoolteacher friend Winifreda Seaton (in language which achieves the simple large vision it complains of lacking):\nIt is horrible to think that all these hours, when my days are full of vigour and my hands and soul craving for self-expression, I am bound, chained to this fiendish mangling-machine, without . . . hope of deliverance . . . I despair of ever writing excellent poetry. I can’t look at things in the simple, large way that great poets do. My mind is so cramped and dulled and fevered . . . the very fibres are torn apart, and application deadened by the fiendish persistence of the coil of circumstance.\nIn January 1918, Rosenberg wrote from the trenches to Edward Marsh, the compiler of Georgian Poetry, and one of the several friends that Rosenberg would make through his poetry: ‘We spend most of our time pulling each other out of the mud.’ In some sense, his subject is the struggle to wrest poetry from the stifling pressures of existence, from mud, poverty, the constraints of obligation.","World War I, the war that was originally expected to be “over by Christmas,” dragged on for four years with grim brutality brought on by the dawn of trench warfare and advanced weapons, including chemical weapons. The horrors of that conflict altered the world for decades—and writers reflected that shifted outlook in their work.\nAs Virginia Woolf would later write, “Then suddenly, like a chasm in a smooth road, the war came.”\nEarly Works Glorified the War\nAmong the first to document the “chasm” of the war were soldiers themselves. At first, idealism persisted as leaders glorified young soldiers marching off for the good of the country.\nEnglish poet Rupert Brooke, after enlisting in Britain’s Royal Navy, wrote a series of patriotic sonnets, including “The Soldier,” which read:\nIf I should die, think only this of me:\nThat there’s some corner of a foreign field\nThat is for ever England.\nBrooke, after being deployed in the Allied invasion of Gallipoli, would die of blood poisoning in 1915.\nThe same year, Canadian doctor Lieutenant-Colonel John McCrae, upon seeing how red poppies grew in the fields that had been ravaged by bombs and littered with bodies, wrote “In Flanders Fields.” The poem, memorializing the death of his friend and fellow soldier, would later be used by Allied militaries to recruit soldiers and raise money in selling war bonds:\nIn Flanders fields the poppies blow\nBetween the crosses, row on row,\nThat mark our place, and in the sky,\nThe larks, still bravely singing, fly,\nScarce heard amid the guns below.\nLiterary Tone Shifts After Grueling WWI Combat\nWhile both Brooke’s and McCrae’s works lent patriotic tones to the sacrifices of war early in the conflict, as time wore on, the war’s relentless horrors spawned darker reflections. Some, like English poet Wilfred Owen, saw it their duty to reflect the grim reality of the war in their work.\nAs Owen would write, “All a poet today can do is warn. That is why the true poet must be truthful.” In “Anthem for the Doomed Youth,” Owen describes soldiers who “die as cattle” and the “monstrous anger of the guns.”\nOwen’s fellow army officer, Siegfried Sassoon, writes of corpses “face downward, in the sucking mud, wallowed like trodden sand-bags loosely filled” in his 1918 poem, “Counter-Attack.”\nFrom the opposite side of the firing lines, German writer Erich Maria Remarque also experienced the grim day-to-day life of a soldier. Later, in 1929, he published an unflinching account in his novel, All Quiet on the Western Front.\nAmong other prominent works reflecting the horrific realities of war was the four-part tome, Parade’s End, by English novelist Ford Madox Ford, and from the Eastern Front, Dr. Zhivago by Soviet Russian writer Boris Pasternak, in which the main character describes grotesque injuries inflicted on the war’s battlefields.\nErnest Hemingway Pens 'A Farewell to Arms'\nIn one of the most famous works set during the “Great War,” American writer Ernest Hemingway offers a gripping love story between a soldier and a nurse set against the chaotic, stark backdrop of World War I.\nA Farewell to Arms is among the writer’s most autobiographical: Hemingway himself served as an ambulance driver during the war, was severely wounded on the Austro-Italian front and had been sent to a hospital in Milan, where he fell in love with a nurse.\nVirginia Woolf Writes on War's Impact on Society\nThe literary response to World War I was not only to portray its horrors at the front but also the reverberations of the war throughout society.\nVirginia Woolf, who had been a close friend of the fallen poet Rupert Brooke, wove profound references to the war’s effects throughout her works.\nIn the setting of her acclaimed novel Mrs. Dalloway, the war has ended, but everyone remains deeply affected by it, including one of the novel’s main characters, a veteran with severe shell shock (now known as PTSD, or post-traumatic stress disorder).\nModernism Emerges in Works by Joseph Conrad, James Joyce, T.S. Eliot\nThe disillusionment that grew out of the war contributed to the emergence of modernism, a genre that broke with traditional ways of writing, discarded romantic views of nature and focused on the interior world of characters.\nWoolf’s novels reflected this emerging tone, as did the works of Joseph Conrad (Heart of Darkness) and James Joyce (Ulysses). T.S. Eliot’s “The Waste Land,” considered to be one of the most significant poems of the 20th century, presents a haunting vision of postwar society, with the opening lines:\nApril is the cruellest month, breeding\nLilacs out of the dead land, mixing\nMemory and desire, stirring\nDull roots with spring rain.\nAldous Huxley’s dystopian novel Brave New World questions once-accepted social and moral notions in presenting a nightmarish vision of the future.\nWorld War I devastated continents, leaving some 10 million soldiers and 7 million civilians dead. But writers responded with profound and groundbreaking work as they and the rest of the world grappled with the war’s upheaval.\nAs Remarque wrote in All Quiet on the Western Front: “All these things that now, while we are still in the war, sink down in us like a stone, after the war shall waken again, and then shall begin the disentanglement of life and death.”"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:7175c613-f410-4b93-acac-f6c3ac76e2da>","<urn:uuid:abe39343-610d-4691-a6c2-415088257f94>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Are modern wine bottles more standardized in size compared to those from the 1800s?","answer":"Yes, modern wine bottles are significantly more standardized. In the 1800s, although manufacturing advancements allowed for more standardized production, bottles varied between 700-800 milliliters. Today, since 1979, the standard wine bottle size has been firmly established at 750 milliliters in both the United States and European Union, containing exactly 25 ounces or five standard pours.","context":["The finest wines, when matured, are generally sent in bottles, carefully packed. Every bottle of champagne is carefully wrapped in cartridge paper, and the case lined with the same substance. This wine should never be drawn from the case until it is wanted for use. Burgundy should be kept in the same manner. The cases being filled with salt, which cannot escape, will preserve the wine fresh even in India. The bottles, however, should be more than commonly thick when designed for a voyage so long.\nCyrus Redding, Every Man his Own Butler (London, 1839)\nA young David Copperfield is banished to work at his stepfather’s dockside import-export wine and spirit warehouse:\nI know that a great many empty bottles were one of the consequences of this traffic, and that certain men and boys were employed to examine them against the light, and reject those that were flawed, and to rinse and wash them. When the empty bottles ran short, there were labels to be pasted on full ones, or corks to be fitted to them, or seals to be put upon the corks, or finished bottles to be packed in casks. All this work was my work, and of the boys employed upon it I was one.\nCharles Dickens, David Copperfield (1849)\nMost early 1600s English wine bottles were thin-walled and better suited for carrying wine from cask to table than for heavier-duty storage and shipping. In the 1630s, thicker walled “shaft and globe” and then (around 1670) “onion bottles” began to be produced. Such vessels could be filled, sealed, and sometimes packed in interlocking layers in wooden boxes for shipping.\nBy the late 1600s, it was recognized that the rounded shape of wine bottles hampered their placement during storage. John Worlidge, in his popular Vinetum Britannicum (London, 1678) states that laying bottles on their sides is to be commended as it keeps corks moist and damaging air out. He warns those who “place their Bottles on a Frame with their no[s]es downwards” that they risk sediment in the bottle being served in the first glass.\nAmong bottles with “seals” at Winterthur, the DePeyster example is of particular interest. John (or Johannes) DePeyster of Albany, New York, served as mayor, city recorder, and Commissioner of Indian Affairs at various times. The 1726 date on this special-order vessel may record when the order for a group of bottles was placed or perhaps represents the vintage of the wine to be placed in it.\nEngland; dated 1719 (bladder onion bottle), dated 1739 (octagonal bottle)\nInscribed “Cs Croon / Woodbroug / 1719” (bladder onion bottle), “*/ -R-S- / 1739” (octagonal bottle)\nBequest of Henry Francis du Pont 1961.1332, 1959.1721\nAlthough the name and initials on these bottles have yet to be identified, the vessels were special orders both in terms of their shapes and the inclusion of inscribed seals. The freeblown “Croon” bottle is a “bladder onion” form made on a modest scale from around 1715 to 1740. The rare octagonal “RS” bottle is a molded form dating from around 1720 through the 1770s.\nThe above two vessels were personalized with amateurish engraving, probably by the owners. On the “SH” bottle, the initials are stipple engraved, which called for repeated striking of the glass with a sharp tool. The shoulder of the cylindrical “W Gildas” wine bottle was inscribed with rough scratching.\nDAMON & SYLVIA, LISIMOND and CHLORIS\nJohn Faber, Jr. (engraver) after a painting by Phillippe Mercier\nThomas and John Bowles and Son (publisher)\nLondon, England; 1753–64\nInk on laid paper\nGift of Mrs. Waldron Phoenix Belknap 1960.754\nBy the time this print was published in the mid-18th century, the illustrated costumes and wine bottle forms were long out of date. The sentiment of friendship and romance shared to the accompaniment of wine, however, was timeless.\nBeginning around 1730, bottles became more cylindrical, making it easier to place them horizontally during storage to keep corks wet and better preserve the wine. Rather than being freeblown, these bottles typically were dip-molded to create the more straight-side profile. The pushed-up undersides, known as “kicks,” left a fairly even bottom edge to the bottle and kept the rough “pontil marks” created during manufacture from scratching wooden table tops. The extra surface area created by a kick may also have helped in cooling the drink when the vessel was placed in cold water or on ice.\nApplied seals on bottles sometimes carried the names or initials of owners. The larger bottle here was made for Sidney Breese, a Welshman who settled in New York City in 1730. He was a merchant specializing in imported goods, including textiles and looking glasses (mirrors). This is one of four bottles bearing the same seal.\nWine bottle (left)\nEngland; dated 1774\nInscribed “Rolle / 1774”\nBequest of Henry Francis du Pont 1959.1978\nWine bottle (right)\nHenry Ricketts & Co.\nBristol, England; 1821–35\nInscribed “W.M.C.” (seal), “PATENT” (shoulder), and “H RICKETTS & Co. / GLASS WORKS BRISTOL.” (underside)\nGift of Mrs. Harry W. Lunger 1973.452.1\nIn 1821 English glassmaker Henry Ricketts patented a new method of molding glass bottles. His full-size, three-part molds completed the upper portion of the bottle as well as the walls and bottom, making vessels more consistent in shape and volume. By this time, complaints and legislation to try to curb trickery by wine-sellers who sold smaller capacity bottles than were promised had a long history. Another mold was pushed up from the bottom to create the “kick” and provide the maker’s name in relief. Within about 20 years, American manufacturers patented similar methods of bottle making. The bottle shown here bears an applied and stamped seal with the original owner’s initials.\nThis children’s book tells of an elegant entertainment at an alderman’s house in Bow, England. The details of the story are related in an alphabetical rhyme and include references to several alcoholic beverages. Alcohol consumption is virtually never referred to in modern children’s books but was considered a part of everyday life in the past. The following verse appears on a page adorned with wine bottles, and a musical scene:\nW was the wine of all sorts: but I think\nIt would be hard to tell you how much they did drink.\nHallmarked silver corkscrews were popular by the mid-1700s, and variations were soon available in steel and other metals. They are listed fairly often in 18th-century Pennsylvania and Virginia Gazette advertisements. The “silver and steel corkscrews” in Catharine Rathell’s 1772 Williamsburg, Virginia, ad indicate she sold such items in different materials and, presumably, at different prices.\nThe “peg and worm” corkscrew shown here features a pick that can be used to remove smaller corks. Two of the other corkscrews feature protective cylindrical cases that, when inserted in the loops, form handles. The simpler of the two folding corkscrews is known as an Irish bow or Irish harp. The other looks much like a modern Swiss Army knife.","Today’s standard bottle of wine contains 750 milliliters, which comes out to just over 25 ounces. A standard restaurant pour is five ounces, meaning that each standard bottle will contain five glasses of wine.\nThe sizes and shapes of glass bottles have changed and evolved significantly throughout the years before the majority of the wine world settled on the 750-milliliter bottle around the early 1980s.\nThere is a multitude of different-sized wine bottles available for purchase today, ensuring the proper amount of wine can be purchased for any occasion and group size.\nBreaking Down How Many Oz In A Bottle Of Wine\n1. Glass Bottle History\nHumans have been making wine for thousands of years, and in the early days of wine production, the product was stored in “amphorae” which are clay jars or flasks. Information like the producer and style of wine were stamped directly into the sides of the clay containers.\nAs the years went on, the Romans developed the technique of glass blowing, and glass bottles were found to be the superior storage vessel for wine.\nGlass bottles allowed for container transparency, and the glass did not interact with the wine or impart any flavors.\nEarly hand-blown glass bottles were tough to make in uniform size, as glass blowing was a new technique and there was no way to standardize the process.\nFor this reason, customers would bring their own glass bottles when purchasing wine and were served a standard portion.\nIn the 1800s, advancements in manufacturing allowed for standardized bottle production, and most wine bottles at the time were between 700 milliliters and 800 milliliters.\nUp until the 1950s, champagne bottles often contained 800 milliliters.\nIn 1979, the United States decided on 750 milliliters as the standard wine bottle size, which comes out to just over five ounces.\nThis allows for five “standard pours” from each bottle, and the European Union followed suit shortly after to simplify wine importation to the US.\n2. Different Bottle Sizes\nThere are a number of different-sized wine bottles available for purchase today, and the esteemed Madeline Puckette of Wine Folly has labeled the following sizes as the most popular in use today!\n- Split – A split is most often used with Champagne and holds a single serving for one person.\n- Demie – The demie bottle holds half the amount of a standard bottle of wine, and is a suitable option for two people who would each like to enjoy only one glass of wine.\n- Jennie – A jennie holds two-thirds the amount of a standard bottle of wine and contains just over three five-ounce glasses of wine.\n- Standard – The standard wine bottle is the most common size in production today and holds 25 ounces, or five standard wine pours.\n- Magnum – A magnum is a double-sized bottle of wine, and is most often presented as a gift.\n- Double Magnum – The double magnum holds four bottles of wine. This is often the largest sized bottle found at large wine retailers and wineries.\n- Jeroboam – The Jeroboam holds six standard bottles worth of wine, making it a great option for medium-sized parties and celebrations.\n- Imperial – The imperial is equal to the size of two double magnums, or eight standard wine bottles. At this size, it is difficult for one sommelier to handle the large bottle, and two servers are often needed to ensure proper pouring.\n- Salmanazar – The Salmanazar holds the equivalent of a full case of wine in just one bottle, totaling the same amount of fluid as 12 standard bottles, and containing almost 61 five-ounce pours.\n- Balthazar – The balthazar holds enough wine to serve over 80 glasses, and is equal to 16 standard bottles of wine.\n- Nebuchadnezzar – Totaling in at the equivalent of 20 standard wine bottles, the nebuchadnezzar contains enough wine to pour over 100 glasses, making it the ultimate showpiece at large weddings, anniversary parties, and other large-scale celebrations.\n- Solomon – The Solomon is the largest wine bottle produced by many bottle makers today and is massive enough to hold two full cases of wine inside, or 24 bottles. Bottles are not often made larger than this, as they become extremely heavy and tough to transport.\n|Bottle Type||Ounces||Milliliters||Standard 5oz Pours|\n3. Ounces vs Milliliters\nWhile the Imperial system is standard in the United States today, most of the rest of the world uses the Metric system of measurement. For this reason, wine is usually measured in milliliters, and not ounces.\nWhen deciding on the size of a “standard” wine bottle, the United States chose 750 milliliters for its similarity to the American Fifth, a measurement used in hard liquor sales.\nAn ounce is equal to just under 30 milliliters, and there is a simple formula for determining the number of ounces in a bottle of wine.\nSimply take the number of milliliters displayed on the bottle, and divide that number by 29.57. The result will be the number of fluid ounces present."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:569006ce-455f-412c-a761-b956e87cf4cd>","<urn:uuid:c00a6e77-44b8-4aea-afaa-3c115c2dcc99>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Hey, I'm into marine life! Which has more diverse sea creatures - Grand Bahama Island or the Great Barrier Reef?","answer":"The Great Barrier Reef has significantly more marine diversity. While Grand Bahama's waters have dolphins and fish around its reefs, the Great Barrier Reef is the world's largest coral reef ecosystem with approximately 1,500 species of fish, 400 species of corals, 4,000 species of molluscs, 16 species of sea snake, 6 species of sea turtle, and large populations of dugong. The reef system spans 348,700 square kilometres, making it the largest marine protected area in the world.","context":["What to do in Grand Bahama Island\nGrand Bahama Island, 60 miles off the coast of Florida, is the second most popular tourist destination in the Bahamas, with the Nassau/Paradise Island area receiving the most visitors. Many of the island's casinos and hotels are clustered in Freeport and on Lucaya's waterfront. Unlike the Nassau/Paradise Island area, Grand Bahama Island has undeveloped stretches, including the Lucayan National Park. Families looking for laid back vacations geared toward scuba or snorkeling should also consider the Out Islands of the Bahamas, also known as the \"Family Islands.\" Top destinations include Exuma and Andros.\nAlong with soft sands, both Lucaya Beach and Xanadu Beach draw crowds with their jet-skiing, para-sailing, and other water sport activities. For a more secluded spot, head to Gold Rock Beach in Lucayan National Park, about 25 miles east of Freeport. One of the island's most beautiful beaches, Gold Rock's wide stretch of dune-bordered coral sands attracts locals on weekends, but few visitors on weekdays. On a Grand Bahama Nature Tours' (www.grandbahamanaturetours.com) outing, kayak through mangrove canopied creeks, picnic on the beach, and swim in the turquoise water. Afterwards, walk a nature trail and explore a cave in search of stalactites and stalagmites.\nAnother top Grand Bahama attraction involves interacting with dolphins at UNEXSO. Participants of all ages are invited to sit on the dock, dangling their toes in the water, while learning about and getting the chance to touch bottlenose dolphins. To swim with them, participants must be at least 55 inches tall. UNEXSO also offers the unusual option of frolicking with the dolphins in open water.\nAndros Island and the Exumas pull divers and snorkelers with their bountiful reefs. Off the Andros shore, the third largest barrier reef in the world sparkles with more than 90 miles of coral formations abundant with fish. Central Park lures snorkelers and divers with its large stands of elkhorn coral growing in 15 feet of water. Divers explore blue holes further out, where the water plunges to a depth of 100 feet. Small Hope Bay Lodge, a family-friendly property, arranges snorkeling trips as well as dive expeditions.\nWrecks and reefs rich with marine life abound in the waters of the Exumas, a chain of 365 mostly uninhabited cays that stretch for 120 miles. The Exuma National Land and Sea Park gains fame for its sunken ships and blue holes swirling with fish. The shallow waters off Great Exuma and Little Exuma attract snorkelers with their sea fans and abundant coral. Dive Exuma, one of several outfitters, is located in George Town, Exuma, and the family-friendly Four Seasons Resort Great Exuma at Emerald Bay also arranges snorkel and dive outings.\nTip: Rake n' scrape, a musical genre Bahamians claim to have created, has as its base the goat skin drum and the African rhythms. Over the years, islanders added utilitarian instruments, creating beats by striking a stick against a washboard, scraping a saw with a knife, and eventually added a guitar. This music can still be heard on the laid-back, sparsely populated Out Islands.

The use of identification books and underwater cards can be useful\nin identifying commonly encountered species. Body and mouth shape are often\nthe best key features in identifying the type of fish. The reef fish section\nof the marine biology manual will outline the features of the mostcommonly\nencoungered families of fish. Aim to learn the name of just one fish every\ntime you visit the reef, and you will quickly know the most commonly encountered\n|ARE WE GOING TO SEE ANY SHARKS ?\nIf you see a shark while visiting the reef, consider yourself very lucky as sharks\nare not frequently encountered by visitors. Of those which are seen the most\ncommonly encountered are the white tip reef and black tip reef sharks. Easily\nidentified by the white markings on the tips of the dorsal fins, they are often\nfound resting upon the sea floor. Like most sharks white tip's are extremely\ntimid and won't stay long around divers. Most sharks found on the reef are\nfish eaters and therefore pose no threat to visitors. Do not harass or block\noff a shark's exit as they may attack out of fear.\n|WHAT ABOUT STINGERS ?\nThe box jellyfish is found in the coastal waters of North Queensland during summer\nmonths (October to March). Visitors wishing to swim during this period should\nonly do so in protective swimming enclosures or wear protective clothing. The\nbox jellyfish is a coastal species and is not found out on the reef, but they\ncan sometimes be found around islands close to the mainland. Other stingers\nthat are sometimes encountered on the reef include the irukandji and blue bottle.\nBoth can cause a nasty sting, Vinegar can used on both box jellyfish and irukandji\nstings but not on blue bottle stings. For blue bottles use cold water and ice.\n|WHY ISN'T CORAL VERY COLOURFUL ?\nMost visitors to the reef comment that the coral isn't very colourful as they\nare used to seeing brightly coloured images in books and on television. Natural\nwhite light is made up of all the colours of the rainbow; underwater, these\ncolours are filtered at different depths with red and yellow disappearing first.\nThis gives the reef a predominantly blue/green appearance. Photographs and\nvideo are taken using lights to show the true colours of the reef. So the colours\nare there, it's just that you need white light to see them. This is why night\ndiving on the reef is so spectacular.\n|WHAT ARE CORALS ?\nCoral are made up of a thin layer of living animals called polyps, which secrete\na chalky, limestone skeleton as they grow. Coral colonies grow as the polyps\ndivide and multiply in a process known as budding. In addition to catching\nplanktonic prey with their tentacles corals also derive nourishment from simple\nsingle celled algae called zooxanthellae (pronounced zoo-zan-thelly). living\nwithin their tissues. Like all plants, zooxanthellae photosynthesize, producing\nnutrients from the suns energy which are used by the polyp for its own nutrition.\nCorals with zooxanthellae are able to lay down limestone skeletons up to three\ntimes faster than those corals without.\n|WHAT TYPE OF CORAL IS THAT ?\nTrying to identify particular species of coral is very difficult. What makes\nit so difficult is that one type of coral may appear as a branching form in\ncalm water and look like a plate coral in another area. In many cases it is\nthe environmental conditions, such as wave action, light levels and the amount\nof sediment in the water, that influence coral colony shape. The easiest way\nto identify corals is by their appearance * boulder * branching * plate * table\n* vase * bushy * solitary\nWHAT ABOUT CORAL SPAWNING ?\nEvery year over one third of the reef's 350 species of coral reproduce sexually\nduring a mass spawning event. The majority of inner reefs spawn around November\nwith the outer reefs spawning later in December. Spawning always takes place\nat night, and follows any time up to six days after the full moon. Eggs and sperm\nare released into the water where they eventually combine to form a free swimming\nplanktonic larval stage.\nWHY IS THE REEF SO FAR OFFSHORE ?\nMost of the Great Barrier Reef is located off the mainland of Queensland. Corals\nneed clear waters which are low in nutrients. They cannot tolerate freshwater\nor nutrients carried in the water run-off from the mainland. That is why the\nmost diverse and abundant corals grow offshore where the environmental conditions\nare more suitable.\nWHAT IS THE WATER CLARITY GOING TO BE\nThe clarity of water on the reef is determined by a combination of the amount\nof sediment and the amount of phytoplankton in the water. Sediment becomes suspended\ndue to increased water motion caused by tide changes, high winds and storms.\nPhytoplankton are the microscopic plants that drift around in the water. They\nare more numerous in areas where the nutrient levels of the water are higher\nparticularly around coastal reefs which receive nutrient rich runoff from the\n|ARE WE GOING TO SEE\nANY WHALES ?\nWhales are normally encountered during the winter months when they migrate up\nto the reef from Antarctic waters to mate and give birth. One of the most spectacular\nvisitors during this period is the Humpback. They are seen in the shallow coastal\nwaters of the Great Barrier Reef ranging from Hervey Bay to\nPort Douglas. Whale watching is conducted by a number of tourist operators through\nthese areas. The Minke is another species of whale seen during winter, particularly\naround the Ribbon Reef area. The smallest whales, the dolphins can be seen all\nyear round in most parts of the reef. * What about Crown-of-Thorns Starfish?\nThe cause of Crown of Thorn Starfish outbreaks is still the focus of a lot of\nresearch and debate. Increased nutrients from the mainland and effects due to\nEl Nino are all being investigated as is the possibility that it is a naturally\noccurring event. Crown of Thorns starfish may actually serve to maintain coral\ndiversity on the reef by feeding on the fast growing species, that if left unchecked,\ncould dominate the reef.\n|WHERE CAN WE GO FISHING ON THE REEF\nFishing is not allowed in green national park zones or pink preservation and\norange scientific zones. In other zones fishing is allowed subject to Queensland\nfisheries restrictions. Legal sizes, closed seasons and catch quotas also apply\nto a variety of fish and shellfish. The following animals are totally protected:\nwhales, porpoises, dolphins, dugong and turtles, clam, trumpet and helmet shells,\nfemale crabs all grouper and cod over 1.2 metres. What about the weather? In\ngeneral the average passenger is not so much concerned with the weather as they\nare with how it will influence their day at the reef.

{"question":"Which architectural patterns better handle decoupling: MQTT's broker model or ESB's bus infrastructure?","answer":"Both MQTT and ESB achieve decoupling but through different mechanisms. MQTT decouples systems through its broker model, where publishers and subscribers never directly connect and remain independent through topic-based communication. ESB achieves decoupling by implementing a bus infrastructure with messaging servers like JMS or AMQP, where applications communicate through adapters without knowledge of other systems. The ESB approach includes additional features like data marshaling, canonical message formats, and transformation capabilities in the adapters, while MQTT maintains a simpler, more flexible approach to data content.","context":["Simply connect your systems to MQTT\nThe MQTT protocol is a widely used protocol in the IoT (Internet of Things). MQTT works according to the publisher/subscriber principle and operates via a central broker. This means that senders and recipients have no direct connection, but the data sources report their data via a publish and all recipients interested in certain messages (identified by the “topic”) receive the data because they have registered as subscribers.\nIn the industrial environment there are many sensors as publishers and superimposed systems as subscribers. In contrast to OPC UA, the data content of messages remains unspecified and is specified by the publisher. In OPC UA, on the other hand, the structures of the communicated data are predefined.\nWith the OPC Router as MQTT subscriber you can use data from MQTT Publisher and pass it on to any system via the other plug-ins (OPC UA, SAP, SQL Databases, Email, REST, etc.). As a MQTT publisher the OPC Router can send data from non-MQTT-enabled sources to a broker to provide any MQTT subscriber with data.\nSee also our Step by Step tutorials to connect the leading IoT platforms via MQTT:\nConnect to the Azure IoT Hub with the MQTT Client\nConnect the AWS IoT Cloud via MQTT\nConnect the IBM Watson Platform via MQTT\nThat’s how easy it is.\nThe MQTT Client Transfer object allows you to send messages as a publisher. The configuration of the broker is done in the instance of the plug-in. The Topic and Payload fields are transferred to the transfer object.\nWhen the transfer is completed, the data is sent to the broker and thus transferred to the subscribers.\nThe XPath or JPath plug-ins can be used very well to structure the data in the payload.\nThe MQTT Client Plug-in provides an MQTT trigger to activate connections.\nThe MQTT trigger is a subscriber for a certain topic (wildcard possible) on a broker. If a message is received, the trigger will provide the topic and the payload in the connection.\nThe browsing of topics is not provided in MQTT protocol. For this reason, the MQTT Client Plug-in does not offer browsing.\nMQTT Client Plug-in Application Examples\nIoT and Cloud Connection\nThe IoT lives from intelligent “things” on the one hand, but also from the comprehensive networking of things on the other. This is achieved by the Cloud and IoT platforms. Most of these platforms have the IoT protocol MQTT as one of their primary interfaces. The data to the digital twins of things is exchanged with the real things via MQTT. The OPC Router with its MQTT client plug-in can serve as a communication partner for these platforms and thus send data from the real world into the platform, but also the way out of the cloud back to the things is possible. What can be regarded as a “thing” from the point of view of OPC Router results from the plug-ins of OPC Router. By combining each of its plug-ins with the MQTT client plug-in, printers, SQL servers, SAP systems and many more can be integrated into the respective IoT platform. Common IoT platforms are for example Amazon AWS IoT (manual for the AWS IoT Cloud connection with MQTT), Microsoft Azure (manual for the connection of Azure IoT Hub with MQTT), IBM Watson, ThingWorx.\nData acquisition from sensors and devices\nThe MQTT protocol has been specifically designed for low bandwidth devices and networks. Therefore, small and low-power devices and sensors are predestined MQTT data sources. With the OPC Router, data from these data sources can be received via a broker and transferred to processing systems such as SQL servers, SAP systems, printers, and others (see plug-ins). Since the MQTT data traffic is bidirectional, data can also be sent to the devices and sensors in this way to make settings or trigger actions.\nExample of an MQTT to SQL Transfer\nData is received from a broker via MQTT client plug-in. The reception activates the trigger. The trigger makes payload available and data is written directly to an SQL table via the MS SQL Server plug-in.\nHere you will find further information\nabout OPC Router and Plug-ins.","I wrote a post a while back, To ESB or not to ESB, about when to use an ESB and when not to. It got a fair bit of pick up, and I’ve had a lot of people reach out to me about it with specific use cases. It got me thinking it’s time to revisit the topic and provide more practical information about your options for integration.\nThis is a multi-part post where I’m going to start by defining what an ESB really is, offering up alternatives for the integration landscape and then finish off with how Mule fits into this landscape.\n- ESB or not to ESB – original post\n- ESB or not to ESB revisited – Part 1. What is an ESB? (this post)\n- ESB or not to ESB revisited – Part 2. ESB and Hub n’ Spoke Architectures\n- ESB or not to ESB Revisited – Part 3, API Layer and Grid Processing Architecture\nESB is an Architecture\nESB is fundamentally an architecture; It is a set of rules and principals for integrating numerous applications together over a bus-like infrastructure. ESB products enable users to build this type of architecture but vary wildly in the way that they do it and the capabilities that they offer.\nThe concept of the ESB architecture is that you integrate different applications by putting a communication bus between them and then enable each application to talk to the bus. This decouples systems from each other, allowing them to communicate without having a dependency or knowledge of other systems on the bus. The concept of ESB was born out of the need to move away from point-to-point integration, which becomes brittle and hard to manage over time. Commonly, the ESB is often drawn as follows:\n- The ‘bus’ concept decouples applications from each other, this is usually achieved using a messaging server like JMS or AMQP.\n- The data that travels on the bus is a canonical format and is almost always XML\n- There is an ‘Adapter’ between the application and the bus that marshals data between the two\n- The adapter is responsible for talking to the back-end application and transforming data from the application format to the bus format. The adapter can also perform a host of other activities such as message routing transaction management, security, monitoring, error handling, etc.\n- ESBs are generally stateless; the state is embedded in the messages passing through the bus.\n- The canonical message format is the contract between systems. If you speak the canonical format, you can communicate with other applications.\nThe ESB diagram above has no mention of messaging servers or adapters between applications, to be more accurate we can add the next level of detail:\nWhere is the Bus?\nI find that the ‘B’ in ESB confuses people since there is no actual bus, at least not in the way people think about a bus. In reality, there is a messaging server such as JMS, AMQP, Tibco RV or WebsphereMQ used as the communication channel. The messaging server is responsible for delivering the messages between application adapters. So in truth, the Bus is real as the set of the queue through which data can be sent and received. These act like well-defined addresses for the Adapters to communicate with each other. Typically an application adapter will have an inbound and outbound queue to receive and send messages.\nTo build on our previous example the ESB architecture looks something like this:\nThe ESB Adapter is really where a lot of the magic happens. This is where data marshaling, transformation, security, transaction management and mediation is handled. There are usually another set of capabilities that an ESB product provides for managing to monitor and governing the implementation.\nESB is just one architecture\nWe see a number of different architectures that people build to solve their integration needs. These range from very simple requirements to full-blown strategic architectures for integration. In part 2 of this post, I will explore other architectures used for integration such as Hub and Spoke, Grid, Pipeline, Enterprise Service Network and simply embedding integration inside a WebApp. I will provide some context of the pros and cons of each approach.\nIn the meantime, I hope this has helped put some clarity around what an ESB architecture is as well as the principals behind it.\nRead on about the next part of this series ESB or not to ESB revisited – Part 2."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:034556f8-6654-45af-98ad-8dc07fb4e152>","<urn:uuid:879d63d3-f843-4c12-8d23-45e4ac81fd3c>"],"error":null}
{"question":"As a curriculum developer, I'm interested in understanding the differences between daily class activities in basic Latin courses versus the progression into more advanced studies. How do these approaches compare?","answer":"Basic Latin courses are structured around foundational daily activities like group recitation and memorization exercises. In contrast, advanced Latin studies progress through distinct developmental stages. The basic level includes daily activities like vocabulary review, flashcard games, and cultural lessons, with classes meeting 55 minutes daily and including about 30 minutes of homework. A typical session involves grammar songs, choral recitation, translations, and vocabulary practice. As students advance, they move into the 'pert' and 'poetic' stages, where the focus shifts to understanding linguistic rules, exploring word relationships, and eventually reaching the rhetoric stage where they learn effective communication. Advanced students learn to express their own thoughts in Latin and explore the flexibility of Latin word order, moving beyond the basic translation and memorization exercises of earlier levels.","context":["My classes meet five days per week for 55 minutes per class. I expect around 30 minutes of homework outside of class. For three days of the week, we work together through what I have termed \"sessions.\" The fourth day is dedicated to vocabulary review (flashcard games) and exercises that practice the new vocabulary and grammar for the lesson. The fifth day is dedicated to a grammar quiz and Roman culture lesson (daily life in Rome, history, mythology, etc.)\nFor days one to three, we work through two sessions each day (six sessions for the week), one session in class, and one session at home. This allows the class to complete one Oerberg Lectiō/Lesson per week. Each of the six sessions takes 40 minutes to an hour to complete, depending on the speed of the student or class. One session comprises six activities: 1) A grammar song linked to the grammar covered in first-year Latin (these are linked to my blog under the \"Sing\" tab; 2) A choral recitation where students practice reading the Latin session aloud (around 5 to 10 lines); we do this as a class and it must be out loud (no silent reading); 3) A translation of the session without any resources; for this section, I usually read sentence by sentence from the section and draw pictures to illustrate the content; I try to speak mostly in Latin, but I freely define words in English on the board; 4) A collection of margin notes for new vocabulary and grammar; students use my definitions and illustrations as their margin notes in their notebook, so the translation and margin notes sections happen at the same time; 5) A short oral conversation using the new vocabulary; these are available to my students who have paid for my class, but you can invent a conversation of your own with the students using the new words, or just ask students comprehension questions in Latin; it's very important at this point to have the students write their own question using at least one of the new words; this activates their new knowledge and makes it personal to them; they should have time to ask and answer these questions with partners; 6) A reverse translation of the section; for this part, students take their English translation and try to retranslate it with good Latin; Oerberg's Latin is the key; I usually write the sentences one at a time on the board, making many mistakes that I think students could make, then I go down the rows asking students if they see any mistakes; students really like to see me make mistakes, and they think it is fun to correct me; I always let students pass if they can't find a mistake.\nStudents complete each \"Session\" on one sheet of paper divided into quadrants. Upper-left is for the translation. Upper-right is for the margin notes. Bottom-left is for the conversation notes and questions. Bottom-right is for the reverse translation.\nHere's a breakdown of time for each activity: 1) 3 minutes; 2) 2 minutes; 3) 10 minutes; 4) 5 minutes; 5) 10 minutes; 6) 10 minutes. On a good day, I can get through one session in about 40 minutes. Students are responsible for completing the next session at home. By the time that they have finished one session, they remember and can use the new vocabulary and grammar for the new section of text (usually 3-5 new concepts).\nStudents don't get tired of the story, because they are learning to write and speak Latin with their classmates. They are not just learning to read and recognize a familiar text. The goal is text creation, not just recognition. My students' minds are too active to get bored. I haven't found the need to supplement with other texts.","(The following is the second part of a two-part series on Latin at Petra Academy. Click here to read part 1).\nAt Petra, we begin our 3rd through 6th grade Latin classes with “Jingles and Chants,” foundational elements of the Latin language sung or rhythmically chanted by the group as a whole. The rhythm and rhyme of the chants serves as a memory aid for students, and the daily group recitation helps ease the burden of memorizing copious amounts of Latin endings and forms, as required in the study of this particular language.\nIn addition to the daily recitation of these jingles and chants, the students are taught how to recall the information contained in them as a reference while they work. The ability to learn large amounts of information and recall and apply specific details when needed is a skill that will benefit students well beyond their years of Latin study. It is a foundational skill upon which many other skills will be built, just as learning Latin grammar is the basis for more advanced language study.\nAs the student develops, he is less inclined to be satisfied with sheer memorization and begins to ask “Why?” with reference to how the language works the way it does. He wants to know why verbs have six endings in the active voice of each tense while nouns have ten endings per declension. He wants to know why prepositional phrases in English aren’t always prepositional phrases in Latin. He wants to know why Latin has so many endings and why Latin word order doesn’t make sense to his English thinking mind.\nWhen the student begins raising questions such as these, he has entered the “pert” stage and is ready to learn the logic of Latin. Logic is concerned with the thing as it is known, and is the science and art of thinking. It is at this point in a student’s Latin instruction that he should be taught the relationship between words and how those relationships are demonstrated by the inflections used. In short, now that the student has learned the vocabulary and endings in the grammar stage, he is ready to learn how the endings change as the word is used differently in the sentence. He is ready to think about the function of the word in the sentence, not just its meaning.\nIn Petra’s Latin program, the transition into the logic of Latin begins in 6th grade and continues through 8th and 9th grades. In 6th grade, our students begin thinking about language in a different way than they have before. In their English classes, they learn to differentiate the parts of speech and the functions they perform in the context of a sentence. This understanding carries over into Latin and they begin to see the words not just as a part of speech (e.g. noun), but as a functional element of a sentence, performing a specific job in relation to the other words of the sentence (e.g. indirect object).\nStudents learn to think about the idea conveyed instead of just the words displayed. In logic stage Latin, students begin to apply linguistic rules to words instead of just memorizing the endings for that word. They begin to see patterns and predict the endings a word might have based on their understanding of the language. They add the skill of translation to their foundation of memorization.\nAs the student learns the mechanics of the language, he begins to try his hand at expressing his own thoughts in Latin to see if others can correctly understand his meaning. He beings to play at word choice and to explore the freedoms found in the flexibility of Latin word order. As the student moves into the “poetic” stage of development, he becomes more concerned with the science and art of communication, known as rhetoric.\nRhetoric emphasizes the effectiveness of communication and it is in the rhetoric stage of Latin study that ideas are effectively conveyed through persuasive articulation. Much like the swift deployment of a Roman legion to quell an uprising, a well presented truth can travel the time honored road of rhetoric, built on the foundations of logic and grammar, to tear down a falsehood.\nRhetoric is the culmination of language study. Without the truth of logic rooted in the correctness of grammar, though, the effectiveness of rhetoric stumbles short. Children are developmentally predisposed to first learning the vocabulary and inflections of Latin grammar, followed by how the vocabulary and inflections function in relationship with one another, before learning how to effectively use the vocabulary in conjunction with the inflected constructions to express themselves in Latin. Effective communication is the goal of language study, but it cannot be accomplished without the foundation of grammar."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:28b5e9e0-50c5-4d44-8586-9f4a4a8dac86>","<urn:uuid:31b04520-5bc7-4a99-809d-1d6893dc4259>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What role do level systems play in the scoring mechanics of Minecraft versus Tetris?","answer":"In Minecraft, levels exist primarily in terms of game difficulty settings and modes (like survival vs. creative), affecting aspects such as monster spawning and resource gathering. In Tetris, levels play a direct mathematical role in scoring, with most versions incorporating a level multiplier into the point system. For example, in the Nintendo scoring system, points for line clears are multiplied by (level + 1), and in recent guideline-compatible Tetris games, all scoring actions (including Singles, Doubles, T-Spins, and combos) are multiplied by the current level, making higher levels significantly more rewarding for scoring.","context":["Virtually Jenna V.33 !EXCLUSIVE! Full Game 18-mediafire.27\nMinecraft is a sandbox game developed by Mojang Studios. The game was created by Markus \"Notch\" Persson in the Java programming language. Following several early private testing versions, it was first made public in May 2009 before being fully released in November 2011, with Notch stepping down and Jens \"Jeb\" Bergensten taking over development. Minecraft is the best-selling video game in history, with over 238 million copies sold and nearly 140 million monthly active players as of 2021[update] and has been ported to several platforms.\nVirtually Jenna v.33 Full Game 18-mediafire.27\nIn Minecraft, players explore a blocky, procedurally generated, three-dimensional world with virtually infinite terrain and may discover and extract raw materials, craft tools and items, and build structures, earthworks, and machines. Depending on their chosen game mode, players can fight hostile mobs, as well as cooperate with or compete against other players in the same world. Game modes include a survival mode (in which players must acquire resources to build in the world and maintain health) and a creative mode (in which players have unlimited resources and access to flight). There is also a wide variety of user-generated content, such as modifications, servers, skins, texture packs, and custom maps, which add new game mechanics and possibilities.\nThe game world is virtually infinite and procedurally generated as players explore it, using a map seed that is obtained from the system clock at the time of world creation (or manually specified by the player). There are limits on vertical movement, but Minecraft allows an infinitely large game world to be generated on the horizontal plane. Due to technical issues when extremely distant locations are reached, however, there is a barrier preventing players from traversing to locations beyond 30 million blocks from the center.[j][obsolete source] The game achieves this by splitting the world data into smaller sections called \"chunks\" that are only created or loaded when players are nearby. The world is divided into biomes ranging from deserts to jungles to snowfields; the terrain includes plains, mountains, forests, caves, and bodies of water or lava. The in-game time system follows a day and night cycle, with one full cycle lasting for 20 real-time minutes.\nIn survival mode, players have to gather natural resources such as wood and stone found in the environment in order to craft certain blocks and items. Depending on the difficulty, monsters spawn in darker areas outside a certain radius of the character, requiring players to build a shelter at night. The mode also has a health bar which is depleted by attacks from mobs, falls, drowning, falling into lava, suffocation, starvation, and other events. Players also have a hunger bar, which must be periodically refilled by eating food in-game (except in peaceful difficulty). If the hunger bar is depleted, automatic healing will stop and eventually health will deplete. Health replenishes when players have a nearly full hunger bar or continuously on peaceful difficulty.\nThe first major update, dubbed Alpha, was released on 30 June 2010. Although Persson maintained a day job with Jalbum.net at first, he later quit in order to work on Minecraft full-time as sales of the alpha version of the game expanded. Persson continued to update the game with releases distributed to users automatically. These updates included new items, new blocks, new mobs, survival mode, and changes to the game's behavior (e.g. how water flows). To back the development of Minecraft, Persson set up a video game company, Mojang, with the money earned from the game. Mojang co-founders included Jakob Porser, one of Persson's coworkers from King, and Carl Manneh, jAlbum's CEO.\nMojang moved the game out of beta and released the full version on 18 November 2011. On 1 December 2011, Jens \"Jeb\" Bergensten took full creative control over Minecraft, replacing Persson as lead designer. On 28 February 2012, Mojang announced that they had hired the developers of the popular \"Bukkit\" developer API for Minecraft, to improve Minecraft's support of server modifications. This acquisition also included Mojang apparently taking full ownership of the CraftBukkit server mod which enables the use of Bukkit, although the validity of this claim was questioned due to its status as an open-source project with many contributors, licensed under the GNU General Public License and Lesser General Public License.\nSince the first full release of Minecraft, dubbed the \"Adventure Update\", the game has been continuously updated with many major updates, available for free to users who have already purchased the game. Early updates frequently introduced gameplay-altering mechanics while more recent updates tend to enhance the game through additional content or tweaks to existing features.[better source needed] The most recent major update to the game was \"The Wild Update\", which released in June 2022 and added new creatures, biomes, and items.\nAn initial beta test was carried out between 9 June and 1 November 2016. The full game was then released on Windows 10 and MacOS on 1 November 2016. On 20 August 2018, Mojang announced that it would bring Education Edition to iPadOS in Autumn 2018. It was released to the App Store on 6 September 2018. On 27 March 2019, it was announced that it would be operated by JD.com in China. On 26 June 2020, a public beta for the Education Edition was made available to Google Play Store compatible Chromebooks. The full game was released to the Google Play Store for Chromebooks on 7 August 2020.\nAfter nearly one and a half years in beta, Microsoft fully released Minecraft for Windows on December 19, 2016. Called the \"Ender Update\", this release implemented new features to this version of Minecraft like world templates and add-on packs. This version has the ability to play with Xbox Live friends, and to play local multiplayer with owners of Minecraft on other Bedrock platforms. Other features include the ability to use multiple control schemes such as a gamepad, keyboard, or touchscreen (for Microsoft Surface and other touchscreen-enabled devices). Virtual reality support has been implemented, as well as the ability to record and take screenshots in-game via the Windows built-in GameDVR.\nAround 2011, prior to Minecraft's full release, there had been collaboration between Mojang and The Lego Group to make a Lego brick-based Minecraft game to be called Brickcraft. This would have modified the base Minecraft game to use Lego bricks, which meant adapting the basic 11 block to account for larger pieces typically used in Lego sets. Persson had worked on the preliminary version of this game, which he had named \"Project Rex Kwon Do\" based on the joke from Napoleon Dynamite. Lego had greenlit the project to go forward, and while Mojang had put two developers on the game for six months, they later opted to cancel the project, as Mojang felt that the Lego Group were too demanding on what they could do, according to Mojang's Daniel Kaplan. The Lego Group had considered buying out Mojang to complete the game, but at this point Microsoft made its offer to buy the company for over $2 billion. According to the Lego Group's Ronny Scherer, the company was not yet sure of the potential success of Minecraft at this point and backed off from acquisition after Microsoft brought this offer to Mojang.\nMinecraft is recognized as one of the first successful games to use an early access model to draw in sales prior to its full release version to help fund development. As Minecraft helped to bolster indie game development in the early 2010s, it also helped to popularize the use of the early access model in indie game development.\nIn April 2014, the Danish Geodata Agency generated all of Denmark in fullscale in Minecraft based on their own geodata. This is possible because Denmark is one of the flattest countries with the highest point at 171 metres (561 ft) (ranking as the country with the 30th smallest elevation span), where the limit in default Minecraft is around 192 metres (630 ft) above in-game sea level.\nMinecraft has also been used in educational settings. In 2011, an educational organization named MinecraftEdu was formed with the goal of introducing Minecraft into schools. The group works with Mojang to make the game affordable and accessible to schools. The version of Minecraft through MinecraftEdu includes unique features to allow teachers to monitor the students' progress within the virtual world, such as receiving screenshots from students to show completion of a lesson. In September 2012, MinecraftEdu said that approximately 250,000 students around the world have access to Minecraft through the company. A wide variety of educational activities involving the game have been developed to teach students various subjects, including history, language arts and science. For an example, one teacher built a world consisting of various historical landmarks for students to learn and explore. Another teacher created a large-scale representation of an animal cell within Minecraft that student could explore and learn how the cell functions work. Great Ormond Street Hospital has been recreated in Minecraft, and it proposed that patients can use it to virtually explore the hospital before they actually visit. Minecraft may also prove as an innovation in Computer Aided Design (CAD). Minecraft offers an outlet of collaboration in design and could have an impact on the industry.","After Tetris for Game Boy, most games adopted a scoring system designed to reward difficult clears by giving points for more lines cleared at once. Some systems also encouraged starting at higher difficulty.\nOriginal BPS scoring system\nIf the piece was hard dropped, an amount equal to the number of rows covered by the hard drop plus 1 is added. Otherwise, no score for dropping is added.\nPoints are only totalled up either after the stage is cleared or if a life is lost.\nOriginal Sega scoring system\n|Points for soft dropping pieces|\n|0-1||100||400||900||2000||1 per line|\n|2-3||200||800||1800||4000||2 per line|\n|4-5||300||1200||2700||6000||3 per line|\n|6-7||400||1600||3600||8000||4 per line|\n|8+||500||2000||4500||10000||5 per line|\nIf a line clear is also a Perfect Clear, a 10x multiplier is applied to the awarded points.\nOriginal Nintendo scoring system\nThis system is a version of the BPS system with a level multiplier incorporated. It was used in Nintendo's versions of Tetris for NES, for Game Boy, and for Super NES, as well as in Bullet Proof Software's versions beginning with Tetris 2 + Bombliss, though with minor variations in the score for soft drops.\n|n||40 * (n + 1)||100 * (n + 1)||300 * (n + 1)||1200 * (n + 1)|\nFor each piece, the game also awards the number of points equal to the number of grid spaces that the player has continuously soft dropped the piece. Unlike the points for lines, this does not increase per level.\nList of games\nThe following is a list of games that use this system, along with notes and differences:\n- Tetris (Game Boy): Awards points for soft dropping based only on the last press that leads to a lock; any earlier soft drops are not counted.\n- Tetris (NES, Nintendo): Awards points for soft dropping based only on the last press that leads to a lock; any earlier soft drops are not counted. Soft dropping points are buggy due to a miscoded BCD addition. Level multiplier is based on the level after the line clear, not before (as in other games in this list).\n- Tetris 2 + Bombliss: Awards 0-5 points if piece is soft dropped based on the amount of time the soft drop button is pressed. Tetrises from level 55 onwards are affected by integer overflow and as a result score much less (e.g. lv. 55 Tetris scores 66000-65536 = 464 points).\n- Super Tetris 2 + Bombliss (research pending)\n- Tetris & Dr. Mario: Level multiplier is based on the level after the line clear, not before. Multiplier stops increasing after level 9 (hence capped at 10).\n- Super Tetris 3: Awards 0-6 points if piece is soft dropped. Standard mode is scored as in BPS Tetris. See the game article for details on Magicaliss scoring.\n- Tetris X: Does not score dropping pieces.\n- Tetris 64: Has no level multiplier. Does not score dropping pieces.\n- Tetris DX: Awards points while pieces are being soft dropped. Level multiplier stops increasing after level 20 (hence capped at 21).\n- SuperLite 1500 Series: The Tetris: Does not score dropping pieces. Awards a fixed 1,000,000 point bonus for a perfect clear.\n- Tetris Worlds: Popular mode (GBA version) only. Base score assigned to level 1, thus level multiplier is (level) not (level + 1). Awards points for soft dropping based only on the last press that leads to a lock; any earlier soft drops are not counted. Hard drops are scored the same as soft drops.\n- Tetris (WonderSwan Color): Base score assigned to level 1. Does not score dropping pieces. Awards a fixed 1,000,000 point bonus for a perfect clear.\n- Minna no Soft Series: Tetris Advance: 1.5× multiplier for back-to-back Tetrises.\n- Tetris Kiwamemichi: Level multiplier is based on the level after the line clear, not before. More research pending.\nMany fangames use this system as well. The following are some notable examples:\n- DTET: Has a combo multiplier of 1 + 0.5*(length of combo - 1) that applies to the whole combo; as a result, line clear scores are only awarded at the end of a combo. Scores for dropping pieces increase by level (research pending).\n- N-Blox: Base score assigned to level 1. Drop points are based solely on the distance the piece falls regardless of whether it was manually dropped or not.\nTetris 4D uses a version of the system with all point values doubled.\nThe New Tetris\nThe New Tetris awards \"lines\": one for each line cleared, one extra line for clearing four lines with one I tetromino, and several lines for clearing parts of a 4x4 square. This does not increase as the game gets faster. Soft and firm drops do not give points; instead, they allow the player to place more tetrominoes (and clear more lines) in the three minute game.\nEach mode of Tetris Worlds has its own scoring system. As in The New Tetris, the unit of score in each mode is \"lines\"; 2-, 3-, and 4-line clears grant additional points in some modes.\nEach mode of Tetris DS has its own scoring system. Most notably, the system used in Standard mode represents a fusion of the 1, 3, 5, 8 pattern used in several modes of Tetris Worlds with the section multiplier of the NES and Game Boy system.\nRecent guideline compatible games\nMost games released after Tetris DS share large parts of their scoring system. The following system is accurate for games that use 3-corner T-Spin and pointing side T-Spin Mini rules (such as Tetris Friends). Level is always considered to be the level before the line clear.\n|Single||100 × level|\n|Double||300 × level|\n|Triple||500 × level|\n|Tetris||800 × level; difficult|\n|T-Spin Mini no lines||100 × level|\n|T-Spin no lines||400 × level|\n|T-Spin Mini Single||200 × level; difficult|\n|T-Spin Single||800 × level; difficult|\n|T-Spin Mini Double (if present)||400 × level; difficult|\n|T-Spin Double||1200 × level; difficult|\n|T-Spin Triple||1600 × level; difficult|\n|Back-to-Back difficult line clears||*3/2|\n(for example, back to back tetris: 1200 × level)\n|Combo||50 × combo count × level|\n|Soft drop||1 point per cell|\n|Hard drop||2 points per cell|\nOnly a Single, Double, or Triple line clear can break a Back-to-Back chain, T-Spin with no lines will not break the chain.\nOften games do not have combo scoring or may calculate it differently. Some games may also award the player bonus points for a perfect clear."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:5c6482af-4253-443b-8af1-2acd9a0874ad>","<urn:uuid:3370f16c-1c9e-45e4-92e7-dfc615d5e25f>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do emotional needs in the human givens approach compare to the social dimensions emphasized in sustainable human development?","answer":"The human givens approach identifies specific emotional needs including security, attention, autonomy, intimacy, community belonging, privacy, status, achievement, and meaning - viewing these as biological imperatives for mental health. In contrast, sustainable human development frames social needs through the lens of solidarity and distributive justice, emphasizing the importance of gender equality and collective social responsibility. While both recognize the importance of social connection, sustainable human development places more emphasis on systemic social transformation and collective wellbeing rather than individual emotional fulfillment.","context":["What are the 'human givens'?\nWe are all born with innate knowledge programmed into us from our genes. Throughout life we experience this knowledge as feelings of physical and emotional need.\nThese feelings evolved over millions of years and, whatever our cultural background, are our common biological inheritance. They are the driving force that motivates us to become fully human and succeed in whatever environment we find ourselves in.\nIt is because these psychological needs are incorporated into our biology at conception that we call them – and the innate resources we have in order to help us meet them – human 'givens' – they are the givens and drivers of human nature.\nOur given physical needs\nAs animals we are born into a material world where we need air to breathe, water, nutritious food and sufficient sleep. These are the paramount physical needs. Without them, we quickly die. In addition we also need the freedom to stimulate our senses and exercise our muscles. We instinctively seek sufficient and secure shelter where we can grow and reproduce ourselves and bring up our young. These physical needs are intimately bound up with our emotional needs — the main focus of human givens psychology.\nOur given psychological needs\nEmotions create distinctive psychobiological states in us and drive us to take action. The emotional needs nature has programmed us with are there to connect us to the external world, particularly to other people, and survive in it. They seek their fulfillment through the way we interact with the environment.\nConsequently, when our human needs are not met in the world, nature ensures we suffer considerable distress — anxiety, anger, depression etc. — and our expression of distress, in whatever form it takes, impacts on those around us.\nIn short, it is by meeting our physical and emotional needs that we survive and develop as individuals and a species.\nThere is widespread agreement as to the nature of our emotional needs – the essential ones for our mental health are listed below.\nEmotional needs include:\n- Security — safe territory and an environment which allows us to develop fully\n- Attention (to give and receive it) — a form of nutrition\n- Sense of autonomy and control — having volition to make responsible choices\n- Emotional intimacy — to know that at least one other person accepts us totally for who we are, “warts 'n' all”\n- Feeling part of a wider community\n- Privacy — opportunity to reflect and consolidate experience\n- Sense of status within social groupings\n- Sense of competence and achievement\n- Meaning and purpose — which come from being stretched in what we do and think.\nOur innate resources\nThe physical and emotional needs that we have are not the only human givens – nature also gave us innate 'guidance systems' to help us meet our needs. We call these 'resources'.\nThe resources nature gave us to help us meet our human needs include:\n- The ability to develop complex long term memory, which enables us to add to our innate knowledge and learn\n- The ability to build rapport, empathise and connect with others\n- Imagination, which enables us to focus our attention away from our emotions, use language and problem solve more creatively and objectively\n- Emotions and instincts\n- A conscious, rational mind that can check out our emotions, question, analyse and plan\n- The ability to 'know' — that is, understand the world unconsciously through metaphorical pattern matching\n- An observing self — that part of us that can step back, be more objective and be aware of itself as a unique centre of awareness, apart from intellect, emotion and conditioning\n- A dreaming brain that preserves the integrity of our genetic inheritance every night by metaphorically defusing expectations held in the autonomic arousal system because they were not acted out the previous day.\nIt is such needs and tools together that make up the human givens, nature's genetic endowment to humanity.\nOver enormous stretches of time, they underwent continuous refinement as they drove our evolution on. They are best thought of as inbuilt patterns — biological templates — that continually interact with one another and (in undamaged people) seek their natural fulfilment in the world in ways that allow us to survive, live together as many-faceted individuals in a great variety of different social groupings, and flourish.\nIt is the way those needs are met, and the way we use the resources that nature has given us, that determine the physical, mental and moral health of an individual.\nAs such, the human givens are the benchmark position to which we must all refer — in education, mental and physical health and the way we organise and run our lives.\nWhen we feel emotionally fulfilled and are operating effectively within society, we are more likely to be mentally healthy and stable. But when too many innate physical and emotional needs are not being met in the environment, or when our resources are used incorrectly, unwittingly or otherwise, we suffer considerable distress – and so do those around us.\nExplore our articles and interviews\nIvan Tyrrell talks with Daniel Nettle about the far closer than expected connection between psychosis and creative thinking.\nIvan Tyrrell talks with Paul Allin about the significance of the Government’s National Well-being Programme and the contribution of the human givens\nRos Jeal describes how she is helping women stop themselves from being lured back into abusive relationships.\nJanice Haddon shows how she has drawn upon the human givens approach to work more creatively with corporate clients.\nAndrew Jones describes how the human givens approach has transformed his effectiveness in his demanding role as a chaplain in the Royal Air Force.\nChris Dyas vividly describes how he teaches troubled children to be their own therapists.\nJames Tapper suggests that Charles Dickens’s famous seasonal novel contains much that reflects the human givens approach to therapy.\nWhy the human givens approach is important for psychotherapy.\nLatest Tweets:Tweets by humangivens\nVolume 25, No 1, 2018, the latest edition of the Human Givens Journal is now available.\nDate posted: 11/06/2018\nBrian Greene and Jennifer Broadley discuss how to apply the human givens approach in couples therapy.\nDate posted: 30/05/2018","Recent issues have dealt with gender equality and clean energy as two necessary ingredients to attain the transition from cosumerism to sustainability. Other ingredients may be necessary, and it is impossible to isolate the combination of ingredients that would be sufficient. However, the ultimate goal of the transition must be made clear, and this goal is integral human development that can be sustained. All other goals, no matter how desirable and how legitimate, are to be pursued to the extent that they support integral human development. The term sustainable human development is defined as\ndevelopment that promotes the integral human development of people today without compromising the integral human development of people tomorrow. This definition is patterned after the Brundtland Report (1987) and Amartya Sen (1999) definitions with additional of emphasis on the integration of the physical and psychological needs of people. Maslow's hierarchy of human needs is used as the basis for \"integrating\" human development. For each level in Maslow's hierarchy, some of the applicable interdisciplinary resources are mentioned and the effort required to use them is assessed, with emphasis on fostering gender equality and clean energy.\nIntegral Human Development\nIntegral human development (IHD) is a concept derived from Catholic social teaching. It entails holistic development of each human person, not in isolation but in solidarity with other people to foster justice and peace. Thus IHD entails holism, solidarity, and peace with justice:\nHolistic: Integral Human Development promotes the good of every person and the whole person; it is economic, social, political,\ncultural, ecological and spiritual. It also promotes the integrity of creation.\nSolidarity: Integral Human Development promotes the rights and responsibilities of each person and of every person to one another.\nJustice and Peace: Integral Human Development promotes a just and peaceful society that respects the dignity of every person.\nIntegral Human Development, Catholic Relief Services, 2008.\nThe concept of integral human development goes back to the emergence of Homo sapiens. It is certainly a biblical concept (Cf. Mark 8:36) rooted in the human vocation to be imago Dei. It encapsulates all dimensions of human well-being. It fully takes into account that humans must live in harmony with the human habitat. It is of course a central theme of Catholic social doctrine, but is by no means restricted to the Catholic ethos.\nDefinition of Sustainable Human Development\nThe Brundtland Report (1987) defines sustainable development as \"a form of development which satisfies the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.\" Even though this was not necessarily the intent of the Brundtland Commission, sustainable development has been narrowly associated with economic development pursuant to meet the material needs of people. In his seminal work, Development as Freedom (1999), Amartya Sen put this misconception to rest by showing that the top priority is to enable people to develop their capabilities to the maximum possible extent. Sen perceives freedom (both physical and psychological) as fundamental for individual and social development.\nrecent presentation about the 2011 Human Development Report (due out November 2011), Eva Jespersen has proposed the following definition of sustainable human development: \"The preservation – and whenever possible expansion – of the substantive freedoms and capabilities of people today while undertaking reasonable efforts to avoid risks that would seriously compromise the capability of future generations to have similar – or greater – freedoms.\" This is a further elaboration of Sen's definition to stress distributive justice, the need to ensure - as much as possible - the freedoms required for further development of human capabilities, and the need for careful analysis of the risks and uncertainties associated with technological development and plans for required substitution of resources. It is a good step forward, both conceptually and analytically. However, it is possible to go even further.\nThe term sustainable human development is defined here as development that promotes the integral human development of each and every human person today without compromising the integral human development of people tomorrow. This definition is patterned after the Brundtland Report (1987) and Amartya Sen (1999) definitions, albeit with additional of emphasis on the integration of the physical, psychological, and spiritual needs of people. People need bread, but they need more than bread. People need respect and esteem, but they still need more. People need freedom to develop their talents and capabilities, but they also need to use freedom and capabilities responsibly. People need to grow in solidarity with others, for it is only in self-giving to others that humans become fully human. This fundamental insight, which is shared by all ethical and religious traditions, must be kept in mind at all times; for sustainability without solidarity is a social impossibility.\n\"The part cannot be well until the whole is well.\" Plato, 428-348 BCE\nMaslow's Hierarchy of Human Needs\nAbraham Maslow (USA, 1908-1970) created the \"hierarchy of human needs\" in the 1940s. Maslow's model explicitly takes into account the physiological, safety, emotional, love/belonging, esteem/self-esteem, and self-actualization stages of integral human development. The hierarchy of human needs is usually represented as a pyramid, with the most basic needs at the bottom and the socialization needs at the top. There are many variations of the pyramid: one is shown to the right and others can be easily found. Going upward, the progression for each human being is to satisfy (1) the basic physical and physiological needs, (2) the need for safety and security, (3) the need psychological well-being, (4) the need for self-actualization (self-esteem, social responsibility), and (5) the need for self-giving to others which, if lived to a heroic degree, leads to people like Francis of Assisi and Teresa of Calcutta. For further discussion of Maslow's \"levels of human development\" - and other models of human development - the reader is referred to the May 2010 issue of Mother Pelican. It is suggested that\nembracing the ethic of solidarity is practically impossible under level 3, and generally requires level 4. What about sustainability?\nOutgrowing Homo economicus and becoming Homo solidarius\nThe ethic of solidarity is basically the ethic of reciprocity. In the Christian tradition, it is also known as the Golden Rule, i.e., \"do to others whatever you would like them to do to you\" (Matthew 7:12, Luke 6:31). The ethical concept of solidarity in modern economics started with the publication of Ethics and the National Economy (Heinrich Pesch SJ, 1918). Outgrowing Homo economicus, and becoming Homo solidarius, basically entails applying the Golden Rule to economic decision-making. In one form or another, the Golden Rule is recognized as a basic norm of human behavior in\nmost religious traditions. It is, however, seldom practiced in today's economic world of neo-liberal capitalism. Homo economicus must become Homo solidarius. People must adapt to the ethic of solidarity. Institutions must adapt to the same ethic. It is hard for people to change as long as institutions don't change, and institutions don't change because people don't change. This is the vicious cycle that must be broken.\n\"Do to others|\nyou would like them\nto do to you.\"\nMatthew 7:12, Luke 6:31\nSee also Luke 10:30-37\nOutgrowing Homo economicus and becoming Homo ecologicus\nAn ethic of solidarity is also needed in the relationship between humanity and the human habitat. Actually, taking good care of the planet is but one application of the ethic of solidarity; for abusing the planet eventually leads to harming people. This has been so the emergence of Homo sapiens (Genesis 2:15), and remains true today; except that today the harm done to people is more observable in terms of health and climate change impacts. Therefore, becoming Homo solidarius and becoming Homo ecologicus is one and the same process. Human solidarity is meaningless if it excludes taking good care of the very natural resources that are indispensable for human survival. Another term for Homo ecologicus is Homo sustinens, i.e., humans capable to living in a sustainable manner. Again, people must adapt to the ethic of sustainability, and institutions must adapt to the same ethic. Else, the vicious cycle of extravagant consumerism and resource exploitation will lead to an increasingly unsustainable outlook for human civilization.\n\"Is it not enough for you|\nto feed on the good pasture?\nMust you also trample the rest\nof your pasture with your feet?\nIs it not enough for you\nto drink clear water?\nMust you also muddy\nthe rest with your feet?\"\nDimensions of Sustainable Human Development\nTwo dimensions of sustainable human development are crucial going forward: gender equality and clean energy. Gender equality is crucial because it is the most universal form of human solidarity. As long as cross-gender solidarity is lacking, how can we expect any other form of solidarity to be sustainable? Clean energy is critical because the environmental predicament confronting humanity is fueled by the burning of fossil fuels. As long as we keep abusing the planet, how can we expect any level of human development to be sustainable?\nTransition from Gender Inequality to Gender Equality\nIt is hard to imagine sustainability without solidarity, and it is hard to imagine sustainable solidarity without gender equality:\nAs Amartya Sen has pointed out, \"development that is not engendered in endangered.\" The wisdom of this statement is confirmed in the World Health Organization's Getting to grips with gender inequality and many other analyses and reports, notably the United Nations' Human Development Reports and Human Development Index.\nTransition from Fossil Fuels to Clean Energy\nThe following time frame was initially offered for consideration in the June 2011 issue of this journal, and has been further refined as follows:\nNote: The following acronyms, and terminology are used in this transition concept and subsequent discussion:\nA brief synopsis of this transition concept is provided below. For further energy transition analysis click here.\nFinancial Transaction Tax (FTT)|\nGlobal Citizens Movement (GCM)\nHuman Development (HD)\nHuman Development Index (HDI)\nHuman Development Report (HDR)\nIntegral Human Development (IHD)\nLand Value Tax (LVT) or Resource Value Tax (RVT)\nMaslow's Hierarchy of Human Needs (MASLOW)|\nNon-Governmental Organization (NGO)\nPrinciple of Solidarity (SOLIDARITY)\nPrinciple of Subsidiarity (SUBSIDIARITY)\nPrinciple of Sustainability (SUSTAINABILITY)\nSustainable Development (SD)\nSustainable Human Development (SHD)\nThere are four phases in this transition concept:\n- The first phase (2011-2020) is concientization to enable incentivation. The objective is to create widespread popular support for the required revisions of tax codes and energy subsidies. In other words, the first phase is about creating a collective mindset of social responsibility. The global citizens movement has received new impetus with the recently launched Widening Circles initiative. The new ISO 26000 guidelines on social responsibility can also be instrumental in fostering a mindset of solidarity and sustainability in business and government.\n- The second phase (2021-2030) is incentivation to enable redistribution. The objective is to reform tax codes and energy subsidies to expedite the transition to clean energy. Applicable reforms include shifting taxes from earned income to unearned resources (via \"Land Value Taxes\" or, more generally, \"Resource Value Taxes\") and taxing financial transactions of dubious social value (via \"Financial Transaction Taxes\"). These resource usage revenues and financial transaction revenues should be set high enough to yield a surplus after public services and clean energy subsidies. This surplus should then be distributed to all citizens via a guaranteed basic income (next phase).\n- The third phase (2031-2040) is redistribution to enable democratization. The objective is to institutionalize democracy with distributive justice. Applicable reforms include adopting a Universally Guaranteed Personal Income (i.e., a basic minimum income rather than a minimum wage) and a Maximum Allowable Personal Wealth (i.e., an upper limit on financial wealth accumulation) that can be adjusted periodically. This democratic reform is required to reverse the unsustainably widening rich-poor gap but should not be confused with state socialism. Minimum income and maximum wealth thresholds are to be used as checks and balances against both left-wing and right-wing extremism.\n- The fourth phase (2041-2050) is democratization with widely institutionalized solidarity, sustainability, and subsidiarity. The principle of subsidiarity has already been included in the constitution of the European Union. It prescribes decisions to be made at the lowest possible level consistent with governance capabilities and the common good of the global commonwealth. In other words, a world government would only act (i.e. make laws) if, and only if, any possible action by individual countries is insufficient. Keeping the peace between nations, and formulating laws pursuant to the ecological integrity of the planet, are the two areas where some form of democratic global governance is required. Global problems require global solutions. National problems require national solutions. Local problems require local solutions. There may be regional problems that require regional solutions.\nThese four phases are further analyzed in the Status of the Transition to Clean Energy supplement (still work in progress). The four phases are sequential to some extent, but overlaps and iterations are to be\nexpected. Clearly, the concientization phase should start immediately but will have to be sustained indefinitely. It is hard to envision the incentivation and redistribution phases happening sequentially. Only God knows if a global democracy can be achieved by 2050, but we must try. The biggest temptation, for nations as well as individuals, is to succumb to cynical pessimism.\nHuman Development is not Free\nFreedom is required for human development, but human development is not free. Experience confirms that human capabilities tend to decrease in dictatorial states. But even under total freedom, human development takes human effort and integral human development even more so. The era of \"externalities\" (\"free\" natural resources) is rapidly coming to an end, and so is the era of extravagant energy consumption at a low cost. It will not be simply a matter of working longer hours and postponing retirement until age 75, although some such adjustments may become necessary. What is bound to increase is the investment in mental and emotional effort, because people will need to adapt their ways of thinking and behaving to changing conditions. In making decisions they may be compelled to think about the common good and act accordingly. The consequent inner conflicts may in turn induce many to undertake the inner journey earlier in life. This is more difficult than simply running around in pursuit of material gratifications, for it requires overcoming fear: \"It takes more courage to dig deep into the dark corners of one's own soul than it does for a soldier to fight on the battlefield.\" (William Butler Yates, Ireland, 1865-1939)"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:2f052cca-d8b8-46ac-b085-5cd76bbd80a8>","<urn:uuid:499bb0da-c4a7-44e2-bdbf-fcbc54ed40ea>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do Plato's and Pericles' views on Athenian democracy differ in terms of its effects on society?","answer":"Pericles and Plato had contrasting views on Athenian democracy. Pericles fostered and praised democracy, viewing it as a system that allowed citizens to flourish. However, Plato was critical of democracy, believing it led to problematic outcomes. He argued that democracy's emphasis on freedom would ultimately lead to tyranny, stating that 'the greatest and most savage servitude emerges from the greatest freedom.' Plato was particularly concerned about democracy's relationship with wealth, arguing that in such a system it was impossible to simultaneously honor wealth and maintain wisdom among citizens.","context":["Alcibiades: alcibiades, brilliant but unscrupulous athenian politician and military alcibiades' guardian, the statesman pericles, a distant relation, was too he was recalled by the athenian fleet, which remained loyal to the democracy and portrayed in plato's “symposium” view biographies related to categories.

Without comment on this, a friend asked me about the same basic passage from Plato, because it was discussed on the BBC:\nThe passage at the center of this appears to be as follows:\nPlato, Republic 564a\n“It is likely, I said, that tyranny emerges out of no other state except for democracy—the greatest and most savage servitude emerges, I suppose, from the greatest freedom.”\nΕἰκότως τοίνυν, εἶπον, οὐκ ἐξ ἄλλης πολιτείας τυραννὶς καθίσταται ἢ ἐκ δημοκρατίας, ἐξ οἶμαι τῆς ἀκροτάτης ἐλευθερίας δουλεία πλείστη τε καὶ ἀγριωτάτη.\nThe problem with the discussions, however, is that Plato’s interlocutors take a very long time to get to this point: the discussion about the four types of government starts at 544a So picking out this single passage is kind of like watching one series of the Superbowl and thinking you know the whole game (sorry Atlanta).\n(And, as an aside, plucking any bit out of its context in a Platonic dialogue is a little dodgy. [And I say this with authority as someone whose hobby is taking quotations out of context.] I am not a Platonist, but I have read enough to know that each dialogue presents its own development of arguments, essentially a self-contained universe of ideas. The dialogues do interrelate, but an idea projected in one is not a universal assertion. This is especially true in the Republic.]\nMuch earlier in the piece, Plato starts to discuss democracy. His issue has to do with the importance of money:\n“Therefore, I said, this sort of manner facilitates the change from oligarchy into democracy, through the insatiable pursuit for its proposed good, that there be as much wealth as possible?”\nI guess I mean that when those who rule in a state rule because they possess much, they are not willing to restrain by law however many of the youth are unhindered, to prevent them from spending and wasting their own wealth, because they hope that by acquiring and lending money on their possessions, they might become even wealthier still and more honored.\nTherefore it is clear in this city that it is impossible to honor wealth and obtain sufficient wisdom among the citizens at the same time, but, rather, it is necessary to care for one or the other?\nOk, he said, that seems right.”\nΟὐκοῦν, ἦν δ’ ἐγώ, μεταβάλλει μὲν τρόπον τινὰ τοιόνδε ἐξ ὀλιγαρχίας εἰς δημοκρατίαν, δι’ ἀπληστίαν τοῦ προκειμένου ἀγαθοῦ, τοῦ ὡς πλουσιώτατον δεῖν γίγνεσθαι;\n῞Ατε οἶμαι ἄρχοντες ἐν αὐτῇ οἱ ἄρχοντες διὰ τὸ πολλὰ κεκτῆσθαι, οὐκ ἐθέλουσιν εἴργειν νόμῳ τῶν νέων ὅσοι ἂν ἀκόλαστοι γίγνωνται, μὴ ἐξεῖναι αὐτοῖς ἀναλίσκειν τε καὶ ἀπολλύναι τὰ αὑτῶν, ἵνα ὠνούμενοι τὰ τῶν τοιούτων καὶ εἰσδανείζοντες ἔτι πλουσιώτεροι καὶ ἐντιμότεροι γίγνωνται.\nΠαντός γε μᾶλλον.\nΟὐκοῦν δῆλον ἤδη τοῦτο ἐν πόλει, ὅτι πλοῦτον τιμᾶν καὶ σωφροσύνην ἅμα ἱκανῶς κτᾶσθαι ἐν τοῖς πολίταις ἀδύνατον, ἀλλ’ ἀνάγκη ἢ τοῦ ἑτέρου ἀμελεῖν ἢ τοῦ ἑτέρου;\n᾿Επιεικῶς, ἔφη, δῆλον.\nΠαραμελοῦντες δὴ ἐν ταῖς ὀλιγαρχίαις καὶ ἐφιέντες ἀκολασταίνειν οὐκ ἀγεννεῖς ἐνίοτε ἀνθρώπους πένητας ἠνάγκασαν γενέσθαι.\n(It is interesting that the anti-financial aspect of this dialogue is praised by few…) Plato’s vision of political change is not merely shaped by an aristocratic prejudice against new money, but it is also conditioned by Athenian and local Greek histories. His sample sizes are not large enough! The political cycles envisioned by the later historian Polybius seem a lot more realistic and pertinent, to my taste.\nPolybius, Histories 6.4\n“The proof that what I have said is true comes from the following. It must not be asserted that every well-made government is a principality, but only the government which is assented to voluntarily and which is governed by reason rather than fear and force. Nor should we consider every oligarchy to be an aristocracy: the latter emerges only when men rule because they are the most just and the most prudent. In a similar way, a true democracy is not that in which the majority has the power to do whatever it wants, but what counts is if the will of the majority enforces observance of its traditional laws, honor to the customary laws, duty to parents, respect to elders, obedience to the laws—then it is right to call a state a democracy.\nFrom this, we can isolate six types of government: the three I have just mentioned and three additional, related forms, monarchy, oligarchy, and mob rule. The first of these, monarchy, arises naturally, and without machination. The second follows it and develops from it with preparation and adjustment. Once this has transformed into the evil form akin to it, tyranny, and aristocracy develops from the dissolution of both. When aristocracy devolves into oligarchy as is natural, and the people turn into rage over the injustice of their leaders, democracy emerges. Over time, mob-rule develops from outrage and illegality. Anyone can understand clearly from this pattern that the things I am saying now are true, based on the nature of each government in its origins and its evolution.”\nὅτι δ᾽ ἀληθές ἐστι τὸ λεγόμενον ἐκ τούτων συμφανές.  οὔτε γὰρ πᾶσαν δήπου μοναρχίαν εὐθέως βασιλείαν ῥητέον, ἀλλὰ μόνην τὴν ἐξ ἑκόντων συγχωρουμένην καὶ τῇ γνώμῃ τὸ πλεῖον ἢ φόβῳ καὶ βίᾳ κυβερνωμένην:  οὐδὲ μὴν πᾶσαν ὀλιγαρχίαν ἀριστοκρατίαν νομιστέον, ἀλλὰ ταύτην, ἥτις ἂν κατ᾽ ἐκλογὴν ὑπὸ τῶν δικαιοτάτων καὶ φρονιμωτάτων ἀνδρῶν βραβεύηται.  παραπλησίως οὐδὲ δημοκρατίαν, ἐν ᾗ πᾶν πλῆθος κύριόν ἐστι ποιεῖν ὅ,  τι ποτ᾽ ἂν αὐτὸ βουληθῇ καὶ πρόθηται παρὰ δ᾽ ᾧ πάτριόν ἐστι καὶ σύνηθες θεοὺς σέβεσθαι, γονεῖς θεραπεύειν, πρεσβυτέρους αἰδεῖσθαι, νόμοις πείθεσθαι, παρὰ τοῖς τοιούτοις συστήμασιν ὅταν τὸ τοῖς πλείοσι δόξαν νικᾷ, τοῦτο καλεῖν δεῖ δημοκρατίαν. διὸ καὶ γένη μὲν ἓξ εἶναι ῥητέον πολιτειῶν,  τρία μὲν ἃ πάντες θρυλοῦσι καὶ νῦν προείρηται, τρία δὲ τὰ τούτοις συμφυῆ, λέγω δὲ μοναρχίαν, ὀλιγαρχίαν, ὀχλοκρατίαν.  πρώτη μὲν οὖν ἀκατασκεύως καὶ φυσικῶς συνίσταται μοναρχία, ταύτῃ δ᾽ ἕπεται καὶ ἐκ ταύτης γεννᾶται μετὰ κατασκευῆς καὶ διορθώσεως βασιλεία.  μεταβαλλούσης δὲ ταύτης εἰς τὰ συμφυῆ κακά, λέγω δ᾽ εἰς τυραννίδ᾽, αὖθις ἐκ τῆς τούτων καταλύσεως ἀριστοκρατία φύεται.  καὶ μὴν ταύτης εἰς ὀλιγαρχίαν ἐκτραπείσης κατὰ φύσιν, τοῦ δὲ πλήθους ὀργῇ μετελθόντος τὰς τῶν προεστώτων ἀδικίας, γεννᾶται δῆμος.  ἐκ δὲ τῆς τούτου πάλιν ὕβρεως καὶ παρανομίας ἀποπληροῦται σὺν χρόνοις ὀχλοκρατία.  γνοίη δ᾽ ἄν τις σαφέστατα περὶ τούτων ὡς ἀληθῶς ἐστιν οἷα δὴ νῦν εἶπον, ἐπὶ τὰς ἑκάστων κατὰ φύσιν ἀρχὰς καὶ γενέσεις καὶ μεταβολὰς ἐπιστήσας."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:0e4ac478-023d-4818-940c-f54807eb6b56>","<urn:uuid:f1fc6dad-175e-4670-80be-fc1395e6be78>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are some health risks associated with heavy metals in baby food, and how do these contaminants enter the products?","answer":"Heavy metals in baby food pose several health risks, particularly for developing infants. Lead exposure is associated with neurological impairment, learning disabilities, and lower IQ, even at low levels. Cadmium can cause kidney, liver, and bone damage, with children being more susceptible to low-dose exposure over time. Both metals accumulate in the body over time. These contaminants can enter baby food through multiple routes, including industrial processes, mining, burning fossil fuels, and waste incineration. Heavy metals can contaminate soil through sewage sludge disposal and the application of pesticides or phosphate fertilizers. Studies have shown that infants who exclusively feed on formula have 7.5 times higher urinary arsenic levels than breastfed babies. Additionally, pesticides and veterinary drugs have been found in commercial baby foods, with pesticide residues present in over 60% of baby foods available in Spain and the UK.","context":["Nutrition is so important and particularly so in the first years of life.\nSeeing the advertisements, it appears that a wide range of companies is making nutritious, health-promoting baby food.\nHowever, this isn’t fully accurate.\nIn fact, many of the ingredients in commercial baby food are ultra-processed, with links to a variety of health problems.\nFurthermore, some of these foods contain contaminants such as heavy metals and pesticides.\nThis article will first look at the negative side of commercial baby foods — firstly baby jar foods and then baby formula.\nFollowing this, the article will examine some healthier options.\nBaby Food and Nutrient Density\nThere are several problems regarding commercial baby food.\nFirst of all, here is a look at the nutritional values.\n- A study comparing all 479 commercially available baby foods in the UK found that 65% are sweetened. 79% of these foods were spoonable baby jar foods, but similar homemade foods had more than double the nutrients. The researchers concluded that the majority of the products “do not serve the intended purpose” of providing nutritious meals to infants (1).\n- A recent study on the entire commercial baby food range in the US shows that “the vast majority” of products contain added sugar (2).\n- Commercial baby foods “mainly consist of sweet fruits and vegetables” like mango, banana, and sweet potatoes. As a result, they are “unlikely to encourage a preference for bitter tasting vegetables or non-sweet food” (3).\n- In Australia, 29% of baby foods contain synthetic vitamins and minerals. The “vast majority are fruit-based products,” and they “have relatively high sugar content” (4).\nThe Impact of Sweet Taste Perception\nTo be honest, the fact that commercial baby food is lacking in nutritional value isn’t surprising.\nHomemade foods incorporating fresh ingredients are much more likely to provide beneficial nutrients than processed mixes.\nThese commercial baby foods also primarily focus on sweet taste.\nAnd unfortunately, this emphasis on sweet-tasting foods can have an adverse effect in future life.\nFrom the time we are born, the foods we eat shape our taste preferences.\nIn the modern world, children already have enough dietary pitfalls to avoid without being trained to prefer a sweet taste.\nHarmful Ingredients in Baby Jar Foods\nHave you seen how much a jar of baby food costs?\nGiven the price, you’d expect them to be full of the very best quality ingredients.\nConversely, commercial baby jar foods often contain sketchy ingredients that are harmful to health.\nYes, the same stuff that’s used by the fast food industry to cook fries is also in many baby jar foods.\nThe oil of choice in these products is canola oil, which is an ultra-processed industrial oil.\nIn the first place, the manufacturing process to make this oil is extremely harsh and uses solvents, deodorizers, and even bleach.\nSecondly, the extreme heat the production process uses often damages any beneficial nutrients in the oil.\nSeeing sugar on the back of a jar isn’t so surprising, but it’s shocking to see how much some brands contain.\nFor example, look at the baby food on the right. Apparently, it has “no added sugar.”\nHowever, if you look at the ingredients you can see a combination of grape juice concentrate, peach concentrate, more grape concentrate, and then a bunch of thickeners (flour) and preservatives.\nIn other words, this whole jar is full of carbs (total: 35g) and sugar (25g) and little else. The product is 100% fat-free and contains only 2g protein.\nAll in all, it’s not real food. It is fruit juice concentrate mixed with flour.\nRefined Sugar and Children’s Health\nIn recent years, the food industry’s message that sugar is a positive source of energy for children is on its deathbed.\nSugar is an entirely non-essential ingredient that has negative health impacts.\nFor instance, a 2015 study on children with obesity found that taking sugar out of the diet (while keeping calories the same) led to significant decreases in blood sugar, insulin, triglycerides, and blood pressure — in only nine days (7).\nMake Your Own!\nInstead of paying a premium price for a mixture of grape and pineapple concentrates, it is easy to make a spoonable baby food at home.\nSure, it’s a little more time-consuming, but there are no mystery ingredients, and you can avoid all the additives, preservatives, and possible contaminants.\nFirst of all, using an electronic baby food maker makes it simple.\nWith this, you can puree any number of nutritious foods to make a variety of spoonable feeds.\nFor some great ideas, the Paleo Mom has a handy table with ingredient ideas and at what age to introduce each food.\nNote: Not all mothers can breastfeed, and formula can play a role in this situation. But there is a clear difference between a healthy formula and some of the poorer choices.\nOut of all commercial baby food, some formula products contain relatively unhealthy ingredients.\nIn fact, it’s not unusual to see ingredients such as;\n- Industrial vegetable oils\n- Sugar and corn syrup (in vast quantities)\n- Refined flours\nTo demonstrate this, here is a look at one of the available products.\nSimilac Soy Powder Formula\nAdmittedly, this is a soy formula, so it purposefully doesn’t include milk.\nIn other words: this is specifically designed for babies who have allergies or sensitivities to cows milk.\nHowever, just take a look at the ingredients, and you can see that the majority of this product is sugar and oil; 76% to be precise.\nA further 14% is soy protein, and then the remaining 10% is a mixture of preservatives and vitamins and minerals.\nCorn Syrup and Sugar = 49%\nThe primary ingredient of this product is corn syrup, which represents 39% of the product by weight.\nNext, sugar accounts for a further 10%.\nSimple sugars are necessary for babies — the fact that breast milk is about 40% sugar (lactose) is a good indication of this.\nHowever, this refined sugar, usually made from GMO corn and sugar cane, provides glucose and fructose rather than lactose.\nVarious Oils = 27%\nAside from the sugar, the next major ingredient in this formula is vegetable oil — there are three different kinds;\n- Coconut oil\n- High-oleic safflower oil\n- Soybean oil\nWhile coconut oil is no problem, soybean oil has a host of negative studies behind it.\nIn a 2015 study, soybean oil was found to be “more obesogenic and diabetogenic” than fructose (9).\nUnfortunately, soybean oil has an extremely harsh industrial production process. It is in almost all processed food—and it’s in many commercial baby food formulas too.\nRegarding high oleic safflower oil, this oil is probably health neutral. It is still an ultra-processed oil and processing mostly strips it of its beneficial components. There are certainly better oils around.\nHowever, high-oleic vegetable oils are much more stable against oxidation than their regular counterparts and contain a healthier fatty acid profile.\nSome Problems With Commercial Baby Food\nWe should choose baby food carefully for some of the following reasons:\n- Baby and infant formulas available at retail have no FDA regulation.\n- Harmful contaminants such as rocket fuel and heavy metals have been found in baby foods. A study shows that infants who exclusively feed on formula have a 7.5x higher urinary arsenic level than breastfed babies (10).\n- Synthetic additives in commercial baby food can be problematic, such as laboratory-made folic acid.\n- Infant formula often features genetically modified (GMO) sugar and refined vegetable oil. Despite being non-GMO, organic products tend to have the same ingredients.\n- High-heat processing damages the formula which results in the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs). In fact, commercial infant formulas have a “70-fold higher level of a major AGE than human breast milk” (11, 12, 13).\n- Many organic baby food formulas contain brown rice syrup. Following concerns over the potential arsenic contamination of rice, a study showed that using brown rice syrup “may introduce significant concentrations of arsenic” into the diet. Given that babies eat the same formula several times per day, this is a cause for concern (14).\n- Pesticides and even veterinary drugs have been found in commercial baby foods. Also, pesticide residues are present in over 60% of those foods available at retail in Spain and the UK (15, 16)\nBreastfed Babies Are Healthier\nFirst of all, for mothers who can — breastfeeding is always the healthier choice compared to a processed formula.\nStudies show that individuals who feed on mother’s milk as a baby enjoy better health and improvements in lifelong immunity.\nHowever, for mom’s unable to nurse their baby, there are still healthy options available.\nWholesome Baby Formula: Healthier Options\nIt is easy to complain about poor quality baby food formulas. But this isn’t very helpful if we don’t know how to find healthier options.\nSo, here is a look at some better choices that we can either buy or make ourselves.\nCommercial Baby Food Formula – Nanny Care Infant 1\nThis formula from Nanny Care is not perfect, but it has a much healthier ingredient profile than the usual commercial offering.\nFirst of all, there is no soybean oil, and it is entirely free of added sugar, soy, and corn syrup.\nHere is a look at the ingredients.\nGoat Milk Solids\nThe main ingredient is goat milk solids.\nExperts believe goat milk to be a closer match to human breast milk than cows milk. Additionally, studies show it to be more digestible and less allergenic (20).\nApproximately 7% of all babies have an allergy specifically to cow milk protein, making goat milk a viable alternative.\nVegetable Oils – High-oleic Sunflower, Rapeseed, Sunflower\nThere are no commercially available baby food formulas without vegetable oils. High oleic sunflower oil is one of the healthier oils, and at least there is no soybean oil in this product.\nOther ingredients in the formula include vitamins, minerals, amino acids, and preservatives (citric acid and a vitamin E-based antioxidant).\nOverall, the ingredient profile is much cleaner than the vast majority of products on the market.\nLet’s compare the first seven ingredients to the soy formula we looked at earlier;\n|Nanny Care First Infant Milk||Similac Soy Powder Formula|\n|Pasteurized goat milk solids||Corn syrup solids|\n|Lactose (from milk)||Soy protein isolate|\n|High oleic sunflower oil||High oleic safflower oil|\n|Sunflower oil||Soybean oil|\n|Vitamins||C. cohni oil|\nFor me, the first five ingredients are key; breast milk naturally contains whole milk—not corn syrup. And sugar and soybean oil are two of the unhealthiest ingredients in the whole food chain.\nSome of the products and recipes covered here may help give children a more nutritious start to life.\nAnd in regard to baby formula, there are many different available options.\nBut whichever options you choose, it’s important to carefully research and discuss with your pediatrician.\nIt’s okay to research different options, but for something so important it is best to run it by an expert.\nNutrition is always important in life, and never more so than for a small baby.","- Why should we worry about lead and cadmium?\n- What are the sources of lead and cadmium?\n- How are we exposed to lead and cadmium?\n- How do lead and cadmium get into chocolate products?\n- How can manufacturers prevent lead and cadmium contamination in their products?\n- How can I tell if lead or cadmium is in the chocolate product I purchase?\n- Doesn’t the government protect us from chemicals like lead and cadmium in the products we buy?\n- Will I get sick if I eat chocolate products with cadmium?\n- What can I do to help make sure the chocolate products I buy are free of cadmium?\n- What is Proposition 65 and how is As You Sow enforcing it?\nWhy should we worry about lead and cadmium?\nBack to top\nThe California Office of Environmental Health and Human Hazard Administration (OEHHA) has listed cadmium and lead as chemicals known to cause birth defects or other reproductive harm.1\nLead has been widely recognized as the single most significant environmental health threat to children.2 Lead exposure has been a significant public health issue for decades and is associated with neurological impairment, such as learning disabilities and lower IQ, even when ingested at low levels.3, 4, 5 “No amount of lead ingestion is ‘safe’ for children,” asserts Sean Palfrey, MD, a practicing pediatrician and professor of Pediatrics and Public Health at Boston University School of Medicine. “Pregnant women and young children with developing brains in particular should avoid any ingestion of lead.”\nChronic exposure to cadmium can cause kidney, liver, and bone damage in humans, and children are more susceptible to the effects of exposure to low doses of cadmium over time. Cadmium may also cause developmental problems, such as decreased birth weight, harm to neurobehavioral development, and male reproductive toxicity, all of which have been observed in animal studies.6, 7\nLead and cadmium accumulate in the body over time, increasing the total body burden of these heavy metals over decades. Ingesting even small amounts of these metals will add to existing body burdens and should be avoided.3, 4, 5, 6, 7\nWhat are the sources of lead and cadmium?\nBack to top\nCadmium and lead are toxic heavy metals that are released into the environment through manmade industrial processes including mining, burning fossil fuels such as coal or oil, incineration of municipal waste (plastics/batteries), and manufacturing and smelting, the largest source of airborne cadmium. Cadmium and lead also enter soil through the disposal of sewage sludge, or the application of pesticides or phosphate fertilizers (which can contain high levels of cadmium).4, 7\nOnce released into the atmosphere, respirable-sized airborne particles attach to dust, can travel long distances, and will be deposited onto the earth, where they move easily through soil layers and can be taken up into the food chain. Once mined and introduced into the atmosphere, these heavy metals can move from air to soil to water, but do not break down easily and will remain for decades.4, 7\nHow are we exposed to lead and cadmium?\nBack to top\nThe main route of human lead and cadmium exposure occurs via ingestion from food as well as through contaminated water and soil.4, 7 Lead and cadmium in food are ubiquitous and do not seem to discriminate between natural, certified organic, and non-organic products. One or both of these metals have been found in various foods including baby foods (made with carrots, peaches, pears, sweet potatoes), dietary supplements, vitamins, protein powders, seaweed snacks, ginger cookies, packaged peaches/pears, various fruit juices, as well as chocolate.\nAnother way we are exposed to lead and cadmium is through inhalation from dust or pollution from industrial processes. Additionally, cadmium is present in cigarette smoke.\nHow do lead and cadmium get into chocolate products?\nBack to top\nCadmium and lead may contaminate the chocolate product at many points through the “bean to bar” process; these sources may depend on the cacao growing, fermenting, processing, manufacturing, shipping, and packaging practices.\nOne significant source is manmade pollution created by industrial processes as described above. Due to the persistence of these heavy metals in soil, they remain present even after the industrial source has been removed. Another source of these heavy metals in chocolate is through direct application of pesticides (lead and cadmium), phosphate fertilizers (cadmium), as well as sewage sludge disposal (lead and cadmium).4, 7\nA third source of lead and cadmium is contamination through one of the various processing steps a bean undergoes after the harvest. These steps include fermentation, drying of the cacao bean, and manufacturing processes such as grinding, refining, and conching. Other opportunities for contamination are shipping, handling, and finally, packaging. Studies have shown that much of the “lead contamination in (chocolate) products occurs after the beans are harvested and dried, during the shipping of those beans and/or the manufacturing of cocoa and chocolate products.”.8, 9\nHow can manufacturers prevent lead and cadmium contamination in their products?\nBack to top\nThere may not be a single remedy to remove lead and cadmium in chocolate products. Chocolate manufacturers must understand the manufacturing practices and possible manmade sources of contamination and then take steps to identify the source(s) of the contamination. For example, the equipment used to process chocolate could be a primary source of lead or cadmium. Similarly, water used in processing, or shipping containers, may be high in lead. Once the source(s) are identified, suppliers and manufacturers can improve their practices; increase supply chain transparency; and effectively remove lead and cadmium from their final product.\nAnother protocol many agree on is for the cocoa bean growers to test the soil in which they grow the cocoa beans before planting the beans, and avoid the use of lead/cadmium-laden pesticides, as well as avoiding phosphate fertilizers, which often contain high levels of cadmium.\nHow can I tell if lead or cadmium is in the chocolate product I purchase?\nBack to top\nThe only way to tell if lead or cadmium is in a product is to have the product tested for heavy metals by a certified lab. However, under California’s Proposition 65, manufacturers must warn consumers if a product contains chemicals above set levels known to cause cancer and/or birth defects or other reproductive harm.\nDoesn’t the government protect us from chemicals like lead and cadmium in the products we buy?\nBack to top\nThe FDA does not consistently monitor food for lead and cadmium contamination. California has the most health protective standards in the country for the presence of lead and cadmium in consumer products, and requires the manufacturer to warn consumers if a product contains chemicals known to cause cancer and/or birth defects or other reproductive harm, above the safe harbor level set by California’s Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment.\nWill I get sick if I eat chocolate products with cadmium?\nBack to top\nIt is difficult to predict which chemical exposure(s) will trigger an adverse health effect in a person, due to interindividual variation (depending on biological and/or genetic factors). What we do know is that lead and cadmium are toxic heavy metals and accumulate in the body where they remain for decades. The first step in preventing exposure is to identify the chemical itself and then try and avoid it. With all chemical exposures, the most vulnerable populations are developing fetuses, children, the elderly, and those most impacted from working or living near industrial and manufacturing plants.\nWhat can I do to help make sure the chocolate products I buy are free of cadmium?\nBack to top\nCheck the lists that we have published on our web site and buy the product that do not require a warning. You can also write to your favorite chocolate manufacturer(s) and ask them to fix this issue the check back to see our list as we hope manufactures will soon look down their supply chains and reduce the levels below California’s safe harbor level for reproductive harm and let us know so we can retest.\nWhat is Proposition 65 and how is As You Sow enforcing it?\nBack to top\nCalifornia Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986 is a consumer-right-to-know law voted into existence in 1986 by California citizens. It protects Californians by requiring the manufacturer to warn consumers if a product contains chemicals known to cause cancer and/or birth defects or other reproductive harm. While the law is CA specific, the enforcement of the law has a positive impact on all of the consumer products available through the US. Many product manufacturers, when reformulating to reduce toxins for the California market, will then sell the same product across the US and even globally.\nFor over 23 years, As You Sow has been successfully enforcing the California Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986 and has worked with manufacturers to reformulate hundreds of products in order to provide the consumer with a cleaner, healthier product. These include mercury in fish, toluene in nail polish, lead in herbal supplements, formaldehyde in portable school classrooms, and toxic chemicals in cosmetics and laundry detergent. You can see a list of some of these products on our Toxic Enforcement page.\n- California Office of Environmental Health and Human Hazard (OEHHA).\n- National Research Council, Measuring Lead Exposure in Infants, Children, and Other Sensitive Populations.

{"question":"What was the historical significance of Romulus and Remus in founding Rome, and how did religious practices during the Roman Republic connect to political power?","answer":"Romulus and Remus were legendary twins born around 771 BC to Rhea Silvia and either Mars or Hercules. They were abandoned on the Tiber River but saved and nursed by a she-wolf until found by shepherd Faustulus. Upon reaching adulthood, they killed their great-uncle Amulius and restored their grandfather Numitor to power. When establishing their own city, Romulus killed Remus in a quarrel, making Rome's foundation begin with fratricide. During the Roman Republic, religion and political power were deeply intertwined, with no separation of church and state. The same elite men who served as public officials could also be augurs and pontiffs. For example, Julius Caesar became pontifex maximus before being elected consul. Religious authority was used to legitimize political power, with augurs reading divine will to sanction Roman expansionism as divine destiny.","context":["Founding of Rome\nThe founding of Rome can be investigated through archaeology, but traditional stories handed down by the ancient Romans themselves explain the earliest history of their city in terms of legend and myth.\nThe most familiar of these myths, and perhaps the most famous of all Roman myths, is the story of Romulus and Remus, the twins who were suckled by a she-wolf. This story had to be reconciled with a dual tradition, set earlier in time, the one that had the Trojan refugee Aeneas escape to Italy and found the line of Romans through his son Iulus, the namesake of the Julio-Claudian dynasty.\nThe national epic of mythical Rome, the Aeneid of Virgil, tells the story of how Trojan prince Aeneas came to Italy. The Aeneid was written under Augustus, who claimed ancestry through Julius Caesar from the hero and his mother Venus. According to the Aeneid, the survivors from the fallen city of Troy banded together under Aeneas and underwent a series of adventures around the Mediterranean Sea, including a stop at newly founded Carthage under the rule of Queen Dido, eventually reaching the Italian coast. The Trojans were thought to have landed in an area between modern Anzio and Fiumicino, southwest of Rome, probably at Laurentum or, in other versions, at Lavinium, a place named for Lavinia, the daughter of King Latinus whom Aeneas married. This started a series of armed conflicts with Turnus over the marriage of Lavinia. Before the arrival of Aeneas, Turnus was engaged to Lavinia, who then married Aeneas, starting the war. Aeneas won the war and killed Turnus. The Trojans won the right to stay and to assimilate with the local peoples. The young son of Aeneas Ascanius, also known as Iulus, went on to found Alba Longa and the line of Alban kings who filled the chronological gap between the Trojan saga and the traditional founding of Rome in the 8th century BC.\nToward the end of this line, King Procas was the father of Numitor and Amulius. At Procas' death, Numitor became king of Alba Longa, but Amulius captured him and sent him to prison; he also forced Numitor's daughter Rhea Silvia to become a virgin priestess among the Vestals. For many years, Amulius was the king. The tortuous nature of the chronology is indicated by Rhea Silvia's ordination among the Vestals, whose order was traditionally said to have been founded by Romulus's successor Numa Pompilius.\nRomulus and Remus\nThe myth of Aeneas was of Greek origin and had to be reconciled with the Italian myth of Romulus and Remus, who would have been born around 771 BC if taken as historical figures. They were purported to be sons of Rhea Silvia and either Mars, the god of war, or the demi-god hero Hercules. They were abandoned at birth, in the manner of many mythological heroes, because of a prophecy that they would overthrow their great-uncle Amulius, who had overthrown Silvia's father Numitor. They were abandoned on the Tiber River by servants who took pity on the infants, despite their orders. The twins were nurtured by a she-wolf until a shepherd named Faustulus found the boys and took them as his sons. Faustulus and his wife Acca Larentia raised the children. When Remus and Romulus became adults, they killed Amulius and restored Numitor. They decided to establish a city; however, they quarreled, and Romulus killed his brother. Thus, Rome began with a fratricide, a story that was later taken to represent the city's history of internecine political strife and bloodshed.\nThe ancient Romans were certain of the day Rome was founded, April 21, the day of the festival sacred to Pales, goddess of shepherds, on which date they celebrated the Par ilia (or Palilia). However, they did not know the exact year the city had been founded; this is one reason they preferred to date their years to the presiding consuls over using the formula A.U.C. or Ab Urbe Condita. Several had been proposed by ancient authorities, and Dionysius of Halicarnassus records these: the Greek historian Timaeus, the first to write a history of the Romans, stated that Rome was founded in the 38th year prior to the first Olympiad, or 814 BC; Quintus Fabius Pictor, the first Roman to write the history of his people, stated Rome was founded in the first year of the eighth Olympiad, or 748/7 BC; Cincius Alimentus claimed Rome was founded in the fourth year of the twelfth Olympiad, or 719/8 BC; and Cato the Elder calculated that Rome was founded 432 years after the Trojan War, which Dionysius stated was the first year of the seventh Olympiad, or 752/3 BC. Dionysius himself provided calculations showing that Rome was founded in 751 BC, starting with the Battle of the Allia, which he dated to the first year of the ninth Olympiad, or 390 BC, then added 119 years to reach the date of the first consuls, Junius Brutus and Tarquinius Collatinus, then added the combined total of the reigns of the Kings of Rome (244 years) to arrive at his own date, 751 BC. Even the official Fasti Capitolini offers its own date, 752 BC.\nThe most familiar date given for the foundation of Rome, 753 BC, was derived by the Roman antiquarian Titus Pomponius Atticus, and adopted by Varro, having become part of what has come to be known as the Varronian chronology. An anecdote in Plutarch where the astrologer Lucius Tarrutius of Firmum provides an argument based on a non-existent eclipse and other erroneous astronomical details that Rome was founded in 753 BC suggests that this had become the most commonly accepted date. Through its use by the third-century writer Censorinus, whose De Die Natali was the ultimate influence of Joseph Justus Scaliger's work to establish a scientific basis of ancient chronology, it became familiar.\nRecent discoveries by Andrea Carandini on Rome's Palatine Hill have also yielded evidence of a series of fortification walls on the north slope that can be dated to the middle of the 8th century BC. According to the legend, Romulus plowed a furrow (sulcus) around the hill in order to mark the boundary of his new city.\nThe name of Rome\nThere is no consensus on the etymology of the city's name. Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712–1778) suggested Greek \"ῥώμη\" (rhōmē), meaning \"strength, vigor\". A modern theory of etymology holds that the name of the city is of Etruscan origin (and perhaps the city itself, though this cannot be proven), derived from rumon, \"river\".\n|This section needs additional citations for verification. (December 2011) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)|\nThe historical Latins were originally an Italic tribe who inhabited the Alban Hills.[when?] They later moved down into the valleys, which provided better land for agriculture. The area around the Tiber river was particularly advantageous and offered notable strategic resources; the river was a natural border on one side, and the hills could provide a safe defensive position on the other side. This position would also have enabled the Latins to control the river and the commercial and military traffic on it from the natural observation point at Isola Tiberina. Moreover, road traffic could be controlled, since Rome was at the intersection of the principal roads to the sea coming from Sabinum (in the northeast) and Etruria (to the northwest).\nThe development of the town is presumed to have started from the development of separate small villages located at the tops of hills that eventually accreted to form Rome. In any case, the location that became the city of Rome was inhabited by Latin settlers from various regions, farmers and pastoralists, as evidenced by differences in pottery and burial techniques.\nRecent studies suggest that the Quirinal hill was very important in ancient times, although the first hill to be inhabited seems to have been the Palatine (therefore confirming the legend), which is also at the center of ancient Rome. Its three peaks, the minor hills (Cermalus or Germalus, Palatium, and Velia), were united with the three peaks of the Esquiline (Cispius, Fagutal, and Oppius), and then villages on the Caelian Hill and Suburra.\nThese hills had expressive names. The Caelian Hill was also called Querquetulanus (from \"quercus\", oak) and \"Fagutal\" (pointing to beech-woods, from \"fagus\" meaning \"beech\"). Recent discoveries revealed that the Germalus on the northern part of the Palatine was the site of a village (dated to the 9th century BC) with circular or elliptical dwellings. It was protected by a clay wall (perhaps reinforced with wood), and it is likely that this is where Rome was really founded.\nThe territory of this federation was surrounded by a sacred border called the pomerium, which enclosed the so-called e Servian expansion of Rome.\nFestivals for the Septimontium (literally \"of the seven hills\") on December 11 were previously considered to be related to the foundation of Rome. However, April 21 is the only date for Rome's foundation upon which all the legends agree, and it has recently been argued that Septimontium celebrated the first federations among Roman hills. A similar federation was, in fact, celebrated by the Latins at Cave, Italy or at Monte Cavo (in Castelli).\nDuring the Italian Renaissance, a group of humanists affiliated with the Roman Academy formed a sodality to pursue antiquarian interests, celebrating the \"birthday of Rome\" annually on April 20. In 1468, the Academy was suppressed by Pope Paul II for fomenting \"republicanism, paganism, and conspiracy\", but the sodality was reinstated about ten years later under Sixtus IV as the Societas Literatorum S. Victoris in Esquiliis (\"Literary Society of Saint Victor on the Esquiline\"). The reformed group placed itself under the new patronage of saints Victor, Fortunatus, and Genesius, \"whose feast day was conveniently proven to coincide with the Palilia\". Their \"Palilia\" was organized by Pomponio Leto and featured speeches, a communal meal, and a poetry competition.\n- Livy (1797). The history of Rome. George Baker (trans.). Printed for A.

There was no principle analogous to separation of church and state in ancient Rome.\nDuring the Roman Republic —27 BCthe same men who were elected public officials might also serve as augurs and pontiffs.\nPriests married, raised families, and led politically active lives. Julius Caesar became pontifex maximus before he was elected consul.\nThe augurs read the will of the gods and supervised the marking of boundaries as a reflection of universal order, thus sanctioning Roman expansionism as a matter of divine destiny.\nThe Roman triumph was at its core a religious procession in which the victorious general displayed his piety and his willingness to serve the public good by dedicating a portion of his spoils to the gods, especially Jupiterwho embodied just rule.\nAs a result of the Punic Wars — BCwhen Rome struggled to establish itself as a dominant power, many new temples were built by magistrates in fulfillment of a vow to a deity for assuring their military success. As the Romans extended their dominance throughout the Mediterranean world, their policy in general was to absorb the deities and cults of other peoples rather than try to eradicate them,  since they believed that preserving tradition promoted social stability.\nInscriptions throughout the Empire record the side-by-side worship of local and Roman deities, including dedications made by Romans to local gods.\nForeign religions increasingly attracted devotees among Romans, who increasingly had ancestry from elsewhere in the Empire. The mysteries, however, involved exclusive oaths and secrecy, conditions that conservative Romans viewed with suspicion as characteristic of \" magic \", conspiratorial coniuratioor subversive activity.\nBecause Romans had never been obligated to cultivate one god or one cult only, religious tolerance was not an issue in the sense that it is for competing monotheistic systems. Augustusthe first Roman emperor, justified the novelty of one-man rule with a vast program of religious revivalism and reform.\nPublic vows formerly made for the security of the republic now were directed at the well-being of the emperor. So-called \"emperor worship\" expanded on a grand scale the traditional Roman veneration of the ancestral dead and of the Geniusthe divine tutelary of every individual.\nThe Imperial cult became one of the major ways in which Rome advertised its presence in the provinces and cultivated shared cultural identity and loyalty throughout the Empire.\nRejection of the state religion was tantamount to treason. Ultimately, Roman polytheism was brought to an end with the adoption of Christianity as the official religion of the empire.\nFounding myths and divine destiny[ edit ] Relief panel from an altar to Venus and Mars depicting Romulus and Remus suckling the she-wolf, and gods representing Roman topography such as the Tiber and Palatine Hill See also: Roman mythology and Founding of Rome The Roman mythological tradition is particularly rich in historical myths, or legendsconcerning the foundation and rise of the city.\nThese narratives focus on human actors, with only occasional intervention from deities but a pervasive sense of divinely ordered destiny. Aeneas, according to classical authors, had been given refuge by King Evandera Greek exile from Arcadiato whom were attributed other religious foundations: Their mother, Rhea Silviahad been ordered by her uncle the king to remain a virgin, in order to preserve the throne he had usurped from her father.\nThrough divine intervention, the rightful line was restored when Rhea Silvia was impregnated by the god Mars. She gave birth to twins, who were duly exposed by order of the king but saved through a series of miraculous events. The brothers quarrel while building the city walls, and Romulus kills Remus, an act that is sometimes seen as sacrificial.\nTullus Hostilius and Ancus Marcius instituted the fetial priests. The first \"outsider\" Etruscan king, Lucius Tarquinius Priscusfounded a Capitoline temple to the triad Jupiter, Juno and Minerva which served as the model for the highest official cult throughout the Roman world.\nThe benevolent, divinely fathered Servius Tullius established the Latin Leagueits Aventine Temple to Dianaand the Compitalia to mark his social reforms. Servius Tullius was murdered and succeeded by the arrogant Tarquinius Superbuswhose expulsion marked the beginning of Rome as a republic with annually elected magistrates.In many societies, ancient and modern, religion has performed a major role in their development, and the Roman Empire was no different.\nFrom the beginning Roman religion was polytheistic. From an initial array of gods and spirits, Rome added to this collection to include both Greek gods as well as a number of foreign cults.\nAs the . The Romans worshipped their gods in a temple. They made sacrifices of animals and precious items to their gods.\nThey believed that when an Emperor died he became a god and so a .

{"question":"As biology student, I wonder about biodiversity in rainforests and threats to species. How many species live there and what happens when forests are cut down?","answer":"Nearly half of the planet's plant and animal species live in rainforests, including mammals, reptiles, amphibians, arthropods, plants and birds. The forests host diverse species like gorillas weighing up to 400 pounds, anacondas reaching over 37 feet, and unique birds like the resplendent quetzal. When deforestation occurs, this biodiversity faces severe threats - on average, 137 species become extinct every day, or 50,000 each year. Deforestation leads to habitat fragmentation, forcing animals into already occupied territories, causing territorial conflicts, homelessness, food scarcity, and migration disruptions.","context":["Learn something new every day\nMore Info... by email\nA rainforest is a dense four layer jungle with a humid and hot climate that experiences a great amount of rainfall annually. Tropical rainforest covers only 6 percent of the world but it is estimated that nearly half of the planet’s plant and animal species live in the rainforests of Central America, Africa, Southern Asia and Australia. Mammals, reptiles, amphibians, arthropods, plants and birds are all common types of rainforest species. In addition to animal and plant biodiversity, many products like chocolate, sugar, cinnamon and pineapple are grown in rainforests.\nRainforests have dense canopy layers that prevent much light from reaching the forest floor. As a result, many plant rainforest species such as the epiphytes or air plants that live on the branches and trunks of trees have evolved including several tropical orchid species. Some fig plants will slowly strangle a host tree as it grows up toward the sun. Other plants such as the venus flytrap are carnivorous and will consume insects. Nepenthes rafflesiana, a pitcher plant common in Southeast Asia, can grow to more than 30 feet (9 meters) and produces 12-inch (30-centimeter) long pitchers that trap not only insects but small reptiles and mammals as well.\nThere are many large mammalian rainforest species. The gorilla inhabits Central Africa, eats fruit and bark and can weigh up to 400 pounds (181 kg) and stand 6 feet tall (1.8 m). Orangutans live in Indonesia, have a diet similar to that of the gorilla but are smaller, weighing up to 250 pounds (113 kg). In Southeast Asia, India and China roam bengal tigers that eat antelopes, monkeys, pigs and even elephants while the jaguar of Central America prefers turtles and deer. Capybaras can weigh up to 100 pounds (45 kg), are found in South America and are skilled swimmers that eat water plants and fruit.\nRainforest species also include amphibians and reptiles. The colorful poison dart and red-eyed tree frogs inhabit the regions of Central and South America and consume insects such as crickets and flies. Rainforest reptiles can be large, such as the anaconda of the Amazon River Basin that can be more than 37 feet long (11 meters). Anacondas will eat primarily rodents, birds, fish and turtles. Other common reptiles include the black caiman, boa constrictor, gaboon viper and reticulated python.\nMany common rainforest species are birds or arthropods. The resplendent quetzal of Central America boasts a tail of red and blue feathers that is nearly 25 inches long (63.5 cm). Another brilliantly colored bird is the toucan that lives in hollow trees and eats fruit. The leafcutter ant has strong jaws for cutting leaves and grass used to grow the fungi it eats. While the leafcutter inhabits the forest floor, high in the canopy lives the brown winged blue morpho butterfly where it consumes rotten fruit. Additional rainforest arthropods are the praying mantis, giant water spider and paper wasp.\nOne of our editors will review your suggestion and make changes if warranted.

I'm setting up a vinyl horse fence - what are the maintenance requirements compared to other types, and how can I enhance it with electric fencing?","answer":"Vinyl fencing lasts a long time and requires less maintenance compared to wooden fences which need upkeep to prevent rotting and horse chewing. However, vinyl can be broken if horses push through it. To enhance vinyl fencing with electric fencing, you can use Easy Snap electric insulators that allow quick installation of electric wire or tape without drilling holes. The Equi-Tee hot wire stud can be glued to post faces to hold wire away from fence boards. It's recommended to add one or two strands of electric tape to protect both the horses from the fence and the fence from the horses. The electric component provides additional security while maintaining the aesthetic appeal of the vinyl fence.","context":["Horse and Pony Facility Preparation\nFirst Horse or Pony Facility Preparation\nThere are a few things to keep in mind when preparing your facility for your first horse or pony. The most important are space, shelter and water.\nWhen we talk about space, horses and ponies are grazing animals and they need to be able to move throughout the day. Placing them in a stall or small paddock 24-7 isn’t good for their physical or mental state. Depending on their exercise level and maintenance program, a turnout or dry lot can be sufficient. Ideally, you’ll want a pasture with approximately two acres for the first horse or pony and an additional acre for each horse or pony added to the herd.\nThe kind of fence used in your pasture is essential to your horse or pony’s health. Having the wrong kind of pasture fence (barbed wire, smooth wire or large square mesh fences) can lead to very hazardous situations that can be career ending. If the fence at the facility housing your horse or pony is already in place, make sure to check for holes or potentially dangerous places. Repair anywhere the horse or pony can escape or get injured. If the fence looks problematic, I recommend putting up an electric fence inside of current fence.\nIf you’re building or renovating a fence, there are options to consider:\nWooden fences look neat and are sturdy, but they do take maintenance to keep horses from chewing on them and the boards from rotting due to weathering.\nWire fences such as woven or V-mesh fences are a good option. When using a wire fence, just make sure that a horse or pony can’t get a leg or something stuck in the wire. It’s also beneficial to have a top rail of some sort for stability and to keep horses and ponies from pushing through it over time.\nPVC fence looks good and lasts a long time, but it can be broken and if the horses or ponies figure out how to push through it, it can be hard to keep them in.\nPipe fences are solid and keep horses from running through it. While unlikely, if they do get caught or try to jump over it, a pipe fence doesn’t have much give and can cause injuries.\nElectric fence is a good option to stand alone or provide additional support to the types of fence listed above. It’s important to monitor the horse or pony for the first few hours they’re enclosed in an electric fence. The initial shock can send them running through the fence. Typically, they will respect if after that.\nOnce you have the pasture fenced off, taking care of the pasture and forage your horse or pony will be eating is important. Each region has its own pasture management programs. Soil type, climate and landscape all play a role. To find the best pasture management options, contact your local extension office. You’ll want to be sure to rid of any harmful plants or weeds that can cause your horse or pony to become ill and find a way to manage the pasture so it reaches its full potential for your equine animal’s requirements. Dry lots or part time confinement may be recommended and need to be planned for accordingly.\nYou’ll want to make sure to have proper shelter for your horse or pony. While they don’t necessarily need an enclosed box stall free of anything harmful, they do need something to protect them from nature’s elements such as rain, wind, snow, hail and extreme heat. The shelter should be at least 10 feet x 12 feet for one horse or pony and 8 feet tall. If it is a metal or steel building, I recommend putting a border (plywood, fence, etc.) around the bottom 4 foot – 5 foot to prevent injuries if they were to roll or kick into the building. You’ll want to place the shed where it blocks the wind and has good drainage. It needs to be accessible to clean and feed out of if needed. If you have a sick or injured horse or pony you’ll want to be able to get to it with a truck and trailer and close it off for confinement purposes.\nSome people like to add storage for hay and feed onto their shelter. It’s a good idea to have somewhere dry to store your hay, feed and supplies. The elements can cause hay and grain to mold or rot and, while it’s inevitable to keep critters way from hay storage, the less, the better. Animals like racoons and opossums spread diseases to horses and ponies.\nLastly, you will need a clean and sufficient water supply. Many people rely on automatic waters or natural resources. No matter what you choose to use, you’ll want a clean and reliable water source. You can find information on the facilities water at your local extension office. When using an automatic water, be sure to check that it doesn’t freeze over when it’s cold and clean it occasionally. If you have a natural resource, such as a pond or stream, make sure it’s safe for horses and ponies to access and if the pond or stream freeze, be sure you can supply them water another way. Don’t allow them to drink out of stagnant waters as they can have bacteria and other harmful toxins that can lead to illnesses.\nStarting on the right foot with your horse or pony ownership journey will make it easier as time progresses. Setting yourself up to prevent illness and injury will give you less headaches and will make the experience more enjoyable for everyone involved. Plus, proper maintenance increases your property value in the long run.\nFor additional information on caring for horses or ponies, check out our website www.performancepony.com, email firstname.lastname@example.org or call or text me, Camie Widmer at (641) 799-5042.\nI found these links very helpful and they provide additional information on space, shelter and water needs for horses and ponies.","Before installing an electric fence, check your county regulations to make sure you can use the fence in your area.

{"question":"How can students join and get involved with the ACS Division of Polymer Chemistry (POLY)?","answer":"Students can join POLY with a free first-year membership. To get involved, they can attend networking events at local and national ACS meetings, participate in webinars about polymer applications, and volunteer at national and regional meetings. They can also join POLY/PMSE student chapters at their universities, which offer professional development events and networking opportunities. Students can follow POLY activities through their website and social media presence on Twitter (@POLY_ACS), Facebook (@ACSPOLY), and LinkedIn.","context":["Meet the ACS Division of Polymer Chemistry\nWhen Katrina Knauer was an undergraduate at Florida State University, one problem loomed large in her mind: plastics. Single-use plastics. From take-out containers to shampoo bottles, they were everywhere. As a chemical engineering major, she was amazed by the chemistry that made these plastics possible. But she worried about environmental impacts. “We have this huge source of waste that we don’t know what to do with,” she recalls thinking.\nToday, Knauer is a polymer scientist beginning a new job at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden, CO. She develops technologies for recycling plastics and works with industry leaders to make those innovations scalable.\nKnauer credits landing this dream position, in part, to the relationships she’s built through the ACS Division of Polymer Chemistry (POLY), a community of professionals dedicated to advancing the polymer enterprise and addressing global challenges. As the member-at-large on the POLY executive committee, Knauer encourages ACS members to join—especially students.\nStudents who join POLY can explore how their own interests in polymer chemistry can lead to a wide range of impactful careers while building connections and gaining professional skills.\nPotential in polymers\nPolymer structures vary widely, from long molecules that are twisted and tangled together like a bowl of spaghetti strands to repeating blocks or branching chains, resulting in a broad range of properties, says Philip Costanzo, a chemistry professor at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo. “They have a lot more properties than just a single small molecule because they are so long and they can interact with each other.”\nBecause of their diverse physical properties, polymers lend themselves to many uses—and career paths. Before beginning her current position, Knauer was a senior scientist at Novoloop, a chemical recycling startup in the San Francisco Bay Area. She helped devise methods for upcycling polyethylene waste from single-use plastics like sandwich bags, turning it into polyurethanes designed for more long-lasting products like running shoes and performance raincoats.\nMeanwhile, Costanzo designs new polymers that work as “re-healable” materials. His team modified polymers in soybean oil to create a topcoat for cars that “heals” (or spontaneously self-repairs) with heat. “If you got your car scratched, instead of getting it repainted,” he explains, “you could heat it up with a hair dryer and melt the scratch away.”\nPolymer scientists also tackle other challenges, such as drug delivery and sustainable energy. They work in academia, industry, and government. But while the applications for polymer science are expansive, the POLY division helps the community of polymer scientists remain close-knit. “Being involved with POLY really has given me a wonderful support network of colleagues,” says Knauer.\nCostanzo is confident that POLY will do the same for students. “It will open up doors for internships, research opportunities, graduate school opportunities,” he says. “The sooner you plug in and interact with people, the more opportunities will pop up.”\nPlugging into POLY\nCurious about polymers but not sure where that interest could take you? POLY hosts networking events at local and national ACS meetings. They also offer webinars on cutting-edge polymer applications—from fighting the pandemic to 3D printing.\nThrough these events, you can connect with polymer enthusiasts in a wide range of professions and career stages who can offer insights into their own professional paths. “Especially if you do want to go to grad school, you’ll want to start knowing what people are doing, what kind of research they are working on, what universities are focusing on,” says Knauer.\nSome schools also have POLY student chapters jointly supported by the Division of Polymeric Materials: Science and Engineering (PMSE), another ACS division for polymer chemists. POLY/PMSE student chapters are typically formed by graduate students and postdocs but are open to undergrad involvement as well. One of Knauer’s main goals is to encourage more universities to establish student chapters. “I try to get funding to set up networking events and professional development events for the students,” says Knauer.\nOne such event, Random Walks from a PhD, is a symposium series created by the recently formed POLY/PMSE student chapter at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. “Random Walks is a classic polymer physics term to describe random trajectories of polymer chains,” explains Chapter President Hazel Davis, a PhD candidate in polymer science and engineering whose research focuses on how polymers can be used to deliver proteins for various therapeutic applications. The organizers invite polymer scientists to speak about the twists and turns of their own career trajectories. The first speakers at the symposium, which was launched last summer, included Knauer, a patent agent, and a materials scientist at Nike.\nAbout 25 students joined each of the hybrid virtual/in-person sessions, including numerous undergraduates. Geneva McElvaine, a third-year chemistry major at Rhodes College in Memphis, TN, attended while conducting REU research at UMass Amherst on soft material interfaces. McElvaine isn’t sure what she wants to do after graduation, but the symposium helped her see polymer science as a real possibility. “If I really wanted to make myself known in the polymer science industry, or participate in it, I would know where to start,” she says.\nZachary Ahmad, a fourth-year polymer science and engineering major at the University of Southern Mississippi, also attended the symposium while conducting summer research at UMass, Amherst. Afterwards, Ahmad connected with all of the speakers and many of the attendees on LinkedIn. None of the speakers work in Ahmad’s particular research area: creating flexible electronics for medical applications. But he values these connections for the unexpected ways that their careers may someday overlap. “It made bridges that I can take in the future if I need to,” he says.\nMACRO and more\nPOLY can also help you develop professional skills for advancing your polymer science career—and the skill building might come with some prizes along the way. POLY recently sponsored a three-minute elevator pitch competition for graduate students at Case Western Reserve University’s ACS POLY/PMSE Student Chapter. Irlaine Machado, a graduate student in polymer engineering, who recently passed her dissertation defense, won $500 for a pithy description of her research on eco-friendly flame retardants. Hitting all of the key points in three minutes was challenging, recalls Machado, who is earning a joint degree from Case Western and the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro in her home country of Brazil. “I needed to practice a lot.”\nPOLY members can also draw on the many resources provided by the Macromolecular Alliance for Community Resources and Outreach (MACRO), a POLY/PMSE committee that supports curriculum building, community outreach, and professional development. Interested in sharing your love of chemistry with elementary school students? MACRO is compiling a collection of lesson plans certain to thrill the very youngest of chemists, like how to make DIY silly putty and slime.\nMACRO’s website can also help you develop professionally by identifying internship opportunities, for example, or learning tips for strengthening your grad school application. “We’re adding more and more things—like how to prepare a résumé, how to write a cover letter, how to write your first paper,” says Costanzo, who leads MACRO along with PMSE’s Dominik Konkolewicz of Miami University in Oxford, OH.\nIn about a year, MACRO will launch a mentorship program designed to support members at each career stage. Graduate students, for example, will mentor undergraduates and, in turn, be mentored by postdocs. Postdocs will similarly be both mentors and mentees.\nMaggie Kumler, a fourth-year chemistry major in Costanzo’s lab with an interest in sustainable polymers, has already found that being both a mentor and a mentee is greatly rewarding. “In our lab, the older students are used as mentors for the first and second years,” she says. “That’s something that I’ve gained a lot of experience in that I’m really grateful for.”\nAs with other networking opportunities, your POLY mentors and other colleagues can give you heads-ups about openings, write recommendation letters, or even refer you to hiring committees at their own companies. It’s not so much that a company will hire you just because you are a POLY member, but having the connections will make it much easier to get your foot in the door, says Davis. “Really these networks are incredibly vast.”\nThe first year of POLY membership is free to new members. Members keep tabs on POLY events by checking out the POLY website and following the group on Twitter (@POLY_ACS), Facebook (@ACSPOLY), and LinkedIn. If you’d like to meet other POLY members, a great way to start is by volunteering. “Students can reach out to me at any time to find out how to get involved,” says Knauer. “We are always looking for volunteers to help at the national meetings and regional meetings.”\nAnd if you’d like to volunteer to help with any of POLY’s other offerings, just contact the organizers. POLY members are passionate about helping students grow professionally, says Knauer. “That’s my favorite part of POLY, the really strong focus on educating the students and giving them as much opportunity as possible.”"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:e81e8c93-2b61-4092-8c90-293c8ec8fc54>"],"error":null}

How do they differ in terms of skill development? 请解释这两种工艺对儿童发展的影响。","answer":"Paper collage helps children develop creativity and motor skills while being a simple and effective activity. It enhances their overall craft abilities and contributes to their general development. Origami, on the other hand, specifically helps children practice following instructions, improves their manual dexterity, and provides a sense of satisfaction from creating decorative end-products. Both crafts are educational but develop different skill sets - collage focuses more on creative freedom and basic motor skills, while origami emphasizes precision, instruction-following, and spatial understanding.","context":["How To Make A Paper Collage?4 min read\nWhen we talk about the most fun activities in art and craft, one cannot miss paper collage. Paper collage is not just easy, but it looks extravagant. However, making a paper collage is simple as there are no rules or any specifications. Moreover, kids also love to make their paper collage due to their straightforwardness. The materials required for making paper collage are also available in our house as most of us have piles of paper stock which is a waste.

This time, the best part is this is the most fun and probably the most accessible craft activity that your child will love. You do not need to cut paper in any shape and size. You can cut it into any size and even ask your child to make fun designs. Let us begin to know how we can make a paper collage so ask your child to assist you in this productive activity and see how their skills grow.\nGrab a stack of paper scraps, a pad of coordinating paper, or something you hand. Pull out 3-8 sheets of distinct paper designs. It can be solid, patterned, or I like the double-sided paper’s okay because it is notably effortless to see them coordinate with each other.\nThe key to a suitable collage is making your designs sense blissful together. That’s going to be a point of view all your own. Everyone likes distinct shades and one-of-a-kind looks, so what you love is uniquely your own. Go with it.\nMaterials You Need\n- A Variety of paper: Different designs of paper will make the collage overall beautiful. Also, kids might find it more accessible as they don’t need to find any specific paper to perform this activity. Thus, using any paper will be a compelling idea.\n- Glue (use warm glue): Although you can use any glue, it is pasting the paper. However, using hot glue will be better as it gives us better results and passes the paper in a better way.\n- Scissors (optional): Scissors are optional as paper can be torn with hands as well. However, scissors give a better finishing which adds more beauty to the collage. So using scissors is up to you and your kid’s comfort.\nHow to Draw?\n- First, to create your paper collage, you want a location or something to put it on. Then, get a canvas board or, even simpler, a sheet of wood.\n- You cannot create a paper collage besides having something to make. Pick any photo or picture that you like and base it off on that. It ought to be whatever (an animal, nature, etc.)\n- To switch your picture to your canvas/board, the fantastic method is the grid method. You draw a grid on each photograph and canvas using your ruler and pen/pencil/marker.\n- Now that your grid is on each of your photos and canvas, it is time for you to switch that photo onto your canvas. Again, using your pencil, reproduce something that is in a positive container on the grid of your photograph into the identical field on the grid on your canvas. This offers the image on the canvas a nearly identical switch from the unique picture.\n- Now that your photo is on your canvas use paint, coloring pencils, or virtually write the title of the hues in their preferred areas. This makes it less challenging to organize the colorations with the paper later on.\n- You now want to get some paper (preferably journal paper). Find pages out of magazines that fit the colorations you are using and tear them up into small pieces. (This is where the scissors are non-obligatory, relying on how you desire your collage to come out. The scissors might also make a cleaner reduction; however, you may additionally decide upon the difficulty of tearing the paper via hand.)\n- Using a paintbrush, gently unfold layers of glue on your canvas. This is the only way your portions of paper will stick to your canvas.\n- When your canvas is nonetheless wet with glue, vicinity the portions of paper in their preferred locations (by dimension and through color). Then, continue to unfold glue on your canvas and location portions of paper in their favored locations (steps 7 & 8).\n- When completed setting your paper on your canvas and you have gotten your favored look, unfold one closing layer onto your piece. This flattens any bumpy or rising portions of paper and makes it seem smoother. Then, please wait for it to dry, cling to your masterpiece.\nSo these were some of the easy steps that you need to follow if you want to make a paper collage. Making a paper collage is simple and effective.\nMost collage craft activities teach kids how to make an easy paper collage. However, do you know making a paper collage helps your kid to grow in many ways? Firstly, their creativity amplifies, and they work better in other craft activities also. Next, kids usually grow their motor skills by indulging in these craft activities. Overall, there is an overall growth of a kid that assists them in their whole life. Therefore help your child to make paper collages and also spend quality time with them.","Origami for Kids divider panel\nAll of us used a cheap cardboard A4 ring binder to store our origami models, split into three sections:\nVery first, we hole punched various pieces of coloured cards for the front of the binder, onto which we stuck our models.

{"question":"I'm struggling with bicycle parking in my dense urban neighborhood - what specific challenges do pre-war neighborhoods in The Netherlands face regarding bicycle storage, and why?","answer":"Pre-war neighborhoods in The Netherlands face particular challenges with bicycle parking due to their spatial layout and housing type. The main issues are narrow streets and sidewalks, combined with townhouses that have been converted into multiple dwellings without sheds or gardens. This makes it difficult for residents to park their bicycles safely and conveniently, leading to bicycles blocking pavements, which affects accessibility, safety, and neighborhood livability.","context":["The battle for public space has started to emerge in many cities across the globe. Our streets have to cater for many things, from the regular post box or bin to trees and benches. Transport uses a significant part of that public space, both moving as well as parked. Even in a city like Amsterdam, considered by many the cycling capital of the world, 48% of public space is still used by the car as shown in an article by Parool. Only 11% of that public space is reserved for the bicycle in Amsterdam. In a city like The Hague, which is generally considered to be more car dominated, this percentage is likely to be lower. Typically, the parked bicycle is everywhere, but it is mostly pushed on space generally used by the pedestrian. This battle for public space becomes more and more apparent in Dutch neighborhoods with limited public space, like in the city of The Hague.\nCycle Parking in Pre-War Neighborhoods in The Hague\nPre-war neighborhoods are especially sought-after and popular places to live in The Netherlands. However, their spatial layout (narrow streets and sidewalks) and the housing type (townhouses converted into multiple dwellings with no sheds or gardens) make it challenging for most residents to park their bicycles in a convenient and safe way. Bicycles blocking the pavements affects not only the accessibility and safety but also the livability of these neighborhoods.\nIn 2019, The Hague adopted its new Cycle Strategy with one of the main objectives being the delivery of 'easy cycle parking'. The subsequent Cycle Implementation Plan called for addressing cycle parking in pre-war neighborhoods. In 2021, The Hague selected seven neighborhoods for this project, and they approached Arup to produce a Plan of Approach. To verify the approach, Geuzen- en Statenkwartier, a neighborhood of 14,000 residents, was chosen as a pilot project.\nChecking the Facts and Needs\nBoth quantitative (car and bicycle parking surveys) and qualitative (residents' needs and concerns) data was used to evaluate the current situation and suggest solutions. Analysis of parking data enabled the team to pinpoint locations with highest need for additional cycle parking facilities. The analysis showed that the neighborhood not only has a high demand for cycle parking facilities, but also a high demand for car parking. All the data gathered in the project was saved in a Geographic Information System (GIS).\nSuccessful Stakeholder Engagement\nTo verify the locations with high demand for cycle parking, and to devise the best design for cycle parking facilities, Arup facilitated digital discussion between the residents and the municipality about the use and layout of the urban space. Two stakeholder engagement sessions were held. The first stakeholder engagement covered a presentation of the analysis, both qualitative and quantitative. It also covered generic questions about the use of public space, such as: \"What has to be sacrificed for extra bicycle facilities? The sidewalk? Car parking spots? Urban green or playgrounds?\". Another topic covered in the first session was shortlisting the top 10 of locations with the highest need for a solution. To facilitate that, a top 20 was pre-selected based on the quantitative and qualitative analysis. Stakeholders were able to vote for the top 10 using the Mentimeter tool.\nThe second stakeholder engagement session focused on the top 10. Questions were prepared to understand the preferences of the stakeholders for the solutions. Examples of those questions: \"What type of solution do you prefer? Indoor? Outdoor? Covered? And how far are you willing to walk to your bicycle?\". These questions were facilitated by an Inspiration Book with examples of cycle parking solutions. With the answers to the questions the project team was able to gather preferences for each of the locations in the top 10. These preferences were then taken into consideration in the design process, carried out by the Ingenieursbureau Den Haag. The design process was informed by the number of required parking spaces per location and the mentioned preferences. The end result will be a design with for example a covered parking facility at the corner of the street including some additional Sheffield stands in the street.\nDemocratizing the Battle for Space\nWhile stakeholder engagement was key in this project, it also posed a challenge due to the restrictions caused by COVID-19. By carrying out digital public consultations and using the digital mapping tool, the project team was able to minimize the impact of the restrictions on interacting with the residents. The digital tools can be applied anywhere in the world and have also proven to be more successful in engaging stakeholders. The battle for public space is something that any city will have to face in some shape or form. A good way to approach that battle it by democratizing it using (digital) stakeholder engagement.\nNicolaas Beetsstraat 2A\n3511 HE Utrecht, The Netherlands\nPHONE: +31 (0) 15 202 6116\nDue to Covid-19 (Corona-virus) the DCE-team is working from home, therefore this phone might not be answered.\nPlease leave a message with your phone number through our contact form on the left side of this page, and we’ll call you back as soon as possible!"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:c0d9823c-6ab4-4575-901a-38461f98d6cf>"],"error":null}
{"question":"As a transportation and cryptocurrency researcher, I'm intrigued by the intersection of safety protocols and verification systems. What are the specific verification mechanisms used in both country road safety management and green Bitcoin mining oversight?","answer":"In country road safety, verification relies on physical indicators such as roadside poles with instructions that must be read top-down, along with visual clues like skid marks or broken fences that indicate recent accidents. For green Bitcoin mining, verification is achieved through a technical architecture using decentralized identifiers (DIDs) anchored on the Energy Web Chain, where miners must provide verification from electric utilities or energy attribute certificate issuing bodies to prove renewable energy sourcing. Both systems require constant monitoring and adherence to specific protocols to ensure safety and compliance.","context":["From incredibly tight bends to herds of sheep, country roads are full of hazards that you’re unlikely to find on your daily commute. In fact, on average, three people die on country roads every day. Plus, there are 10 times as many fatalities on rural roads than on motorways, according to the RAC Foundation. Therefore, if you’re looking to embark on your first drive through the countryside, it’s worth preparing for the journey in advance.\nHere you’ll find our top tips for driving on country roads, which will help to keep you, your passengers, and other drivers safe. Read on to find out more.\nAdjust your speed\nMost UK country roads have a speed limit of 60mph. However, this is rarely a safe speed to travel, according to road safety charity Brake.\nOn country roads, you should pay less attention to speed limits and, instead, adjust your speed according to the conditions. Rural roads tend to be narrow with blind bends, and rarely have pavements or cycle paths. Therefore, you need to be travelling at a speed that allows you to react to any hazards quickly and effectively.\nWhen you’re driving at 60mph, your stopping distance will be approximately 73 metres — that’s the length of three tennis courts. So, if you turn a corner and encounter an oncoming vehicle or group of pedestrians, you’ll have no chance of stopping in time. Speeds of around 40mph are more appropriate when you’re driving in the countryside.\nLook out for clues\nYou need to be very vigilant when driving on country roads, and should constantly be looking for clues of what lies ahead.\nFor example, if you see skid marks or notice a broken fence at the side of the road, there may have been an accident there recently. So, it’s wise to take your time so you can react to any hazards in plenty of time.\nIt’s also vital that you keep an eye out for road-side poles that display instructions or warnings. If you find one with a number of signs, you should read it from the top down and be prepared to deal with any hazards in that order.\nExpect the unexpected\nAs we’ve mentioned, there are far more hazards on country roads. From slow-moving tractors to herds of cows, you should be prepared to encounter the unexpected.\nYou should move at a steady pace, and stay alert. Sharp turns, dips in the road, and hiddencrests are all common hazards that you’re likely to come across when driving on rural roads, so you need to be ready to slow down or stop at a moment’s notice.\nKeep overtaking to a minimum\nWhen driving on country roads, you should try to overtake as little as possible. When you do need to overtake, make sure that you won’t be putting yourself or other drivers in danger. The best way to do this is to anticipate what might happen when you pull out to overtake. Are you sure that the vehicle in front of you isn’t going to turn right, and that no traffic is going to join the carriageway from a side road? If you aren’t 100% sure that it’s safe to overtake, you should hang back — it isn’t worth putting yourself in danger to get to your destination slightly earlier.\nIf you don’t have much experience, driving on rural roads can be overwhelming. But, if you worry too much, you run the risk of getting distracted. So, while you need to remain alert for your entire journey, you should also try to relax and take everything as it comes.\nIn their guide to de-stressing on your drive, Lookers recommends preparing well for your trip and creating a relaxing atmosphere in your vehicle. This will help to keep you calm and collected while you’re tackling those country roads for the first time.\nNext time you’re driving on rural roads, keep these five tips in mind. They’ll help keep you safe and calm until you reach your destination.","Open-source “Green Hashrate” software solution will track and verify green Bitcoin mining\nTesla recently proclaimed it will resume accepting Bitcoin as payment once the cryptocurrency’s miners achieve 50% sourcing from renewable energy. Tesla’s position is demonstrative of growing demands among crypto investors (and investors more generally) to prove the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) credentials of investment options.\nIn response, today nonprofit Energy Web is releasing an open-source architecture for a “Green Hashrate” application that will enable Bitcoin miners to claim and verify the amount of renewable electricity used in their operations from the bottom-up. There are several expected market applications, including:\n- Enabling green mining pools to require proof of renewables for any miners as part of the know-your-customer (KYC) process to join a green mining pool;\n- Helping miners deliver proofs of renewable energy sourcing to local regulators and/or investors to meet ESG criteria;\n- Over time, proving to crypto investors (like Tesla) and regulators the actual amount of renewable electricity powering an entire cryptocurrency network at any time.\nThe first version of this solution will be manual and is designed around the KYC process for green mining pools like Terra Pool, a green mining pool spearheaded by two Crypto Climate Accord Signatories, Argo and DMG Blockchain. The next step is to automate the application making it possible for miners, utilities, and in some cases regulators to trust that a given Bitcoin mine is in a specific part of a grid with a particular mix of renewables. To accomplish this, the solution will leverage the Energy Web Decentralized Operating System (EW-DOS) and in particular decentralized identifiers so as to protect proprietary miner information in compliance with GDPR and other privacy-protecting regulations around the world.\nTechnical Architecture for Blockchain-Agnostic Proof of Green Solution Stack\nIn this solution architecture, a Bitcoin miner creates a decentralized identifier (DID) that is anchored on the Energy Web Chain, a public blockchain built for the energy sector. In order to deliver the required KYC credentials to join a green mining pool (or for that matter, to make any legitimate public claims about sourcing from 100% renewables), miners must provide verification from the appropriate market authority, such as an electric utility and/or energy attribute certificate issuing body, to prove its renewable energy sourcing. This verification is then linked to the miner’s DID and documented on-chain.\nThe most immediate users of this solution will most likely include miners located in geographies already using 100% renewably-generated electricity — namely, geographies with 100% hydro (or even volcanoes) that are becoming increasingly appealing to miners— and miners that procure and claim energy attribute certificates at a 100% proportion to their electricity use. Some miners may also want to show that their electricity purchases match electricity use on an hour-by-hour level in line with the emerging EnergyTag certificate standard currently being defined and tested in various demonstrations.\nIn setting the vision for the Green Hashrate application, several requirements were considered to ensure it is poised for adoption across the global Bitcoin mining community. For example, the application does not impact the fungibility of Bitcoin — a core requirement for any realistic solution — and provides privacy protections around a given mining facility’s actual energy use and precise location. This solution must also eventually illustrate the overall adoption of verified renewable energy use as a percentage of overall Bitcoin hashing across the entire Bitcoin mining network at a given time, which would set a new example of industry-wide ESG transparency for other industries to follow.\n“I am excited to see the speed in which Terra Pool is actively working with CCA to develop and implement clean energy standards that are pushing forward the positive momentum that the CCA is driving in moving blockchains to net zero carbon,” commented Sheldon Bennett, CEO of DMG Blockchain Solutions.\n“Our vision is for any crypto miner in the world to be able to download the Green Hashrate application and show to the rest of the world exactly how much renewable electricity that mine is using,” said Jesse Morris, CCO of Energy Web. “And by using technologies like blockchain paired with decentralized identifiers, we can pull this off in a way that guarantees privacy of sensitive information for all parties involved.”\nSince the Green Hashrate application is open-source, once developed any Bitcoin miner or green mining pool can use and build on top of it to meet their respective needs. This solution could also be easily extended to other industries to streamline the verification of renewable energy sourcing, from data centers and factories to electric vehicle fleets and commercial buildings.\nLooking forward, there are two design questions being considered that will need to be solved in order to scale the solution:\n- How can we streamline, digitize, and automate utility verification of miner location and grid mix?\n- Beyond increasingly widespread global demand for 100% renewable Bitcoin, how can we create additional incentives to promote widespread adoption of the Green Hashrate application beyond miners who are already 100% renewable?\nThis Green Hashrate solution is already attracting interest from additional mining companies. “This Green Hashrate software can be instrumental for miners like ourselves to provide auditable tracking and traceability of the provenance of our 100% renewably powered mining facilities. Building regulatory trust and investor confidence in our company’s, and industry’s, commitment to sustainability is more important now than ever before as this topic takes hold of the public conversation around the future of blockchain technology,” said Brittany Kaiser, Chair of the Board at Gryphon Digital Mining, which is also a CCA Signatory.\nWe will report back in the coming weeks with updates on the technical development and tests of this Green Hashrate solution.\nPlease let us know if you would like to get involved with informing and testing this work by contacting email@example.com.\nTogether, we can #MakeCryptoGreen!"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:38e68074-6b32-45a2-8946-3d9ecd4c56a7>","<urn:uuid:95bbd334-8cdb-4da2-b7d6-8ffda623175b>"],"error":null}

The new model performs well in capturing the major nitrogen state/flux variables (e.g., soil nitrate and nitrate leaching). The addition of nitrogen dynamics improves the modeling of the carbon and water cycles (e.g., net primary productivity and evapotranspiration). This improvement advances the capability of Noah-MP to simultaneously predict weather and water quality.\nGeosci. Model Dev.

The \"modified BMJ\" scheme gives a better representation of the observed rainfall for the whole tropics in both winter and summer seasons.\nGeosci. Model Dev.

Discuss., 8, 3971-4018, doi:10.5194/gmdd-8-3971-2015, 2015\nA global empirical system for probabilistic seasonal climate prediction\nSummary: Our paper reports on a simple regression-based system for producing probabilistic forecasts of seasonal climate. We discuss the physical motivation behind the statistical relationships underpinning our empirical model and provide a validation of hindcasts produced for the last half century. The generation of probabilistic forecasts on a global scale along with the use of the long-term trend as a source of skill constitutes a novel approach to empirical forecasting of seasonal climate.\nGeosci.

We compare two methods of inferring PM2.5 concentrations from the model: (1) based on the sum of the masses in the fine aerosol modes, as is most commonly done in CMAQ model evaluation; and (2) computed using the simulated size distributions. Differences are generally less than 1microgram/m3, and are largest over the eastern United States during the summer.\nGeosci. Model Dev. Discuss., 8, 3861-3904, doi:10.5194/gmdd-8-3861-2015, 2015\nA new ensemble-based consistency test for the Community Earth System Model\nSummary: Climate simulations codes are especially complex, and their on-going state of development requires frequent software quality assurance to both preserve code quality and instill model confidence. To formalize and simplify this previously subjective and expensive process, we have developed a new tool for evaluating climate consistency. The tool has proven its utility in detecting errors in software and hardware environments and providing rapid feedback to model developers.\nGeosci. Model Dev.

The optimal results improve the metrics performance by 9%. A software framework can automatically execute any part of the “three-step” calibration strategy. The proposed methodology and framework can be easily applied to other GCMs to speed up the model development process.\nGeosci. Model Dev.

The inverse estimate of ocean physics and atmospheric forcing yields a dynamically consistent and global state estimate without unidentified sources of heat and salt that closely fits in-situ and satellite data. Any user can reproduce it accurately. Parametric and external model uncertainties are of comparable magnitudes and generally exceed structural model uncertainties.\nGeosci. Model Dev.

Current land surface models (LSMs) poorly represent irrigation impacts on regional hydrology. 2. Approaches to include irrigation in LSMs are based on either potentially outdated irrigation inventory data or soil moisture curves that are not constrained by regional water balances. 3. We use satellite remote sensing of actual ET and groundwater depletion to develop recent estimates of regional irrigation data. 4. Remote-sensing parameterizations of irrigation improve model performance.\nGeosci. Model Dev.
