{"question":"How does conduction delay compare between myelinated and unmyelinated axons?","answer":"Unmyelinated axons show more variable conduction delays that increase with stimulus time and depend on activity history, as seen in the lobster PD neuron where delay varies with stimulus frequency. In contrast, myelinated neurons conduct impulses faster because nerve impulses jump over the myelin sheath rather than travel through it, making the distance to the axon terminal shorter due to the insulating properties of myelin.","context":["Volume 13 Supplement 1\nModeling and prediction of conduction delay in an unmyelinated axon\n© Zhang et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd. 2012\nPublished: 16 July 2012\nConduction delay in axons is a function of the axon morphology, passive membrane properties and voltage-gated ionic currents. Although conduction delay is usually assumed to be constant, indicating perfect temporal fidelity, recent work has shown that the delay of each action potential depends on the prior short- and long-term history of activity in the axon . Violation of temporal fidelity leads to substantial variations in inter-spike intervals which has potential impact on temporal neural activity.\nIn experiments using the motor axon of the pyloric dilator (PD) neuron of the lobster, H. americanus, we measured conduction delay using Poisson random stimuli applied at different mean rates . These measurements showed that the mean value and the variance of conduction delay increases as a function of stimulus time until these values reach a steady state at about 5 minutes post-stimulation. Even at steady state, conduction delay showed a non-monotonic relationship with stimulus frequency (finst): it was higher at small or large values of finst but has a minimum at finst~45 Hz. Moreover, bath application of dopamine drastically improved the temporal fidelity of conduction delay.\nWe have constructed a conductance-based model of the PD axon to examine the role of different ionic currents in shaping the history dependence of conduction delay. In addition to the standard Hodgkin-Huxley currents, this model includes a transient potassium current IA and a hyperpolarization activated inward current Ih, both of which have been characterized in this axon. The main effect of dopamine in the biological axon is an increase of Ih which counteracts the activity-dependent hyperpolarization , mimicked by adding a Na+/K+ pump in the model.\nAction potential conduction velocity can be approximated by (d=axon diam, R*=total memb resistance/unit area at peak, R a =axial resistivity, C m =capacitance/unit area . Although this equation accurately predicts the conduction velocity of a single action potential in our model, it fails to the variations in conduction velocity in the presence of the history-dependent effects. This discrepancy is partly due to non-uniform conduction velocity along the axon when active at high rates. We revise the formula to predict the relationship between the conduction delay and total membrane resistance at the action potential peak.\nSupported by NIH MH60605 and NS58825\n- Ballo AW, Bucher D: Complex intrinsic membrane properties and dopamine shape spiking activity in a motor axon.

Conduction velocity is also dependent on temperature and the properties of the axonal milieu.\nWhat is the normal range of nerve conduction?\nNCV tests can measure the speed and strength of nerve signals. Nerve conduction velocity between 50 to 60 meters per second is considered normal.\nWhat factors might influence nerve conduction velocity?\nPhysiological factors such as age, temperature, height, and gender are known to affect the nerve conduction velocity (NCV).\nWhy is conduction velocity important?\nIn neuroscience, nerve conduction velocity (CV) is an important aspect of nerve conduction studies. It is the speed at which an electrochemical impulse propagates down a neural pathway. Conduction velocities are affected by a wide array of factors, which include; age, sex, and various medical conditions.\nWhy will your calculated nerve conduction velocity therefore be an underestimate of the true conduction velocity?\nHowever, because the calculated CV is derived from a single stimulation point, it underestimates the true conduction value because it does not account for nerve activation time, tissue transit time, or physiologic slowing (discussed later here).\nWhat determines conduction velocity?\nThe conduction velocity of the action potential is determined by measuring the distance traveled (length of the nerve in m) and dividing by the time (sec) taken to complete the reflex arc, also called the latency. Conduction velocity = distance (m)/time (sec). Measurement of distance is relatively straightforward.\nWhat are the two main factors that determine conduction velocity in a neuron explain how each impacts conduction velocity?\nConduction velocity is influenced by myelin sheath thickness and internode distance (i.e. the distance along the axon between the nodes of Ranvier) (Hursh, 1939), and both parameters are linearly related to axon diameter.\nWhat are the two main factors that determine conduction velocity in a neuron?\nThe speed of neuron transmission generally depends upon two factors: axon size and degree of myelination. Larger diameter axons transmit signal faster due to lower resistance to the flow of charge inside the axon.\nWhy does age affect nerve conduction velocity?\nPatients with older age had longer latencies, smaller amplitudes, and slower conduction velocities compared with the younger age group. The change with age was greater in sensory nerve conduction and late responses in all the peripheral nerves.\nWhat is the relationship between nerve size and conduction velocity?\nThe conduction velocity is proportional to fiber diameter, and there is an optimum ratio of myelin thickness to fiber diameter for maximal conduction velocity. Internodal length is roughly proportional to fiber diameter in normal nerve populations (Hiscoe 1947; Vizoso and Young 1948; Vizoso 1950).\nWhat is the relationship between nerve size and conduction velocity explain?\nLarger diameter axons have a higher conduction velocity, which means they are able to send signals faster. This is because there is less resistance facing the ion flow.\nHow is nerve conduction velocity measured?\nThe nerve conduction velocity (speed) is then calculated by measuring the distance between electrodes and the time it takes for electrical impulses to travel between electrodes. A related procedure that may be performed is electromyography (EMG).\nWhy is the speed of conduction through a reflex arc slower than the speed of conduction of an action potential along an axon?\nWhy is the speed of conduction through a reflex arc slower than the speed of conduction of an action potential along an axon? a. Transmission between neurons at synapses is slower than along axons.\nWhich type of nerve has the highest conduction velocity?\nUp until now, we have only activated fibres in the A-alpha group, the largest group of fibres in the nerve, containing fibres with the largest diameters and highest conduction velocity.\nWhat increases conduction velocity?\nMyelination improves the conduction velocity—the speed with which action potentials travel—in axons. Axon diameter also affects conduction velocity; fatter axons carry action potentials faster.\nWhy does conduction velocity increase with temperature?\nThe primary effects of temperature on nerve function occur by altering the kinetics of channel gating. The acceleration of sodium channel activation with warming increases conduction velocity, while the acceleration of sodium channel inactivation shortens the relative refractory period.\nHow does myelin increase conduction velocity?\nSummary. Myelin can greatly increase the speed of electrical impulses in neurons because it insulates the axon and assembles voltage-gated sodium channel clusters at discrete nodes along its length. Myelin damage causes several neurological diseases, such as multiple sclerosis.\nHow does myelin help increase conduction velocity quizlet?\nMyelination increases conduction velocity by: 1) electrically insulating the axon, which increases Rm and reduces membrane capacitance. This increases the length constant and reduces the time constant.\nWhy is the speed of conduction slower in Unmyelinated neurons?\nMyelinated neurons conduct impulses faster than unmyelinated neurons because nerve impulses jump over the myelin sheath rather than travel through it, making the distance to the axon terminal shorter. This occurs due to the large proportion of fatty substances that make up the myelin sheath.\nHow does the loss of myelin sheath alter nerve conduction velocity?\nMyelin reduces membrane leakiness by preventing open channels and as a result, increasing how far a single electrical impulse within the axon will travel. Importantly this also increases how quickly an action potential will travel down an axon – myelin greatly increases the conduction velocity of a neuron (Figure 2.3.\nHow does myelin decrease capacitance?\nMyelin in fact decreases capacitance and increases electrical resistance across the cell membrane (the axolemma) thereby helping to prevent the electric current from leaving the axon.\nHow does capacitance affect the velocity of the action potential?\nCapacitance affects the velocity (rate) of the action potential. Decrease the capacitance, and increase the velocity of the action potential."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:12e9048e-a775-4466-bdc7-8761d9f2c1ba>","<urn:uuid:3ee24140-b825-4337-94ca-7d32cbef19ee>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the specific engineering considerations for constructed wetlands in stormwater management, and how might the new regulatory changes impact their implementation in watershed protection?","answer":"Constructed wetlands require careful engineering to manage water storage and treatment. Key design elements include controlling 'bounce' (water level fluctuations) to under 2 feet for 10-year storm events, creating various depth zones (50/50 mix of open water and emergent plants), and selecting appropriate plants based on flood tolerance classifications. These systems provide multiple benefits: storing runoff, improving water quality, creating wildlife habitat, and offering community green space. However, the 2020 EPA regulatory changes threaten wetland protection by removing Clean Water Act coverage from wetlands not physically connected to protected waters, potentially allowing uncontrolled pollution discharge. This could undermine the effectiveness of constructed wetlands in watershed protection, especially in areas where wetlands go subsurface or don't have direct surface connections to larger water bodies.","context":["By Kelly Foster, Waterkeeper Alliance\nReversing more than 40 years of progress and settled law, on January 23, 2020, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Army Corps announced a new regulation that removes clean water protections against discharges of pollution into rivers, lakes, streams, and wetlands across the country.\nWhile the Clean Water Act is focused on protecting drinking water, fisheries, recreation and other important uses of our waters, the new regulation is focused only on protecting large, commercially navigable waters, the territorial seas, and a small subset of the waters that feed into them.\nThe regulation is a definition of “waters of the United States” under the Clean Water Act, and it determines whether toxic chemicals, radioactive waste, sewage, and other pollutants can be dumped into rivers, streams, lakes, and wetlands. Waters that meet the definition of “waters of the United States” are protected. Waters that fall outside it aren’t. That means the pollution prohibitions and controls designed to protect people and water quality simply do not apply — allowing uncontrolled discharges directly into the water.\nBecause everyone understands that clean water is vital to public health and wildlife, and pollution moves downstream, the Clean Water Act’s regulatory definition of “waters of the United States” has long protected traditionally navigable waters, territorial seas, interstate waters, and intrastate rivers, streams, lakes, wetlands, canals and other waters against pollution and destruction.\nThe new EPA and Army Corps regulatory definition is an extreme departure from that, and the impact on our nation’s waters will be dramatic if it is not overturned in court.\nThe regulation is not based on science and it will not protect drinking water, fisheries or recreational uses of the nation’s waters as required by the Clean Water Act. It eliminates protections for these, and many other, categories of waters:\n- Interstate waters that flow across state boundaries (unless protected by another category)\n- Rivers, streams and canals that flow in response to rainfall\n- Rivers, streams and canals that flow year-round or seasonally but do not connect in a “typical year” to commercially navigable waters or the territorial seas via surface flow\n- Lakes that do not contribute surface flow to commercially navigable waters or the territorial seas via surface flow in a “typical year”\n- Wetlands that do not physically touch or become flooded by an otherwise protected water\nThe agencies claim the rule is being adopted to provide regulatory certainty and predictability for American farmers, landowners, and businesses — but it provides nothing remotely akin to that because it creates arbitrary, non-scientific categories of protected waters.\nAlthough there is extensive data available on the hydrology and connectivity of our nation’s waters, EPA and the Army Corps say that “there are significant limitations to the extent to which currently available data can be used to identify the scope of all or even a subset of jurisdictional waters” and that they are “in the early stages” of their effort to develop data necessary to do so. In other words, the agencies do not know which waters are included in the regulatory definition they devised, and they are just now starting to try to figure that out.\nBecause the Clean Water Act would no longer be controlling all discharges of water pollution at their source as intended, we will not know where the pollution is coming from and we won’t be able to clean up downstream waters.\nEven worse, the agencies say they “bear the burden of proof” for determining if a water is jurisdictional and, if they lack data to make that determination, they will treat waters as “non-jurisdictional.” In response to comments pointing out problems with their definition, the agencies describe the shortcomings of the available data and types of complex, case-by-case evaluations they “may” undertake to make a decision. In other words, the agencies’ definition doesn’t provide regulatory certainty for anyone, including the agencies themselves.\nDespite the agencies’ lack of knowledge regarding what their own regulation means for our nation’s waterways, it is possible to get a sense of how many waterways will lose protection. The loss is dramatic, particularly in the West. For example, there are millions of miles of rivers and streams across the country that could lose protection solely based on frequency of flow, including the ephemeral streams that make up roughly 90 percent or more of all surface water in the arid Southwest. And at least 51 percent of the nation’s wetlands could lose protection solely because they do not physically touch a protected river, stream or lake.\nThese are significant and devastating losses, and we know it will be far worse than that. For example, we applied the rule to 12 watersheds across the country and determined:\n- A 14,605 square-mile-area New Mexico’s Rio Grande Basin could lose protection. Additionally, roughly 90 percent of the rivers and streams in the basin could lose protection, including a stream that receives discharges from Los Alamos National Laboratory upstream from a drinking water intake for the City of Santa Fe.\n- Streams and rivers throughout the Meramec and Lower Missouri River watersheds, including 1,083 miles of streams that go subsurface and feed into rivers and springs, could lose protection.\n- All of the waters in a roughly 5,185 square mile area of the Snake River basin that include waters important for recreation, tourism and trout fishing like the Big Lost River, Little Lost River, and Medicine Lodge Creek could lose protection.\nUncontrolled pollution discharged into these waters not only harms the receiving waters directly, but also causes pollution and harm to downstream waters. This is true without regard to whether the water exists because of rainfall, goes subsurface, or doesn’t physically touch a downstream water. And because the Clean Water Act would no longer be controlling all discharges of water pollution at their source as intended, we will not know where the pollution is coming from and we won’t be able to clean up downstream waters.\nThe Clean Water Act requires the agencies to maintain and protect the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the nation’s waters. The Agencies have instead adopted a regulation that is a giveaway to industrial polluters and will allow widespread pollution and destruction of the nation’s waters. This endangers all of us. Waterkeeper Alliance is committed to overturning this dangerous regulation, and restoring broad water quality protections for our country’s water resources.","If You Build It\nConstructed wetlands provide an ideal solution for dealing with stormwater in increasingly urbanized environments\n- By Scott D. Wallace\n- Apr 01, 2006\nStormwater managers around the country are challenged by growing regulatory requirements in the face of increasingly urbanized land uses. As cities continue to grow, more and more areas are covered with roads, buildings, parking lots, and other impervious surfaces. Instead of storing and slowly releasing water, these impervious surfaces quickly shed rainfall. At the same time, contaminants on these impervious surfaces, such as salt, oils, and sediments, are picked up and carried away in the runoff. The result is both an increase in runoff volume and a decrease in water quality, contributing to the decline of urban and suburban streams throughout the United States.\nThis threat to our streams and rivers has lead to intense interest in stormwater best management practices (BMPs). Because stormwater managers often have very limited areas in which to install BMPs, there is a push toward systems that can provide as much multiple-use benefit as possible.\nWhy Constructed Wetlands?\nAlterations of drainage patterns within watersheds often require the creation of new, engineered wetland systems. These constructed wetlands can be designed to achieve specific project goals. Wetlands combine the goals of water storage and release, water quality improvement, wildlife habitat, and community green space. By combining these attributes, wetlands offer many opportunities for multiple-benefit stormwater projects.\nLocated within depressed areas in the landscape, wetlands are natural accumulation points for stormwater runoff. After storm events, wetlands fill with stormwater runoff, which is gradually released from the wetland basin. Water stored in the wetland can be released by overland flow to surface waters, or discharged to ground water through infiltration, depending on the specifics of the project.\nManaging Water in Wetlands\nThe key benefits provided by water storage in wetlands are volume and time. Every cubic foot of water that is temporarily stored in a wetland is a cubic foot of water subtracted from damaging peak floods. Processes that treat stormwater and reduce contaminants require time to operate. The storage and gradual release of runoff from wetlands provides the time needed for water treatment.\nWith knowledge of engineering hydraulics and plant hydrology, designers can create wetlands that store and release water in a manner that mimics the hydroperiod of natural wetlands. Wetland plants have developed the ability to transport oxygen from the leaves, through the plant stems, and into the root system. This oxygen transport capacity allows the plant to survive in waterlogged soils (which do not contain oxygen). However, individual plant species vary widely in this regard. Plants with a high degree of oxygen transfer can tolerate permanently flooded soils. Other plants may tolerate flooding for only a few days, or not at all. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has developed a classification system for this flood tolerance that ranges from Obligate (plants occur almost always (greater than 99 percent) in wetlands) to Upland (plants almost never (less than 1 percent) occur in wetlands).1 The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service ( www.fws.gov/nwi/bha/) has classified more than 6,700 plant species according to their wetland tolerance.\nIn addition to this classification system, there are handbooks available to assist in the plant selection process.2 Armed with this knowledge, designers can determine the acceptable \"bounce\" of the wetland (how much and how long a plant community can be flooded without adverse impacts). A typical bounce target for design purposes is less than 2 feet of water level increase from the 10-year, 24-hour storm event. Outlet weirs for the stormwater wetland can then be designed to produce bounce fluctuations that are within the acceptable range of the plant community.\nWetland Treatment Processes\nWetland systems remove contaminants through a variety of physical, chemical, and biological treatment mechanisms.3 Treatment mechanisms that are particularly important for stormwater management include settling, precipitation, plant uptake, and microbial degradation.\nIn the process of storing water, wetlands reduce flow velocity through the dense stem networks of aquatic plants. Reduction in flow velocity allows for settling, interception, and filtration of sediment particles. Since nutrients, metals, and organic matter are absorbed into sediment particles, substantial reductions of these pollutants occur as well.\nThese systems act as \"microbial hotels,\" with the microbes growing on plants, plant detritus, and sediment particles (the biofilm) performing as powerful treatment drivers for organic matter and nitrogen compounds. The wide range of oxidation/reduction (redox) potentials within the wetland environment creates conditions conducive to the precipitation of many metals, including iron, copper, and nickel.\nWetlands and Wildlife Habitat\nSince wetlands combine terrestrial and aquatic habitats, they offer unique benefits for hundreds of species of wildlife. These range from breeding habitat for amphibians to \"stop-over\" feeding and resting areas for migratory waterfowl. The decline of many animal species can be directly linked to the ongoing loss of wetland habitat within the United States. Despite an official policy of \"no net loss\" of wetlands, the United States continues to lose wetlands, with corresponding declines in many species (especially migratory birds) and associated increases in flood damages.\nMaintaining a healthy and diverse community of plants, insects, fish, birds and other species is a key ingredient is controlling nuisance species like mosquitoes. Well-designed wetland systems include a variety of habitat zones, ranging from open water to emergent plants to upland buffer areas. Wetland areas that are greater than 3-feet deep will generally not support emergent vegetation like cattails and bulrushes. These \"deep zones\" will instead be open-water areas that can support submerged aquatic plants and are attractive habitats for fish, waterfowl, and animals such as muskrats. Generally speaking, the greatest habitat diversity of a wetland system will be achieved with a 50/50 mix of open water and emergent plants.\nWetlands and People\nWetlands can provide \"green islands\" in an otherwise urban landscape. By combining zones of different water depth (with associated plant communities), a diverse range of habitats can be combined in a relatively small area. This creates a broad range of wildlife viewing opportunities, especially if visitor access through boardwalks or trails is incorporated into the project. This range of access can include viewing blinds for bird watching, elevated boardwalks for access into the wetland, fishing docks in deep-water areas, and associated trails through upland areas adjacent to the wetland.\nPlanning for visitor use requires an understanding of the type of wildlife that will use the wetland, the anticipated degree of access to the wetland, and the programming or educational goals associated with the project. For instance, wetlands that support populations of alligators or other potentially dangerous species will require boardwalks that are located at least 3 feet above the water level with a secure railing system. Educational programs may have their own specific needs, ranging from signage to a good location to gather visiting students. Fishing docks can be constructed over deep-water areas that provide good fish habitat (old pipes or brush piles can be used to increase fish habitat in these areas). The key is to identify the project goals for visitor use up-front and then design the needed infrastructure into the project to support these goals.\nWetlands have a lot to offer as a stormwater BMP. Through the storage and gradual release of water, they can reduce flood damage to downstream properties. Within the wetland ecosystem, a variety of processes naturally occur that treats runoff and reduces contaminants. Wetlands provide habitat for key wildlife species; and through the use of creative design, a diverse range of habitat areas can be combined into a small area. Finally, since wetlands are attractive to both people and wildlife, a broad range of visitor use can use the potential trails, boardwalks, and other design features.\nThe natural \"kidneys\" of our landscape, the ability of wetlands to store water and gradually release it, reducing flood damage, is well documented. Inside the wetland, complex assemblages of plants and microbes act to purify the water as it flows through the system. Wetlands offer protection from predators for many kinds of fish, amphibians, and reptiles, and they are an important link in the life chain of hundreds of species of migratory birds. Because of their abundant wildlife habitat, they offer the chance for people to \"get away\" and experience nature, even in urban environments.\n- United States Army Corps of Engineers (1987) Wetlands Delineation Manual.

{"question":"How do the five principles of Lean thinking relate to the implementation challenges of JIT inventory systems?","answer":"The five principles of Lean thinking (establishing value, understanding value stream, encouraging flow, pull production, and pursuit of perfection) directly align with but also expand upon the implementation challenges of JIT inventory systems. While JIT requires rethinking the entire workflow from raw materials to finished products and demands new supplier relationships, Lean principles provide a broader framework for these changes. The JIT implementation challenges of requiring workforce flexibility, needing management commitment, and establishing new supplier relationships correspond to Lean's principles of flow promotion, continuous improvement, and pull production. Both systems require a complete mindset change throughout the company, with Lean providing a more comprehensive framework focused on customer value, while JIT focuses specifically on inventory and production efficiency.","context":["Traditionally, raw materials and inventory of finished goods were considered assets. This notion has changed because of JIT and now inventory is considered as waste or dead investment, incurring additional costs.\nThe Benefits of Just-in-Time Inventory\nLen Calderone for | ManufacturingTomorrow\nJust-in-time (JIT) inventory is a stratagem that manufacturers utilize to increase efficiency and decrease waste by receiving goods only as they are needed in the manufacturing process, thereby reducing the cost of inventory. Importantly, manufacturers must forecast their requirements accurately.\nJIT avoids the waste associated with overproduction, waiting for material and holding excess inventory. The original concept was created by the founder of Toyota. Just-in-Time means that a manufacturer makes only what is needed, only when it is needed, and only in the amount that is needed.\nMany manufacturers have tried to imitate Toyota without understanding the underlying concept or motivation, which might have led to the failure of those projects. The concept behind Toyota’s system is to work intelligently and eliminate waste so that only minimal inventory is needed.\nToyota’s founder used the American supermarket as his model for what he was trying to achieve in the factory. When shopping for groceries, a customer takes what s/he wants from the shelf and purchases them. The store restocks the shelf with enough new product to fill up the shelf space. In a manufacturing situation, a worker would go to an inventory storage location and remove the quantity of material needed for production. The inventory storage location would then replenish just the amount of the material taken.\nThe just-in-time inventory model lets manufacturers reduce their overhead expenses while always ensuring that parts are available to manufacture their products. This allows a company’s customers to be better served, while, at the same time, lowering the cost of doing business.\nWarehousing excess inventory can be very expensive. Reducing the amount of inventory can reduce carrying costs. Companies that employ the just-in-time inventory model may be able to reduce the number of warehouses they own, or even allow them to eliminate those warehouses altogether.\nAn efficient supply chain can deliver lower costs throughout the manufacturing process, and those lower costs can then be passed on to the customer, making the company's products more affordable. This helps the company acquire a larger market share and outpace its competitors.\nBy using the JIT model, a manufacturer has a better level of control over its entire manufacturing process, thereby, making it easier to respond quickly when the needs of customers change. For example, a manufacturer that uses the just-in-time inventory model can quickly increase production of an in-demand product, while reducing production on products that are slowing down. The company will need to cut prices on any unsold inventory just to clear it out, which reduces the perceived value of the manufacturer’s other products. The just-in-time inventory model reduces this waste.\nOne example of JIT are fast-food restaurants, which use just-in-time inventory to serve their customers on a daily basis during breakfast, lunch and dinner. Fast food restaurants have cheese, burger patties and all the fixings in a refrigerator, but they don't start assembling and cooking their cheeseburgers until a customer places an order.\nAnother example is the self-publishing industry. Authors might forgo the traditional approach to publishing their works and self-publish. Self-published authors can take advantage of just-in-time inventory by working with a printer that offers print-on-demand services. Print-on-demand companies don't print the books until an order is placed.\nBy reducing inventory, JIT frees up resources to employ them elsewhere in the company. A retail store—using JIT—can renovate its warehouse space, providing additional retail floor space without expanding the store itself.\nA manufacturer can convert part of its warehouse into manufacturing space, increasing production. JIT also allows the workforce to focus on primary tasks, from making goods to interacting with customers rather than stocking material.\nWith JIT, manufacturers will know when employees are needed at different stations of assembly to meet the demand of those stages of manufacturing. A more flexible workforce can focus on quality production with lower defect rates, which lower costs and increase customer satisfaction.\nTo make JIT workable, management must rethink the entire work flow of the company, from the intake of raw materials to the final finished product. At the same time, supply-chain relationships might require multiple suppliers, closer locations, and suppliers that can provide materials with minimal notice.\nOne negative is the problem that smaller orders will be needed for JIT. Therefore, new negotiations may be needed because of minimum order requirements. Even if a slightly higher price is paid, the cost difference could be offset by the low cost of inventory.\nAn entirely different mindset will be needed throughout the company. The complete workforce must understand the entire JIT process and shift to where they are needed, as work flow recedes and surges to meet customer demand swings. This will take a sizable commitment of both time and money at first—plus allegiance—to stay the course in implementing JIT. If not, the system will never gain traction within the company.\nLean manufacturing and JIT are often mistaken for the same thing, but they are different concepts. Just-in-time manufacturing is focused on efficiency, while lean manufacturing is centered on using efficiency to add value for the customer. JIT can be utilized on its own, or as one step in the lean manufacturing process.\nLean manufacturing takes the idea of JIT and looks at it from the perspective of customer value. In the lean manufacturing process, a company must consider what aspects of the product add real value. The first tenet of lean manufacturing is that every step in the production process must add something of value.\nThe manufacturing process is then redesigned to remove activities that don't add value. Transporting parts from a distant warehouse to the manufacturing plant would not add value. Switching to JIT would reduce transportation and warehousing costs, making the product more affordable. The JIT process adds value by increasing efficiency.\nThe most important benefit of JIT is the elimination of raw material, inventory and product storage costs. Traditionally, raw materials and inventory of finished goods were considered assets. This notion has changed because of JIT and now inventory is considered as waste or dead investment, incurring additional costs.\nFor additional information:\nThe content & opinions in this article are the author’s and do not necessarily represent the views of ManufacturingTomorrow\nLen Calderone - Contributing Author\nLen contributes to this publication on a regular basis.

Full Overview Report\nLean Processes – The concept of “Lean Management” or lean administration encompasses all those methods that contribute to carrying out operations at minimum costs, optimizing processes and reducing waste.\nThe results of the study of the behaviour of the Japanese and American automotive industry led to the establishment of Lean principles for Project Management.\nThe 5 Principles of Lean Thinking\nLean thinking is based on five basic principles. Let us remember that the main objective of the lean methodology is “to do more with less”, eliminating waste (Muda), minimizing any activity or operation that does not add value to the product or service we supply. These principles forge the paradigm shift required by all company members to adopt Lean, with the necessary support of the organization’s leaders.\nThe first principle is based on establishing and being completely clear about what we consider value for the product or service we are examining. Second, we must identify and understand its value stream. In other words, fully understand all the stages, transactions, operations, and activities to supply said product or service. The third principle is related to flow promotion – attacking restrictions (bottlenecks) and arranging the process to facilitate the movement of materials, minimizing waste.\nAs a fourth point, we must work towards the maturation of our processes so that it is the customer who “pulls” their demand from the supply chain so that, as a supplier, we deliver a quality product, on time, in the required amounts as dictated by a JIT (Just-in-time) system. Finally, the fifth principle of Lean thinking is searching for perfection. Although perfection is not possible, this pillar reminds us that the path of continuous improvement has no end.\nBelow we explore the 5 Principles of Lean Thinking in more detail:\n1) Generate value\nThe initial principle is of paramount importance. What activities in the supply of my product or service generate value for my customer? The client’s needs must be embodied in a series of specifications, plans, or at least in a value offer. For example, if you run a beauty salon and offer makeup reference images, you must honour that offer to the customer’s satisfaction. The customer specifies, and the manufacturer must produce based on those specifications. The definition of the concept of customer value in the manufacturing sector delivered to the manufacturer through technical documentation. The manufacturer’s task is to supply these needs with minimum shedding consistently.\n2) Understand the value chain (VSM)\nAs we mentioned before, complete clarity required of the series of activities. And operations that must occur to generate value and deliver what the client asks of us. This objective can be achieved through a VSM mapping (Mapping of the Value Chain or Value Stream Mapping) of the current state, and sources of waste – change – can be identified, which must be minimized or eliminated. The VSM allows the analyst to solve problems, understand the flow of communication and information, evaluate the capacity of the process to meet the demand, manage suppliers, and determine the methods where essential activities are carried out for the definition of customer value.\n3) Encourage flow\nOnce the value chain been defined, it is necessary to facilitate the flow of materials. And products to fulfil our promise to the customer. To do this, we have several tools such as the principles of the Theory of Constraints, the Kanban system, Heijunka production levelling, standardization of processes and SWIP (Standard Work in Process), the VSM mentioned above, SMED (change of one-digit dies or Single Minute Exchange of Die), among others. If you have high production volumes, it is also recommended to organize the equipment and machines by flow (as in U-shaped work cells) and not by function (as a machining workshop would do).\n4) Pull Production\nWe refer to a JIT (Just-in-time) philosophy when talking about pull. Developing flexible and robust processes, rapid product changes, efficient information flows, and standardized operations. It seeks to reduce response times, avoid anticipating demand through expensive inventory, producing only when my internal client requires it. In the Clockwork Pull or Push blog article, an in-depth look at this specific topic.\n5) Pursuit of Perfection\nPerfection is a path unattainable in our indicators, but we can get closer to it if we instil a kaizen culture of continuous improvement at all levels of our organization.\nWhy is Lean Management so Important?\nIndustries such as IT, construction, and education have embraced Lean methodologies for their benefit. Lean project management can improve the value of products with streamlined processes.\nOther benefits of lean management:\n- Greater innovation: Projects improve thanks to creativity.\n- Less “waste”: Both physical “waste” and waiting times between production steps reduced. And at the same time, the possibility of overproduction or excess processes minimized.\n- Improved customer service: Customers are given what they need, no more and no less.\n- Better lead times: The result is faster responses and fewer delays.\n- Best quality products: Product defects minimized due to quality controls.\n- Better inventory management: With inventory monitoring, setbacks avoided.\n- Whether the stakeholders are internal or external, shifting to Lean thinking can simplify work processes and lead to greater efficiency in the project team.\nLean project management applies lean concepts such as poor construction, lean manufacturing and lean thinking to project management.\nLean Project Management guides companies in Project Management with high productivity in all project stages. With Lean, the delivery of projects pursued in a reasonable time, with a competitive cost. And a result that satisfies the requests and needs of the clients."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:bea5b95c-b5cd-48fb-b2a6-ba1d1a59ac8b>","<urn:uuid:6fcf3113-7f32-4e3d-ac44-6c1b88015768>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How was the Potsdam Museum established and what were the key developments in its early history?","answer":"The Potsdam Museum was founded in 1939 to house a Collection of English Pottery donated by Frank and Harriet Burnap, natives of the village who lived in Kansas City, Missouri. The Burnaps had assembled one of the most complete collections of English pottery in the United States and wanted to share it with their hometown. The basement of the library building at Elm and Park Streets was remodeled, and the Museum opened in 1940. Over the years, the museum expanded its collection to include glass, china, furniture, costumes, farm and household tools, and historical materials related to Potsdam and St. Lawrence County. It has evolved into an active cultural and educational community agency that offers rotating exhibits, research assistance, and educational programs for schools.","context":["The first Library Association was the Washington Benevolent Society Library Incorporated in Potsdam on June 14, 1814 under a general act with Benjamin Raymond, Liberty Knowles, Azel Lyman, Dr. Robert McChesney, Pierce Shepard, Jacob Redington, and Sewall Raymond, trustees.\nThe Union Library Association was incorporated January 8, 1828 with Jabez Willes, Zenas Clark, Amos Brown, Myron G. Munson, Horace Allen, Solomon M. Crary, Solomon Parmeter, trustees. The Masonic Royal Arch Masons, St. Lawrence Chapter No. 24, was formed at Massena February 1809. It was removed in 1816 to Potsdam. In 1828, it was suspended and having funds at the time, these were expended in the purchase of a library, which in 1853 had about 400 volumes. In 1887, a Library and Reading Room Association was formed and financed by subscriptions for three, three-year periods. This library, located in two stores in the Albion Hotel Block, was maintained for nine years.\nIn 1896, The Potsdam Public Library Reading Room Association was formed, five trustees were elected at the village caucus, money raised by taxation to maintain it, and funds solicited from individuals to purchase the Finnimore property, corner Market and Depot Streets. In 1934, the Universalist Church gave its building to the village for a library and with funds left by will to the library, it was remodeled into the present attractive building. In 1946, the present library celebrated its 50thanniversary, but Potsdam has had a library history since 1814.\nThe Potsdam Museum was founded in 1939 to house a Collection of English Pottery given to the village by Frank and Harriet Burnap, natives of the village, who resided in Kansas City, Missouri. Mr. and Mrs. Burnap had gathered together one of the most complete collections of English pottery in the United States and decided to share it with their home town. The basement of the library building, Elm and Park Streets, was remodeled and the Museum opened in 1940.\nDuring the years, many historical items have been given to the Museum, including glass, china, furniture, costumes, farm and household tools, and much material relating to the history of Potsdam, St. Lawrence County and the area. Today, the Museum is an active cultural and educational community agency, with a full program of rotating exhibits, research assistance, and aid to schools in the form of teachers’ boxes and class visits tailored to interests.\nGUN HOUSE – TOWN HALLS – CIVIC CENTER\nOn the site where the auditorium of the Civic Center now stands, was a small frame building called “The Gun House” where was kept the one cannon belonging to the village. On April 18, 1845, an act was passed to levy a tax of $600 in each year 1846-47 in the town of Potsdam for the erection of a town hall to be situated on the west side of the Public Square (where the “Gun-House” was), and not to be let on Sundays without the consent of the trustees of the two nearest churches. It was built in 1845 by William Sweet, contractor, of wood 64 x 40 feet, and stood on the center of the west side of Public Square. A story of an incident that happened in this first Town Hall is taken from Annie Clarkson’s History of the Episcopal Church. The Potsdam MERCURY of January 1848 thus alludes to Mr. Hubbard’s (he was the pastor of Trinity Church) taking part in the debate at a meeting of the Potsdam Lyceum. The subject for discussion was “Has Phrenology a tendency to benefit mankind?” Some of the best speaking talent of the place was called together, five ministers, three medical gentlemen, and several of the legal profession, but ‘the boys’ present made such a disturbance that the persons possessing a good degree of sensibility could not proceed in the debate. The Rev. Mr. Hubbard, a worthy appearing young gentleman of the Episcopal order, and who spoke with much feeling and candor, attempted a speech, but was so much disturbed by these intruders, that he paused and addressed some remarks to the ‘boys’. The real annoyers, not feeling themselves addressed by this appellation, continued their violation of order and propriety, and the worthy gentleman, after several ineffectual efforts to turn the minds of these graceless personages, obeyed the sentiment that ‘but one should speak at a time’, and in the midst of his speech, while quoting a beautiful passage from Shakespeare, took his seat, nor has he been at the Lyceum since . . . Mr. Hubbard’s sensibility and sense of propriety would not allow him to proceed amid confusion and he abandoned the effort. This Town Hall burned in 1857 and a new one was built in 1858 costing $5,000. This one lasted until 1875.\nIn 1875, the Town House was too old, leaky, and too small for such a thriving town and on February 1875 at Town Meeting, $20,000 was voted by a majority of 10 votes to build a new one. It was to be of broken ashlar 90 x 68 feet with a mansard roof. (Picture). It was the scene for Normal graduations, plays, musicals, lectures, home talent shows. One outstanding feature of the auditorium was its perfect acoustic properties and architects came from Boston and other cities trying to find the reason. No one ever found the secret. The building was condemned and in 1934 the new Civic Center project was launched, a group of buildings even now overtaxed in use and the envy of the North Country."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:8cf233e9-6f03-4e3e-99a0-c9186b737bb6>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the historical developments in Wisconsin's dairy goat industry since the late 1980s, and how do proper animal handling practices contribute to the success of dairy operations in terms of productivity and animal welfare?","answer":"Wisconsin's dairy goat industry began significant growth in 1989 when Montchevre started operations in a small former cheddar factory, driven by trade disputes with French imports. The industry has evolved from specialty shops to mainstream retail, with goat cheese now available nationwide in various forms including fresh cheese logs, crumbles, and aged varieties. The company helped make goat cheese mainstream in the U.S. by adapting products to American tastes and introducing innovations like flavored varieties. Regarding animal handling's impact on operations, research has demonstrated that negative handling behavior correlates with increased cow fearfulness, lower milk yield, and poorer conception rates. Conversely, positive handling techniques reduce fear and increase production. Studies show that dairy animals can recognize and remember handlers, responding with stress responses (increased heart rate) to those who treated them negatively, even when those handlers are merely present. Training in low-stress handling techniques has been shown to improve both productivity indicators and make animals easier to handle, highlighting the direct connection between proper handling and successful dairy operations.","context":["Dairy goat industry grows to keep up with demand for cheese\nThirty years ago, if you were looking for goat cheese, you likely went to a specialty cheese shop. The cheese was probably imported from France.\nToday, Wisconsin is the country’s nation's largest producer of goat cheese, and the industry is growing. While cows have always been part of the dairy state landscape, dairy goats fill more of the scene than ever before.\nConsider it the Montchevre effect. The largest producer of goat cheese in Wisconsin, Montchevre stepped into production almost by accident. When a trade dispute and high tariffs threatened goat cheese imports from France in 1987, Arnaud Solandt considered his options. If his company couldn’t sell goat cheese, perhaps it could make it.\n“Wisconsin was the logical place,” said Solandt, who commutes from his home in California. “I found a little co-op that would be able to sell us some (goat’s) milk, and it was easy to find a cheese plant.\n“I called my boss and said, I think I found something, goats, a building, the perfect setting. By that time, the sanction had been lifted. I told him he should check it out. If he wasn’t going to, I thought about doing it myself.”\nJean Rossard and Arnaud Solandt started Montchevre inside a small former cheddar factory in Preston in 1989. They rapidly outgrew that space and moved about 30 miles down the road to Belmont. They bought the facility from another cheese company, Lactalis, which moved to a new building next door to make French cheeses, including President Brie.\nMontchevre and Lactalis are now the two largest employers in Belmont, a small town in southwestern Wisconsin where the population hovers around 1,000.\nAnd Montchevre can be found in all major retailers nationwide. The early years meant wooing customers and introducing them to fresh chevre. Since then Montchevre has expanded production exponentially because of increased demand.\nAt the same time, Wisconsin is seeing an increase in dairy goats and production of goat cheese. As of Jan. 1, Wisconsin led the states for milk goat inventory, according to the latest USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service – Sheep and Goats report.\nWorking with 423 independent farms in Wisconsin, Minnesota, Illinois and Missouri, Montchevre collects 70% of its milk from within a 200-mile radius of its plant. Forty percent of that milk comes from 141 farms in Wisconsin. Milk is collected every two to three days, depending on the farm.\n“We started with a milk agreement from a co-op for 5,000 pounds of milk, which was a giant amount at the time,” Solandt recalled. “That’s all we could have at the beginning, (enough for) about 600 to 700 pounds of cheese. Now it wouldn’t be enough for our equipment.\n“I spent the first four or five years doing demos at stores,” he added. “So many times we had to fight the stereotypes that people had with the bad image of the goat. Then the popularity of the Mediterranean diet meant goat cheese became more acceptable.”\nSolandt said Montchevre played a big role in making goat cheese mainstream in the U.S.\n“Of course, we had to make every mistake possible at first,” he said. “We started thinking we had to have the product the way we would have it in France. We quickly realized in 1992 that we had to make something much more acceptable to consumers in the U.S.”\nToday finding goat cheese is no problem.\n“You can find goat cheese almost anywhere now, especially the chevre, the fresh goat cheese,” said Andy Johnson, a specialty cheese coordinator who works with producers as the outreach specialist for the Center for Dairy Research in Madison.\n“Goat cheese is also becoming more sophisticated. Now we’re seeing more specialty aged cheeses like a Bucheron or Brie or Crottin,” he continued. “We started a program almost 20 years ago focusing on specialty cheese. Goat cheese, it’s only going to get bigger and grow in popularity.”\nAmong those who see the appeal in dairy goats and cheese is Meg Wittenmyer, a cheesemaker and dairy goat farmer at Bifrost Farms in Boyceville. Wittenmyer, Wittenmeyer, who turns 60 this year, got her cheesemaking license in 2015 and and marks her creamery’s one-year anniversary in June. She also partners with two CSA programs, Threshing Table Farm out of Clayton, Wis. and Racing Heart Farm near the Twin Cities, to provide goat cheese for their customers.\nMontchevre is the largest goat cheese producer not only in Wisconsin but also in the country nation. Its line of fresh cheese logs includes 13 flavor varieties, from garlic herb and tomato basil to lemon, fig and olive, and the blueberry vanilla, which won top honors at the Wisconsin State Fair in 2015. Additional flavors like jalapeño honey are made exclusively for specific retailers; cranberry orange is made just for Whole Foods. Montchevre’s first foray into flavoring their cheese was to add cranberries.\n“It is a small industry. I remember my French colleagues making fun of me a little bit,” said Arnaud. “I smile when I see that in France they now have goat cheese with berries.”\nToday, Montchevre turns its goat’s milk into fresh cheese logs, crumbles and medallions, plus half a dozen styles of aged cheeses. Look for its newest product, Wood Box Brie, coming to retailers this spring.\nMontchevre has also made a commitment to non-GMO (genetically modified organisms), beginning with its bestselling 4-ounce fresh goat cheese logs. The company opened a lab in Kalona, Iowa, to analyze crops, hay and feed for goat’s milk producers, and in April began processing the logs for retail.\nInnovation is something they take pride in.\n“In 1995, we were the first company to do fresh goat cheese crumbles,” Solandt said. “This is a flagship product of our line. It is the first innovation made in Belmont. We’re pretty proud of that.”\nSolandt and Rossard have also branched out with Creamery 333, a partnership of friends in the cheese industry by which cheese is made at the Belmont facility but aged in Brooklyn, N.Y.\nAs demand for goat’s milk has increased, dairy goat farms also have grown. Besides new farms, some established dairy cow farmers have switched to goats or added them. Among them are Steve Loudenbeck, 50, and his son, Seth, 23, in Lake Geneva.\nThe Loudenbeck family has farmed the 72 acres, raising dairy cows and growing hay, since the early 1950s. Devastated by a barn fire in 2003, Steve shut down dairy operations. After high school, Seth, who has never wanted to do anything but farm, convinced persuaded his dad to return to dairy and transition the farm to dairy goats in 2013.\nLast November, they expanded and built a new barn for the “milkers.” The father-son team milk their 330 Saanen and Alpine goats daily at 4 a.m. and 4 p.m., 28 at a time.\n“The key to milk is good hay,” said Steve Loudenbeck, noting their goats feast on a grain mix plus hay grown on their farm.\n“They eat before us every morning and every night,” added Seth. He also plays country music for the goats, and the family shows their goats at the Walworth County Fair and takes them to the Wisconsin State Fair for milking demonstrations in its Discovery Barn.\n“I do believe there are more farmers who will get into this,” said Steve, who started with 125 goats and sees continued growth. “Montchevre came out and talked with us before we started, to tell us what we needed. It isn’t that much different from cows. The goats are more curious.”\nAccording to Solandt, “it is basically the same job, just on a smaller scale. It doesn’t mean it is less work. It is just as much work, but we’ve had a lot of people who have struggled with the price of cow milk, especially in the past few years. There is more demand for goat milk, and we’ve had quite a few farmers converting.”\nOn a larger scale, the city of Chilton has Drumlin Dairy and Milk Source, which is among the state’s largest dairy operations with four dairy farms in Wisconsin, varying in size from 2,400 to 8,000 milking cows.\nMilk Source began milking goats in the summer of 2016 with a few hundred. Today the milking herd numbers about 3,000. Milk is shipped to LaClare’s creamery in Malone, which is less than 10 miles from the farm.\n“We became aware that there was a shortage of goat milk for local Wisconsin processors,” said Bill Harke, director of public affairs for Milk Source. “For more than 50 years our family-owned dairy farms have produced the highest quality milk from dairy cows, and we are now doing that with our goats.\n“The market is evolving in interesting ways, and a marriage of cow milk with goat milk has proven to be quite popular with cheeses, such as LaClare’s Chandoka and Martone,” Harke added. “It’s exciting for families that have been steeped in generations of cows to be working with new animals.”\nThe industry’s influence also can be seen with the expansion of dairy goat education at Southwest Wisconsin Technical College in Fennimore. Staff there spent three years working with the Department of Agriculture to create a new dairy goat herd management program.\nThe school tapped farmers and cheesemakers for guidance and used a $100,000 gift from Montchevre to help implement monthly online classes, which begin this month. A two-day conference in November will follow. As part of the program, participants are required to complete 120 hours of on-farm experience.\n“The goat industry is so young, so new, and when we look at the infrastructure even in the state of Wisconsin, there’s a lot of learning that needs to be done,” said Deb Ihm, agriculture coordinator for the college. “People are trying to figure out the potential and sustainability.\n“We’re a good fit because of our location,” she added. “We’ve got four dairy goat cheese processors, including the largest one in the nation, Montchevre, within 45 minutes, and Saputo (Woolrich) down the road in Lancaster. This is about building upon what is already established.”","Good dairy-cow-handling skills are vital\nAppropriate animal handling practices are very important for dairy farms.\nExtensive research shows how farm personnel behave and handle the cattle has an impact on animal welfare and productivity, Dr. Katy Proudfoot, The Ohio State University Extension animal welfare and behavior specialist, told listeners during a recent DAIReXNET presentation.\n\"It's very clear from the research that negative human behavior can impact fearfulness in cows and that's related to production, so more fearful animals produce less milk and those two things combine to impact the overall welfare of that animal and that herd,\" she said.\nNegative behavior include slapping, pushing and hitting the animal with an object, as well as using prods, tail twisting, loud yelling and abrupt movements.\nResearch also shows the benefits of positive behavior, including reducing fear and increasing production, which contribute to better animal and herd welfare.\nLow stress, positive handling techniques are expressed through gentle touching, stroking, soft talking and slow, more methodical movements.\nFrom the cow's perspective\nDairy farm personnel should take into account the way cows hear and see, Proudfoot said. Thanks to their large, very mobile ears, their hearing is actually much better than humans, both in the range and volume, so what humans view as loud is amplified for them.\nIt's also important to recognize that their visual field is very different from humans. Their eyes are on the side of their heads and to the front, giving them poor forward depth perception.\n\"They can't really see very well in front of them, and they can't see anything behind them,\" she noted. That mean moving too quickly in or out of a cow's rear blind spot or in front of her will spark more fearful responses.\nCows stand in the middle of a personal flight zone and will move away if a person enters it. The size of that flight zone is impacted by breed, genetics and age, as well as human behavior.\n\"The variations in flight zones can tell you a little bit about fearfulness of cows — the larger the flight zone is, the more likely they are to be fearful of people,\" Proudfoot said.\nInterestingly, studies on fear and aversion revealed that cows find shouting as distressing as a short electric shock. That could mean the prod isn't as aversive as we think it is, she noted, or it could be the shout is actually more aversive than we think to cows' more sensitive ears.\nThe effects of negative handler behavior were researched using people who behaved either positively or negatively with the study cows. The individual bovines' behavior, milk yield and physiological stress response were then measured as each handler came into the parlor.\nEven though the handlers were merely present in the parlor and not handling the cows, the animals showed a stress response, such as increased heart rate, only when the negative handlers entered the parlor. The cows also behaved differently, moving more and more likely to kick, when the milking machines were attached and there was a tendency for milk yield to be lower, Proudfoot added.\n\"This tells us that cows can recognize people, distinguish between them and can remember who treats them negatively,\" she said.\nA study to see how cows recognize people began with the animals being feed treats by a particular person. In follow-up tests, when the human faces were visible, cows chose their \"rewarder\" over 90 percent of the time. When faces were covered, Proudfoot said cows still selected their \"rewarder\" about half the time, suggesting they use smell and/or appearance, as well.\nIn an effort to understand the effects of handling, Australian researchers visited 66 dairy farms and measured the amount of negative handling that cows experienced, as well as flight zones, milk yields and conception rates. A wide variation in handling was documented, ranging from farms with very little negative handling to others where, 40 percent of the time, cows were handled in ways that were aversive, such as shouting or hitting.\nThe study concluded that negative handler behavior was correlated with cow fearfulness as measured by the size of the flight zone, lower milk yield and poorer conception rates.\n\"It should be mentioned that we know that correlation does not necessarily mean causation. All we knew is that these things are related,\" Proudfoot noted.\nBenefits of handling training\nWhen producers were given a intervention course on animal handling, they were found less likely to use negative handling. They also believed that their cows were easier to handle, which Proudfoot pointed out is generally the case when people learn low stress handling techniques.\nResearchers also documented an increase in milk yield and conception rates after the training course. \"There was some evidence that, by improving these skills, you can actually improve some indicators of productivity,\" she said.\nLow-stress handling is a concept that has been discussed for decades, especially within the beef cow industry and by Dr. Temple Grandin. \"There are handling techniques that handlers can learn so they do not need to shout, hit, kick or prod the cows to get them to move,\" Proudfoot pointed out.\nA good way to determine if a farm could benefit from training is to look at and listen to the cows and the people, she suggested.\nDo the cows have large flight zones? Do they look \"on-edge\" or vigilant? Do they quickly move away from you and other people? Do they slip/fall? Do they bunch? Do they vocalize? \"These are all signs, from the cow, that tell you she may be experiencing fear,\" Proudfoot said.\nThe flight zone of the cows can be measured by, first, choosing a sample of cows at the feed bunk or in a pen. Slowly start to walk up to the cows, moving about one step per second. If the majority of the cows are moving away from you when you are somewhat less than 10 feet away, they are likely fearful, Proudfoot said..\nTurning her attention to the handlers, Proudfoot asked if they hit or punch the cows. Are they using a prod when it isn't necessary? Are they yelling or cursing at the animals? Do they bang objects together to make loud noise? Do they drag calves? Do they generally seem like they don't care about the animals?\nIf a farm can answer \"yes\" to any of these questions, Proudfoot suggested, the handlers and their cows would benefit from handling training.\nChoose a training class that teaches skills, she advised, including moving cows using their flight zone, point of balance and herd behavior; how to avoid negative behavior and use positive reinforcement.\nThe training should teach the skills, but it should also impact the handler's attitude. Improving skills can improve attitude and job satisfaction, she pointed out.\nOwners should be aware of employees that do not care about the animals, or are not satisfied with their jobs since negative attitudes can lead to negative behavior.\nTake action when the employees could benefit from training, if you see something that you are not comfortable with, or if employee attitude is a problem.\n\"If you see abuse, stop abuse,\" she said. \"Animal care starts with you.\"\nOptions for handling training currently available include the following:\n·Merck DairyCare365 at www.dairycare365.com/solution/dairy-care365-training-series\n·Validus/Kansas State Animal Care Training at www.animalcaretraining.org/PackageDetail.aspx?type=DAIRY\n·National Dairy FARM Program at www.nationaldairyfarm.com/resources"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:3e01e1ef-fdde-431d-8012-81e8f1a4dcb1>","<urn:uuid:c1a3de9e-520a-454a-ae00-ffd36428576e>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How cost-effective are electric blankets for heating, and what fire safety plans should households have in place?","answer":"Electric blankets are highly cost-effective for heating, with typical usage costing between 1p to 9p per night. A 60-watt blanket used for seven hours nightly over six months costs approximately £14.60 annually, while a 70-watt version costs £16.42 - comparable to leaving a landing light on. Regarding fire safety, households should have a comprehensive plan including smoke alarms on every level, regular battery checks, and an escape plan with two ways out of each room plus a designated meeting spot outside. Everyone in the household should know how to properly use a fire extinguisher and understand the P.A.S.S. technique (Pull, Aim, Squeeze, and Sweep).","context":["These are the best electric blankets to ensure you stay warm and well-rested through the colder months\nWhat could be more inviting than a warm bed on a cold night? With the UK’s long, chilly winters, many of us can’t do without a hot water bottle or electric blanket to make the climb into bed a bit easier. But while hot water bottles offer a localised heat, an electric blanket will ensure you’re blissfully thawed from head to toe. Indeed, the prospect of jumping into a pre-heated bed on a chilly night is so appealing that you might just start opting for an earlier bedtime.\nElectric blankets are having a bit of a comeback. Forget your granny’s old energy-guzzling electric blanket, which was so crudely made that you could feel the bony wires through the bed sheet. Today’s newer models feature much better technology, thinner wires and higher safety standards. They are also a lot cheaper to run than cranking up your heating. In fact, they will allow you to drop your thermostat by a few degrees, or even turn the heating off altogether.\nAs well as keeping you cosy, electric blankets have other benefits too. The heat they provide will increase blood circulation and help your muscles to relax. This can alleviate any muscle tension, stiffness or pain from arthritis. A number of studies show the effectiveness heat can have in healing a variety of conditions. Share a bed with your partner? Many models come with dual controls that will allow you both to determine your own individual temperature on each side of the bed.\nHow do electric blankets work?\nThey contain thin electrical heating wires that have been placed into the fabric. The blanket is placed in between your mattress and bottom bed sheet. When you plug the blanket into your electricity supply they heat up, warming the blanket and your bed.\nThey feature an attached control unit (between the blanket and the electrical outlet) that you use to turn it on and off. This adjusts the amount of heat it produces and how long it stays on for.\nModern electric blankets have a shut-off mechanism, which prevent the blanket from overheating or catching fire. Do not use a blanket that pre-dates 2001 as it may not contain this shut-off mechanism, so it may run the risk of overheating.\nTip: Always check the cord is long enough to reach the nearest plug socket, or you may need to use an extension lead.\nHow much do electric blankets cost to run?\nThe price you pay for an electric blanket will depend on your usage. It can either be kept on all night on a low setting, or used for a short amount of time before you get into bed.\nEnergy Helpline tested a 60 watt and a 70 watt blanket for seven hours a night over six months, which is as much as you’re likely to use the blanket for. The annual cost for the 60 watt was £14.60 (8p a night) and £16.42 for the 70 watt – (9p a night). This is about the same cost as leaving the landing light on.\nBest electric blankets\n1. Dreamland Cotton Heated Mattress protector – best for a quick heat-up time\nThis economical electric blanket from Dreamland costs as little as 1p per night to run for seven hours. It fits like an elasticated fitted sheet, so it is really easy to throw on your bed. It hugs the mattress really well with a generous 38cm deep skirt. Made from 200-thread-count cotton, it is soft to the touch, breathable, and the deep quilted finish makes it feel all the more luxurious.\nIdeal Home newsletter\nSign up to our newsletter for style and decor inspiration, house tours, project advice and more\nThe pièce de résistance is the addition of dual controls so you and your partner can pick your own setting. If they’re ever away you only need to heat up your own side of the bed. It features a very handy ‘Ready For Bed’ five-minute pre-heat button. Turn this on before you clean your teeth, wash your face etc, and by the time you’re prepped for bed it will be ready for you.\nIn addition, it comes with a choice of five different heat settings which you can select for just 1 hour as you nod off. It can even stay on all night, for nine hours. After your chosen time, it automatically shuts off.\nIf you do opt for the all-night setting, it cleverly detects and responds to any temperature changes whilst you sleep. Available in all sizes from single through to super king with dual controls available from the double size up. This electric blanket can be washed at 40 °C and tumble dried on a low setting.\nIdeal Home’s rating: 5 out of 5 stars\n2. Silentnight comfort control electric blanket – best for a low budget\nThe Silentnight electric blanket is not designed to fit to the edges of the mattress. Instead, it comes with ties that neatly wrap around the four corners instead, keeping it securely in place. It is a bit of a fiddle to set up and if you’re looking for full bed coverage, then this might not be your first choice.\nThat said, it is a good option if you just want to use an electric blanket occasionally and don’t feel the need to splash out on a top-of-the-range model. You have three heat settings to choose from, and there is an auto shut-off function, which means the built-in thermal fuse will shut down if it detects a hot spot or a fault in the wiring.\nMade from polyester, it is not very soft to the touch and it could do with a bit more padding as the wires do stick out a little. However, this blanket is memory-foam compatible.\nAn added perk is you can also control your Silentnight electric blanket (and other home electronics) with the Silentnight App and Wi-Fi plug. Wherever you are you can use your smartphone to switch the blanket on or off, and even set the timer so it’s warmed up and ready for when you get in.

Never use an electric blanket if you’re sharing your bed with a small child or pet. The Fire Service lists the following safety instructions:\n- Always follow the manufacturer’s instructions\n- Only use a blanket that has the UK Safety Standard mark\n- Never use an electric underblanket as an electric overblanket, and vice versa\n- Keep all blankets flat – make sure there is no crumpling that could hold any excess heat\n- Only leave a blanket switched on all night if it has thermostatic controls for safe all-night use.\n- Don’t get blankets wet, and if your blanket does get wet, don’t use it. Never switch it on to dry it.\n- Always turn off at the mains when not in use.\nHow do I clean an electric blanket?\nVideo Of The Week\nVideo Of The Week\nIt’s nice to have a blanket that is as clean and fresh as it is warm. Always check the manufacturers instructions first, but most can be washed in the machine at 40 degrees using a mild detergent. Just make sure you detach the controls first!\nSome can even be tumble dried, but never use your electric blanket until it is completely dry or you could damage the wiring. Never iron your electric blanket.\nWhat else should I know before buying an electric blanket?\n- How often should I replace my electric blanket? You should replace your electric blanket at least every 10 years. If you are ever in doubt about the condition, bin it and buy a new one – never buy one second-hand.\n- What are the fabric options? They are typically made from polyester, fleece or cotton and really it comes down to personal preference. Polyester is more affordable and durable but less breathable than cotton. Choose fleece for an all-round cosy experience.\n- What if I suffer from allergies? There are plenty of anti-allergy options out there. Made from specially-made hypoallergenic fabrics combined with the blanket’s heat, they create a hostile environment for any dust mites.\n- Can you feel the wires? You really shouldn’t. The wires used these days are very thin and flexible.\n- Can you use an electric blanket with a memory foam mattress? It’s not ideal as memory foam reacts to your own body heat. The blanket will act as a barrier between your body and the mattress, which will prevent the mattress from moulding to your body properly. However, there are some models out there that are compatible.\n- How hot do electric blankets get? The average minimum temperature is around 25°C (the lowest is 18°C). The average maximum is 48°C (the highest is 56°C).\n- How should I store my electric blanket when not in use? Always roll your electric blanket as folding could damage the wires.","06 May Fire Prevention And Protection\nFire Prevention And Protection\nFire prevention and protection is an important consideration for homeowners, business owners, and communities.

This plan should be regularly reviewed and updated with new information. It should detail the steps to take in case of a fire emergency, as well as provide instructions on how to prevent one from occurring.\nThis fire safety plan should include evacuation routes for all personnel, along with any disability accommodations that need to be taken into account. It should also contain procedures for alerting personnel and responding quickly to an emergency.\nThis can include designating people as responsible for different parts of the building or area, such as a lookout, firefighter, medical responder, etc.\nHaving an effective fire safety plan is key to preventing damages and keeping personnel safe in the event of an emergency. Regular review and practice of this plan ensures that everyone is prepared and can respond quickly if needed.\nIn addition, having a clear understanding of the plan helps reduce mistakes and delays caused by confusion or miscommunication during an emergency situation.\nNow that we have covered the basics of fire safety plans, it is important to understand the role of fire extinguishers.\nFire extinguishers can be an invaluable tool in combating a fire before it spreads and causes more serious damage. They are an effective way to stop a small fire from becoming a large one, and should always be kept on hand in any environment where a fire could occur.\ndepending on the type of fire they are designed for. For example, Class A extinguishers are used for fires involving ordinary combustibles such as wood, paper, or fabric, while Class B extinguishers are designed for fires involving flammable liquids such as grease or gasoline. It is important to understand the different classes and choose the right type of extinguisher for each application.\nWhen using a fire extinguisher it is important to remember the acronym P.A.S.S., which stands for Pull, Aim, Squeeze, and Sweep. This process will ensure that you use the correct technique when attempting to put out a fire with an extinguisher.\nAdditionally, it is important to keep in mind that even if you successfully contain a fire with an extinguisher there may still be hidden smoldering sources within walls or other objects that could reignite later on and cause further damage or injury if not properly taken care of. Therefore, any use of an extinguisher should be followed up with proper clean up and inspection by trained personnel.\nFire Emergency Response\nFire prevention and protection are essential for keeping people safe from the danger of fire. It is important to be aware of the potential risks associated with fire and to take steps to minimize them. A crucial part of effective fire safety is having a plan in place for how to respond if a fire does occur.\nFire emergency response is necessary to ensure that everyone can get out of the building safely and that the fire can be extinguished quickly. It is important for everyone in the building to know what actions they need to take in case of an emergency, such as a fire.\nWhen an alarm sounds, everyone should immediately evacuate the building, using designated exits if possible. During this process, individuals should stay low and follow directions from any emergency personnel on site. This will help ensure that everyone can safely get out of the building as quickly as possible.\nOnce outside, people should move a safe distance away from the building so that they don’t impede firefighters or other personnel responding to the incident. It is also important for anyone outside not to re-enter the burning structure until it has been declared safe by authorities or firefighter personnel on site.\nBy following these guidelines and taking proper precautions during an emergency, individuals can help ensure their own safety while allowing first responders to do their job efficiently and effectively.\nIt’s important to take fire prevention and protection seriously. We should always be aware of the risks and take steps to minimize them.\nFire safety plans are essential for any home or business, as they provide a clear plan of action in case of an emergency.\nAdditionally, having fire extinguishers on-site, knowing how to use them correctly, and doing regular maintenance can help put out any small fires before they become large ones.\nFinally, it is important that everyone know what to do in the event of a fire emergency.\nBy following these tips, we can all work together to reduce the risk of fires and protect ourselves and our property.\nMy Fire Safety.

{"question":"How do both the vanadium flow battery and La Pyramide cheese demonstrate advancements in their respective fields, and what challenges do they face?","answer":"The vanadium flow battery represents advancement in energy storage, with commercial implementations including a planned 50-megawatt battery in Port Augusta and China building the world's largest such battery. However, it faces challenges of high upfront costs and lower efficiency compared to Li-ion batteries. Similarly, La Pyramide represents advancement in cheese-making, evidenced by its maker Debra Amrein-Boyes being one of only 18 North Americans inducted into the prestigious French Guilde des Fromagers Confrerie de St.-Uguzon. While the cheese demonstrates sophisticated flavor development and aging potential, it faces limited availability, being locally available only in British Columbia, though it can be shipped throughout Canada.","context":["No one can say the West Coast doesn't have it all. The mountains, the ocean, and now pyramids. La Pyramide to be exact.\nThis firm goat's milk cheese from The Farm House Natural Cheeses in Agassiz, B.C., is shaped like the triangular Egyptian masterpiece - with the top lopped off. Once you experience La Pyramide's sophisticated, smooth flavour, you'll be wishing you had the missing piece, too.\nThe exterior of the cheese is dusted in ash whose dark grey tones mix with the white mould rind and give La Pyramide a delicately textured, ancient appearance. On looks alone, this stately polygon makes a cheese board photo-worthy.\nSlicing into the dense paste, you discover a pale white interior with a ripe edge at the thin, delicate rind. The flavour is mild and tangy when it first hits the palate. This acidity is balanced by a creaminess that transforms potentially tart flavours into the sweeter zing you might find in lemon shortbread.\nProviding a perfect contrast, the rind is slightly sharp and salty. Most impressive are the lingering and complex notes that continue to develop long after the cheese has melted in your mouth.\nLa Pyramide is modelled after the AOC French cheese Valençay, which originates in France's Loire Valley. And you can blame Napoleon for the absentee peak on the cheese. The story goes that the emperor, upon his return from an unsuccessful Egyptian campaign, became enraged when he saw the pyramid-shaped cheese and sliced the top off.\nThis B.C. cheese is made with cultures that originate from France to provide authentic flavour. These are added to the pasteurized milk, which is allowed to ripen at a low temperature for about 20 hours. This gradual ripening allows the lactic bacterial cultures to develop slowly, encouraging lots of flavour development. Then the curd, cut in slivers (allowing for more moisture release) is hand-ladled into the moulds and left to drain for 48 hours.\nOnce unmoulded, the cheese is salted and dusted with ash. After another two days of draining, the cheese is allowed to ripen for a minimum of two weeks. La Pyramide is tasty in its younger stages but is also capable of long ripening. Eventually, when aged and hard, it becomes perfect for grating.\nFarm House Natural's cheese maker, Debra Amrein-Boyes, was one of 18 people in North America inducted into the Guilde des Fromagers Confrerie de St.-Uguzon this March. The guild is a prestigious French organization that recognizes individuals who uphold and protect the traditional cheese-making process.

So as the world works to decarbonize its energy supply by reducing its reliance on coal, natural gas and petroleum and increasing its use of these variable renewable sources of electricity for the grid, one technology, in particular, is experiencing a renaissance: the stationary battery.\nIn a nutshell, stationary batteries are devices that use chemical interactions between materials to store electricity at a set location for later use. These batteries make it possible to store the electricity generated when sun and wind are at their peak so it can be made available to the grid when electricity demand is at its peak — such as when people get home from work and turn on their lights, air-conditioning or heating, television, and kitchen appliances.\nThe class of battery most modern electronics users and electric vehicle owners are familiar with is the lithium-ion, or Li-ion, battery. Li-ion batteries also predominate in the stationary battery market, mainly because they’ve been around longer and have had more time to mature as a technology, according to Jessica Trancik, associate professor of energy studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and the Institute for Data, Systems, and Society\nBut just because Li-ion batteries are commonly used in consumer electronics and EVs, that doesn’t necessarily mean they’re the best option for storing electricity in a renewable energy-dependent grid. Today’s lithium-ion batteries have their risks, costs, and limitations. And while they might be first out of the blocks on the battery market, they will soon face stiff competition from a variety of alternatives and amendments that aim to match or beat their efficiency, with greater safety and sustainability. As the incentives increase for the development of more large-scale electricity storage and the business case for better battery storage technology becomes evident, there’s plenty of innovation happening.\nAmong the frontrunners for large-scale stationary storage of wind and solar power are flow batteries, which consist of two tanks of liquids that feed into electrochemical cells. The main difference between flow and conventional batteries is that flow batteries store the electricity in the liquid rather than in the electrodes. They’re far more stable than Li-ion, they have longer lifespans, and the liquids are less flammable. Not only that, but a flow battery can be scaled up by simply building bigger tanks for the liquids.\nOne type of flow battery, known as the vanadium flow battery, is already available commercially. A grid-scale 50-megawatt vanadium flow battery is planned for energy storage in the South Australian town of Port Augusta, and China is building the world’s largest vanadium flow battery, expected to come online in 2020. There are two main downsides: the liquids can be costly, so there’s a greater up-front cost for the batteries, and flow batteries aren’t quite as efficient as Li-ion batteries.\nPlenty of Innovation\nThere are plenty of other developments happening in this space, making it an exciting time for battery research and development, Trancik says.\nFor example, researchers at RMIT University in Melbourne are developing a proton battery that works by turning water into oxygen and hydrogen, then using the hydrogen to power a fuel cell. Several other research teams around the world are exploring completely lithium-free ion batteries using materials such as graphite and potassium for the electrodes and aluminum salt liquids to carry the charged ions. Researchers in China are looking at improving the existing technology of nickel-zinc batteries, which are cost-effective, safe, non-toxic and environment-friendly but don’t last as long as Li-ion. There is even work going on related to saltwater-based batteries, with one design already being used for residential solar storage.\n“Now we see a lot more incentive, we see falling costs for lithium-ion batteries, we see the stationary energy storage market benefiting from the growth of electric vehicles,” Trancik says. “It’s definitely still early days, particularly for stationary energy storage, but it’s a really important area and I think people are starting to realize that.”"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:a3e2b5e1-7d0f-4bb9-bc3b-5adecca46b83>","<urn:uuid:58ee76b7-ec26-4617-8466-3fdecaba7dfa>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What role did the Vehicle Assembly Building serve, and what EVA mobility requirements must it accommodate?","answer":"The Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) served as the indoor assembly facility for rockets, measuring 716 feet long, 518 feet wide, and 525 feet tall. It contains four high bays originally used for Saturn V assembly and now used for shuttle orbiter mating with rockets and external tanks. The facility must accommodate EVA mobility requirements including: suits capable of kneeling, bending, and prolonged walking, chest displays that don't impede arm/hand work envelopes, enhanced durability for long-term use, simplified resizing capability for different crew members, and integrated features for airlock ingress/egress in both standing and seated positions.","context":["The primary launch facility for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.\nAfter World War II, the United States began serious development of long-range missiles. Work to extend the range of missiles quickly encountered a major public safety issue. Missiles fired from existing test sites would have to fly over populated areas. Early missiles were inherently unsafe and unreliable, so civilian overflight was deemed unacceptable. A coastal or island launch facility was considered ideal, since flights over unpopulated ocean would result in minimal civilian risk. Many sites were considered. Soon, however, the Cape Canaveral area of Florida became the choice for most of the large missile tests. Cape Canaveral prominently juts out from Florida’s eastern coastline. This provides a large margin for safety if a missile were suddenly to go off course. Furthermore, the area around the cape was marshy and had a low civilian population density. Despite its relative isolation, major roads, rail lines, and port facilities were nearby, so logistics were less of a difficulty at the Cape Canaveral site than many others suggested.\nLimited tests were conducted in the Cape Canaveral area as early as 1947, but full-scale missile tests began in earnest in July, 1950. Missiles and rockets have been fired from Cape Canaveral ever since. The Cape Canaveral site began in 1940 as the Banana River Naval Air Station. The site was transferred to the Air Force in 1950 and renamed the Patrick Air Force Base. The launch facilities were designated the Atlantic Missile Range and the Missile Firing Laboratory. The launch facilities are now part of the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, associated with the Patrick Air Force Base, under the jurisdiction of the Forty-fifth Space Wing.\nMost early missiles, and nearly all intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), were tested at the Cape Canaveral launch facilities. Working under the principle promoted by Wernher von Braun, the chief missile designer in the United States, each launch facility was built for a different type of missile. Fueling equipment, servicing equipment, and a service tower, called a gantry, were all built specifically for each rocket. Furthermore, control systems for each rocket were housed near the launch pad in a reinforced concrete bunker called a blockhouse. Missiles and rockets were generally assembled at the launch site, so each launch complex required vehicle assembly equipment. Each launch complex received a numerical designation, based on the order of its construction.\nWhen the United States made the decision to send humans into space, it made sense to use the facilities at Cape Canaveral to launch the rockets carrying the astronauts. Launch Complexes 5 and 6 served as the launch sites for the first U.S. crewed spacecraft, the Mercury/Redstone flights. With the decision to go forward with the Apollo Program, Launch Complexes 34 and 37 were constructed to test the Saturn I rockets.\nTwo key factors played a role in the creation of a separate launch facility for the crewed spaceflight program. One of these factors was a Department of Defense study in April, 1960, in which the Atlantic Missile Range was described as being nearly saturated with launch facilities. Additional facilities could not be built on site without the safety hazard of overflying other launch facilities. A second factor was the directive associated with the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, in which a separate civilian space organization, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), was created and dedicated to the peaceful exploration of space. While NASA continued to use Department of Defense facilities at Cape Canaveral for the Gemini missions and early Apollo tests using the Saturn I rocket, various government officials felt strongly that NASA should have its own launch facilities.\nIn selecting a launch site for the rockets used for the Apollo Program, NASA was faced with several considerations. The farther south the launch site was located, the easier it would be to launch a spacecraft into an equatorial orbit around Earth. Furthermore, a launch site from which spacecraft could be launched in an easterly direction would enable the rocket to use Earth’s eastward rotation to assist in achieving the necessary velocity for Earth orbit. Numerous sites were studied, including several Pacific islands as well as barrier islands off Georgia and Texas. Ultimately, the logistic capabilities, together with the need to use some of the tracking systems of the Atlantic Missile Range, led NASA to a site adjacent to the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS). Shortly after the selection of the Cape Canaveral site, NASA acquired over 111,000 acres on Merritt Island, just northwest of CCAFS. On March 7, 1962, NASA made the Launch Operations Center a separate NASA field center, and was made the controlling entity for the new Merritt Island Launch Area on January 17, 1963. The launch area was designated Launch Complex 39. On November 29, 1963, the Launch Operations Center was renamed the John F. Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in honor of the assassinated president a mere week after his death. Cape Canaveral was also renamed Cape Kennedy at this time, but in 1973 the state of Florida changed the name back to Cape Canaveral. KSC headquarters moved to Merritt Island on July 26, 1965, and KSC became a fully functioning space center.\nThough a separate facility, KSC continued use of launch complexes constructed at CCAFS for launches of uncrewed missions until 1990. During 1989 and 1990, control over uncrewed launches shifted from KSC to the Air Force and to rocket manufacturers. Most of the uncrewed NASA missions, however, are still launched from CCAFS, and payload processing often occurs at KSC, though the launch itself is no longer under KSC direct control.\nThe heart of KSC is Launch Complex 39, designed initially for the Saturn V rockets, but adapted for use with the space shuttle. Launch Complex 39 has two virtually identical launch pads, 39-A and 39-B. Earlier rockets were generally assembled at the launch pad, fueled, and then launched. Such an approach was fine for the smaller rockets. However, the time needed to assemble the massive rockets needed for lunar missions would require a launch pad to be tied up for many months. Additionally, the corrosive, salty ocean spray and the potential for tropical storms at Cape Canaveral made a spacecraft exposed on the launch pad susceptible to damage. Launch Complexes 34 and 37 at CCAFS had louvers on a mobile service structure to protect the spacecraft. The Moon rockets would be too large, however, for that approach to protecting them. Additionally, with pads tied up for months, it was projected that NASA would need up to several dozen launch pads. A better, less expensive approach was needed.\nThe solution was to build a Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) a safe distance from the launch pad. The rocket would be assembled in the VAB while sitting on a Mobile Launch Platform (MLP) which would then be transported to the launch pad when the craft was completed. Three MLPs were constructed. A Mobile Service Structure (MSS) was used with the Saturn V rockets to prepare them for launch. The MSS was removed prior to launch, and the gantry at launch was part of the MLP. The MLP system was redesigned for the space shuttle without the large gantry. A Fixed Service Structure (FSS) is now built at each launch pad, which contains orbiter crew access and umbilical arms for fueling the space shuttle. Attached to the FSS is a Rotating Service Structure (RSS) that swings into position to cover the orbiter while it is on the launch pad, permitting access and servicing of the payload bay. A system of flame deflectors and trenches channels rocket exhaust away from the rocket as it takes off.\nTo protect the Saturn V during assembly, and to promote a faster launch pad turn around, the Vehicle Assembly Building was constructed. The VAB, one of the largest buildings ever built, covers 8 acres of land, and measures 716 feet long, 518 feet wide, and 525 feet tall. It consists of four high bays and a low bay. The high bays were originally used to assemble the Saturn V. Two bays are now used to mate the space shuttle orbiter with the solid rockets and the external fuel tank. The other two bays are used for external tank checkout and storage, solid-rocket contingency handling, and orbiter contingency storage. The low bay is used for engine maintenance shops and as a storage area for certain solid-rocket aerodynamic parts.\nAdvances in electronics technology by the time of the Apollo Program meant that launch control no longer needed to be housed in a blockhouse adjacent to the launch pad. Thus, KSC’s launches are directed from the Launch Control Center (LCC) located over three miles away from the launch pads. The LCC is a multilevel building containing offices, computers, and data analysis equipment on the first three levels. Offices and conference rooms are on the fourth level. The third level contains the firing rooms, where launches are directed. Two firing rooms are fully operational and can be used to direct launches. The other two are used for software development and analysis and for data and engineering analysis. Controllers have a view of the launch pads from large windows at one end of the firing rooms. Large, heavy steel shutters are designed to close rapidly to protect the windows in the event of a catastrophic accident at the launch pad.\nThe Shuttle Landing Facility (SLF) is essentially an airportlike facility for the space shuttle. Its main feature is a 15,000-foot-long, 300-foot-wide runway on which the space shuttle can land upon returning from orbit. Adjacent to the runway is a Recovery Staging Area where a convoy of recovery vehicles can wait for the shuttle to land. These vehicles extract the poisonous fuels from the shuttle and make sure that there are no poisonous vapors in the area prior to crew egress. Also adjacent to the runway is the Orbiter Processing Facility (OPF), where the orbiter can be serviced. The OPF has facilities to mate or remove the orbiter from the back of a modified Boeing 747 used as a transport between NASA facilities.\nTo carry various components and equipment from place to place within the facility, KSC has a variety of transporters. Most have special functions, such a solid-rocket transporter, an orbiter transporter, or a payload-canister transporter. The most impressive, however, are the two oldest transporters used, the crawler transporters (CTs). The CTs, originally designed to carry the MLP from the VAB to the launch pads carrying the Saturn V, now carry the MLP with a space shuttle on board to the launch pad. Moving at about one mile per hour, the CT is 131 feet long and 113 feet wide, and carries loads as heavy as 12 million pounds. The crawler is able to deliver the MLP to its proper position to within 2 inches precision. Each crawler is able to travel about 35 feet per gallon of diesel fuel.\nAs the United States’ spaceport, KSC is looking ahead to the next-generation launch vehicle that will replace the space shuttle. The modular design of Launch Complex 39 permits great flexibility in adapting to new launch vehicles. Unlike previous launch complexes that generally became obsolete along with the rocket that they were originally designed for, Launch Complex 39 was readily adapted from Saturn V operations to space shuttle operations. Thus, it is expected that similar adaptations would be possible for most of the foreseeable designs of launch vehicles in the coming decades.\nBenson, Charles D., and William Barnaby Faherty.

The ACES was not designed to perform EVAs.The Russian Orlan and Sokol, while slightly varied in design, have many of the same limitations.To support the Vision for Space Exploration (VSE) and Constellation objectives, it is necessary to develop a new pressurized suit system. One that is smart and evolvable.\n11 Design Challenges (1 vs 2 vs 3 suits…) The broad range of operational environments that this new suit system will be required to support poses some new challenges in selecting and designing the appropriate suit architecture.However, the potential programmatic benefits of developing, operating and sustaining a common/evolvable single suit system architecture warrant a more thorough examination.Development of a single integrated IVA/EVA suit system that satisfies all of the Constellation capability requirements versus a multiple suit approach is a programmatic decision that is at the forefront of the Exploration pressure suit development activity.\n12 Design Challenges (1 vs 2 vs 3 suits…) Some basic design challenges that need to be examined includeFor IVA un-pressurized periods, the suit needs to support the crew for long periods of time (i.e. launch/entry/abort and in-flight powered phases). These phases alone would lean towards a lightweight, low-bulk, all fabric-based garment structure, minimizing hard-contact points.For EVA, more gross mobility is necessary to support planetary exploration. For surface EVA alone, this would lean towards a more rigid, high bulk suit for operating in an upright position but could be uncomfortable to wear in a recumbent position as necessary for IVA phases.\n13 The overall NASA goal is to get to Mars by using LEO and Lunar missions as stepping stones Initial Prove-OutSystem VerificationImprove DesignEtc.Long Term TestingPlanetary EVAHabitatEtc.Final GoalLong Term UseReliabilityMaintainability\n14 Maintenance Goal = 4% of EVA Time Repair Goal = 1% of EVA Time The number of EVA’s between overhauls will need to significantly increase in order to support future missionsShuttleISSLunar/Mars(1)Recertification5XRedesign20X5 EVA25 EVA300 – 500 EVAMaintenance Goal = 4% of EVA TimeRepair Goal = 1% of EVA TimeNotes: (1) Assumes 2 year mission, EVA every other day\n15 Schematic Need Statement EVA ChallengesSchematic Need StatementPLSS Packaging DriverThere are many technology components and system options already in development that may support VSE EVA requirementsShuttle/ISS EMUComponent Weight: 73 lbsPackaging Weight: 79 lbsTotal: 152 lbsMars: lbsPLSS design objectivesFlexible (upgradeable & evolvable)Mission maintainableSmallReliableLightweightRobustNASA must determine the optimum combination of these life support technologies (i.e., a functional support schematic) that meets the mission requirements\n16 Technology Options to Consider CO2/Humidity ControlVent Flow and Pressure ControlThermal ControlOxygenPowerElectronicsPackaging Concepts\n17 Shuttle Extravehicular ChallengesSSA129 lbs.PLSS200 lbs.Total329 lbs.PF: 2.20SSAxxx lbs.PLSS145 lbs.TotalPF: 1.59SSA35 lbs.PLSS65 lbs.Total100 lbs.PF: 1.24Shuttle ExtravehicularMobility UnitMk.

The more detailed the concept or design gets before it is found to be unacceptable, the more costly will be the recovery effort.Prove out a new idea/concept with first cut analysis unless,The basic concept depends on a unique idea – then a test must be run before concept approval.In the conception phase the program needs experienced, inventive, engineers that won’t get bogged down in detail that is not needed until later in the process.\n45 Lessons Learned The weight target is very difficult to meet. Develop a weight control plan early with estimated or calculated weights so that corrective actions can be taken as soon as possible.The concepts generated resulted in unacceptably high component operating temperatures.Thermal analysis personnel available early in the concept phase.Complexity of the heat transfer within PLSS prevents designer from doing own analysis.Document the importance of the key requirements and re-evaluate periodically.We lost sight of the weight goal even though that was the primary reason for the entire effort.\n46 PLSS Development Conclusions & Products Removing 2/3 of the PLSS mass is as hard as we expected.Creativity is still needed.Requirements conflict strongly in the problem.Significant progress has been made - but, the concept requires further development.ProductsDesign guideline document created in Task Two.Extensive documentation of effort; contains proven procedures and design and analysis tools.Concept Mockup\n47 EVA Engineering Conclusion The space suits and EVA systems needed to meet the requirements for sustainable and extended Lunar exploration present new challenges to NASA, other government agencies, academia, and industry. Innovative technologies and cooperation among the many involved organizations to address these challenges will be one of the keys to success for future space exploration."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:dbfb9fc1-2cab-4504-bc99-952f7960f43b>","<urn:uuid:da03037e-b9d9-42bc-917d-15b1478baa24>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Which battle had more casualties: Cissa in 218 BC or Waterloo in 1815?","answer":"The Battle of Waterloo in 1815 had significantly more casualties than the Battle of Cissa. At Cissa, the Carthaginians lost 6,000 soldiers in battle and 2,000 were captured. At Waterloo, Napoleon alone lost about 25,000 soldiers and had another 8,000 captured, making it a much bloodier engagement.","context":["Battle of Cissa\n|Battle of Cissa|\n|Part of the Second Punic War|\n|Commanders and leaders|\n|Hanno||Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Calvus|\n|Casualties and losses|\nThe Battle of Cissa was part of the Second Punic War. It was fought in the fall of 218 BC, south of the Greek town of Tarraco in north-eastern Iberia. A Roman army under Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Calvus defeated an outnumbered Carthaginian army under Hanno, thus gaining control of the territory north of the Ebro River that Hannibal had just subdued a few months prior in the summer of 218 BC. This was the first battle that the Romans had ever fought in Iberia.\nAfter the successful conclusion of the Siege of Saguntum, Hannibal Barca had rested his army. Then, in the summer of 218 BC, he had started out for Italy with either 90,000 foot and 12,000 cavalry (according to Polybius), or with 46,000 foot and 10,000 horse. He had spent the summer conquering the area north of the Ebro River. After subduing the Iberian tribes, but leaving the Greek cities unmolested, Hannibal crossed over into Gaul to continue his march to Italy, leaving a contingent to guard the newly conquered territories and sending 10,000 less reliable troops home.\nThe Roman navy had been mobilized in 219 BC, fielding 220 quinqueremes for the Second Illyrian War. Consul Tiberius Sempronius Longus received 4 legions (2 Romans and 2 allied, 8,000 Roman and 16,000 allied infantry and 600 Roman and 1,800 allied horse) and instructions to sail for Africa with 160 quinqueremes. Publius Cornelius Scipio received 4 legions (8,000 Roman and 14,000 allied infantry and 600 Roman and 1,600 allied horse) and was to sail for Iberia escorted by 60 ships. However, the gallic Boii and Insubre tribes in northern Italy had attacked Roman colonies, causing part of Scipio’s force to deploy there and fresh legions were raised to replace them, delaying his departure.\nWhile Hannibal was marching through Gaul, Scipio had landed with his army at the allied Greek city of Massilia. He then sent a cavalry patrol north, up the eastern bank of the Rhone River, which clashed with a similar force of Numidian light cavalry and, after a hard fought skirmish, drove off the Carthaginians. Scipio marched north from his base, while Hannibal marched east towards the Alps. Arriving at the deserted Carthaginian camp, Scipio learned that Hannibal was three day's march away and decided to send his forces to Iberia under the command of his elder brother Gnaeus, who had been consul in 221 BC, while he himself returned to Northern Italy to organize the defences against Hannibal.\nHasdrubal Barca, the younger brother of Hannibal, had 12,650 infantry, 2,550 cavalry and 21 elephants to guard the Carthaginian possessions south of the Ebro. Hannibal had left a certain Hanno with 10,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalry to garrison the newly conquered territory north of the Ebro. This Hanno has been identified by various authors as Hannibal’s nephew (son of Hasdrubal the Fair), a brother or no Barcid relation.\nGnaeus Cornelius Scipio Calvus, with 20,000 infantry (2 Roman and 2 allied legions) 2,200 cavalry and 60 quinqueremes, sailed from Massilia and landed at Emporiae in Iberia. The Greek cities of Emporiae and Tarraco welcomed the Romans, and Gnaeus began to win over the Iberian tribes north of the Ebro. Hasdrubal Barca, after being warned of the Roman expedition, marched north with an army of 8,000 foot soldiers and 1,000 cavalry to join Hanno.\nHanno had been completely surprised by the Roman arrival in Iberia. Seeing the grip of the Carthaginians on the newly conquered Iberian tribes loosening because of the activities of Scipio, he decided to offer battle. Hanno marched and attacked the Romans just north of Tarraco, near a place called Cissa or Kissa. There were no brilliant manoeuvres or ambushes, the armies formed up and faced off. Being outnumbered two to one, Hanno was defeated relatively easily, losing 6,000 soldiers in battle. Furthermore, the Romans managed to capture the Carthaginian camp, along with 2,000 more soldiers and Hanno himself. The camp contained all the baggage left by Hannibal. The prisoners also included Indibilis, an influential Iberian chieftain who would cause severe trouble for the Romans later. The Romans also stormed the town of Cissa, though to the frustration of the Romans it did not contain any valuable booty.\nGnaeus became master of Iberia north of the Ebro. Hasdrubal, arriving too late to aid Hanno and not being strong enough to attack the Romans, still crossed the river and sent a flying column of light cavalry and infantry on a raid. This force caught some Roman sailors foraging and inflicted such casualties that the effectiveness of the Roman fleet in Iberia was reduced from 60 to 35 ships. The Roman fleet, however, raided the Carthaginian possessions in Iberia. Roman prestige was established in Iberia, while the Carthaginians had suffered a significant blow. After punishing the officers in charge of the naval contingent for their lax discipline, Scipio and the Roman army wintered at Tarraco. Hasdrubal retired to Cartagena after garrisoning allied towns south of the Ebro.\nIf Hanno somehow had won the battle, it might have been possible for Hannibal to get reinforcements from Barcid Iberia as early as 217 BC. This battle brought the same results for Scipio in Iberia as the Battle of Trebia would bring for Hannibal in Italy: securing a base of operation, and winning over some of the native tribes as a source of provisions and recruits, also cutting off the overland communication of Hannibal from his base in Iberia. Unlike Hannibal, Scipio did not immediately launch a major campaign on enemy territory south of the river. Nor would he cut loose from his base like Hannibal did in the near future. Scipio took time to consolidate his holdings, subjugate or befriend Iberian tribes and raid Carthaginian territory. These activities laid the foundation for the future Roman operations in Iberia.\n- Delbruck, Hans, Warfare in Antiquity, Volume 1, p 362 id = ISBN 0-8032-9199-X\n- Peddie, John, Hannibal's War, p 19 id = ISBN 0-7509-3797-1\n- Lazenby, J.F., Hannibal’s War, p 71 id = ISBN 0-8061-3004-0\n- Lazenby, John Francis, Hannibal's War, p 37, id = ISBN 0-8061-3004-0\n- Lazanby, John Francis, Hannibal's War, p32, id = ISBN 0-8061-3004-0\n- Bagnall, Nigel, The Punic Wars, p157, id = ISBN 0-312-34214-4\n- Cottrell, Leonard, Hannibal: Enemy of Rome, p24, id = ISBN 0-306-80498-0\n- (Livy xxi, p23, 60)\n- Polybius 3.76 p7\n- Lazanby, John Francis, Hannibal's War, p126\n- (Livy xxi p60)\n- Livy, 22.20.4-10\nSources & References\n- Bagnall, Nigel (1990).

From former opponents Frankrich he forced ally, so with Russia after the Peace of Tilsit in July 1807. But Tsar Alexander I considered it a shame to be only a secondary ally of Napoleon, also set his country imposed by France continental block to import British goods to the mainland economically. Politically, Russia also had to contend with the Duchy of Warsaw created by Napoleon in 1807, which threatened Russian interests in Poland.\nIn 1811, Alexander decided to withdraw from the agreements with France, Napoleon was now determined to declare war on Russia once again and forcefully subjugate the country this time.\nPreparations for war:\nAfter the termination of Russian agreements with France, Napoleon began to build his army for his campaign. In the summer of 1812, he maintained, for the then conditions unique, about 600,000 soldiers. This army was made up of Frenchmen and soldiers of the recently annexed territories as well as soldiers of satellite states such as the German Confederation of the Rhine, Italy and Warsaw. Even the Austrians and Prussians used as compulsory allies had to confront soldiers against their former ally Russia. Next came about 200,000 horses added to the soldiers.\nNapoleon's military tactics, designed to supply his army through the occupied territories with such a mass of soldiers only for a short time, so he bet on a fast and aggressive campaign against Russia in order not to get into supply difficulties.\nThe beginning of the campaign:\nIn June 1812, the Russian campaign began by Napoleon. But Napoleon's concept of a brief but devastating campaign did not work out. The Russian army leadership continued to drop its troops and avoided the direct confrontation with the French. These were now forced to march after the Russian troops in the vastness of the Russian area. When the first real battle took place in Smolensk in August, the concept of orderly Russian withdrawal was already noticeable. The French supply lines were too long and the supply of the troops collapsed. Many thousands of soldiers died from starvation, exhaustion or disease. The battle did not bring Napoleon the hoped for breakthrough but ended in a draw and the Russian troops began to withdraw again in an orderly manner.\nThe attack on Moscow:\nAfter the Battle of Smolensk Napoleon left despite his supply difficulties, his troops continue east to march Moscow. He was under the assumption that the Russians would defend their capital to the last man and finally agree to a peace after a defeat.\nBut even before Moscow, the Russian troops put Napoleon in the way. Under the leadership of General Kutuzov, his troops built strong fortifications in the village of Borodino. On September 7, 1812 Napoleon let his troops perform a charge on the defensive positions. With high losses, about 70,000 men fell on both sides that day, the French were able to take the positions. But General Kutuzov quickly rebuilt his army, but the decision had still not been made for Napoleon.\nEven after the invasion of Moscow, Napoleon was unable to persuade Tsar Alexander I to capitulate. He was forced to withdraw from Russia in order not to completely lose his army, which was already decimated by the poor supply.\nThe retreat from Russia:\nIn mid-October 1812, the French withdrawal from Russia began, which was to inflict greater suffering on the soldiers than the battles themselves.\nAlready marked by hunger, exhaustion and disease, the soldiers on the way back from the Russian winters were hard hit. The soldiers collapsed by the thousands on the way, remained lying and died. In addition, the constant skirmishes with the Cossacks, who carried out rapid surprise attacks with their horses, brought further losses to the French soldiers. Injured and wounded were left behind in the villages and towns and were often killed, abused or abducted when the civilian army withdrew.\nThe last victory on Russian soil was recorded by the French at the Battle of Beresina from 26 to 28 November 1812. The Russian troops tried to encircle the French troops crossing the Beresina and destroy them, in a final battle, the French managed to break out of the cauldron and continue to march west.\nOn December 8, 1812, Napoleon decided in Smorgon to rush ahead of his troops and build a new army in France and unite them with its current one in Central Europe.\nNapoleon's attempt to turn the war:\nOnce back in France, Napoleon and French conscripts, Poles and Germans built a new army to fight against Russia and its allies Prussia, Austrians and Swedes. The beginning of the new campaign gave rise to new hope in Napoleon to be able to decide the war still in his favor. But at the Battle of Leipzig in October 1813, where his army was defeated 2 to 1 of the coalition, he had to retreat under heavy losses again and then could no longer go on the offensive.\nThe occupation of France:\nIn December 1813, the rulers of Prussia, Austria and Russia agreed on the occupation of France and the complete overthrow of Napoleon. The British contributed their share through the victories in Spain and the advance to southern France.\nIn the meantime, Napoleon succeeded in rebuilding a new army. But due to the now widespread doubts of the population in the war, only about 100,000 conscripts came together.\nNapoleon was still able to win one or the other victory, but against the now invading army of the coalition, he had nothing to oppose. In March 1814 Paris was occupied and Napoleon was forced to abdicate.\nNapoleon's exile and short return:\nAfter the occupation of Paris, Napoleon had become aware that he was no longer up to the coalition military. These in turn granted him a dignified departure as emperor of the Mediterranean island of Elba, where he should stay until his death.\nHowever, since Napoleon's abdication failed to bring about the desired reintroduction of the monarchy, Napoleon was confirmed in his belief that only he could lead the country and prepared his return. Euphorically celebrated by the soldiers, he arrived in Paris in March 1815 and restored his political status prior to his abdication. Immediately, he also began with the formation of a new army to again against the coalition to go to war.\nAlready in June 1815, the campaign took place in Belgium where he encountered the British-Dutch army of Wellington and a Prussian army under General Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher. In the battles of June 16 at Quatre-Bras and Ligny, he was able to fight back his old tactics faithfully both armies separately. But in the Battle of Waterloo, the armies could unite and exist together against Napoleon.\nThe Battle of Waterloo:\nOn June 16, 1815, the British-Dutch army under the leadership of Herog von Wellington, after a clash with the French troops at Quatre-Bras, had to retreat to a ridge near Mont St. Jean, south of Waterloo. His army consisted of about 68,000 soldiers, the French, although only slightly stronger with 72,000 soldiers, but the French were far more battle-tested and equipped with significantly more cannons.\nWellington left most of his army behind the hill to protect them from the French cannons. After the artillery fire Napoleon let his infantry march in a broad line on the opponents. The musket fire and the cannons of Wellington's soldiers, meanwhile, caused a veritable bloodbath among the French, who continued to march on. Only when Wellington let his heavy cavalry charge the French did they retreat. Unfortunately, the British cavalry hurried after the retreating French soldiers and themselves fell into the fire of the counter-artillery. Then, when the French cavalry came out to counterattack, the British suffered heavy casualties.\nAssuming that the loss would bring the British to collapse, the French Marshall Ney ordered his riders to make a direct attack. However, this could not break the defensive tactics of the British with their bayonet reinforced squares and had to be stopped after the bombardment by the muskets with heavy losses.\nIn the course of the fighting, the French succeeded in conquering the farms below the hill, but support for Wellington in the form of the approximately 50,000 -strong Prussian army came closer and closer. An unification would have meant defeat for Napoleon, so he tried to keep the Prussians separate from the British and launched a direct attack on the British with his imperial guard. The attack fell victim to the shelling of the British muskets and so broke even the guard during the fighting on.\nThe French had to retreat and were pursued by the Prussian cavalry, which also led to heavy losses. Overall, Napoleon lost in this battle about 25,000 soldiers, another 8,000 were captured. With that, the French military was finally defeated.\nAfter the victory at Waterloo and the subsequent Congress of Vienna, the old monarchist conditions were restored in France and Napoleon, who capitulated in July 1815 aboard the English ship HMS Bellerophon, was exiled to St. Helena. There he wrote his memoirs and died in 1821.\nYou can find the right literature here:\nMany books have been written about Napoleon and his campaigns, but very little about the soldiers of his armies and of the organization and conditions under which they lived and served.\nIn this classic study, now reissued in paperback, H.C.B. Rogers examines Napoleon's army in terms of its staff systems, its arms and its supporting services as it existed and changed during the long period that separated the battles of Valmy and Waterloo.\nThis is not another history of Napoleon's campaigns. Apart from the brief narrative of the opening chapter designed to serve as an aide-memoire, military operations are only cited to illustrate organization, tactics, equipment and administration.\nThe author seeks to show how, as Lord Wavell put it, Napoleon inspired 'a ragged, mutinous, half-starved army and made it fight as it did'.\nForging Napoleon's Grande Armée: Motivation, Military Culture, and Masculinity in the French Army, 1800-1808\nThe men who fought in Napoleon’s Grande Armée built a new empire that changed the world. Remarkably, the same men raised arms during the French Revolution for liberté, égalité, and fraternité. In just over a decade, these freedom fighters, who had once struggled to overthrow tyrants, rallied to the side of a man who wanted to dominate Europe. What was behind this drastic change of heart?\nIn this ground-breaking study, Michael J. Hughes shows how Napoleonic military culture shaped the motivation of Napoleon’s soldiers. Relying on extensive archival research and blending cultural and military history, Hughes demonstrates that the Napoleonic regime incorporated elements from both the Old Regime and French Revolutionary military culture to craft a new military culture, characterized by loyalty to both Napoleon and the preservation of French hegemony in Europe. Underscoring this new, hybrid military culture were five sources of motivation: honor, patriotism, a martial and virile masculinity, devotion to Napoleon, and coercion. Forging Napoleon's Grande Armée vividly illustrates how this many-pronged culture gave Napoleon’s soldiers reasons to fight.\nThe Sunday Times bestselling account of Napoleon's invasion of Russia and eventual retreat from Moscow, events that had a profound effect on the subsequent course of Russian and European history. Moscow has both fascinated military historians and captured the imagination of millions on an emotional and human level. 1812 tells the story of how the most powerful man on earth met his doom, and how the greatest fighting force ever assembled was wiped out. Over 400,000 French and Allied troops died on the disastrous Russian campaign, with the vast majority of the casualties occuring during the frigid winter retreat. Adam Zamoyski tells their story with incredible detail and sympathy, drawing on a wealth of first-hand accounts of the tragedy to create a vivid portrait of an unimaginable catastrophe. power. His intention was to destroy Britain through a total blockade, the Continental System. But Tsar Alexander of Russia refused to apply the blockade, and Napoleon decided to bring him to heel. ramifications on Russian, French, German and, indeed, European history and culture cannot be understated. Adam Zamoyski's epic, enthralling narrative is the definitive account of the events of that dramatic year.\nWaterloo: The History of Four Days, Three Armies, and Three Battles\nFrom the New York Times bestselling author and master of martial fiction comes the definitive, illustrated history of one of the greatest battles ever fought—a riveting nonfiction chronicle published to commemorate the 200th anniversary of Napoleon’s last stand.\nOn June 18, 1815 the armies of France, Britain and Prussia descended upon a quiet valley south of Brussels. In the previous three days, the French army had beaten the Prussians at Ligny and fought the British to a standstill at Quatre-Bras. The Allies were in retreat. The little village north of where they turned to fight the French army was called Waterloo. The blood-soaked battle to which it gave its name would become a landmark in European history.\nIn his first work of nonfiction, Bernard Cornwell combines his storytelling skills with a meticulously researched history to give a riveting chronicle of every dramatic moment, from Napoleon’s daring escape from Elba to the smoke and gore of the three battlefields and their aftermath. Through quotes from the letters and diaries of Emperor Napoleon, the Duke of Wellington, and the ordinary officers and soldiers, he brings to life how it actually felt to fight those famous battles—as well as the moments of amazing bravery on both sides that left the actual outcome hanging in the balance until the bitter end.\nPublished to coincide with the battle’s bicentennial in 2015, Waterloo is a tense and gripping story of heroism and tragedy—and of the final battle that determined the fate of nineteenth-century Europe."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:6692c93a-1932-4266-910d-9721b434135e>","<urn:uuid:2667af51-3eb6-4bfd-9a60-3fddcc8fde5c>"],"error":null}

RCM operates two minting facilities which produce everything from Canada’s circulation coins to bullion coins, medals, and circulation coins on behalf of other nations.\nIt was founded in 1908, and operates as a Crown Corporation of Canada. These organizations are state owned but “generally enjoy greater freedom from direct political control than government departments.\" Canada’s mint is somewhat unusual because it is expected to turn a profit even though it is not privately owned.\nThe profit motive at least partially explains why the Mint has been so willing to innovate and launch a wider variety of superb quality coins and bars. Here’s a glimpse into the RCM’s history and achievements over the years.\nRoyal Canadian Mint Silver Products:\nRoyal Canadian Mint History\nCanada relied upon Britain’s Royal Mint to produce circulation coins for more than 50 years after the nation was founded. The nation’s quickly growing population put Canada in dire need of more coin production. However, the process of authorizing and building an independent national mint with the needed capacity would take decades.\nThe first step was an 1890 proposal for building a branch operation of Britain’s Royal Mint located in Canada. The proposal languished for 11 years, before authorization was finally granted in 1901 to build a facility in Ottawa. Seven years of delays, planning and construction followed. The Mint finally began production of Canada’s circulation coins in 1908. Lord Earl Grey himself activated the presses.\nThe Royal Mint in Ottawa operated for more than 20 years before gaining independence from Britain. It was renamed the Royal Canadian Mint in 1931 and began operations under the control of Canada’s Department of Finance.\nWhere are the mints in Canada?\nLate in 1960, the master of the mint of the Ottawa facility proposed the construction of a second facility. The Mint was operating at maximum capacity, and unable to keep up with demand. A large portion of circulation coins had to be made with the help of the Philadelphia branch of the US Mint.\nPoliticians wrestled over whether a second location was truly needed and where it should be built for 11 years. They eventually agreed to construct a new mint facility in Winnipeg. Land was purchased in 1972, and construction began. It was completed in 1976.\nDuring the 11-year debate over building a second location, the Royal Canadian mint was reorganized as a Crown corporation. The expectation was for it to operate more like a private corporation and turn a profit.\nThe original Ottawa facility was declared a National Historic Site of Canada in 1979.\nToday the Winnipeg facility produces circulation coins for Canada as well as for other nations such as Cuba, Norway, Colombia and Iceland. The Ottawa Mint is responsible for striking collectible coins and bullion coins.\nThe year 2007 saw another interesting milestone for the Royal Canadian Mint. To mark the launch of one-ounce Gold Maple Leaf bullion coins made from “five nines” (99.999%) pure gold, the Mint produced a handful of massive 100 kilogram gold Maple Leaf coins. The face value of each coin is $1 million CAN. Guinness World Records certified them as the world’s largest gold coins.\nThe record lasted until 2011 when Australia’s Perth Mint struck its 2,231-pound coin of 99.99% pure gold.\nRoyal Canadian Mint coins have been racking up awards over the past 30 years. The Mint has claimed prizes for artistry, innovation and “Coin of the Year” on multiple occasions. It’s 2012 Coin of the Year commemorated the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee. 1,500 coins were struck in 99.999 pure gold with a genuine Canadian diamond inset, viewable from both sides.\nPalladium Bullion Pioneers\nPalladium bullion has been growing in popularity in recent years. The Royal Canadian Mint was the first to strike a production coin using the platinum group metal in 2005. The decision to issue a palladium version of its iconic Maple Leaf was an attempt to meet the rising demand.\nTo date only two sovereign mints have produced these coins in quantity, with the other being the US Mint which began issuance in 2017.\nRCM produced the Palladium Maple Leaf, which had a fineness rating of .9995, between 2005 and 2007, and again in 2009. Production then went on hiatus until 2015 when it was resumed and continues to this day.\nCanadian Gold Maple Leaf\nThe Maple Leaf, Canada’s popular gold coins were first struck in 1979 and initially carried a fineness rating of .999. The purity was upgraded to “four nines” (.9999) in late 1982.\nThe Royal Canadian Mint became the world’s first to produce 99.999% pure gold coins in 2005 and it remains the only sovereign mint to do so. These higher purity coins have generally been part of a special series, with limited mintages. The total supply of 99.999% Gold Maple Leaf coins is tiny relative to those with 99.99% purity.\nThe 1911 Canadian Silver Dollar is only found in three examples. Interestingly, only two were made from actual silver, the other was struck in lead. One of the silver coins is on display in a museum in Ottawa while the other silver coin was sold at auction in 2003. Its price? Around 1 million dollars. These are the rarest and most valuable Canadian coins.\nThere were fewer than 30 coins struck in the “Dot Cent” group of pennies struck in 1936. Today only three of these coins have been identified in mint condition. During the most recent auction for one, the penny fetched $253,000 – more than 25 million times its face value.\nThe 1921 Canadian 50-cent piece is also sought after by collectors. Nearly 30,000 of these coins were struck and released, but only around 100 of them are believed to still exist. The vast majority have been melted, significantly increasing the value of those that remain.\nThe Royal Canadian Mint has a rich history.

{"question":"How do contemporary African American art institutions preserve cultural heritage while advancing modern artistic expression?","answer":"Contemporary African American art institutions work to both preserve heritage and advance modern expression. MoCADA's mission focuses on rediscovering African cultural traditions lost through colonization while fostering dynamic spaces for cultural evolution through exhibitions, education programs, and community initiatives. Similarly, AFRICOBRA's artistic movement demonstrated this dual focus by creating a distinctive visual voice that mobilized elements of their everyday visual environment while advancing contemporary Black aesthetics, ultimately influencing global audiences through their sophisticated approach to communicating deep meaning through multiple layers.","context":["Mocada Museum - A Renaissance Of Foreign African Artists\nIn a world where being normal is encouraged, we come across phenomenal places like the Mocada Museum. A true source of inspiration to transcend normalcy and a place that will live on in the hearts of Africans for years to come. MoCADA’s mission is to rediscover valuable African cultural traditions that were lost through colonization and the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade and to foster a dynamic space for the creation of the continuous evolution of culture.\nSince the days of the Harlem Renaissance, many movements have sought to preserve and celebrate African culture and MoCADA is one of the few that have been able to achieve this in a modern and socially relevant way. The Harlem Renaissance was the most influential movement in African American literary history. Harlem, New York City attracted a remarkable concentration of intellect and talent and served as the symbolic capital of a cultural awakening. Harlem embraced the literary, musical, theatrical and visual arts. This was displayed in unrivaled plays such as the musical play Shuffle Along which opened at the 63rd Street Musical Hall in New York. The play ran 474 performances on Broadway and spawned three touring companies.\nMoCADA was established to revive this black artistic talent and cause African American intellectuals to look on their African heritage with new eyes and in many cases with a desire to reconnect with a heritage long despised or misunderstood by both whites and blacks.\nThe MoCADA museum is the Museum of Contemporary African Diasporan Arts (MoCADA). It was founded in 1999 by Laurie Angela Cumbo in a brownstone townhouse owned by the Bridge Street AWME Church in the Bedford-Stuyvesant community of Brooklyn, New York. It is the first museum of its kind to be opened in New York.\nLaurie developed the concept of the museum from her graduate thesis at New York University, which focused on the feasibility of an African diaspora museum contributing to the revitalization of central Brooklyn, economically, socially and aesthetically.\nThe museum began with socially and politically charged exhibitions and public programs focused on contemporary issues impacting people of the African diaspora. Seventeen years later, The MoCADA Museum has grown to serve both adults and youth throughout the diaspora, with an emphasis on underserved communities of color, through a diverse range of exhibitions, education and community programs. This is achieved through on-site as well as out-of-doors programming. Seventeen years later, MoCADA has grown to serve both adults and youth throughout the diaspora, with an emphasis on underserved communities of color, through a diverse range of exhibitions, education and community programs.\nIn 2006, The MoCADA Museum moved to its current home, an expanded space at 80 Hanson Place, at South Portland Avenue, in Fort Greene, a historically black middle-class neighborhood in Brooklyn which is home to the Brooklyn Academy of Music (BAM) arts district. The MoCADA Museum has grown to accommodate many exhibitions throughout the year that highlight various identities of the African Diaspora. The central location of Fort Greene allows for a cross-section of the Brooklyn community to gather at MoCADA and partake in the many events produced for each exhibition. MoCADA's large bookstore has ample space to host events such as book readings, student tours, and musical events.\nThese events include the Exhibition and Curatorial Program, The Curatorial Fellowship and Internship Program, the Educational Artist-In-Schools and Guided Tours Program, the KIDflix Film Fest of Bed-Stuy, MoCADA Television, and the Soul of Brooklyn Tourism Initiative. MoCADA is currently working with Rodney Leon Architects PLLC to design the future home of MoCADA.\nThe MoCADA Museum believes that the concept of the museum exists within its people and it is the museum’s goal to serve as a conduit for African Diaspora forms of expression ranging from the visual and performing arts to film and television with the goal of repositioning the continent of Africa and its people in both a foundational and central role in world development.\nThe MoCADA Museum continues to use the visual arts as a point of departure for exploring new artistic production across a variety of disciplines. Through exhibitions and programming, MoCADA incites dialogue on pressing social and political issues facing the African Diaspora and fosters a dynamic space for the creation and continuous evolution of culture.\nMajor Exhibitions and Featured Artists\nIn Dew Time: Artists in School Program Exhibition\nIn Dew Time featured the interdisciplinary work of students from MoCADA’s 2017 Artists in Schools program. These artists conceptualized what it means to create art around the theme of S.T.E.A.M. (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, Math) while developing a better understanding of the African Diaspora. Teaching Artists Austin Greene, Alexis Mena, Sawdayah Brownlee, M. Scott Johnson and Zaria Poem guided their students through the multi-layers of their own conflicts, solutions, desires and defense mechanisms through sculpture, painting, drawing, animation and sound design.\nDiagram of The Heart by Glenda Gordon\nIntending to document the relationship between the ‘books of love’ and the daily lives of the Northern Nigerian women who wrote them, Glenna Gordon was made privy to the myriad of possibilities that exist for women as they navigate domestic interiors, wedding ceremonies, and public space. While the resulting images were intentionally ambiguous in judgment, the women were revealed within sites of conflict and vitality.\nGordon maintained a healthy skepticism of documentary photography and its use as an agent for social change and awareness. However, she was certain of the effect of images on perception and subsequent behaviors. Taking her own understanding of Nigeria to task, Diagram of the Heart affirmed the ability of the medium to unsettle the predominant narrative of a place toward one that is in conversation and evolving.\nTea Time by Theresa Chromati\nTea Time, by Theresa Chromati, references commonplace traditions as the passive residue of colonization. Yet, as the tea is taken “black,” this specific practice is recontextualized to offer a space of affirmation, solidarity, protection, and endearment. The multicolored domestic space is pungently rendered, suggesting it as a robust site of reflection on identity and social relationships. Masked black figures dressed in teacups and teapots are either seen in defense, collectively lifting a carton of milk out of their private interior, or in repose indulging in one another’s nourishment.\nTea embraces a double-meaning, referencing the hot drink and its healing abilities, as well as the informal use that indicates possession of a highly coveted piece of information. The five-panel work is further extended through accompanying audio by Pangelica, with Chromati lending a bold, self-assured voice to proclaim, “I got more than enough,” against sounds of crying lambs, gas escaping bubbles, and an ambient tropical storm.\nLe Projet Nouveau\nThe MoCADA Museum presented Le Projet Nouveau, a multi-media platform that reflects the voices of many artists who propose ecological, cosmological, architectural and sociological methods to be used in Haiti's reconstruction. Coinciding with the 1st anniversary of the devastating earthquake that ravaged the country, this project serves to facilitate the production of ideas and actions in modern day Haiti. Le Projet Nouveau brings together 18 artists whose work presents ideas about the reconstruction of Haiti.\nThe exhibiting artists draw upon political, cultural, architectural and socio-economic themes to propose what can be offered towards the re-shaping of the first black republic. The exhibition highlights the aesthetic response of artists to the turbulence that has plagued the nation since it gained independence from France in 1804.\nThe artists in the exhibition used their practices to visualize Haiti's future by re-imagining the country through its people, its culture, the African Diaspora, and its artistic legacy. The artists featured in this exhibit are as follows: Trevor Brown, Nelson Caban, Rebekah A. Frimpong, Edouard Steinhauer, Michele Stephenson, Wahala Temi, Adrienne E. Wheeler, Nathan Williams and Tracee Worley.\nOther exhibitions include Pixelating: Black in New Dimensions, Feed Your Head: The African Origin of the Scientific Aesthetic, Gentrification of Brooklyn, Black Madonna, Ain’t I A Woman, The French Evolution: Race, Politics and the 2005 Riots, Standing with Papa Legba: Vodou at the Crossroads, Re-imagining Haiti and Saying No: Reconciling Spirituality and Resistance in Indigenous Australian Art.\nIn 2012, the museum landed a $100,000 grant from the Rockefeller Foundation to pay for a two-year program that brought monthly concerts to public spaces in Houses like Walt Whitman, Ingersoll, and Farragut in Fort Greene, Brooklyn. The concert series, titled \"Public Exchange,\" attracted talented musicians and drew crowds up to 500 or 600. It brought together groundbreaking programming to traditionally underrepresented areas of Public Housing in Brooklyn.\nThe following year in 2013, The MoCADA Museum launched another art performance series, Soul of Brooklyn, which is \"a series of block-party style arts events meant to bring the community together and promote local businesses”. As the current executive director stated: “Soul of Brooklyn Block Parties are meant to concentrate Brooklyn’s artistic energy in a single place at a single time, to bring people together and foster interactions between artists and the whole community. What better way to increase vibrancy in our community than to showcase this renaissance in the streets and the businesses that people visit every day? Rather than expecting people to adapt their lives to the arts, we bring the arts right to the people”.\nOther community development programs include the KID flix Fest of Bed-Stuy which is a free annual film festival for kids and their families. Laurie Cumbo, the founder of the MoCADA Museum also continues to personally contribute to her community.\nThe MoCADA Museum and the Harlem Renaissance have brought dignity to the African American. They have renewed the faith of black people in their heritage and whites are beginning to take notice. The acknowledgment of black culture is progressively growing and this has been made evident by the numerous examples of statues of old white supremacist icons being removed and which are still being removed in formerly Confederate states. This shows that there is a new shift in consciousness that acknowledges the struggles and history of different ethnicities. A new day has come and the legends of the Harlem Renaissance would be proud of how far African Americans have come.","Collateral Event of the 58th International Art Exhibition – La Biennale di Venezia\nAFRICOBRA: Nation Time is an official Collateral Event of Biennale Arte 2019 (May 11th – November 24th 2019), in Venice, Italy. AFRICOBRA: Nation Time is presented by bardoLA, originated and supported by the Museum of Contemporary Art North Miami, and curated by Jeffreen M. Hayes, Ph.D.\nAFRICOBRA was founded on the South Side of Chicago in 1968 by a collective of young Black artists, whose interest in Transnational Black Aesthetics led them to create one of the most distinctive visual voices in 20th Century American art. The key characteristics to what we now consider the classic AFRICOBRA look—vibrant, “cool-ade” colors, bold text, shine and positive images of Black people —were essential to everyday life in the community from which this movement emerged. It is a movement with roots in the soil, streets, classrooms, studios, and living rooms of the South Side of Chicago—yet its influence has extended around the world.\nThe five AFRICOBRA founders—Jeff Donaldson, Wadsworth Jarrell, Jae Jarrell, Barbara Jones-Hogu and Gerald Williams—understood the potential power visual art has to communicate deep meaning on multiple layers. They had the sophistication to mobilize the organic elements of their everyday visual environment into something capable of affecting the hearts, minds, and spirits of contemporary people. Their collective impact, in addition to Napoleon Jones-Henderson and Nelson Stevens both of whom joined the group in 1969 on the visual arts scene helped establish the visual voice of the Black Arts Movement of the 1960s and 70s. Their further impact—as artists, educators, and community leaders—has brought the members of AFRICOBRA to the forefront of contemporary conversations about the history, legacy, and future of Black Art in America and the world.\nAFRICOBRA: Nation Time is the next chapter of AFRICOBRA: Messages to the People, which premiered at MOCA North Miami during Art Basel Miami 2018, AFRICOBRA: Nation Time will focus entirely on the historic aspects of this vital, Chicago-born Black Arts collective. More than 40 works will be on view by Jeff Donaldson, Gerald Williams, Jae Jarrell, Wadsworth Jarrell, Barbara Jones-Hogu, Napoleon Jones-Henderson, and Nelson Stevens. Historic documentation, archival photographs and other ephemera will be showcased throughout the exhibition offering a unique and comprehensive narrative of AFRICOBRA’s birth and evolution on the South Side of Chicago in the late 1960s and early 1970s and its reverberating effect on the art scenes of Washington, DC, New York City, and Lagos, Nigeria.\nThis groundbreaking exhibition will be mounted within the historic, picturesque Venetian Gothic palazzo of Ca’ Faccanon, offering more than 5,000 square feet of exhibition space. Its perfectly central location is only meters away from the Rialto Bridge and St. Mark’s square.\nAFRICOBRA: Nation Time at Biennale Arte 2019 is the first time the work of this vital, definitive, and historic Black Arts collective has been given the opportunity to be celebrated by global audiences on this scale. AFRICOBRA: Nation Time is an exhibition of historic importance for the Black Arts Movement in the United States and all international audiences who are curious to discover more about the ways in which the aesthetic of African American artists relates to politics, culture and identity. Capturing the sentiment of their time with a visual language of vivid colors, rhythm, compositional arrangement and shine, the artists in AFRICOBRA: Nation Time reflect how a marginalized group found a way to empower themselves in a society that consistently denied them their power.\n“The fullness of Blackness is important in our global culture and AFRICOBRA addresses and connects the Diaspora in their art,” said Hayes. “While it represents this movement of nationhood in the 1970s, this exhibition explores the social and political fabric that continues to hold Black people together, even through the struggle in our contemporary moment.”\nThe exhibition is sponsored by Kavi Gupta Gallery and made possible with the generous support from the City of North Miami, Florida, John S. and James L. Knight Foundation. The exhibition is also supported by the Terra Foundation for American Art as part of Art Design Chicago, an initiative exploring Chicago’s art and design legacy.

{"question":"How do the Vienna sewer tours and the movie Moon compare in terms of providing an isolated experience?","answer":"Both offer isolated experiences but in different ways. The Vienna sewer tours take visitors into confined underground passages where they experience dark, echoing corridors with limited human contact besides their tour group. Moon similarly depicts isolation through Sam Bell's solitary three-year mission on the far side of the moon, with only a robot named GERTY for company and limited communication with Earth. However, while the sewer tours' isolation is brief (45-55 minutes) and includes a guide and group, Moon portrays a much more extreme and prolonged isolation lasting years.","context":["Third-Man-Tours of Vienna's sewers\nGuided tours that take visitors down into the \"underworld\" of Vienna\n's sewers, in particular to spots that were famously used for key scenes in the classic movie \"The Third Man\".\nMore background info:\n\"The Third Man\", released in 1949, was one of the most surprisingly successful movies of the immediate post-WWII\nera. It's based on a novel/screenplay by Graham Greene who was directly inspired by post-war Vienna\n, and so the backdrop and thematic setting of the film have an almost documentary quality, though the cinematography offsets this with some decidedly experimental elements.\nThe plot, as briefly summarized as possible, involves a second-rate writer, Holly Martin, who comes to Vienna to see an old friend, Harry Lime, who Martin soon finds out is apparently dead. He learns that Lime had been a wheeler and dealer in substandard black-market penicillin, which left many an unfortunate patient damaged for life – apparently this was indeed a real-life problem in Vienna at that time. Martin, however, finds out that Lime's death was only staged, and that he still carries on with his illegal dealings, using the underground sewers to move from one part of the city to another, which above ground was heavily patrolled by the military.\nMartin eventually meets up with Lime – who is played by Hollywood star Orson Wells – who in one of the most famous scenes of the film delivers his infamous \"cuckoo-clock speech\" on Vienna\n's landmark Ferris wheel in the Prater amusement park. In this speech he plays down the noble morals Martin is trying to promote by cynically pointing out that 500 years of peace and democracy in Switzerland\nhave produced little more than the cuckoo clock.\nThe showdown of the film takes place in the sewers of Vienna, when police (and Martin) chase Lime. Intense dark scenes of eerie footsteps, reverberating voices and echoing gunshots make these scenes really stand out. They rank amongst the most captivating in movie history. In fact, though, parts of what purportedly is a sewer is actually the Wien river in its concreted over underground canal … but never mind, it certainly provided for better angles and light.\nThe enduring fame of the film is today still exploited in Vienna, even though initially, it hadn't even been all that successful in the city in which it was shot – that came later, more gradually. A cinema on the Ring, the Burgkino, still screens the film regularly (in the English original), there's a museum about the movie, and at least three regularly scheduled walking tours on the theme.\nOn one of these tours, visitors are taken down into the parts of Vienna\n's sewer system where crucial scenes of the film were shot – and given the element of darkness and undergroundness and the film's general dark tone, I thought this could be featured on these pages with an entry of its own too.\nWhat there is to see (and smell): I've experienced this unusual tourist treat twice, once in October 2009 on a German language tour and again in May 2010 in English. Apart from the language there were also further differences.\nOne general one is that now you have to wear hard hats with little LED headlamps on them. The reason for this is not just enhanced safety (a good thing, especially if you're tall, since some of the corridors are indeed so low that you could easily bang your head). It's also because the underground passages are now less lit up – clearly to heighten the spooky atmosphere – which has furthermore been supplemented by a few sound effects that come from hidden tannoys. For real, on the other hand, are the sounds that cars rolling over manholes make – this produces strange clanking noises which reverberate around the underground passages, seemingly coming out of nowhere. Much eerier than the recorded sound effects.\nOnce you've registered, paid for your ticket and have been provided with your hardhat, the tour guide will first give a brief introduction, still above ground: bits of information about the film and post-WWII Vienna\nin general. On the English-language tour this was much briefer. But that's not necessarily a bad thing as you get to what you're here for quicker: namely when the group descends through a star-shaped hatch into the actual sewers. This spot also featured in the \"The Third Man\" and may thus look familiar to those who've seen the film.\nDown there you get to see three \"rooms\" connected by low corridors. The first room is at one of the main sewer canals with its fast-flowing dirty water. This is the smelliest section on the tour, but it's not actually all that bad. But if you're really, really sensitive, take a scarf or mask to cover your nose and mouth.\nHere a short film is shown. In 2009 this was in German with English subtitles and it was projected onto a screen suspended directly above the sewer. In May 2010 the film was in English and was projected directly onto the walls. While this may be an improvement in as much as it, again, somewhat enhances the spooky effect, it makes it more difficult to follow the film: it's harder to discern what it is that's being screened and the sound reverberates in such a way that it is also harder to understand what's being said (subtitles are of course unaffected by this).\nContent-wise, the film shown here has nothing to do with \"The Third Man\" but is a general introduction to the sewer system and the tasks of the people whose job it is to do the maintenance work down here.\nThen the \"Third Man\" theme is picked up again in the next room – which will look instantly familiar to all those who have seen the film. This is the main original location of many of the sewer shots of the movie – although others were actually shot in a studio mock-up in England. Orson Wells was famously reluctant to go down the sewer himself (allegedly he was afraid of rats), so that a double was needed. The location is real, though, even if it has been slightly altered: a new overflow canal inlet was added in recent years, only barely visible behind the old weir.\nOn the more recent English-language tour I did in May 2010 it was here that more film snippets were projected directly onto the wall opposite the elevated walkway you stand on – and colourful lighting effects were added as well. The German-language tour in 2009 was focused less on such haunted-house effects and more on factual information delivered by the guide. The new design is more effective in a visual sense, perhaps, but to be honest I preferred the more sober earlier approach. (It was also easier to take good photos of the room, as it looked in the film – which of course lacked colour effects, having been shot in black and white.) But others may well prefer the \"upgraded\" design – it's a matter of personal taste, I suppose.\nBy the way: at this point, the sewer odour is negligible, as the waters are actually fed by Vienna's many little rivulets coming down from the hills of the Wienerwald.\nThe next point on the tour is another sewer proper, and here you can see it too: grimy bits hanging of wall, lamps and lower handrails. More info on the history of the sewer is provided here.\nIn 2009 another film was shown here, again projected onto a screen suspended above the sewer. It too was more on the topic of \"The Third Man\" movie and its various connections with Vienna\n– and if I remember correctly was more traditional and informational rather than for effect.\nWhat I did not see in 2009 (allegedly for security concerns) but was again included in 2010 is the famous inside of the tunnel that the Wien river flows through and which provided one of the most iconic images of the entire film. It could well be that whether you're shown this or not is weather-dependent (obviously, if there's been too much rain, the water levels may suddenly rise to levels too dangerous for people to be down here.) If you get to see it it's quite something – although you don't actually see that much, since it is pretty dark. Still, even in the dim light of the headlamps on the hard hats and the guide's torch you get a feeling for the cavernous space of this covered river. On my tour in May 2010 there was even a car down here! It was the police (just as in the film!) – and their rear lights in the distance gave a good impression of distance. Then it turned round and came towards us. Quite a sight!\nFinally you are led back up into the open and there's a chance for some more questions and answers. And that's it.\nAll in all, the tour is only about one half to two thirds about the \"Third Man\", but that shouldn't stop dark tourists from doing it – as the other real-life bits of info about (and sensory experience of) the sewer are also worth taking in. It's not even as claustrophobic as you might expect – only the connecting corridors may feel a bit narrow, but the stations where the talking and film-showing takes place are quite spacious.\nIncidentally, you are very unlikely indeed to encounter any rats on the tour (even though the guide may joke about you not being allowed to take any away with you). Even if there are any about, they'd disappear at the first sign of humans approaching.\n, more precisely: under Esperantopark and Friedrichstraße on the southern edge of the First District bordering the 4th – the meeting point for the tour is opposite No. 6 Friedrichstraße – and is clearly marked.\nAccess and costs: restricted, seasonal and by guided tour only; reasonably priced.\n: It is, quite predictably, only possible to go down to the sewers on guided tours. Before you're admitted you also have to sign a disclaimer (as the environment down there potentially poses a slight health & safety risk\nTours are conducted seasonally only, between 1 May and 31 October, and during the season take place Thursdays to Sundays, every hour on the hour between 10 a.m. and 9 p.m. – cost: 7 EUR (concessions and combination discounts apply). English-language tours may only be offered somewhat less frequently. Best check ahead.\nAnd also as the tours are generally very popular and numbers of participants for each tour are limited, it is highly recommended to book ahead: phone +43-1-4000-3033.\nThe meeting point for the tour is at the access hatch on a small green plot called Esperanto Park (for a small statue in honour of the inventor of this artificial language, Ludwig Zamenhof) – from the First District walk down Operngasse from opposite the Opera itself until you come to an open area where the busy street Friedrichstraße bends down into Wienzeile. The meeting point on the island in the street/square is marked by a large information panel next to a kind-of monument (and at times by a kind of oddly-shaped flag featuring the distinctive face of Orson Wells as Harry Lime, as well) and a single concrete sewer section. Here, you'll find the green van where you have to register for your tour, sign the disclaimer and leave your payment, before the group tour commences.\nTime required: The tour lasts about 45 to 55 minutes; you are advised to be at the meeting point 15-20 minutes before the start of the tour (for administrative reasons – you need to sign a disclaimer before you can join such a tour).\nCombinations with other dark destinations: There are further attractions on the same movie theme, esp. an above ground \"Third Man\" walking tour of some of the locations where scenes for the film were shot. Such walks are organized by the same company that also offers the sewer tours – and in fact if you book both you get a discount. Another \"Third Man\" walking tour of film locations is offered by viennawalks.com.\nThose who are really into the film could also go to the Third Man Private Collection, a kind of museum about the film, and in part also about Vienna\n). The most prized exhibit is the original zither that Anton Karas played/composed the movie's characteristic music on (a hit record back then that made Karas a star).\nThose not yet or no longer all that familiar with the film could go and watch it (in the English original) at the Burgkino cinema on Opernring 19 (showing the film usually on Sundays and Tuesdays at 4 in the afternoon, sometimes also on Friday night (best check ahead at www.burgkino.at).\nThe \"Third Man\" connection could also additionally justify a trip out to the Prater funfair with its iconic Ferris wheel, which also featured in the film. It's quite heavily touristic, but why not go on it all the same and when at the top spare a few thoughts about morals, penicillin, Italian bloodthirst and cultural icons and/or Swiss democracy and cuckoo clocks … for those seeking a more immediate adrenaline kick, the funfair also offers some real white-knuckle rides of the highest order!\nFor other dark sites not related to the \"Third Man\" in any way see under Vienna\nCombinations with non-dark destinations:\nThe access hatch to the sewer tour is only steps away from some of Vienna\n's best sights. One of them is the Naschmarkt.

Let’s take a look at them here, from highest to lowest in terms of budget.\nIn Moon, Sam Rockwell stars as “Sam Bell,” an isolated helium-3 miner about to complete a three-year tour of duty on the far side of the moon. His only company is a robot GERTY (voiced by Kevin Spacey), and he suffers greatly from faulty communications with Earth which only allow him to send one-way messages to his wife.\nAs his stint comes to a close, Sam begins hallucinating and having increasingly bizarre experiences, and ultimately discovers unexpected information about the true nature of his assignment.\nWhat makes Moon shine as a sci-fi story is its unusual and isolated setting, compelling acting, and intriguing food-for-thought twist at the end.\nMoon was co-written by director Duncan Jones and screenwriter Nathan Parker. They set out to keep the budget limited to $5 million by limiting the cast size and filming in a studio (source: Wikipedia). The movie grossed $9.7 million worldwide and won many awards.\nSleep Dealer is a fascinating study in low-budget sci-fi. Although it didn’t perform well in the box office (perhaps because it was only released in 18 theaters), as a sci-fi story I thought it deserved more attention.\nIt’s an intriguing tale of Mexican workers doing grunt work across the border in the United States via remote controlled robots. They’re connected to their alter-egos through a network accessed by cables implanted into their backs and arms. Just as Mexican migrant workers perform many of today’s heavy labor tasks, so do these workers — but from a place “safely” across the border, where they are worn out by their late night hours, desperate to make an income.\nThe story raises interesting social inequity questions, much as Elysium did (albeit at a much higher budget).\nOf the four films, Sleep Dealer is the one that truly tackles social commentary in the way sci-fi is known for.\nAnother Earth embodies a simple sci-fi concept that’s well-executed: What if there was another Earth, and an identical copy of you was present on that mirror planet?\nA young woman, played by actress Brit Marling, struggles to redeem a horrific mistake — a drama playing out under the glow of this duplicate, mirror Earth. When she realizes there’s a chance for redemption tied to the duplicate planet, she enters an essay contest to try to win a civilian ticket to the mirror world.\nThe budget for Another Earth was a $750,000, brought in $1.7 million in the box office, and won awards.\nWhat made the movie so powerful were the tragic circumstances the character created and her painful path to try to recover from them. The sci-fi element of the story was always present — the second Earth was a constant backdrop — but that was the only visual effect necessary. The story felt like science fiction primarily through implication, which I thought worked brilliantly.\nSafety Not Guaranteed\nIn Safety Not Guaranteed, a young magazine intern, Darius, played by Aubrey Plaza, gets picked by one of the magazine writers to go with him and another intern to research the story behind a classified ad that reads:\n“Wanted: Somebody to go back in time with me. This is not a joke. P.O. Box 91 Ocean View, WA 99393. You’ll get paid after we get back. Must bring your own weapons. Safety not guaranteed. I have only done this once before.”\nWhat makes this movie so terrific are the kooky, ever-so-slightly-over-the-top characters and Darius’s growth arc from her reluctance to enjoy life to a more go-for-it spirit. As in Another Earth, the actual sci-fi element is there primarily through conversation and implication: Is this time travel guy for real, or not? Delightfully, you don’t discover the answer until the very end. (And I’m not going to tell you what it is, either.)\nThe budget for Safety Not Guaranteed was a mere $200,000 and it grossed over $4 million, making it the most financially successful of the bunch. The movie also won several awards.\nBudget-Box Office Comparison\nLet’s take a look at how the four movies compared in terms of budget and box office. Isn’t it fascinating that the lowest budget performed the best at the box office, relative to its budget?\n|Sleep Dealer (2008)||$2,500,000||$107,559|\n|Another Earth (2011)||$750,000||$1,776,935|\n|Safety Not Guaranteed (2012)||$200,000||$4,010,957|\nSo what can we take away from all this?\n- Keep the budget low by keeping it simple. One idea, well-executed, can go a long way.As Chris Soth said in one Sci-Fi Circuit column, “Stick to one ‘What if?’ or change and play out the unexpected consequences of it.”\n- Sci-fi aspects can be minor background elements and still significantly impact the tone and genre. Although Safety isn’t even listed in IMDB as “sci-fi” — and it arguably isn’t — the sci-fi tweak on the story was what hooked me and kept me wondering throughout.\n- Great roles and great acting still count, even in the low budget market — and perhaps more so. Every single one of these movies had compelling story lines, stakes, and characters.\n- A limited cast size can help keep the budget low too. Each of these movies had just a few core characters: One in Moon, three in Sleep Dealer, two in Another Earth, and two to four in Safety (depending on how you count).\n- Sci-fi is everywhere. I’m struck by how much sci-fi material is out there for the taking with a little creative brainstorming and a willingness to see it through. And it doesn’t require complex world-building, alien races, or advanced technology to make the sci-fi magic we know and love. How cool is that?\nThanks for reading!\n- Getting a Grip on the Sci-Fi Market with Dan Gordon by Jenna Avery\n- Breaking Into the Sci-Fi Spec Market with Shane Joseph Willis by Jenna Avery\n- Sci-Fi Circuit: Sci-Fi Storytelling, Part 1 — Story Type, Mistakes, & Big Ideas with Chris Soth, by Jenna Avery\n- Sci-Fi Storytelling, Part 2 – Structure, Budget, & What’s Next with Chris Soth, by Jenna Avery\nGet more tips on writing sci-fi in Steve Duncan’s webinar\nWrite Sci-Fi Film & Television Scripts That Sell"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:cd284ffc-77d0-4381-a7be-f567de77e240>","<urn:uuid:fda63612-b287-46ac-b211-6495e03422b5>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What is the key difference between skeletal and cardiac muscle tissue in terms of their cellular communication methods?","answer":"The key difference is that skeletal muscles operate independently, while cardiac muscle fibers branch out and communicate with each other through electrical impulses. These electrical impulses in cardiac muscles are specifically carried between each muscle by an intercalated disc to maintain communication with the nervous system and brain. This specialized communication system in cardiac muscles ensures coordinated contractions for proper heart function.","context":["It’s time to revisit your high-school anatomy class. Today’s class is about the different types of muscle tissue.\nMuscles are made up of soft tissues that form together in patterns to create different types of muscles. Muscles are either voluntary or involuntary and perform different functions depending on the muscle tissue type.\nThe exception to this rule of being voluntary or involuntary is the diaphragm. It is different as it both acts on its own (involuntary) to control breathing (you don’t have to think about breathing), but you can also move it yourself and control the rate of breathing by moving it (voluntary).\nMuscles typically work in pairs by counteracting each other’s movements. If you are curling your arms up, your biceps are contracting and your triceps are relaxing. If you are doing a pushup, your chest muscles are contracting and your upper back muscles are relaxing. Without this symbiotic relationship, you would not be able to move. If both antagonizing muscles were contracting at the same time, we wouldn’t be able to move our bodies.\nThere are three types of muscle tissues and all of them are different because of the functions they perform. The three types of muscle tissue are skeletal, cardiac, and smooth.\nSkeletal Muscle Tissue\nSkeletal muscles are those attached to the skeleton and control body movements and keep the body in position. There are exceptions to this rule such as the tongue and diaphragm not being attached to the skeleton. Skeletal muscles can usually be arranged into four categories:\n- Flexor, a muscle to bend a joint\n- Extensor, a muscle to straighten a joint\n- Abductor, a muscle to move a body part away from the bodies centerline\n- Adductor, a muscle to move a body part towards the bodies centerline\nCardiac Muscle Tissue\nCardiac muscles are those found in the heart and associated respiratory muscles. Cardiac muscle is designed to contract many times over a certain lifespan. The muscle cells themselves are designed much like skeletal muscle to be very strong and are also joined to one another in a linear fashion.\nHowever, unlike skeletal muscles, cardiac muscle fibers branch out and communicate with each other through electrical impulses. These electrical impulses are carried between each muscle by an intercalated disc to ensure communication is maintained with the nervous system and brain. The overall goal of cardiac muscles is to ensure blood gets around the body.\nSmooth Muscle Tissue\nFinally, we have smooth muscle tissue. Examples of where you can find smooth muscle tissue are in the internal organs, blood vessels, and eyes. Where cardiac muscles are built for a high volume of strong contractions, smooth muscle tissue is built for slow and prolonged contraction. Smooth muscles are typically arranged in layers and vary in size to a huge extent. They normally make up muscles that react to involuntary movements.\nBecause muscles have different jobs to do and are put under different kinds of stress, the human body adapts to this by having these different types of muscle tissue. How the cells are arranged and how they react to different stimuli (electrical, hormonal or autonomic) show how the different types of muscle tissue become suitable for different jobs.","It’s time to revisit your high-school anatomy class.

{"question":"How do sedimentary, igneous, and metamorphic rocks differ in appearance, and what regulations govern the collection of petrified wood specifically?","answer":"The three rock types have distinct appearances: sedimentary rocks show layering, break easily, and feel gritty; igneous rocks have mixed crystals without layers; metamorphic rocks are very hard with crystals aligned in bands or layers. Regarding petrified wood collection regulations, it is available for free personal use with specific limits: 25 pounds plus one piece per day, not exceeding 250 pounds per calendar year. No specimen over 250 pounds may be collected without a special permit. The material cannot be sold or bartered to commercial dealers, and mining claims cannot be staked for petrified wood. Commercial collection requires a material sale contract from a BLM Field Office.","context":["& Identify Rocks\nsuggested grade levels: 9-12\nview Idaho achievement standards for this lesson\n|Rock identification book||Adhesive tape|\n|Strong canvas bag||Gloves|\n|Chisel||Unglazed white tile|\n|Newspaper||Egg carton or muffin tin|\n|Notebook and pencil|\nUse the geology section of the Digital Atlas of Idaho. To get there: Click on Atlas Home, Geology, Basics, then on Diagrams. Also use the rock section for a description of different rocks. To get there: Click on Idaho Overview, then on Rocks. Encourage your students to examine the rock cycle and click on the diagram for the explanations on the different types of rock. Explain to the students that they will need to know this in order to do this field activity.\nEncourage your students to collect and identify rock specimens at home:\n1.Try to pick fairly large rock specimens. Use the size of a closed fist as your goal. If you are working in an excavation, collect samples from all layers. When you find a rock you want to keep, stick a small piece of adhesive tape on it. Number the rock and make an entry in your notebook, next to the corresponding number, describing where the rock was found. Wrap the marked rock in newspaper and drop it into your bag. Use the sample as a guide to decide how certain land formations came into being.\n2. If you want to group your rocks according to whether they are igneous, sedimentary, or metamorphic, use the following general description of the three kinds of rocks and compare your samples with the classification pictures. Sedimentary rocks have a layered appearance but usually break easily and feel gritty. Igneous rocks have a crystalline appearance, with the crystals mixed and never in layers. Metamorphic rocks are very hard and more crystalline than igneous rocks, but the crystals of each mineral are lined up in bands or layers.\n3. Remember that the outside surfaces of a rock are weathered, and you must expose a fresh surface if you wish to study the original characteristics of the rock. Use the hammer to break the rock open so that you can see a clean interior surface.\n4. Now that you have collected a number of rock samples and have made notes about where the samples were found, it is time to identify or grade them. There are several techniques you can use to help with this identification: the acid test, the cleavage test, and the streak test. The acid test is very simple. Rocks containing calcite or lime will bubble or fizz when an acid is poured on them. Use vinegar as your acid. If you hold the rock close to your ear and listen carefully, you'll be able to hear any fizzing that might be taking place.\n5. When you break rocks, they will either cleave (an easy, flat break) or fracture, depending on the minerals present in them. Some cleavages are good clues to identifying minerals in rock. The way a rock fractures is also a clue to its identity. Hit the rock with a hammer to break it. Place a cloth over the rock before you hit it so that chips won't fly.\n6. When you scratch a piece of unglazed white porcelain (the back of a bathroom tile will do) with certain rocks, they make characteristic streaks. For example, although pyrite in rock form looks yellow, it always leaves a black streak on the tile. Noting the streak it makes can identify many rocks.\nThese are links to access the handouts and printable materials.\nDiagrams | Rocks","U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIORBUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT\n|El Centro Field Office|\nRockhounding is one of many recreational pursuits on 14 1/2 million acres of lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) in California. Collecting small, non-commercial quantities of rock by rockhounds is allowed free of charge on lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management. Commercial collecting for the purpose of sale or barter is not allowed without special authorization. Rockhounds may use hand tools such as shovels and picks, but must not use explosives or power equipment for excavation.\nRockhounds are welcome to collect limited amounts of rocks, minerals, and gemstones from most federal lands, but there are some exceptions. Some lands are withdrawn or reserved for certain purposes such as outstanding natural areas, research natural areas, recreation sites, national historic sites, etc. Other lands are not open to collecting due to the presence of mining claims. The local BLM offices can provide you with information about available collecting areas and those areas that are closed to rockhounding including any fire or vehicle use restrictions.\nPetrified wood is available for collection on a free use basis in limited quantities as long as the collection is for personal, non-commercial purposes. According to Federal regulations (43 CFR 3622), free use collection weights are limited to 25 pounds plus one piece per day, not to exceed 250 pounds in one calendar year, and no specimen greater than 250 pounds may be collected without a special permit. The petrified wood must be for personal use only, and shall not be sold or bartered to commercial dealers. A material sale contract must be obtained from a BLM Field Office for collection of more than 250 pounds a year, or for commercial use. Mining claims may not be staked for petrified wood.\nHISTORIC ARTIFACTS AND FOSSILS\nThe Antiquities Act of 1906, the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, and the Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979 prohibit the excavation, collection or destruction of any archaeological materials (including fossils) located on lands under federal jurisdiction. The indiscriminate removal of artifacts and certain fossils could affect scientific and educational uses of public lands creating unfortunate gaps in scientific understanding. Petroglyphs, human remains, dwellings, and artifacts of Native American cultures are protected by law because they are integral to the preservation of the cultural heritage of these ongoing traditions and also may provide important information concerning populations who lived here long ago. For more information on the collection of fossils, please download the following brochure \"They Walked Here Long Ago\" or visit http://www.blm.gov/wo/st/en/prog/more/CRM/paleontology.html.\nRockhounding on mining claims is not advised without the mining claimant's consent because the claimant has a legal right to the minerals on the claim, including gemstones. Most mining claims can usually be identified in the field by claim posts or markers, but you should contact a local BLM office to find out which areas have mining claims. Also, it is illegal for a mining claimant to charge fees to the public for recreational use of a mining claim, such as rock collecting.\nMaterial such as agate, chert; jasper, petrified wood, obsidian, cinders and other volcanic products are not considered locatable under the 1872 Mining Law. Most commonly collected rocks and minerals are not subject to mining claim location even though people occasionally stake claims for these minerals anyway. The mere fact that some stones may be cut and polished does not give them a distinct or special value to make them locatable.\nCollecting rocks for landscaping and other personal uses is allowed without a permit, as long as the use is non commercial and no mechanized equipment is used (other than a car or pickup truck). A permit is not needed if you limit your collecting 25 pounds plus one piece per day, not to exceed 250 pounds in one calendar year, and no specimen greater than 250 pounds may be collected without a special permit. The material must be for personal use only and shall not be sold or bartered to commercial dealers.

{"question":"How do forgiveness and loving-kindness meditation both help prevent bitterness?","answer":"Both forgiveness and loving-kindness meditation work to prevent bitterness through positive mental transformation. Forgiveness specifically prevents the root of bitterness from taking over our lives, as mentioned in Hebrews 12:14-15, where it warns that a 'root of bitterness' can spring up and cause trouble. Similarly, loving-kindness meditation acts as a form of self-psychotherapy that heals the troubled mind from pain and confusion, systematically developing positive feelings that can supplant negative ones. As stated in the Dhammapada, 'Hatred cannot coexist with loving-kindness, and dissipates if supplanted with thoughts based on loving-kindness.'","context":["“Pray then like this: Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name. Your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For if you forgive others their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you, but if you do not forgive others their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.” Matthew 6:9-15\nQ. 194 What do we pray for in the fifth petition?\nA. “...we are emboldened to ask, and encouraged to expect forgiveness, when we have this testimony in ourselves; that we from the heart forgive others their offenses.”\nForgiveness = because of the glory and wonder of the cross, I relinquish my perceived right to hurt others in response to the way they have hurt me. It is refusing to retaliate while pursuing kindness.\nForgiving others is vitally important because:\n1. It shows forth the authenticity of my faith in Christ. UNFORGIVING PEOPLE DO NOT GO TO HEAVEN. Merciless people will not be shown mercy. (Matthew 5:7)\n2. Our joy and usefulness as believers are the balance. Everyday I choose to root out bitterness and nurture grace (There is a difference between “struggling to forgive” and the sullen and unyielding state of “I am going to get even…”). (James 3:15)“Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one\nanother, as God in Christ forgave you.” Ephesians 4:32\n3. The world is watching to see if our testimony is true and strong.\nGeneral Principles Regarding Forgiveness\n1. “Abide hard by the cross and search the mystery of his wounds” (Spurgeon). Rejoice in the goodness of sins forgiven. The abiding by the cross will deal with the daily irritants and lead to a life of forbearance.\n“See that no one repays anyone evil for evil, but\nalways seek to do good to one another and to\neveryone.” 1 Thessalonians 5:15\n2. Forgiveness is costly; therefore, I need the help of friends who rejoice in the grace filled imputed righteousness of Jesus. (Matthew 18: 21-35)\n3. Forgiveness does not allow the root of bitterness to take over our lives.\n“Strive for peace with everyone, and for the holiness\nwithout which no one will see the Lord.\n\"See to it that\nno one fails to obtain the grace of God, that no “root of\nbitterness” springs up and causes trouble, and by it many\nbecome defiled.” Hebrews 12:14-15\n4. In forgiveness, we renounce personal vendettas and trust in the justice of Abba Father.\n“Repay no one evil for evil, but give thought to do what\nis honorable in the sight of all. 18 If possible, so far as it\ndepends on you, live peaceably with all. Beloved, never\navenge yourselves, but leave it to the wrath of God, for\nit is written, ‘Vengeance is mine, I will repay, says the\nLord.’” Romans 12:17-19\n“For he is God’s servant for your good. But if you do\nwrong, be afraid, for he does not bear the sword in vain.\nFor he is the servant of God, an avenger who carries out\nGod’s wrath on the wrongdoer.” Romans 13:4\n5. The triune God esteems (loves) a forgiving person, while Satan delights in an angry bitter unforgiving person. (2 Corinthians 2:10-11)\n1. What does it mean to “abide hard by the cross and search the mystery of his wounds”?\n2. How does understanding the mercy of God lead to a life of forbearance as we deal with the daily irritants of life?\n3. What is the difference between a friend who is like Jezebel (1 Kings 21) versus a friend who is like Abigail (1 Samuel 25)?\n4. How do we root bitterness out of our lives?\n5. What is the difference between trusting the justice of God and personal vendettas?\n6. Why does the devil love extremes in the area of addressing sin and being unforgiving (1 Corinthians 5:1-2; 2 Corinthians 2:11-12)?","Loving-kindness meditation can be brought in to support the practice of ‘bare attention’ to help keep the mind open and sweet.\nIt is a fact of life that many people are troubled by difficult emotional states in the pressured societies we live in, but do little in terms of developing skills to deal with them. Yet even when the mind goes sour it is within most people’s capacity to arouse positive feelings to sweeten it. Loving-kindness is a meditation practice taught by the Buddha to develop the mental habit of selfless or altruistic love. In the Dhammapada can be found the saying: “Hatred cannot coexist with loving-kindness, and dissipates if supplanted with thoughts based on loving-kindness.”\nLoving-kindness is a meditation practice, which brings about positive attitudinal changes as it systematically develops the quality of ‘loving-acceptance’. It acts as a form of self-psychotherapy, a way of healing the troubled mind to free it from its pain and confusion. Of all Buddhist meditations, loving-kindness has the immediate benefit of sweetening and changing old habituated negative patterns of mind.\nLoving-kindness is the first of a series of meditations that produce four qualities of love: Friendliness (metta), Compassion (karuna), Appreciative Joy (mudita) and Equanimity (upekkha). The quality of ‘friendliness’ is expressed as warmth that reaches out and embraces others. When loving-kindness practice matures it naturally overflows into compassion, as one empathizes with other people’s difficulties; on the other hand one needs to be wary of pity, as its near enemy, as it merely mimics the quality of concern without empathy. The positive expression of empathy is an appreciation of other people’s good qualities or good fortune, or appreciative joy, rather than feelings of jealousy towards them. This series of meditations comes to maturity as ‘on-looking equanimity’. This ‘engaged equanimity’ must be cultivated within the context of this series of meditations, or there is a risk of it manifesting as its near enemy, indifference or aloofness. So, ultimately you remain kindly disposed and caring toward everybody with an equal spread of loving feelings and acceptance in all situations and relationships.\nHow to do it . . .\nThe practice always begins with developing a loving acceptance of yourself. If resistance is experienced then it indicates that feelings of unworthiness are present. No matter, this means there is work to be done, as the practice itself is designed to overcome any feelings of self-doubt or negativity. Then you are ready to systematically develop loving-kindness towards others.\nFour Types of Persons to develop loving-kindness towards:\n• a respected, beloved person – such as a spiritual teacher;\n• a dearly beloved – which could be a close family member or friend;\n• a neutral person – somebody you know, but have no special feelings towards, e.g.: a person who serves you in a shop;\n• a hostile person – someone you are currently having difficulty with.\nStarting with yourself, then systematically sending loving-kindness from person to person in the above order will have the effect of breaking down the barriers between the four types of people and yourself. This will have the effect of breaking down the divisions within your own mind, the source of much of the conflict we experience.\nWays of arousing feelings of loving-kindness:\n1. Visualization – Bring up a mental picture. See yourself or the person the feeling is directed at smiling back at you or just being joyous.\n2. Reflection – Reflect on the positive qualities of a person and the acts of kindness they have done. To yourself, make an affirmation, a positive statement about yourself, using your own words.\n3. Auditory – Repeat an internalized mantra or phrase such as ‘loving-kindness’.\nThe visualizations, reflections and the repetition of loving-kindness are devices to help you arouse positive feelings of loving-kindness. You can use all of them or one that works best for you. When the positive feeling arise, switch from the devices to the feeling, as it is the feeling that is the primary focus. Keep the mind fixed on the feeling, if it strays bring it back to the device, or if the feelings weaken or are lost then return to the device, i.e. use the visualization to bring back or strengthen the feeling.\nAdapted from buddhanet.net"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:b5a2d778-7022-4c4a-a2d0-f97da5b1322f>","<urn:uuid:13e5fdb6-0f5d-4a40-98fe-ecd38d869223>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I'm a crafts teacher looking for safe art projects. Could you explain how decoupage can be used in classrooms, and what safety measures should be considered when working with craft materials such as Mod Podge?","answer":"Decoupage is a versatile and affordable craft technique that can be used for various classroom projects like creating lap desks, lamps, or doll beds using materials like Mod Podge, paper, and basic supplies. When working with craft materials, several safety measures should be implemented: ensure proper ventilation in the workspace, as clean air supply is essential; wear appropriate protective equipment like gloves when handling chemicals; store materials in original containers with proper labeling; and maintain a well-supplied first aid kit in an accessible location. Additionally, keep the workspace clean, avoid eating or drinking in the craft area, and ensure proper lighting. For projects involving children, supervise the use of tools and adhesives, and consider keeping finished projects protected from spills or damage by storing them appropriately when not in use.","context":["Decoupage is an affordable and fun way to make simple craft projects fabulous and sentimental.

Why not give it an artistic flair? This project has accessible supplies and can be ready to go overnight.\nConsider your color scheme or artistic theme before you get your supplies. You may only need to look as far as you linen closet. The rest can be found at your local craft store or lumber yard.\n- A piece of plywood measuring 15 inches deep by 24 inches long (the average bed pillow)\n- A saw, if you could not find the wood in the correct size\n- Coordinating scrapbook paper\n- Coordinating wall paint to seal the wood\n- Mod Podge - a decoupage medium that is an adhesive and a sealant.\n- A bed pillow - either new or one that is not being used.\n- One yard of 42 or 45 inch wide muslin\n- E6000 Adhesive\n- Tape or staples\nHow to Make Your Lap Desk\nMaking a lap desk is much easier than it sounds. The process goes rather quickly once the paint is dry.\n- If the craft store did not have the correct size piece of wood or the lumber yard did not offer on-site cutting, you will need to cut the piece of plywood to the fit the pillow.\n- Once you have cut the wood, use the sandpaper to take any splinters off and make the wood smooth. Knock the dust off by turning the board on its edge and tapping it on your workbench.\n- Apply one heavy coat of wall paint to each side of the wood for you lap desk. Let this dry for about two hours to ensure the paint is completely dry.\n- While the paint dries, tear the scrapbook pieces into sections or tear out individual images, such as butterflies and flowers. Make three or four large selections to use in the middle and on the sides.\n- Once the paint is dry, arrange your paper pieces on the wood to decide where everything will go before applying the adhesive. Once you have a plan worked out in your mind, remove the paper and apply a thin layer of Mod Podge over the board.\n- Before the Mod Podge dries, place the paper starting with the corners and center. Apply a coat of Mod Podge to the back of the paper pieces, if needed.\n- Apply a coat of Mod Podge over the paper pieces to secure them and seal them.\n- Repeat this process with the rest of your paper pieces; work from largest to smallest.\n- Once you have all of your pieces on the board, cover the entire side of the board with a generous coat of Mod Podge to seal your desk top. Set aside and allow it to dry. This should take about thirty minutes.\n- Unfold the muslin and lay it out on a tabletop or the floor, whichever is easier.\n- Place the pillow diagonal on the fabric. The ends of the pillow should be pointing to corners of the fabric.\n- Starting on the long sides of the pillow, pull the fabric up making sure the entire edge is covered and into the center of the pillow. Secure it with a piece of tape or a staple.\n- Pull up each end of the fabric over the end of the pillow. You may need to fold and tuck fabric at the corners. Secure the fabric with tape or a staple to the fabric from the sides.\n- Once the desk top is dry, flip it over and apply a generous bead of E6000 adhesive to the edges of the board and several stripes of it through the middle of the board.\n- Place the board, E6000 side down, on the pillow covering all secured edges of fabric. You should not be able to see any of the pillow inside the fabric.\n- Holding the board and pillow together, carefully flip it over and set books or something on the pillow to weight it down. This will ensure adhesion while it dries overnight.\n- The E6000 adhesive will take about 24 hours to dry. Once that time is up, your desk is ready to use.\nThis is an inexpensive do-it-yourself decoupage project, and it is much easier to locate parts for than you might think. These are fun to make for different holidays, seasons, or decor.

Get the family involved with tracing and cutting and making everything sparkle with glitter.\n- Start with an empty quart mason jar without a lid. Wash and dry the outside of the jar to remove any residue from fingerprints.\n- After the jar is dried, apply a thin coat of Mod Podge. Let the jar dry completely.\n- On the backside of the scrapbook paper, trace the edging template. Depending on the size of your paper, you may need to do this more than once. Make a tall border for the bottom and a narrow one for the top of the jar. Cut out on the lines that you have drawn\n- When the jar is dry, apply a thin coat of Mod Podge to the back of the border you just cut out. Carefully wrap the border around the bottom and top of the jar. Smooth any folds or bubbles.\n- Apply a thin coat of Mod Podge to set and seal the borders.\n- While the jar dries, make the snowman image with the stamp and ink pad on plain white paper or the backside of a scrap of the scrapbook paper. Do the same with the word stamp \"Magical.\"\n- While the stamp ink dries, apply a thin coat of Mod Podge over the glass that is showing on the jar between the borders. Sprinkle iridescent glitter over the jar while the adhesive is still wet. Let the jar dry about 15 minutes.\n- Use the colored pencils to color in the detail of the snowman. Tear out the stamps and set aside.\n- Once the jar is dry, hold the jar over the trash can and dust off any loose glitter.\n- Apply a thin coat of Mod Podge to the back of the stamped details. Place on the jar and smooth. Apply a thin layer of Mod Podge over the stamps and let dry about five minutes.\n- Apply a generous coating of Mod Podge over the entire jar. Set aside and let it dry.

While this bed was made for a Barbie doll, the size of the box can be enlarged or decreased to fit any doll or stuffed animal.\nGather your supplies before you begin. You might have everything in your closet or pantry.\n- An empty box - The box for this project was an empty microwave popcorn box that you would find at wholesale warehouse stores such as Sam's Club or Costco.\n- Mod Podge\n- A foam brush or paint brush\n- Dinner or party napkins in two coordinating designs\n- A box knife\n- A hand towel to match the napkins\n- Four small plastic shot glasses\n- Hot glue\nAssembling the Doll Bed\n- Begin with an empty box that is long enough to fit the doll or toy.\n- Using a box knife, round off both ends of the box making one end shorter than the other as shown in the images below. These will be the head and foot of the bed.\n- Cut the sides as straight as possible so they are about two inches deep. You do not have to be perfect here because the layers will make up for any unevenness.\n- Coat the outside of the box with a layer of Mod Podge and let it dry.\n- Tear the napkins into four strips and separate the layers. Only tear two or three napkins at a time. You may not use them all. Do not throw anything away yet.\n- Apply another thin coat of Mod Podge to the end or side that you decide to start on. While wet, apply the white layer of the napkins making sure to leave enough napkin at the top to fold over to the inside.\n- Apply a thin layer of Mod Podge to secure the napkins and seal that layer.\n- Once you have the outside finished of where you are working, repeat this on the inside. Fold over the napkin the is overhanging from the front.\n- Repeat this around the box and then let dry. The layer should only take about fifteen minutes to dry.\n- Repeat this process with the design that you have chosen for the outside of the bed. It may take two or three layers of napkins to cover the box design.\n- Let the box dry for a few hours before moving on to the inside of the headboard and footboard. This will allow for the outside to be thoroughly dry and the inner edges will not shift.\n- Repeat the process for the inside of the headboard and footboard using the second napkin choice. Since there are no designs on the inside of the box, you may only need one layer of white napkin and one layer of designed napkin.\n- Clip off any overhang from the headboard and footboard and smooth the edges.\n- Allow the bed to dry a few hours.\n- Put a final generous coat of Mod Podge over the inside and outside of the bed to seal it.\n- Allow to dry overnight.\n- Turn the plastic shot glasses upside down and apply a small amount of hot glue. Place one on each corner or the box bottom to serve as the legs of the bed.\n- Fold the hand towel to fit the bed. This is the mattress and a folded napkin in either print is the pillow.\n- Your bed is now ready for your little one to enjoy.\nOther Decoupage Project Ideas\nYou can decoupage just about anything. There are several project ideas on Craftster.org and on craft store websites, such as A. C. Moore. A simple internet search will result in many, many pages of ideas. An easy gift idea is a decoupaged picture frame or a wooden tray with children's pictures decoupaged on it.\nIf you want to use special papers for your project but are pressed for time, you can print free decoupage papers at home using your home computer and printer. Gift wrap paper is also a good choice.\nEmbellishing your decoupage project depends on how fancy you want to make it. You could add bright buttons to a picture frame or silk flowers to a decoupaged box. It all depends on what you want your project to look like. Rhinestones that have flat backings found in most craft stores are a great choice too. Scrapbooking jewelled designs are another good option to add some glitz and glamour. If you are doing a project with baby items or pictures, consider embellishing your project with a small satin bow.\nProtecting Your Project\nRegardless of what type of decoupage project you have decided on or have finished, you need to protect it so you can enjoy it for years to come. If it is a small picture frame a child has made for you, consider placing it in a shadow box to hang on a wall or keep it in a China cabinet. If it is something that is meant to be enjoyed by small children, such as the doll bed, place it on a shelf in a bookcase when they are not playing with it. Keep the project where you can see and enjoy it, but where it is away from spills unless it is under glass.","As a visual artist, it is hard to consider health and safety concerns a top priority in creating art when you can barely finance your work or find the time to complete it. However, taking the time to consider and assess the risks associated with any art-making activity and spending money on basic safety measures is a necessity.\nInstead of relating numerous horror stories to convey the importance of safety in the arts, here are some basic safety topics to encourage you to either get started or heighten your awareness of safety as a valuable investment in your artistic future. While these issues are particularly relevant to visual artists, artists in all disciplines can benefit from this information.\nFire Hazards & Prevention:\n1. Locate exits and devise an escape plan in case of a fire.\n2. Equip your studio with at least one ABC all-purpose fire extinguisher and smoke detector.\n3. Install extinguishers near exits and potential fire hazards.\n4. Familiarize yourself with the operation of that particular fire extinguisher.\n5. Inspect the extinguisher annually. It may need to be professionally recharged or checked over time.\n6. Consult the local fire station with your questions.\nElectrical Fire Prevention:\n1. Inspect electrical wiring and electrical system to make sure that they are in good shape and that they are rated for the amount of power you are pulling from the system.\n2. Inspect all tool and machine power cords for damage, as well as any extensions cords you may be using.\nFlammable Material Care:\n1. Be aware of all flammable and combustible materials and liquids in your workspace, especially solvents and other chemicals.\n2. Always check the label of any material for safe handling and storage instructions.\n3. Store these items appropriately and away from potential sources of ignition.\n4. You may consider purchasing an anti-flammable storage cabinet. These units need to be properly grounded and ventilated.\n5. Waste solvents and solvent-soaked rags should be stored properly in an anti-flammable waste container.\nOther Fire Safety Concerns:\n1. Wear fire resistant clothing like cotton and wool if welding, soldering, glassblowing, or using an open flame. Protect against flying sparks in the workspace.\n2. Keep collection systems and machine motors free of flammable dusts and filters.\n3. Keep all passageways clean and unobstructed.\nPersonal Protective Equipment\nThe cost of personal safety equipment should be considered a business expense, just like studio rent and material costs. Every artist should own and make use of all of the items listed below.\nAdequate ventilation includes more than an open window or door in your workspace.\n1. Choose an appropriate type of ventilation for you. Pick dilution ventilation if working with small amounts of moderate toxins. Dilution ventilation is where clean outside air is brought into the workspace to dilute any toxic gases to safe levels and then the air is exhausted outside. The most effective ventilation solution is local ventilation, where toxic fumes, mists, and dusts are sucked away from the area in which you are working and are vented to the outside by using a tube or hood to capture the toxins as you work, some sort of duct to carry the contaminated air outside, and an exhaust fan to pull the contaminated air through the system.\n2. The tube or hood should be placed as close to the work area or source of contamination as possible.\n3. Be sure that there is an adequate supply of clean or fresh air coming in to your workspace.\n4. Make sure that the exhaust fan is not located near any clean air intakes, or exhausted contaminated air will re-enter your work space.\n5. Design and construct ducts with minimal and gradual bends and the proper length to operate successfully.\nUse a respirator in addition to, never in place of, a properly ventilated workspace\n1. Make sure that the respirator is the correct size for your face.\n2. Have a safety supply company representative or sales person help with selecting the correct cartridge or filter for your specific needs. Acids require an acid-gas cartridge; bases and alkalis necessitate an ammonia cartridge; dusts, mists, fumes, and other chemicals require the use of a toxic dust filter, and solvents require an organic vapor cartridge.\n3. All cartridges and filters should be changed as indicated on the directions for their use.\n4. When not in use, respirators should be kept in a sealed plastic bag to preserve the absorption of filters/cartridges and should be wiped clean regularly.\n1. Use the appropriate type of glove to prevent chemicals, solvents or toxic materials, from entering your body through skin contact.\n2. Replace gloves as frequently as is necessary. The contact with toxic substances will make the gloves degrade over time.\n3. Use tweezers or tongs to handle toxic materials in order to reduce the exposure to your hands and fingers.\n4. Use specialty gloves for metalworking, glass working, and other special operations.\nFace and Eye Protection:\n1. Use safety glasses or goggles for protection against impact, as well as those worn for infrared and ultraviolet radiation and chemical splash protection.\n2. Have a safety supply company representative or salesperson help you select the proper safety glasses for your needs. Safety glasses used for impact hazards should include shatter-resistant lenses and side shields. Glasses used to protect against infrared radiation require a shade rating between 1.7 and 3. Most safety glasses will block out the majority of ultraviolet light. If you are using a process that generates intense ultraviolet light, you will need to purchase glasses designed to protect you from this hazard.\n3. In some instances a face shield may also be needed. Face shields are designed to protect against damage to the face only and should not be substituted for eye protection.\n1. Protective earmuffs offer the most protection but can sometimes interfere with safety glasses or face shields. Earplugs are another alternative.\n2. Clean these items regularly. Earplugs contaminated with grease or other chemicals can become a hazard themselves.\nOther Protective Clothing and Equipment:\nAdditional personal protective equipment is available, depending on your particular activity. Some of these items include: leather aprons and jackets, hard hats, and safety shoes. Check with your local safety supply company.\nFirst Aid Kit:\nAll workspaces should be equipped with a well-supplied First Aid Kit.\n1. Locate the kit in an accessible location.\n2. In addition to the general list of medicines and supplies that most of us are familiar with, the kit should also include a first aid manual and a list of emergency numbers.\n3. Keep any allergy or medical condition medication with your first aid kit.\n4. Storage and Handling of Toxic Chemicals and other Materials:\n5. Take an inventory of all the materials you work with and know what materials are hazardous and what chemicals they contain.\n6. Always check the label of any new material for safe handling and storage instructions. The Art and Creative Materials Institute (ACMI) mark many art materials. Products bearing the AP seal of the ACMI are certified non-toxic. Materials bearing the CL seal of the ACMI contain ingredients that are toxic or hazardous but can be safely used following precautions.\n7. Collect Material Safety Data Sheets for the materials you use. Manufacturers of all materials are required to have Material Safety Data Sheets on all materials. These sheets provide detailed information on product ingredients and hazards, and the precautions that should be taken.\nOther Storage Concerns:\n1. Store materials in original containers.\n2. If materials cannot be stored in original containers, label the new container.\n3. Avoid breakable glass containers.\n4. Make sure materials/containers will not fall off shelves and are tightly capped.\n5. Do not place volatile materials on high shelves.\n6. Do not store incompatible materials or chemicals together.\n7. Gas cylinders should be chained up to a permanent fixture to prevent them from falling.\nGeneral Safety Tips:\n1. If possible, substitute safer materials or processes for those that present risks.\n2. Maintain/periodically check all equipment and tools.\n3. Tie all hair back when using power tools and equipment.\n4. Never remove or alter tool or machine guards.\n5. Vacuum, rather than sweep, dusty work areas.\n6. Keep separate clothes for working in the studio - wash them separately and often.\n7. Do not eat, drink or smoke in the studio.\n8. Have proper lighting in your workspace."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:7042ed71-0b79-4aae-99c0-6155fc82dbd3>","<urn:uuid:d9fc1c1a-6679-4c98-b6d0-a772f8a809b1>"],"error":null}

THE JOINT USUALLY FAILS FROM EXPANSION, CONTRACTION AND WATER INFILTRATION within a few years.\nSometimes this repair is necessary due to the location of the damage. Keep an eye on it, maintain it properly, and it can last. Brick Molding, sills, and most trim should not be replaced this way. It looks bad too.\nThis is a bay window.

If you run across termite or ant damage you need to call your termite company to see if it is covered under your bond. If there is an active nest, which means you can see the termites or ants, it is usually covered by your bond. If there is no evidence of activity it's usually not covered. This needs to be repaired the same as rotten wood listed above. If the termites get into the framing, more extensive repairs and support are needed, which are not covered here.\nFoggy Windows or Seal Failure\nSeal failure occurs when the rubber gasket in between double pane glass leaks and allows moisture to infiltrate the gap.\nThe only way to fix this is to replace the window sash or the whole window.\nWood windows can rot from excessive moisture that builds up over time.\nSeal failure or glazing issues can lead to bigger problems.

The gutter will not be exactly level, it will actually lean or be angled toward the downspout. It leans toward the downspout to help it drain. Sometimes the gutter can come loose and lean in the opposite direction of the down spout. If you have a gutter overflowing its either clogged,loose or not angled correctly.\nWe recommend 6\" gutters with 3x4 downspouts and a cover if you are in close proximity to trees."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:b0fee2ce-c999-4ea6-97ab-8ab06da5246a>","<urn:uuid:42edb943-00d8-4948-8804-a3ecfc8b3d7b>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Could you compare how current assets and current liabilities are categorized on a balance sheet, particularly in terms of their time horizons and how they relate to a company's operational cycle?","answer":"Current assets and current liabilities are both categorized based on a one-year time horizon. Current assets are items that can be converted into cash within a year or less, including cash and cash equivalents, inventory, prepaid expenses, marketable securities, and accounts receivable. Current liabilities, similarly, are obligations that are due within a year, such as dividends payable, bank debts, rent, tax, wages, utilities payable, interests payable, and customer prepayments.

This diversity contains different people who share different cultures, traditions, beliefs, and perspectives. Many people have blended their cultures with others, but most people still adhere to their native cultures. Each culture has its own views and perspectives on certain areas in life, especially health care. This paper will focus on different cultural backgrounds, specifically Polish, Russian, and Irish cultures, and their beliefs and traditions. Additionally, this paper will explore the cultural and religious beliefs and attitudes towards health care, health protection, and health maintenances for these three cultural groups.\nCulture’s Impact on Health\nAccording to Edelman and Mandel, “Culture…refers to integrated patterns of human behavior that include the language, thoughts, communications, actions, customs, beliefs, values, and institutions of racial, ethnic, religious, or social groups. It is ‘shaped by values, beliefs, norms, and practices that are shared by members of the same cultural group'” (Edelman & Mandel, 2014, p. 24). As mentioned before, culture influences every aspect of a person’s life, which includes his or her beliefs, values, and customs on lifestyle and health care. Since health care providers in the United States are very likely to encounter people of different cultural backgrounds, it is extremely pivotal to be aware of the different beliefs, values, and customs that patients may have. These beliefs and values will affect their behavior and what health care options are available for them. Therefore, health care providers must be culturally competent. Cultural competence is “the ability to give care to an individual that demonstrates awareness of and sensitivity to the underlying personal and cultural reality of the individual by identifying and using cultural norms, values, and communication and time patterns in collecting and interpreting assessment information” (Edelman & Mandel, 2014). Nurses and other health care providers need to be culturally competent to be able to provide the best care to each patient. By exhibiting cultural competence and having an awareness of a patient’s culture, values, and beliefs, a nurse can make the patient feel comfortable and valued, which can also help improve the patient’s compliance with his or her health care.\nHeritage Assessment Tool (HAT)\nNurses should utilize the Heritage Assessment Tool (HAT) to obtain valuable information about the patient’s cultural, ethnic, and religious background. This tool helps nurses to determine the patient’s different needs and practices that need to be addressed when providing a beneficial health care plan. This tool was utilized when interviewing three culturally different families: a Catholic Polish family, a Jewish Russian family, and a Catholic Irish family. The HAT portrayed some similarities among the three families such as the fact that spouses were of the same religion and ethnic background, all belong to a religious institution, all practice religion at home and are active members of their institution, all prepare ethnic foods and practice ethnic activities, and all prefer to speak their native language. However, due to the different cultures and religions, each family has different health care beliefs and needs that must be considered by nurses.\nCatholic Polish Family\nThe Heritage Assessment Tool (HAT) was first given to a Catholic Polish family, who strongly adheres to their religious beliefs and practices. It is important for nurses and health care providers to be aware of the practices that Catholics may want to participate in while admitted to a hospital. For instance, there are some sacraments and blessings such as Confession and Holy Communion that Catholic patients may want to participate in before surgeries. In those cases, a priest needs to be requested or a Eucharistic minister if the patient wants to receive Communion (Ehman, 2012). Additionally, patients who may be extremely sick or near death might request to participate in the Sacrament of the Sick, or the Last Rites, so a Catholic priest must be contacted in that case as well. Nurses must also be aware that many Catholics follow religious practices like weekly attendance at Mass and special observance of religious holidays, and an interruption in such practices can be distressing; therefore, they should arrange for a priest to come to the patient or bring the patient to a chapel. Some Catholics even carry religious objects with them like rosary beads, so nurses need to be aware of such objects and ensure that they are not destroyed or thrown away. Lastly, during religious holidays or seasons, Catholics may participate in certain dietary restrictions. For instance, during the season of Lent, many Catholics may abstain from meat, so nurses must be aware of these dietary changes.\nReligious practices and beliefs are not the only factors that affect a person’s health care, but also the cultural/ethnic beliefs and practices are a big factor. When it comes to minor aches and pains or illnesses, most Polish people will try to heal themselves with home remedies or over-the-counter medicines. For colds and flu-like symptoms, Poles will often eat chicken noodle soup, drink tea with honey or raspberry syrup, eat spoonfuls of honey to soothe sore throats, eat slices of bread with butter and garlic, dress warmly, take hot baths with salt, and even take cold or pain medicine if needed. Many Poles “display stoicism towards pain and may ‘suffer’ in silence,” so they will wait a couple of days before seeing a doctor. However, if they are experiencing serious pains or illnesses, they will immediately see a doctor. Sometimes, Polish people associate their pain with religion and believe that their pain comes from God, so they must repent and change their behaviors (Diversicare, 2006). Overall, health is extremely important to Polish people, and if they have serious illnesses or pains, they will visit a doctor or hospital.\nCatholic Irish Family\nA Catholic Irish family was also interviewed using HAT. The religious beliefs and practices were already mentioned before in the section about the Catholic Polish family. Therefore, in this section, only the cultural and ethnic practices and perspectives about health will be discussed. Like most people, Irish people attribute good health to good food and physical exercise. Irish people, however, associate health with luck and attitudes (McCluskey, 2000). If someone is happy and has a positive attitude, then they will have good health; however, if someone is filled with stress and has a negative attitude, then they will experience illnesses. Some Irish home remedies that are practiced for minor colds and aches include drinking tea (specifically ginger, mint, or green tea), eating honey (with salt sometimes), drinking hot whiskey, wrapping their feet in garlic or onions, and drinking carbonated drinks for stomach pain (Hendicott, 2017). If the illnesses get very serious, Irish people will seek out medical advice and go see a doctor or a health care provider.\nJewish Russian Family\nLastly, a Jewish Russian family was interviewed using HAT. As with many religions, some Jewish people might strongly follow all Jewish beliefs and practices, while others might only observe certain practices and beliefs. Therefore, nurses need to ask the patient about their preferences, but they should still be aware of all Jewish practices. Many Jewish people might observe the rule to not work on the Sabbath or other religious holidays, which would affect health care because work could include any tasks or tools that need electricity (Ehman, 2012). Moreover, any medical procedures that are needed right away should not be scheduled on the Sabbath or religious holidays out of respect for Jewish patients. Additionally, Jews follow a Kosher diet, meaning that they must prepare their food a certain way, cannot eat certain foods (like pork), and cannot mix certain foods together (like dairy and meat together). Many Jewish holidays also have certain dietary changes in which the Jewish patient may need to eat a certain food, or they may have to fast from sundown-to-sundown. Furthermore, some Jewish people believe in modesty, so these patients may want to be treated by a health care provider of the same sex. Lastly, if a Jewish patient passes away, the family might follow the tradition that there should be a quick burial soon and that there should not be an autopsy. The family might also want the deceased patient to always be accompanied by a family member in the hospital and even near the morgue so that they may pray and read psalms.\nThe cultural practices and beliefs for Russians are an important factor to consider as well. Russians believe that people can have good health by dressing warmly, avoiding stress, and staying nourished (Health Care Chaplaincy, 2013). Russian people may turn to folk medicine or remedies before going to a doctor. These remedies include using herbs, eating chicken soup, spiritual healing, homeopathy, eating an abundance of vegetables, eating raw garlic or onions, drinking milk with butter, and staying warm. Like Polish people, some Russians may exhibit stoicism to pain and may not ask for pain medication. Russians may even tend to self-diagnose themselves before they go to a doctor. If the illness or pain is serious, Russians will seek medical advice from a doctor. Some Russian people may believe that the doctor is the ultimate authority, so it may be important for the doctor to introduce the patient to the rest of the health care team. Ultimately, Russians turn to home remedies first, but will see a health care provider if their health is seriously at risk.\nCultural, ethnic, and religious beliefs, traditions, and practices are an important part of health as delineated by the information in this paper. Tools like the Heritage Assessment Tool can help nurses and other health care providers to determine what cultures, ethnicities, and religions they must be aware of when providing the best patient care. However, health care providers must also be aware that not every person of the same cultural or religious background follow all the same exact traditions, so it is important for the health care providers to ask the patients which beliefs or practices they follow. Nurses or health care providers with cultural competence or an awareness of different cultures and religions will help the patient feel comfortable with their health care. The patient will more likely be compliant and will want to participate in improving his or her health."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:b0a94f5a-07e1-4761-a64a-ebd85961cccf>","<urn:uuid:17a88cb4-9239-434b-8c5c-2c19352e44e2>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do responsive email design and web servers handle image delivery differently?","answer":"Responsive email design and web servers handle image delivery in distinct ways. In responsive emails, images are loaded from a web server with considerations for different screen sizes and resolutions, allowing for different images to be loaded depending on the viewing device. Email clients may block images until users prompt to load them. For web servers, image delivery is part of their core functionality through HTTP protocols, where they process and respond to image requests directly as part of their website content delivery role. The hardware components of web servers, including high-performance processors and ample storage capacity, are specifically designed to handle multiple simultaneous requests for content including images efficiently and quickly.","context":["What is Responsive Email Design?\nResponsive email design allows your email to look its best no matter where it’s opened – a smart phone’s email app, a web browser on a computer, or an email client such as Microsoft Outlook. Furthermore, every screen is different. Even when the physical dimensions are the same, different resolutions (the number of pixels that can be drawn on the screen) can dramatically change how the content of an email appears. It’s important to ensure your email will look great no matter where – or how – it’s being viewed.\nThe technology behind responsive email design is the same technology behind responsive web design, which allows websites to render correctly on computer, tablets, and mobile devices – HTML and CSS. Different platforms interpret both HTML and CSS slightly differently and some platforms don’t support certain HTML and CSS features that other platforms do.\nThere are many unique considerations to take into account when designing a responsive email. These include:\n- Button Size: The difference between how a mobile screen reads a finger tap and a computer registers a mouse click at a cursor’s location is not insignificant. A mouse click is nearly pixel-precise, while a finger tap covers a broad area and can read differently depending on the angle of the finger, how clean the screen is, whether the user has callouses, etc. Buttons and links should appear much larger on mobile displays, to make responding to your CTA as easy and painless as possible.\n- Content Width: Content designed to work well on a narrow, vertically-oriented display often looks terrible when stretched to fit a desktop window. There are multiple ways to handle this, including setting a maximum width for the displayed content – scaling as needed for the different screen sizes of phones, but only scaling to a certain size, regardless of whether the user has their browser window set to full screen or not.\n- Image Placement and Resolution: Much like content width and button sizes, loading different images depending on how – and where – the email is being viewed is critical to loading your content quickly and beautifully.\n- Content: More and more users are reading their email on the go. Tailoring your content itself, based on whether the user is viewing the email on a phone vs a desktop computer, lets you add an extra level of customization that can make your content shine! Relying on system information available to the user’s email client, It’s even possible to change content based on time of day, the users location, or even weather conditions!\nIt is important to realize that responsive HTML email design – just like a web page – loads some elements from a web server, most notably – images. There’s no real limit to what content you pull from a server – including displaying text from a database, etc. There is a practical limit, however, as you don’t want a user to feel they must wait for an email to load successfully. Some email clients block images until prompted to load them by the user, so make sure your design and copy is compelling enough that the user clicks that “Load Images” button.","What are the three main elements of a Web server?\nA web server is a crucial component in delivering websites and web applications to users. It handles the request from a user’s browser and responds with the appropriate web pages and content. To understand how a web server functions, it is important to know about its three main elements: hardware, software, and protocols.\nThe hardware element of a web server refers to the physical components that power its operation. It typically includes a computer system capable of running server software, such as a high-performance processor, ample memory, and sufficient storage capacity. Additionally, web servers often utilize redundant power supplies and network connections to ensure continuous availability.\nThe software element of a web server encompasses the programs and applications that enable it to function. One of the key software components is the web server software itself, such as Apache or Nginx, which manages incoming requests and serves the appropriate files. In addition to the server software, other software components like the operating system, database management systems (e.g., MySQL), and programming languages (e.g., PHP, Python) may also be present, depending on the specific requirements of the web server.\nProtocols play a crucial role in enabling communication between a web server and client devices. The most fundamental protocol used by web servers is the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). When a user enters a URL in their browser, it sends an HTTP request to the web server. The server then processes the request and sends back an HTTP response, which is displayed as a web page. Additionally, web servers often use secure protocols like HTTPS to encrypt data transmission for improved security.\nOverall, a web server comprises hardware, software, and protocols working together to deliver websites and web applications to users. To better understand their relationship, let’s take a closer look at each element.\n“A web server is the foundational infrastructure that enables websites and web applications to be accessible over the internet. It combines hardware, software, and protocols to handle incoming requests and deliver the requested content to users.” – Web Development Expert\nIn terms of hardware, web servers are typically powerful computers that are optimized for continuous operation. They are designed to handle multiple requests simultaneously and deliver content quickly and efficiently. The hardware components often include:\n- Processor (CPU): A high-performance CPU ensures speedy processing of requests.\n- Memory (RAM): Sufficient RAM allows the server to handle multiple requests concurrently.\n- Storage: Web servers require ample storage capacity to store website files, databases, and other content.\n- Redundant Power Supplies: Servers often have redundant power supplies to minimize downtime in case of power failures.\n- Network Connections: Multiple network connections provide redundancy and ensure continuous availability.\nWeb server software plays a vital role in processing and serving web content. Some commonly used web server software include Apache, Nginx, and Microsoft IIS. These server programs receive HTTP requests from clients and determine the appropriate action to take. Other software components found on web servers may include:\n- Operating System: The server requires an operating system like Linux, Windows, or macOS to manage hardware resources and perform basic tasks.\n- Database Management System (DBMS): If the web server uses databases, it may have software like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB to manage data storage and retrieval.\nProtocols play a crucial role in facilitating communication between clients and web servers. The most essential protocol is HTTP, which enables the exchange of information between browsers and servers. Additionally, HTTPS, a secure variant of HTTP that uses encryption, is widely used to protect sensitive data transmitted over the internet. Other protocols relevant to web servers include:\n- FTP (File Transfer Protocol): A protocol used for transferring files between clients and servers.\n- SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol): Used for sending emails.\n- DNS (Domain Name System): Translates domain names into IP addresses, allowing clients to access web servers.\nIn conclusion, the three main elements of a web server are hardware, software, and protocols. The continuous advancement of these elements has contributed to the growth and evolution of the internet, allowing individuals and businesses to communicate, collaborate, and share information seamlessly.\nWhat are 3 Functions of a Server?\nA server plays a crucial role in managing and distributing resources within a network. Whether it’s a small business or a large enterprise, servers offer a wide range of functions that are essential for maintaining efficient operations. Here, we will explore three important functions of a server:\nData Storage and File Sharing\nA primary function of a server is to serve as a centralized storage system. Servers allow businesses to store and organize their data in a secure and reliable manner. With a server, employees can easily access and share files within the network, promoting collaboration and productivity. By storing data on a server, businesses can also implement backup solutions to protect against data loss.\nManaging Network Resources\nServers are responsible for managing network resources, including printers, internet connections, and email services. By controlling and allocating these resources, servers optimize network performance and ensure smooth operation throughout the organization. Through server-based management tools, administrators can monitor and control network usage, create user accounts, and set restrictions to enhance security.\nHosting Websites and Applications\nIn addition to data storage and resource management, servers are commonly used to host websites and applications. With the ability to handle multiple requests simultaneously, servers ensure fast and reliable access to websites and online services. Businesses often rely on server-hosted applications to support internal processes and customer interactions, enabling efficient workflows and enhancing user experience.\nIn conclusion, servers perform critical functions that contribute to the overall efficiency and productivity of an organization. From data storage and file sharing to managing network resources and hosting websites and applications, servers play a vital role in supporting the day-to-day operations of businesses.\nWhat are the typical types of server?\nA server is a powerful computer that provides resources, services, and data to other computers or clients over a network. In the UK, there are several typical types of servers used for various purposes, each with its own unique features and functionalities.\n1. Web Servers\nA web server is the most common type of server used to host websites and deliver web pages to users’ browsers. It handles HTTP requests and responds with the requested web content. Popular web server software in the UK includes Apache and Nginx.\n2. Database Servers\nDatabase servers store and manage data, allowing users or applications to access and manipulate information efficiently. MySQL and Microsoft SQL Server are widely used database server solutions in the UK.\n3. File Servers\nFile servers centralize file storage and facilitate file sharing within a network. They allow users to access and manage files remotely. Common file server protocols include FTP (File Transfer Protocol) and SMB (Server Message Block).\n4. Mail Servers\nMail servers handle email communication, storing and delivering emails to recipients. They use protocols like SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) for outgoing emails and POP or IMAP for incoming email retrieval. In the UK, popular mail server software includes Microsoft Exchange and Postfix.\n5. Game Servers\nGame servers provide a platform for multiplayer online games, enabling gamers to connect, interact, and play together. These servers require high-performance hardware to handle real-time game data and often have specific server software designed for gaming purposes.\nDid you know? According to a study conducted by Statista, the number of internet users in the UK reached over 64 million in 2020.\nThis variety of server types is crucial for maintaining a robust and interconnected digital infrastructure in the UK. Different industries and organizations require tailored server solutions based on their specific needs, whether it’s hosting websites, storing data, or facilitating online gaming experiences.\nHere’s a table summarizing the typical types of servers:\n|Type||Main Purpose||Example Software|\n|Web Servers||Host websites and deliver web pages||Apache, Nginx|\n|Database Servers||Store and manage data||MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server|\n|File Servers||Centralize file storage and sharing||FTP, SMB|\n|Mail Servers||Handle email communication||Microsoft Exchange, Postfix|\n|Game Servers||Provide multiplayer gaming experiences||Various gaming server software|\nIn conclusion, servers play a vital role in the digital landscape of the UK, supporting various industries and enabling efficient data exchange, communication, and online experiences. Understanding the different types of servers helps businesses and individuals choose the appropriate solutions for their specific requirements.\nWhat is a server and how does it work?\nA server is a powerful computer system that is designed to store, process, and deliver data and applications to other computers or devices over a network. Servers play a crucial role in the functioning of the internet and are used for various purposes, such as hosting websites, managing email services, storing files, and running databases.\nTypes of Servers\nThere are several types of servers, each serving a specific purpose:\n- Web servers: These servers host websites and deliver webpages to users who request them through a browser.\n- Email servers: They manage and store email messages, allowing users to send, receive, and access their emails.\n- File servers: These servers store and serve files, allowing users to share and access data over a network.\n- Database servers: They store, manage, and process large amounts of data, making it accessible through database management systems.\nHow Servers Work\nServers operate on client-server architecture, where clients (such as computers, smartphones, or other devices) connect to the server to request services or data. When a user requests a webpage, for example, their computer sends a request to the web server. The server then processes the request, retrieves the requested webpage from its storage, and sends it back to the client’s device for display in the browser.\nServers rely on software applications and protocols to communicate with clients and perform various tasks. For example, web servers use the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) to handle webpage requests and transfers. Email servers use protocols like POP3 or IMAP to receive and deliver email messages.\nDid you know? The term “server” can also refer to the physical hardware that houses the computer system.\nServers are typically designed with high-performance components, large storage capacities, and robust security measures to ensure reliability, data integrity, and protection against unauthorized access.\nServers are the backbone of the internet and are responsible for delivering the services and data we rely on every day. Whether it’s accessing websites, sending emails, or sharing files, servers play a crucial role in making these tasks possible. Understanding how servers work helps us appreciate the complexity involved in delivering information across networks and ensures efficient communication between clients and servers."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:a4c3f3c3-e007-441d-b877-21cd3d05c3b3>","<urn:uuid:6c98b21e-b743-4c67-a781-668cfc7a5f83>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Which organization had more electoral success between 1901-1920: the Socialist Party of America with Eugene Debs as presidential candidate, or the early AFL under Gompers in terms of achieving their political goals?","answer":"The AFL was more successful in achieving its political goals during this period. While the Socialist Party's Eugene Debs received significant votes in presidential elections (peaking at 901,551 votes or 6% in 1912), the AFL secured more concrete political victories. Under Gompers' leadership, the AFL successfully supported the establishment of the U.S. Department of Labor in 1913 and the passage of the Clayton Anti-Trust Act in 1914. The AFL's strategy of avoiding party politics and instead supporting labor advocates regardless of political affiliation proved more effective than the Socialist Party's approach of running their own candidates. The SPA, while gaining some local electoral victories, saw its influence decline sharply after World War I, while the AFL continued to grow in membership and influence.","context":["- Socialist Party of America\nInfobox Historical American Political Party\nparty name= Socialist Party of America\nparty articletitle= Socialist Party of America\nactive= 1901ndash 1973\nideology= American Socialism,\npreceded by= Social Democratic Party\nSocialist Labor Party\nSocialist Party USA\nDemocratic Socialists of America\ncolors = RedThe Socialist Party of America (SPA) was a socialist\npolitical partyin the United States. It was formed in 1901 by a merger between the three-year-old Social Democratic Party and a wing of the older Socialist Labor Party. It flourished in numerous ethnic enclaves from 1904 through 1912, with Eugene V. Debsas its presidential candidate. It splintered over World War Iand Russia's 1917 October Revolutionand was a minor political movement after 1920, often nominating Norman Thomasfor president.\nFrom 1901 to the onset of\nWorld War I, the Socialist Party had numerous elected officials. There were two Socialist members of Congress, Meyer Londonof New York Cityand Victor Bergerof Milwaukee(a part of the sewer socialismmovement); over 70 mayors, and many state legislators and city councilors. Its voting strength was greatest among recent Jewish, Finnish and German immigrants, coal miners, and former Populist farmers in the Midwest. [Shannon (1951)]\nEarly political perspectives ranged from radical socialism to social democracy, with New York party leader\nMorris Hillquitand Congressman Berger on the more social democratic or right wing of the party and radical socialists and syndicalists, including members of the Industrial Workers of the World(IWW) and the party's frequent candidate, Eugene V. Debs, on the left wing of the party. As well there were agrarianutopian-leaning radicals, such as Julius Waylandof Kansas, who edited the party's leading national newspaper, \" Appeal To Reason\" along with trade unionists; Jewish, Finnish, and German immigrants; and intellectuals such as Walter Lippmannand the Black activist/intellectual Hubert Harrison.\nThe party had a hostile relationship with the\nAmerican Federation of Labor(AFL). The AFL leadership was strongly opposed to the SPA, but moderate Socialists like Berger and Hillquit urged cooperation with the AFL in hopes of eventually forming a broader Labor Party. Their leading ally in the AFL was Max Hayes, president of the International Typographical Union. These efforts were bitterly spurned, however, by the majority of the Socialist Party, who held to either the IWWview or the Wayland view.\nThe party's opposition to\nWorld War Icaused a sharp decline in membership. An increase in the membership of its language federations from areas involved in the Bolshevik Revolution proved illusory, since these members were soon lost to the Communist Labor Party. The party also lost some of its most prominent members, who had been in favor of America's entry into World War I, including Walter Lippmann, John Spargo, George Phelps Stokes, and William English Walling. They briefly formed an outfit called the National Party, in an unrealised hope of merging with the remnants of Theodore Roosevelt's Progressive Party and the Prohibition Party.\nIn June 1918 the Party's best-known leader,\nEugene Victor Debsmade an anti-war speech [ Eugene V. Debs, \"The Canton, Ohio Speech, Anti-War Speech\", delivered June 16, 1918, first published 1918 in \"The Call\", [http://marxists.org/archive/debs/works/1918/canton.htm online at Marxists.org] , accessed 11 August 2006.] calling for draft resistance; he was arrested under the Sedition Act of 1918, convicted and sentenced to serve ten years in prison. He was pardoned by President Warren G. Hardingin 1921.\nExpulsion of Bolshevists\nIn January 1919\nVladimir Lenininvited the communistwing of the Socialist Party to join in the founding of the Communist Third International, the Comintern.\nThe Bolshevists held a conference in June 1919 to plan to regain control of the party by bringing delegations from the sections of the party that had been expelled to demand that they be seated. However, the language federations, eventually joined by\nCharles Ruthenbergand Louis Fraina, broke away from that effort and formed their own party, the Communist Party of America, at a separate convention in Chicago on September 2 1919.\nMeanwhile plans led by John Reed and\nBenjamin Gitlowto crash the Socialist Party convention went ahead. Tipped off, the incumbents called the police, who obligingly expelled the Bolshevists from the hall. The remaining Bolshevist delegates walked out and, meeting with the expelled delegates, formed the Communist Labor Partyon September 1, 1919. The Communist Labor Party merged with the Communist Party of America in 1921 to form the predecessor of the Communist Party USA.\nExpulsion of Socialists from the New York Assembly\nIn 1920, the\nNew York State Assemblyexpelled five Socialist members on the grounds that being a member of the Socialist Party constituted as disloyalty. These members included Louis Waldman, Samuel Orr, Charles Solomon, August Claessens and Sam Dewitt. This case was brought before the Supreme Court, and the members were permitted back into the Assembly.\nFrom 1904 to 1912, the Socialist Party ran\nEugene Debsfor President at each election. The best showing ever for a Socialist ticket was in 1912, when Debs gained 901,551 total votes, or 6% of the popular vote. In 1920 Debs ran again, this time from prison, and received 913,693 votes, 3.4% of the total.\nThe Socialist Party did not run a presidential candidate in 1924, but supported Senator\nRobert M. La Follette, Sr.and his ad-hoc Progressive Party. LaFollette's party disbanded after his death in 1925.\nIn 1928, the Socialist Party returned as an independent electoral entity under the leadership of\nNorman Thomas, a Protestant minister in New York City. Thomas repeatedly ran as the party's presidential candidate through 1948.\nA turn to the left\nThe party experienced a major growth spurt during the\nGreat Depression, primarily among youth. These youth leaders, however, were quickly won over to the proposition of reconciliation and reunification with the Communist Party, in keeping with new Popular Front policy of the Comintern. Leaders of the United Front faction included Reinhold Niebuhr, Andrew Biemiller, Daniel Hoan, and Gus Tyler. Most of these figures went on to become the founders of Americans for Democratic Action(ADA), a key Cold War liberal organization.\nThe \"militants\", as they were called, were triumphant at the Socialist Party's national convention in Detroit in June 1934, which precipitated the exodus of the opposing \"old guard\"—led by\nLouis Waldmanand David Dubinsky—which favored the formation of a national Farmer-Labor Partythat would have been likely led by Huey Long. Fact|date=February 2007 After this fell through, in 1936 the old guard leaders formed the Social Democratic Federation and reluctantly endorsed Franklin Roosevelt.\nBy this time, however, the militants as well were on the Roosevelt bandwagon, in keeping with the dictates of the\nPopular Front. The party was then buttressed by the mass entry of the American followers of Leon Trotskyfrom the U.S Workers Party in keeping with the so-called French Turn, by which Trotskyists recruited to their revolutionaryperspectives. The revolutionary perspectives of the Trotskyists caused enough havoc, however, that they were expelled by 1938. The Socialist Party's youth group, the Young People's Socialist League, left with the Trotskyists.\nBy 1940, only a small committed core remained in the party which opposed\nFranklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal. In 1940 Norman Thomas was the only presidential candidate opposed to a pro-Soviet foreign policy. This also led Thomas to serve as an active spokesman for the isolationist America First Committeeduring 1941.\nThomas led his last presidential campaign in 1948, after which he became a critical supporter of the postwar liberal consensus. The party retained some pockets of local success, in cities such as\nMilwaukee, Bridgeport, Connecticut, and Reading, Pennsylvania. In New York City, they often ran their own candidates on the Liberal Party line. In 1956, the party reconciled and reunified with the Social Democratic Federation.\nIn 1958 the party admitted to its ranks the members of the Independent Socialist League led by\nMax Shachtman. Shachtman's young followers were able to bring new vigor into the party and helped propel it to play an active role in the civil rights movement as well as the early events of the New Left. Shachtman, however, successfully blocked merger of the party with the Jewish Labor Bundon account of that organization's historical anti-Zionism. [cite web\nauthorlink=Socialist Party of Rhode Island\ntitle= A Short History of the Socialist Party USA\nBy the late 1960s the most powerful figures in the Socialist Party of America were Max Shachtman and\nMichael Harrington, who agreed upon a parallel strategy of maintaining the Socialist Party as an independent third party that fielded its own candidates, and acting as a pressure group within the Democratic Party. The party itself had become divided into three caucuses. One was the Debs Caucus led by David McReynolds, which wanted to pursue the traditional position of the Socialist Party as an independent political party and held the most strongly \"leftist\" position within the group. Another was the \"centrist\" Coalition Caucus led by Michael Harrington, which also had a leftist orientation, but wanted to work within the Democratic Party to pull it to the left. Finally, the \"rightist\" Unity Caucus led by Max Shachtman were strong supporters of the Lyndon Johnson/ \"Scoop\" Jacksonwing of the Democratic Party that supported hawkish anti-Communismabroad and civil rightsand the Great Societyprogram domestically.Socialist Party of Rhode Island. (2000). [http://sp-usa.org/spri/sp_usa_history.htm A Short History of the Socialist Party USA] (web page). Accessed: June 13, 2006.] Drucker, Peter. (1994). Max Shachtman and His Left: A Socialist's Odyssey Through the \"American Century\". Atlantic Highlands, NJ: Humanities Press. 346 p. ISBN 0-391-03815-X]\nThis split was reflected in party members opinions about the\nVietnam Warand the New Left– Shachtman and his followers increasingly supported the war and greatly distrusted the New Left, Harrington was strongly opposed to the war, but was nevertheless suspicious of the New Left, while the Debs Caucus opposed the war and embraced the New Left. Conversely, of all the three groups, the Shachtmanitesmaintained the strongest tendency to Marxist orthodoxy (or their version of it) and democratic centralism, while the other two caucuses were more eclectic in their approach to socialism. This division manifest most strongly during the 1968 Democratic Convention, in which members of the Debs Caucus were among the protesters outside of the convention, while members of the Coalition and Unity Caucuses were among the convention delegates.\nBy 1972, the party was even more deeply divided, with the party newspaper, \"\nNew America\", running opposing articles on practically every issue. During the 1972 presidential election, each caucus supported a different candidate; the Debs Caucus supported the independent candidacy of Benjamin Spock, the Coalition Caucus supporting the liberal Democratic nominee George McGovern, and the Unity Caucus supporting the Democratic primary run of Henry M. \"Scoop\" Jackson, then declaring their neutrality between McGovern and Richard Nixonwhen Jackson failed to win the nomination.\nThe Debs Caucus finally broke with the party in 1972 to form the Union for Democratic Socialism. (David McReynolds had left the party in 1970, but rejoined the breakaway group.) The UDS became the\nSocialist Party USAin 1973 when all other factions had abandoned the name \"Socialist Party\". The Socialist Party USA developed into a small third party in U.S. politics, which now has about 1,000 members in good standing and regularly runs candidates for public office, though often these are more educational campaigns than they are serious attempts to win. [ [http://sp-usa.org/ncminutes/1006nc.html Minutes] of October 2006 Socialist Party National Committee meeting.]\nMichael Harrington and the Coalition Caucus left the party soon after. They became the\nDemocratic Socialist Organizing Committee(later the Democratic Socialists of America), which worked within the Democratic Party but in support of its left wing.\nThis left Shachtman and the Unity Caucus in unopposed control of the party (though Shachtman himself died very soon after). In 1973, this group renamed it the\nSocial Democrats USA. It evolved into more of a think tank than a political organization, with many of its members later holding important governmental offices in both Democratic and Republican administrations.\nEugene V.

Reorganizing in 1886, the association of unions changed its name to the American Federation of Labor (AFL) and elected Samuel Gompers (1850–1924) president.\nUnlike the open-membership policy of the Knights of Labor (from whom the AFL gained numerous members in 1886), the AFL determined to organize by craft: At the outset, its member unions included a total of 140,000 skilled laborers. Gompers, who immigrated from England in 1863 and became the first registered member of the Cigar-Makers’ International Union in 1864, had been active in labor for more than two decades. Once chosen as president of the AFL, Gompers remained in that office, with the exception of only one year, until his death in 1924. During the nearly 40-year period, he shaped the labor federation and helped it make strides by determining a general policy that allowed member unions autonomy. Unlike the Knights of Labor, which pursued long-term goals such as Knights leader Terence Powderly’s abstract objective of making “every man his own master—every man his own employer,” the AFL focused its efforts on specific, short-term goals such as higher wages, shorter hours, and the right to bargain collectively (when an employer agrees to negotiate with worker/union representatives).\nIn the 1890s the AFL was weakened by labor violence, which evoked public fears. A July 1892 strike at the Carnegie Steel plant in Homestead, Pennsylvania, turned into a riot between angry steelworkers and Pinkerton guards. The militia was called in to monitor the strike, which five months later ended in failure for the AFL-affiliated steel-workers. Nevertheless, under Gompers’s leadership, membership of the AFL grew to more than 1 million by 1901 and to 2.5 million by 1917, when it included 111 national unions and 27,000 local unions. The federation collected dues from its members, creating a fund to aid striking workers. The organization avoided party politics, instead seeking out and supporting advocates regardless of political affiliation. The AFL worked to support the establishment of the U.S. Department of Labor (1913), which administers and enforces statutes promoting the welfare and advancement of the American workforce, and the passage of the Clayton Anti-Trust Act (1914), which strengthened the Sherman Anti-Trust Act of 1890, eventually delivering a blow to monopolies.\nThe CIO was founded in 1938. In the early 1930s several AFL unions banded together as the Committee for Industrial Organization and successfully conducted campaigns to sign up new members in mass-production facilities such as the automobile, steel, and rubber industries. Since these initiatives (which resulted in millions of new members) were against the AFL policy of signing up only skilled laborers by craft (the CIO had reached out to all industrial workers, regardless of skill level or craft), a schism resulted within the AFL. The unions that had participated in the CIO membership drive were expelled from the AFL; the CIO established itself as a federation in 1938, officially changing its name to the Congress of Industrial Organizations.\nIn 1955, amidst a climate of increasing anti-unionism, the AFL and CIO rejoined to form one strong voice. Today the organization has craft and industrial affiliates at the international, national, state, and local levels, with membership totaling in the millions."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:544ba8a5-ab46-4f36-bb4e-9ba56d935aa3>","<urn:uuid:3d2baf32-2a1a-41ff-9e00-b3be5194022b>"],"error":null}
{"question":"As a web developer working on accessibility, I need to understand: what are the technical improvements for canvas accessibility in HTML5, and what privacy concerns arise from canvas fingerprinting?","answer":"The HTML5 Canvas API has been modified to improve accessibility through several technical enhancements: separation of caret and focus ring management, addition of setCaretSelectionPos API with x, y, w, h parameters for better magnifier positioning, removal of canDrawCustom property from DrawFocusRing, and addition of baseline property to TextMetrics. However, canvas elements also pose privacy risks through canvas fingerprinting, where websites can uniquely identify users by instructing browsers to draw hidden text or 3D graphics that generate unique digital tokens. These tokens can be combined with other data like installed fonts, plugins, and screen resolution to create user profiles for tracking across affiliated websites.","context":["Modify existing Canvas 2D API caret and focus ring support to drive screen magnification\nModify the Canvas 2D API to properly handle caret, selection position, and focus rings to assist screen magnification products to support users with low vision in using canvas.\nThe existing Canvas 2D API specification provides an API called DrawFocusRing() that has incomplete support for screen magnification tracking of focus rings, carets, and content selection. In speaking with some magnifier vendors they need access to the caret or selection position rectangle (constituting an edge) as well as the accessibility semantics of the corresponding object in the fallback content. The text in DrawFocusRing states minimal text that refers to a caret: \"The given coordinate is used if the user's attention needs to be brought to a particular position (e.g. if a magnifier is following the editing caret in a text field).\"\nAuthors should be forced to follow system settings as these are set by a user based out of personal preference. Personal preferences are set for a variety of reasons, the most serious being that the user simply cannot use the application because of an impairment. To address this issue government procurement standards, such as 508, require applications to support system font and color settings. If your application does not comply you fail purchasing requirements. It should be noted that, in our proposal, if no system setting has been set for focus ring then the drawFocusRing simply draws along the path as the author specified while at the same time updating the magnifier based on the focus ring.\nThe existing specification suffers from the following deficiencies.\n- DrawFocusRing is a single API that is intended to drive both drawing of a focus ring while providing a caret position. Accessibility API services for caret position and focus rings are separate APIs as developers don't draw the caret and focus ring at the same time. Consequently, the API for each needs to be separated out.\n- DrawFocusRing does not ensure that the focus ring, drawn, allows the browser to follow focus ring conventions for the OS platform that may also reflect user's preferences. It allows the author to execute a separate drawing function that would cause the author to draw focus using the standard drawing path but not drive magnification when that occurs. If the author sets canDrawCustom to true and the operating system has not specified out a focus ring is to be drawn, that drawing is turned over to the author. Therefore the specification allows the author to draw focus without driving magnification.\n- Although DrawFocusRing provides for a caret position the user agent does not know whether it is supporting a caret position or a focus ring. The x, y attributes are required.\n- DrawFocusRing, in the current specification, only allows the author to provide a point. At large magnification levels (4x-20x) a magnifier also needs to use the height and width of the caret, to be able to properly center the content in the screen. This was verified when speaking with Freedom scientific.\n- DrawFocusRing does not address magnifier tracking of user content selection in canvas. Canvas authors will want to allow for content selection. Some user agents, like Internet Explorer, support caret tracking during selection whereas others, like Safari on the Mac, treat the selection position as a separate entity.\n- DrawFocusRing's caret position support does not allow for an author to acquire caret blink rate settings that may have been set to prevent seizures.\n- The existing DrawFocusRing text does not provide any guidance to user agent manufacturers as to how to use the necessary information to support accessibility API services.\n- In the situation where we are dealing with text content, it is essential that we be able to access the text's baseline in order to properly compute the drawing path for a caret, selection position, or focus ring. This information is not provided in the canvas 2D API specification and requires additional computation.\nIn speaking with both Freedom Scientific and AI Squared both companies expressed the need to be able to track caret and focus ring changes. Browsers, like Internet Explorer 9, are using Direct2D on Windows and eliminating the ability to capture their traditional display driver or GDI drawing call interception techniques to capture the caret and the focus ring. On other platforms there is no vehicle to capture the draw these drawing calls. Furthermore, many believe this change is only meant to target rich text editing but in actual fact it is not. Canvas developers will at times introduce a caret or provide for content selection. Programmatic access is essential to drive magnification.\nWe have introduce modifications to the Canvas 2D API Specification that are enumerated here:\n- moved to setting of the caret and selection position to a separate API from DrawFocusRing to a separate API called setCaretSelectionPos that takes x, y, w, h parameters to define the caret selection position being reported to the browser to pass on the the platform accessibility API services. The additional width and height of the caret will allow user agents to better assist screen magnifiers in positioning the zoom position at large magnification levels with combined with the semantic information provided by the corresponding element passed from fallback content.\n- removed the optional canDrawCustom property from DrawFocusRing. The author should already have already integrated the custom drawing scheme into the drawing path. Furthermore, even if the system is able to draw the FocusRing it needs the drawing path to compute the path of the focus ring. Also, if the system has not configured the system in a current manner, returning false and passing the drawing function off to the author will cause the author to draw the focus ring without telling the magnifier where it is.\n- modified drawFocusRing to provide user agents with information on how to use the drawing path to drive magnifiers for focus ring. More complete details will that address API or platform specific issues will need to be addressed in the HTML to Platform Accessibility APIs Mapping Guide.\n- Separated Focus and Caret Selection Management into two separate sections. Not all selected content has to receive focus.\n- Added a function to get the caret blink rate to reflect system settings set by users that may have been done to prevent seizures.\n- Added the property baseline to TextMetrics to acquire the baseline of text.\n- Re-wrote code example, emphasizing the fallback content as an accessible shadow DOM, that was in section 10 and moved it to section 11 of the specification. The previous code was non-executable.\nThe impact to the specification is minor and it minimizes the impact to authors while producing a more reliably accessible solution.\n- Provides for both screen magnifier tracking of caret and selection position changes on canvas separate from focus rings to allow a user agent to drive the appropriate platform accessibiity APIs.\n- This is a much better solution than Proposed here in response to Issues 74 and 75, listed under Issue 105, as we completely separate caret and selection accessibility support from drawFocusRing().\n- Provides the ability for the author to query system caret blink rate settings so that they may avoid causing seizures as a result of high blink rates.\n- Changes the caret information provided to a screen magnifier to include width and height information to aid magnifiers in zooming around a caret or selection position.\n- Caret and Selection position APIs are lite weight. The APIs support screen magnification without restricting the user's drawing ability. This also allows this same API to drive magnification zooming when the author wants to draw the magnifier zoom to other drawing constructs.\n- Fixes the loop holes in drawFocusRing() that could allow an author to not direct the screen magnifier to the focus ring\n- Provides a vehicle to get the baseline for text, as requested in defect 11342 to facilitate focus ring drawing an caret/selection positioning in and around text\n- Caret and Selection are not integrated with actual drawing. However, it is questionable that we could produce something that is rich enough for canvas\n- Although outside the scope of this issue, this proposal does not address another need for screen magnification involving conveying screen screen coordinates of all content rendered from the fallback content on canvas. We have not yet come up with a way to do this without considerable impact to authors. One way to do this would be to provide an API here in the Canvas 2D API specification. This could be addressed in a later version after last call for HTML 5.\n- HTML Canvas 2D Context\n- Modifications to 2D Context (earlier version but still applicable)\n- Bug 11342 Request to expose text baseline in TextMetrics\n- Bug 11239 Canvas support accessible caret tracking independent of Focus Ring tracking (with refrence to code to implement Bug 11342\n- Click in the window, Shift space to Zoom.

Most of the code was on websites that use AddThis’ social media sharing tools.

{"question":"How did Frank Basloe's and James Naismith's early experiences with basketball differ?","answer":"Frank Basloe and James Naismith had very different early experiences with basketball. Basloe grew up playing basketball on the south side of Herkimer at the turn of the 20th century, initially idolizing local basketball stars and carrying their bags to games. At age 16 in 1903, he left school to promote and play basketball with Basloe's Globetrotters across many states. In contrast, Naismith invented the game while working at the Springfield YMCA Training School, drawing inspiration from a childhood game called Duck on the Rock that he played in Bennies' Corners. He went on to become a Physical Education Director, Campus Chaplain, and Basketball Coach at the University of Kansas, where he remained from 1898 until his retirement in 1938.","context":["Associate Professor Michael Antonucci of Keene State College in New Hampshire will present a book talk from 6 to 9 p.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 30, at the Frank J. Basloe Library in Herkimer to discuss the significance of Frank J. Basloe’s basketball memoir “I Grew Up With Basketball.”\nThis book was written in 1952 and has been out of print for years. Through Antonucci’s efforts, it has been published again by the University of Nebraska Press. He has written the introduction.\nBasloe immigrated to Herkimer from Vienna, Austria, in 1891 at the age of four. By then, the rules and equipment used for the game of basketball were already being developed in Herkimer by YMCA director Lambert Will. In 1890, Will was sent information from Dr. James Naismith about a game he invented at the Springfield YMCA. Teams threw balls into peach baskets to score points. They used leather balls, and these would be rolled, thrown, passed, bounced or kicked, similar to the game of rugby.\nWill and his early Herkimer YMCA team developed the rules, court layout, player positions (forwards, guards and centers), prototype uniforms, hoops, backboards and nets that became used and perfected in modern basketball. Notably, the ball could only be passed, thrown and bounced due to play on hardwood floors. The game was divided into two 24 periods because the peach baskets would have to be replaced after that length of time. This rule was used for many years and still applies in college basketball. The world’s first basketball game was played on Feb. 7, 1891 at the Herkimer YMCA, between the Herkimer Businessmen’s Nine and the YMCA Nine teams. There was much local interest in the game, and other teams rapidly formed in the region and eventually across the Northeast. These teams requested and used Will’s rules.\nBasloe grew up playing basketball on the south side of Herkimer at the turn of the 20th century. He idolized the local basketball stars, carrying their bags to games and playing exhibition games with other local children. In 1903, at the age of 16, he left school to promote and play basketball across many states with Basloe’s Globetrotters. Until the 1920s and the advent of the New York Original Celtics, New York Renaissance and the Harlem Globetrotters, Basloe’s clubs reigned supreme among barnstormers. With his persistent effort and love of the sport, he helped establish basketball nationwide.\n“I Grew Up With Basketball” chronicles the earliest days and players of American basketball.\nAntonucci discovered Basloe’s book while doing research and realized its importance.\n“One of the great things about it is that it illustrates how sport is a kind of American frontier and even a great equalizer. ‘I Grew Up With Basketball’ reminds us that basketball — more than baseball prior to the Second World War — was a democratizing force that brought fans, players and anyone associated with the game into contact with people unlike themselves,” he said.\nPage 2 of 2 - “What makes Basloe so interesting as a figure is his ability to read people and situations and make the best of them. Throughout the book, circumstances aren’t always moving in a direction that he wants, but he seems to find a way to make them work out as well as they can. There’s something instructive in this, particularly in the context of a sports world driven by perfection,” Antonucci added.\nAccording to Library Director Lesley Paul, the Frank J. Basloe Library was named for Basloe in 1974.\n“The Basloe family donated funds to renovate and furnish the building when the library was moved to 245 N. Main St. They wished to dedicate it to Mr. Basloe, who had passed away in 1966,” she said.\n“The library trustees and I are very pleased to present this book talk by Michael Antonucci. We’re thrilled that Frank J. Basloe’s book is back in print. It’s filled with facts, anecdotes, illustrations and players’ names. Many of the families still reside in the area. This is important American history that took place right here. It also fuels the debate about the true origins of basketball. According to the Basketball Hall of Fame, Dr. Naismith invented the game. This is true, however, Basloe provides evidence that nearly every aspect of the game as we know it now was developed in Herkimer and the first game was played in Herkimer. I am hoping that people who remember Mr. Basloe and the early local players will be able to attend this book talk and share their memories. It would be great if they could bring old photos or basketball memorabilia,” Paul added.\nCopies of the book will be available for sale and may also be purchased on Amazon.com.","Dr. James Naismith\nAlso Watch: “FAST BREAK” – Dr. Naismith\nOn 24 Jul 2011, a heroic-sized statue of Dr. James Naismith, the inventor of basketball and native son of Ramsay township, ON, was unveiled in Centennial Square in downtown Almonte.\nBorn in Ramsay Township (in Lanark County in Eastern Ontario, just west of the City of Ottawa) on 6 Nov 1861, James was the eldest son of Scottish immigrants John and Margaret Naismith. In 1869, the family moved to Grand Calumet where his father began work as a saw hand. He was orphaned at age nine, when his parents contracted typhoid fever while working in the milling community. When their grandmother died in 1872, the Naismith children, Annie, James and Robbie, were left under the care of their uncle, Peter Young, back in Ramsay. James attended the one-room schoolhouse in Bennies’ Corners. He was known in the neighbourhood as a strong and skillful boy, but at school his monthly report cards showed poor grades. Although not the head of his class in academics, he was a leader among his peers in all physical activities and showed signs of becoming a fine athlete. James attended high school in Almonte, ON.\nDespite the burden of farm duties, there was also time for play. In Bennies’ Corners, the local blacksmith shop was the gathering spot for the children. Here they enjoyed watching the blacksmith work his materials and playing in the sugarbush behind the shop. Where a tree or boulder served as a convenient base, they played variations of tag and hide-and-seek or tried their skill at Duck on the Rock – a game which combined throwing with tag using a large base stone to be guarded by the one player. This stone sat in the blacksmith’s yard adjacent to the Bennies’ Corners school. Players formed a line from a distance of 15-20 feet from the base stone. Each player used a fist-sized stone. The object was to dislodge the “guards” stone from the top of the base stone, by throwing and taking turns.\nAfter graduating from Almonte High School, he attended McGill University. Jim headed for McGill’s gymnasium where he soon began participating in the gymnastic and rugby program. By his junior year, he was winning the university’s highest honours for his athletic involvement. Jim had time for extracurricular interests, joining the student government and Literary Society for which he debated. In 1887, he was cited on the Prize and Honour List for having passed the Bachelor of Arts in Honours in philosophy and Hebrew. He graduated as one of the top ten in his class on 30 Apr 1887. After graduation, Jim enrolled in the largest theological school affiliated with McGill University, the Presbyterian College. To finance his education, he accepted an appointment as instructor of physical education in the gymnasium at McGill. Although James won theological scholarships, he dismayed colleagues and professors by continuing his involvement in athletics. Naismith learned of the YMCA International Training School in Springfield, MA, for the education of laymen-leaders of youth. Shortly thereafter, in the summer of 1890, Jim left the Presbyterian College as an non-ordained minister to pursue a career with an emphasis on physical education. Remembering Duck on a Rock and how successful the lobbed arcing shot proved, Naismith incorporated a set of rules for throwing a soccer ball aimed at two peach baskets, thus creating a new game of his design called “Basket Ball”. That was in 1891. Within a few years, this game caught on and was soon being played at other institutions.\nNaismith then embarked on a career in Physical Education through the YMCA, but took time out to earn his Medical Degree in 1989 while operating the Denver YMCA. This led him to accept the positions of Physical Education Director, Campus Chaplain and Basketball Coach at the University of Kansas. He remained there from 1898 until his retirement in 1938. He served twice in military conflict, including WWI in France. From time to time, Naismith returned to visit the area of his boyhood in Ramsay and Almonte, and maintained a long friendship with another famous “Ramsay son”, Tait McKenzie. Naismith saw his gift of basketball admitted as an official sport at the 1936 Berlin Olympics, which he felt was the highlight of his long career.\nHe died in Lawrence, KS, from heart trouble on 29 Nov 1939.\nThis article is taken from The Souvenir Program of the North Lanark Highland Games, Almonte, ON, 20 Aug 2011\n‘Dr. James Naismith’: The original rules of basketball:\nOn January 15, 1892 in Springfield, Massachusetts, the International Young Men’s Christian Association Training School (now Springfield College) newspaper The Triangle published the rules for a brand new game invented by physical education professor James Naismith. Naismith called it Basket Ball, which originally involved attaching a peach basket to a suspended board.\nDr. James Naismith’s Original 13 Rules of Basket Ball:\n- The ball may be thrown in any direction with one or both hands.\n- The ball may be batted in any direction with one or both hands (never with the fist).\n- A player cannot run with the ball. The player must throw it from the spot on which he catches it, allowance to be made for a man who catches the ball when running at a good speed if he tries to stop.\n- The ball must be held in or between the hands; the arms or body must not be used for holding it.\n- No shouldering, holding, pushing, tripping, or striking in any way the person of an opponent shall be allowed; the first infringement of this rule by any player shall count as a foul, the second shall disqualify him until the next goal is made, or, if there was evident intent to injure the person, for the whole of the game, no substitute allowed.\n- A foul is striking at the ball with the fist, violation of Rules 3,4, and such as described in Rule 5\n- If either side makes three consecutive fouls, it shall count a goal for the opponents (consecutive means without the opponents in the mean time making a foul).\n- A goal shall be made when the ball is thrown or batted from the grounds into the basket and stays there, providing those defending the goal do not touch or disturb the goal. If the ball rests on the edges, and the opponent moves the basket, it shall count as a goal.\n- When the ball goes out of bounds, it shall be thrown into the field of play by the person first touching it. In case of a dispute, the umpire shall throw it straight into the field. The thrower-in is allowed five seconds; if he holds it longer, it shall go to the opponent. If any side persists in delaying the game, the umpire shall call a foul on that side.\n- The umpire shall be judge of the men and shall note the fouls and notify the referee when three consecutive fouls have been made. He shall have power to disqualify men according to Rule 5.\n- The referee shall be judge of the ball and shall decide when the ball is in play, in bounds, to which side it belongs, and shall keep the time. He shall decide when a goal has been made, and keep account of the goals with any other duties that are usually performed by a referee.\n- The time shall be two 15-minute halves, with five minutes’ rest between.\n- The side making the most goals in that time shall be declared the winner. In case of a draw, the game may, by agreement of the captains, be continued until another goal is made.\nA Booster Paid $4.3 Million For Naismith’s Rules, Then KU Built This Palace For Them\nAfter KU alumnus David Booth purchased James Naismith’s original rules of basketball for a total of $4.3 million in 2010, the DeBruce Center was built adjacent to Allen Fieldhouse to house the\nhistoric two-page document. Narration by KU alumnus and television journalist Bill Kurtis.\nOnly Known Audio Recording Of James Naismith, Inventor Of Basketball\nKU professor discovers only known audio recording of James Naismith, inventor of basketball.\nIn 1939 radio interview, coach describes a rough-and-tumble first game.\nThere’s No Place Like Home\nOil and Gold: The McPherson Globe Refiners Basketball Story | Kansas Humanities Council"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:ad8f0280-a900-4120-8560-e06d7a8e8407>","<urn:uuid:910546d6-99a7-4c82-ac96-e1859aea4732>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How long does it take to re-fletch a carbon arrow shaft and what are the cost benefits? 🏹","answer":"In the beginning, re-fletching a carbon arrow shaft can take between 5-10 minutes, but with practice, it can be done in under 5 minutes. Re-fletching your own arrows is cost-effective in the long term, as replacing perfectly good arrows just because of damaged fletching isn't cost efficient. For reference, a dozen high-end carbon arrows can cost between 100 to 200 dollars depending on the brand.","context":["Archery is a technical sport with many disciplines such as 3d target, competition, and hunting. As a beginner in the sport, you can go to any retail store that sells archery equipment and buy a dozen low-grade carbon arrow shafts that are pre-fletched. Those arrows will get the job done in terms of developing your form and technique, but they are limited in accuracy because of the straightness of the shaft and fletching. A dozen high-end carbon arrows can range from 100 to 200 dollars depending on the brand and greatly improve your accuracy. With use over time, vanes will begin to peel off, get sliced by broadheads, and become deformed. These accidents have a huge impact on arrow flight and should be fixed immediately. Replacing a perfectly good arrow because of damaged fletching isn’t cost effective. Fletching your own arrow is a cost-effective process that will save money in the long term and increase accuracy. The instructions below are a platform for beginners to get started on how to re-fletch a three-vane carbon arrow.\nThe materials needed are:\n· Carbon arrow shaft (any brand)\n· Arrow fletching tool (Bitzenburger, EZ Fletch)\n· Vane stripper (Dull box cutter, dull razor blades)\n· Vanes (any brand)\n· Super glue (any brand)\n· Q tips\n· Alcohol wipes (rubbing alcohol, acetone with a clean paper towel will work too)\n· Clean surface to work on (mouse pad, bench)\nStep 1: Stripping the Shaft\na. Grip the end of the shaft close to the base of the vanes with your palms facing up. (the working end with the vanes should be on the same side as your thumb)\nb. Firmly grasp the vane stripper in your free hand.\nc. Place the vane stripper at the base of the vane and drive it away from your body while applying a little downward pressure. (be careful not to damage the carbon)\nd. Continue this process until all vanes on the shaft are completely removed.\nStep 2: Prepping the Arrow Shaft\na. Use the alcohol wipes to clean the working end of the shaft where the vanes were stripped off. (do not touch the cleaned part of the shaft after cleaning)\nStep 3: Prepping the Arrow Fletching Jig\na. Place the shaft, with the nock first, firmly into the base of the arrow jig. (nock allows the shaft to be turned to accept the next vane)\nb. Place the bigger end of a single vane at the black mark. (ensure vane is flush against the clamp edge like the picture)\nc. Slide it onto the jig to ensure complete vane to shaft contact.\nStep 4: Prepping the Vanes\na. Apply some rubbing alcohol on a clean paper towel.\nb. With the paper towel/alcohol wipes, clean the entire base of the vane from end to end. (creates a better surface for adhesion)\nStep 5: Fletching the Shaft\na. Remove the vane clamp from the jig.\nb. Insert a cleaned vane into the vane clamp so it is completely flush. (Reference step 3b)\nc. Apply a thin, continuous strip of glue along the entire length of the vane. (a little glue goes a long way)\nd. Place the vane clamp back on the jig. (Ensure the bottom of the clamp is on top of the nock receiving base)\ne. Ensure complete vane to shaft contact. (use both hands to keep the jig from moving)\nf. Wipe off access glue with Q-tip.\ng. Let the glue set for 15 to 20 seconds.\nh. Carefully remove the clamp.\ni. Turn the nob at the base of the jig counter clockwise to accept the next vane.\nj. Repeat steps A through H until the shaft is completely fletched. (3, 4, 6 vane possibility depending on the archer)\nStep 6: Tipping and Tailing\na. Place a dab of super glue on the front and rear of all the vanes where it contacts the arrow shaft. (this prevents vanes from peeling when passing through objects)\nb. Allow the glue to cure for 15 to 20 seconds.\nStep 7: Inspect Completed Arrow\na. Remove the finished shaft from the fletching jig.\nb. Ensure all vanes are flush against the shaft without any gaps or lifting.\nc. Gently lift the arrow a couple of inches by each individual vane to confirm adhesion. (the whole arrow doesn’t have to be suspended in air)\nStep 8: Completely Fletched Arrows\nThese steps are the basics of re-fletching a three-vane carbon arrow. In the beginning, re-fletching a carbon arrow shaft can take between 5-10 minutes. With practice, a shaft can be re-fletched in under 5 minutes. Not only will money be saved in the long term, but accuracy will also be improved. Whatever your discipline in archery is; be safe, have fun, and keep on flinging arrows."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:25d5c7ec-5d2a-45bd-b495-f23ee0986c13>"],"error":null}

Thus, in hot and humid conditions, the density altitude at a particular location may be significantly higher than the true altitude.\nAir density is perhaps the single most important factor affecting aircraft performance. It has a direct bearing on:\n- The lift generated by the wings — reduction in air density reduces the wing's lift.\n- The efficiency of the propeller or rotor — which for a propeller (effectively an airfoil) behaves similarly to lift on wings.\n- The power output of the engine — power output depends on oxygen intake, so the engine output is reduced as the equivalent \"dry air\" density decreases and produces even less power as moisture displaces oxygen in more humid conditions.\nAircraft taking off from a \"hot and high\" airport such as the Quito Airport or Mexico City are at a significant aerodynamic disadvantage. The following effects result from a density altitude which is higher than the actual physical altitude:\n- The aircraft will accelerate slower on takeoff as a result of reduced power production.\n- The aircraft will need to achieve a higher true airspeed to attain the same lift - this implies both a longer takeoff roll and a higher true airspeed which must be maintained when airborne to avoid stalling.\n- The aircraft will climb slower as the result of reduced power production and lift.\nDue to these performance issues, a plane's takeoff weight may need to be lowered or takeoffs may need to be scheduled for cooler times of the day. Wind direction and runway slope may need to be taken into account.\nDensity altitude can be calculated from atmospheric pressure and temperature (assuming dry air).\n- DA = density altitude in feet\n- P = atmospheric (static) pressure\n- PSL = standard sea level atmospheric pressure (1013.25 hPa ISA or 29.92126 US))\n- T = true (static) air temperature in kelvins (K) [add 273.15 to the Celsius (°C)] figure\n- TSL = ISA standard sea level air temperature in kelvins (K) (288.15 K)\n- b = 0.234969\nNational Weather Service Equation\nThe National Weather Service uses the following dry-air approximation of the above equation in their standards.\n- DA = density altitude in feet\n- P = Is the station pressure (atmospheric static pressure) in inches of mercury (inHg)\n- T = T is the station temperature (atmospheric temperature) in Fahrenheit (F)\nNote that the NWS standard specifies that the density altitude should be rounded to the nearest 100 feet.\nEasy formula to calculate density altitude from pressure altitude\nThis is an easier formula to calculate (with great approximation) density altitude from pressure altitude ..and International Standard Atmosphere temperature deviation\n- Density altitude in feet = pressure altitude in feet + (120 x (OAT - ISA_temperature))\n- OAT = Outside air temperature in °C\n- ISA_temperature = 15 °C - (1.98 °C/1000 ft × actual altitude in thousands of feet)\nReferences and notes\n- Air Navigation.

{"question":"Between soil drainage and regular watering, which is more crucial for crocus growth?","answer":"Soil drainage is more crucial for crocus growth. Both documents emphasize the importance of well-drained soil, with Document 1 stating that good drainage is essential to prevent bulb rot and Document 2 specifically listing 'well-drained, loose soil' as a primary growing condition for crocus. While Document 2 mentions regular watering to keep soil slightly moist, it's presented as secondary to the fundamental requirement of proper drainage.","context":["Spring flowering bulbs such as tulips, daffodils, hyacinths and crocuses add lots of color and visual enjoyment to early spring flower beds. These flowers are among the first to appear in spring and signal that cold weather is on the way out.\nIn our area spring flowering bulbs need to be planted in the fall. They can be planted from October through late December, but the best time is the first or second week of November. If temperatures are too high, above 70 degrees Fahrenheit, the flower bud can be damaged. Planting later in the winter can prove difficult if the ground is frozen. If you cannot plant your bulbs after purchasing store them in a cool, dry, dark place until planting. The bottom drawer of a refrigerator works well.\nBefore breaking the soil select high quality bulbs. Choose only bulbs that are firm, unblemished and are medium to large in size. Avoid bulbs that are moldy, soft, discolored or lightweight. If ordering by mail or internet, order from a reputable company to ensure a quality product. Be wary of planting bulbs that have been stored in less than desirable conditions. For example, bulbs purchased last season that have been stored in the garage may not produce flowering plants. In choosing medium/large sized bulbs, remember there is difference in size according to bulb type. For example, tulip bulbs are much larger than crocus bulbs and a large tulip bulb is generally healthier than a small tulip bulb. There is a direct correlation between the quality and size of the bulb and the size of the flower it produces. Large bulbs will produce large flowers or multiple flowers. Medium grade bulbs will produce flowers that are satisfactory.\nAfter bulb selection, plant the bulbs as soon as temperatures are amenable. The first step is to prepare the soil. Till the soil for the entire bed site. Fertilize and lime the soil based on a soil sample. A soil pH of 6.0 to 6.8 is best for most bulbs. In the absence of a soil test, add 1 to 2 pounds of 5-10-10, 10-10-10 or 8-8-8 fertilizer per 100 square feet of bed space. Incorporate lime, fertilizer and any soil amendments thoroughly and deeply, at least 12 inches, to ensure the bulbs receive the nutrients. Most bulbous plants prefer a moist, well-drained, sandy loam that does not remain wet and sticky after heavy rain or dry out too quickly. Good drainage is essential to ensure the bulbs do not rot.\nAfter the soil is prepared, the next challenge is spacing the bulbs in the bed area. Depending on the plant type, bulbs may need to be spaced farther apart to allow for growth. Follow grower instructions for specific spacing recommendations. Remember bulbs can spread over a large area of the bed and dividing them may prove difficult. The closer they are planted the more often they will have to be divided. Also, some types of bulbs need dividing sooner than others. When dividing bulbs, wait until the foliage has died back before digging. When planting, try to avoid spotty or line-out arrangements. Mass plantings will give the best overall look, especially with proper spacing.\nDepth is also important when planting bulbs. A general rule of thumb is to plant at a depth two to three times the diameter for bulbs two inches or more in diameter. For bulbs that are smaller than two inches, plant at a depth three to four times the diameter. The bulb grower also supplies a recommended depth for their product on product packaging.\nAfter planting the bulbs, apply a good layer of mulch. Mulch helps protect the plants and reduce weeds in the bed.\nBulbs can produce flowers for years with very little care, but only if they are started out right. Planting bulbs this fall can make for a great surprise of color in early spring.","As a gardener, it can be immensely rewarding to see the beauty of a garden in full bloom.

What is the best time of year to plant crocus bulbs?\nPlanting crocus bulbs is one of the best ways to add a little bit of color to your garden. But when is the best time of year to plant these beautiful flowers? This article will provide step-by-step information about the best time of year to plant crocus bulbs for gardeners.\nThe best time of year to plant crocus bulbs is during the fall season. This is because the bulbs need a period of cold dormancy in order to bloom properly in the spring. Planting them too early in the fall may result in the flowers blooming prematurely in the winter. The ideal time to plant crocus bulbs is usually between late October and late November, depending on the climate of your area.\nThe next step is to prepare the soil. Crocus bulbs prefer well-draining soil, so it is important to make sure that the soil is not too compacted. Dig a small hole for each bulb that is about two to three inches deep. Place the bulb in the hole with the pointy end facing up. Then cover it with soil and gently pat it down.\nWhen planting crocus bulbs, it is important to space them out properly. Plant them about three to four inches apart from each other. This will ensure that the flowers have enough room to grow and will look their best when they bloom in the spring.\nFinally, after planting the crocus bulbs, water them lightly. This will help to ensure that the soil is properly hydrated and that the bulbs are given the best chance to thrive.\nBy following these simple steps, gardeners can have beautiful crocus flowers blooming in their garden come springtime. With the right timing and preparation, these delicate flowers can bring a little bit of color to any garden.\nYou may want to see also\n2. What soil nutrients are necessary for successful crocus growth?\nCrocus is a widely popular flower that is easy to grow. However, in order to ensure successful growth and healthy blooms, it is important to provide the right soil nutrients. This article will provide gardeners with step-by-step information and examples of the necessary soil nutrients for successful crocus growth.\nThe first step is to make sure that the soil is well-draining. Crocus prefer soils that are high in organic matter, as this helps to retain moisture while also allowing for adequate drainage. If the soil is too wet, the corms may rot and the plants may not grow.\nNext, it is important to ensure that the soil contains the necessary nutrients for crocus growth. These nutrients include nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and calcium. Nitrogen is important for healthy foliage growth, phosphorus helps with root development, and potassium allows for disease resistance. Calcium is important for the formation of strong cell walls, which will help the plant to resist environmental stress.\nIn order to provide these necessary nutrients, it is important to regularly fertilize the soil. A balanced fertilizer is ideal, as it will contain the right proportions of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. An example of a balanced fertilizer is 10-10-10. This means that the fertilizer contains 10% nitrogen, 10% phosphorus, and 10% potassium. It is important to follow the instructions on the fertilizer label when applying the product.\nFinally, it is important to make sure that the soil pH is in the ideal range for crocus growth. Crocus grow best in soils with a pH between 6.0 and 7.0. If the soil pH is lower than 6.0, the plants may not be able to access the necessary nutrients, leading to poor growth. A soil test can help to determine the pH of the soil and any necessary adjustments can be made with soil amendments.\nBy following these steps, gardeners can ensure that the soil contains all of the necessary nutrients for successful crocus growth. Taking the time to provide the right soil nutrients and pH will lead to healthy, vibrant blooms.\nYou may want to see also\n3. How much light should crocus plants receive?\nCrocus plants are delicate and beautiful flowers that can bring life and color to your garden. For the plants to thrive and bloom, it is important to give them the right amount of light. In general, crocus plants need between six to eight hours of direct light per day.\nWhen choosing a place to plant your crocus, look for an area that receives full sun. This means that the area should receive direct sunlight for at least six hours each day. If the area only receives partial sun, then the crocus plants may not flower as well. If you have a shady area, you may want to consider planting a different type of flower that can tolerate the lower light levels.\nIn addition to the amount of light, you will also need to consider the intensity of the light. Crocus plants need bright light but should not be exposed to intense sunlight during the hottest parts of the day. If you live in a region with hot, dry summers, you should try to provide the plants with some shade during the hottest hours of the day.\nWhen it comes to watering, you will want to make sure that the soil is kept moist but not overly wet. You can water your crocus plants about once or twice per week, depending on the weather and the amount of rainfall your area receives. In general, crocus plants prefer soil that is evenly moist but not overly wet.\nFinally, you should keep in mind that crocus plants need cool temperatures in order to bloom. For best results, the plants should be kept in temperatures between 50-70 degrees Fahrenheit. If you live in an area with warm summers, you may want to consider planting the crocus flowers in a container so that you can move them inside during the hottest months of the year.\nBy following these tips, you can ensure that your crocus plants get the light and care that they need. With the right amount of light, water, and temperature, your crocus plants will thrive and bring your garden to life with their vibrant colors and beauty.\nYou may want to see also\n4. How often should crocus plants be watered?\nCrocus plants are a popular choice for gardeners, due to their vibrant colors and easy maintenance. While crocus plants are relatively low maintenance, it is important to understand the amount and frequency of watering that is required for optimal growth and flowering.\nIn general, crocus plants should be watered on a weekly basis, as long as the weather is not too hot and dry. The frequency of watering may need to be adjusted depending on the weather conditions in your area. For example, if it is a particularly hot and dry summer, you may need to water your crocus plants more frequently. During the winter months, when temperatures are colder, you will need to water your crocus plants less frequently.\nWhen watering your crocus plants, make sure to water them thoroughly, but not too much. Over-watering can cause root rot, which can lead to death of the plant. To ensure that your crocus plants are getting enough water, dig a few inches into the soil and check the moisture level. If the soil is dry, then it is time to water your plants.\nIn addition to the frequency of watering, it is important to understand the type of water that should be used for crocus plants. Tap water is generally fine, but if you want to ensure optimal growth, it is a good idea to use filtered or rainwater. Rainwater is ideal, as it contains no salt or chlorine, which can be damaging to the plant.\nTo sum it up, crocus plants should be watered on a weekly basis, unless the weather is particularly hot and dry, in which case more frequent watering may be needed. Make sure to not over-water your plants, and use filtered or rainwater for optimal results. With proper care and maintenance, your crocus plants should be blooming for years to come.\nYou may want to see also\n5. What pests or diseases should be monitored when growing crocus?\nGrowing crocus is a beautiful and rewarding way to bring a bit of color to your garden. However, just like any other plant, crocus can be affected by pests and diseases, so it is important to monitor your plants for these issues. Here are some of the pests and diseases that you should be on the lookout for when growing crocus.\nThe most common pest that affects crocus is the onion fly (Delia antiqua). The larvae of this fly feed on the leaves and stems of crocus plants, causing them to turn yellow and die. The best way to prevent the onion fly from affecting your crocus is to keep the area around the plant free of weeds, as the onion fly is attracted to weedy areas.\nAnother pest that affects crocus is the onion thrips (Thrips tabaci). This pest feeds on the flower buds, causing them to become deformed and discolored. The best way to prevent onion thrips from affecting your crocus is to keep the area around the plant free of debris, as the thrips are attracted to decaying organic matter.\nIn terms of disease, the most common one that affects crocus is the fungus Fusarium oxysporum. This fungus is spread by water, and it causes the stems and leaves of crocus plants to turn yellow and die. The best way to prevent this fungus from affecting your crocus is to water your plants at the base instead of over the top, as this will reduce the amount of water that comes in contact with the foliage.\nFinally, you should also be on the lookout for certain bacterial diseases. These include bacterial leaf spot (Xanthomonas campestris) and bacterial soft rot (Erwinia carotovora). Both of these can cause the leaves and stems of your crocus plants to turn yellow and die. To reduce the risk of these bacterial diseases, make sure to water your plants at the base, remove any diseased foliage, and avoid overcrowding plants.\nBy monitoring your crocus plants for these pests and diseases, you can ensure that your plants stay healthy and vibrant for many years to come.\nYou may want to see also\nFrequently asked questions\nThe best time to plant crocus is in late summer or early autumn.\nCrocus corms should be planted two to three inches deep.\nTwo to three inches of space should be left between each crocus corm.\nCrocus plants should be watered once a week, or when the soil feels dry to the touch.\nCrocus plants prefer well-draining soil with a neutral pH level."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:3f9622a9-3050-4ea9-aaac-23aae4937099>","<urn:uuid:6935ea10-aa04-4669-be0a-1dd9d23793a6>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Hi, I'm concerned about my mobility - what's the main difference between fall risks in diabetes-related neuropathy vs multiple sclerosis?","answer":"In diabetes-related peripheral neuropathy, fall risk primarily stems from reduced sensory and motor neuron excitability, leading to coarsened proprioceptive thresholds and distal muscle atrophy. This particularly affects the ability to handle perturbations during walking. In multiple sclerosis, difficulty walking occurs due to multiple factors including numbness of legs/feet, balance problems, muscle weakness, and muscle spasticity. Additionally, the overwhelming fatigue that affects 80% of MS patients can contribute to walking difficulties. Both conditions can lead to injuries from falls, but they have different underlying mechanisms affecting mobility.","context":["Seeks Distal symmetric polyneuropathy boosts fall risk because of inability to\nSeeks Distal symmetric polyneuropathy boosts fall risk because of inability to handle perturbations. with specific APrT and better hip RTG enabling maintenance of stage length.

Keywords: Peripheral neuropathy sensorimotor features gait falls proprioception muscles strength Launch The World Wellness Organization observed a prevalence of Diabetes Mellitus (DM) of 171 million people in the entire year 2000 and forecasted a rise to 366 million by 2030. The condition is more prevalent in developed countries generally. Including the lifetime threat of developing diabetes in america for those blessed in calendar year 2000 is approximately 40% for girls and 30% for guys. It really is grasped that type 2 DM network marketing leads to early mortality aswell as retinopathy nephropathy neuropathy and accelerated macro vascular illnesses. Therapies that normalize glycemia are believed to prevent era and/or delay development of such problems. The most frequent non-pharmacologic methods to improve glycemic control are weight exercise and loss. Exercise has an additive impact when coupled with caloric limitation and it’s been suggested that sufferers should take part in at least 150 a few minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic fitness exercise per week. Many workout regimens feature strolling and it’s been shown a strolling program increases the metabolic profile of sufferers with type 2 DM. Although prevalence varies peripheral neuropathy (PN) is certainly common in sufferers with type 2 DM. A 2007 French research discovered an 11% prevalence of PN in adults with GW842166X DM while a 1999-2000 USA research observed a 28.5% GW842166X prevalence in people that have DM aged 40 years and older .

Due to the nature of the disease, it can vary widely from one person to another. The symptoms can change in severity from year to year, month to month, and even day to day.\nTwo of the most common symptoms are fatigue and difficulty walking.\nAbout 80 percent of people with MS report having fatigue. Fatigue that occurs with MS is more than feeling tired. It can become debilitating, affecting your ability to work and perform everyday tasks.\nDifficulty walking can occur with MS for a number of reasons:\n- numbness of the legs or feet\n- difficulty balancing\n- muscle weakness\n- muscle spasticity\nOverwhelming fatigue can also contribute to the problem. Difficulty walking can lead to injuries due to falling.\nOther fairly common symptoms of MS include:\n- speech disorders\n- cognitive issues involving concentration, memory, and problem-solving skills\n- acute or chronic pain\nPart 2 of 11\nWhat is multiple sclerosis?\nMS is a chronic illness involving the central nervous system. The immune system attacks myelin, which is the protective layer around nerve fibers. This causes inflammation and scar tissue, or lesions. This can make it hard for your brain to send signals to the rest of your body. Types of MS include:\nRelapsing-remitting MS (RRMS)\nRRMS involves clear relapses of disease activity followed by remissions. Symptoms are mild or absent during remission, and there’s no disease progression during the remission period. RRMS is the most common form of MS at onset.\nClinically isolated syndrome (CIS)\nCIS involves one episode of symptoms that are due to demyelination in the central nervous system. This episode must last for at least 24 hours.\nThe two types of episodes are monofocal and multifocal. A monofocal episode means one lesion causes one symptom. A multifocal episode means you have more than one lesion and more than one symptom.\nAlthough these episodes are characteristic of MS, they aren’t enough to prompt a diagnosis. If lesions similar to those that occur with MS are present, you’re more likely to receive a diagnosis of RRMS. If these lesions aren’t present, you’re less likely to develop MS.\nPrimary-progressive MS (PPMS)\nNeurological function becomes progressively worse from the onset of your symptoms if you have PPMS. However, short periods of stability can still occur.\nProgressive-relapsing MS was a term people previously used for progressive MS with clear relapses. People now call it PPMS. The words “active” and “not active” are used to describe disease activity.\nSecondary-progressive MS (SPMS)\nSPMS occurs when RRMS transitions into the progressive form. You may still have noticeable relapses, in addition to gradual worsening of function or disability.\nPart 3 of 11\nTreatment for multiple sclerosis\nNo cure is available for MS, but multiple treatment options exist.\nIf you have relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), you can choose one of the disease-modifying drugs. These medications are designed to slow disease progression and lower your relapse rate.\nSelf-injectable disease-modifying drugs include glatiramer (Copaxone, Glatopa) and beta interferons, such as:\nOral medications for RRMS include:\nIntravenous infusion treatments for RRMS include:\nDisease-modifying drugs aren’t effective in treating progressive MS.\nOther treatments may ease your symptoms and improve your quality of life. Because the disease is different for everybody, treatment depends on your specific symptoms. For most people, a flexible approach is necessary.\nPart 4 of 11\nEarly signs of MS\nMS can develop all at once, or the symptoms can be so mild that you easily dismiss them. Any symptom can occur first. The following are three of the most common early symptoms of MS:\n- Strange sensations, such as numbness and tingling of the arms, legs, or one side of your face can occur. It’s similar to that of feeling of pins and needles you get when your foot falls asleep, but it occurs for no apparent reason.\n- Your balance may be a bit off, and your legs may feel week. You may find yourself tripping easily while walking or doing some other type of physical activity.\n- A bout of double vision, blurry vision, or partial vision loss can be an early indicator of MS. You could also have some eye pain.\nIt isn’t uncommon for these early symptoms to go away only to return at a later date. You may go weeks, months, or even years between symptom flare-ups.\nThese symptoms can have many different causes. If you have these symptoms, it doesn’t necessarily mean that you have MS.\nPart 5 of 11\nYour doctor will need to perform a neurological exam, a clinical history, and a series of other tests to determine if you have MS.\nDiagnostic testing may include the following:\n- MRI is the best imaging test for MS. Using a contrast dye allows the MRI to detect active and inactive lesions throughout the brain and spinal cord.\n- Evoked potentials require stimulation of nerve pathways to analyze electrical activity in the brain. The three types of evoked potentials doctors use to help diagnose MS are visual, brainstem, and sensory.\n- A spinal tap, or lumbar puncture, can help your doctor find abnormalities in your spinal fluid. It can help rule out infectious diseases.\n- Doctors use blood tests to eliminate other conditions with similar symptoms.\nThe diagnosis of MS requires evidence of demyelination in more than one area of the brain, spinal cord, or optic nerves. That damage must have occurred at different times.\nIt also requires ruling out other conditions that have similar symptoms. This includes Lyme disease, lupus, and Sjogren's syndrome.\nPart 6 of 11\nWhat causes multiple sclerosis?\nIf you have MS, the myelin in your body becomes damaged. Myelin is the protective layer that covers nerve fibers throughout the central nervous system.\nIt’s thought that the damage is the result of an attack by the immune system. As your immune system attacks myelin, it causes inflammation. This leads to scar tissue, or lesions. All of that inflammation and scar tissue disrupts signals between the brain and other parts of your body.\nIt isn’t clear what may cause the immune system to attack.\nIs MS hereditary?\nMS isn’t hereditary, but having a parent or sibling with MS raises your risk slightly. Genetics may play a role. Scientists have identified some genes that seem to increase susceptibility to developing MS.\nResearchers think there could be an environmental trigger such as a virus or toxin that sets off the immune system attack.\nPart 7 of 11\nWhat is the prognosis for people with multiple sclerosis?\nIt’s almost impossible to predict how MS will progress in any one person.\nAbout 10 to 15 percent of people with MS have only rare attacks and minimal disability ten years after diagnosis. It’s not a medical diagnosis, but this is sometimes called “benign MS.”\nProgressive MS generally advances faster than relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). People with RRMS can be in remission for many years. A lack of disability after five years is usually a good indicator for the future.\nThe disease generally progresses faster in men than in women. It may also progress faster in those who receive a diagnosis after age 40 and in those who have a high relapse rate.\nAbout half of people with MS use a cane or other form of assistance at 15 years after receiving an MS diagnosis. At 20 years, about 60 percent are still ambulatory and less than 15 percent need custodial care.\nYour quality of life will depend on your symptoms and how well you respond to treatment. Most people with MS don’t become severely disabled and continue to lead full lives.\nThis unpredictable disease can change course without warning. It’s rarely fatal, and most people with MS have a lifespan that’s close to normal.\nPart 8 of 11\nLiving with MS\nMost people with MS find ways to manage their symptoms and function well. You’ll face unique challenges, and those can change over time. Many people with MS share their struggles and coping strategies through in-person or online support groups.\nHaving MS means you’ll need to see a doctor experienced in treating MS.\nIf you take one of the disease-modifying drugs, you’ll have to make sure you adhere to the recommended schedule. Your doctor may prescribe other medications to treat specific symptoms.\nA well-balanced diet, low in empty calories and high in nutrients and fiber, will help you manage your overall health.\nRegular exercise is important for physical and mental health, even if you have disabilities. If physical movement is difficult, swimming or exercising in a swimming pool can help. Yoga classes range from beginner to advanced levels, and some are designed just for people with MS.\nStudies regarding the effectiveness of complementary therapies are scarce, but that doesn’t mean they can’t help in some way.\nThe following may help you feel less stressed and more relaxed:\n- tai chi\n- music therapy\nMS is a lifelong condition. You should focus on communicating concerns with your doctor, learning all you can about MS, and discovering what things make you feel your best.\nPart 9 of 11\nDietary recommendations for people with MS\nDiet hasn’t been shown to impact the nature of the disease, but it can help with some of the challenges. If you have fatigue, for instance, a diet high in fats and simple carbohydrates won’t help.\nThe better your diet, the better your overall health. You’ll not only feel better in the short term, but you’ll be laying the foundation for a healthier future.\nYour diet should consist mainly of:\n- a variety of vegetables and fruits\n- lean sources of protein, such as fish and skinless poultry\n- whole grains and other sources of fiber\n- low-fat dairy products\n- adequate water and other fluids\nYou should limit or avoid:\n- saturated fat\n- trans fat\n- red meats\n- foods and beverages high in sugar\n- foods high in sodium\n- highly processed foods\nPortion control can help you maintain a healthier weight. Read food labels. Foods that are high in calories but low in nutrients won’t help you feel better.\nIf you have coexisting conditions, ask your doctor if you should follow a special diet or take any dietary supplements.\nPart 10 of 11\nStatistics about MS\nMS is the most widespread neurological condition disabling young adults worldwide.\nAbout 400,000 people in the United States have MS, though that’s only an estimate. Doctors in the United States aren’t required to report MS to any agency. According to the National MS Society, there hasn’t been a scientifically sound, national study on the prevalence of MS in the United States since 1975.\nMost people are between the ages of 20 and 40 when their doctor diagnoses them with MS. Women develop MS 2 to 3 times more often than men, a difference that has grown steadily for five decades. MS is more common among Caucasians of northern European ancestry than other ethnic groups.\nRates of MS tend to be lower in places that are closer to the equator. The rates of MS are higher in places farther away from the equator. This may have to do with sunlight and vitamin D. People who relocate to a new location before age 15 generally acquire the risk factors associated with the new location.\nPart 11 of 11\nWhat are the effects of MS?\nThe lesions from MS can appear anywhere in the central nervous system. This means they can affect any part of your body.\nOne of the most common symptoms of MS is fatigue, but it’s not uncommon for people with MS to also have:\n- some degree of cognitive impairment\nAs you age, some disabilities from MS may become more pronounced. If you have mobility issues, you may be at an increased risk for bone fractures and breaks due to falls. Mobility issues can also lead to a lack of physical activity, which can lead to other health problems. Fatigue and mobility issues may also have an impact on sexual function. Having other conditions such as arthritis and osteoporosis can complicate matters.\n- About multiple sclerosis. (n.d.).

{"question":"How do the atomic spectra of transition metals compare to those of noble gases in terms of their appearance and practical applications?","answer":"When electricity passes through transition metals and noble gases, they produce distinct atomic spectra, but with different characteristics and uses. Transition metals produce colourful compounds that contribute to hair colors and are useful as industrial catalysts. Noble gases each emit specific colors of light - for example, neon produces bright red light used in shop signs, while argon is used in lamp bulbs for temperature control. Both types of elements produce discontinuous spectra that are unique to each element, which can be used to identify their presence in unknown samples.","context":["High School Chemistry/Light and the Atomic Spectra\nWe now know how light can act as a wave or a particle, depending on the situation. You might wonder, though, why a chemistry textbook would waste a whole lesson on light. Light, like matter, is part of the universe, but chemists aren't responsible for studying the entire universe. Chemists are responsible for studying chemicals. What does light have to do with chemicals? Why do chemists need to know about light?\nIt turns out that scientists can actually learn a lot about chemicals by observing how they interact with light. Different chemicals behave differently when struck with a beam of light. In fact, the same chemical will interact differently with differently colored beams of light. To understand what light can tell us about different chemicals, though, we must first look at the electromagnetic spectrum a little more carefully.\n- Distinguish between continuous and discontinuous spectra.\n- Recognize that white light is actually a continuous spectrum of all possible wavelengths of light.\n- Recognize that all elements have unique atomic spectra.\nContinuous Spectra Compared to Discontinuous Spectra\nIf you have a class that requires a lot of work, you might find yourself saying something like, \"I'm continuously doing homework for this class\". Think about what you mean by that. You probably mean that the homework seems to be non-stop. Every time you finish one assignment, the teacher gives another, so you never get a break. When scientists use the word continuous, it has a similar meaning. It means no gaps, no holes, and no breaks of any kind.\nScientists don't use the word continuous to describe homework, but they do use it to describe electromagnetic spectra (spectra is just the plural word for spectrum). In the last section, you learned that an electromagnetic spectrum was a list of light arranged in order of increasing wavelength. A continuous electromagnetic spectrum, then, includes every possible wavelength of light between the wavelength at the beginning of the list and the wavelength at the end. If you find that definition confusing, consider the following example.\nSuppose you have a continuous spectrum that begins with light at a wavelength of 500 nm, and ends with light at a wavelength of 600 nm. Because it's continuous, that spectrum contains light with any wavelength between 500 nm and 600 nm. It contains light with a wavelength of 550 nm. It contains light with a wavelength of 545 nm. It contains light with a wavelength of 567.3 nm. It even contains light with a wavelength of 599.99999 nm. Write down any number (including a number with decimal places) that is bigger than 500 and smaller than 600. A continuous electromagnetic spectrum between 500 nm and 600 nm will include light with a wavelength equal to the number you've written down.\nAs shown in the last section, within the visible range of the electromagnetic spectrum, a light's wavelength corresponds to its color. Therefore, another way of defining a continuous spectrum in the visible range is to say that it is a spectrum which contains every possible color between the color at the beginning of the list and the color at the end. Figure 5.13 shows several examples of continuous spectra in the visible light range. The first continuous spectrum starts with a deep indigo blue and ends with red. Notice how the colors in this spectrum change smoothly all the way from indigo to red. There are no gaps, or missing colors. The same is true of the second continuous spectrum. The second spectrum again starts with a deep indigo blue, but this time ends with yellow. Once more the colors in the spectrum change smoothly without any gaps or holes, which makes the spectrum continuous. The third spectrum is also continuous, only this time it starts with the color green and ends with the color orange.\nNot all electromagnetic spectra are continuous. Sometimes they contain gaps or holes. Scientists call electromagnetic spectra that contain gaps or holes discontinuous. Let's reexamine spectra that start at 500 nm and end at 600 nm. Discontinuous spectra in this range will include light with some, but not all wavelengths of light greater than 500 nm and less than 600 nm. A discontinuous spectrum might, for example, only contain light with wavelengths of 500 nm, 523 nm and 600 nm. Obviously you can think of many numbers that lie between 500 and 600 which aren't included in that list (534 is one example). Therefore, the spectrum is discontinuous. A different discontinuous spectrum between 500 nm and 600 nm might contain every wavelength of light except 533 nm. In this case, almost every wavelength of light is included, but since 533 nm is missing, the spectrum is still discontinuous.\nFigure 5.14 shows several examples of discontinuous spectra in the range of visible light. Again, since the wavelength of a beam of light corresponds to its color, you can clearly see when an electromagnetic spectrum in the visible range is discontinuous – there will be colors missing! In the first example, only a few shades of green are missing from the middle of the spectrum. Nevertheless, the missing shades of green make the spectrum discontinuous. The next two examples in Figure 5.14 have even bigger gaps of missing color, so it's even more obvious that they are discontinuous.\nThe concept of a continuous spectrum compared to a discontinuous spectrum may seem a little silly. So what if one spectrum contains every possible wavelength, while another skips wavelengths here and there! Why does that matter? To understand the importance of continuous and discontinuous spectra, we have to look a little more closely at the ways in which light interacts with matter, and how those interactions can actually produce electromagnetic spectra.\nEach Element Has Its Own Spectrum\nLight from the sun is a continuous spectrum. In other words, when you go to the beach and sunbathe, you are bombarded by light beams of every different wavelength in the electromagnetic spectrum Certain wavelengths bounce off your skin, while others interact in ways that lead to a tan or even sun burn. For example, you've probably seen sunscreens that offer UV protection. Ultraviolet light has wavelengths that are smaller than those of visible blue light. In addition to the white light that we see, the continuous spectrum of light from the sun contains UV light, and light with that range of wavelengths can be dangerous to human skin cells.\nOf course, when you're lying in the sun on the beach, you don't actually see a rainbow shining down on you, do you? Instead, you see white light. As a result, you might be skeptical and find it hard to believe that sunlight forms a continuous spectrum. Surely, the beams of light coming from the sun don't contain every possible wavelength of light… surely, they only contain the wavelengths of light corresponding to the \"color\" white. That argument might seem logical to you, but you've fallen into a common trap – white isn't a color. If you take a careful look at the electromagnetic spectrum, what you'll notice is that there is no \"white\" light in the visible range. It turns out that white light does not come from light of any specific wavelength or range of wavelengths. Rather, in order for our eyes to see white, they must actually receive light of every wavelength in the entire visible spectrum.\nWhen sunlight passes through water, the white sunlight is spread out so that you can actually see the entire spectrum of brightly colored light composing it. This is what we know as a rainbow.\nWhite is not a color, and there is no light with a wavelength corresponding to \"white\". Instead, white light is formed when light of every wavelength in the visible spectrum is mixed together.\nRemember that by passing white light through a prism, you are able to split the light into a rainbow, revealing all of the different colors, or different wavelengths of light that make up white light.\nNow that we know where to find continuous spectra (light from the sun or any other source of pure white light), let's discuss where and when discontinuous spectra appear in our world. By passing an electric current or an electric spark through certain types of matter, it's possible to make that matter glow. Neon lights are one common example of this phenomenon. When an electric current travels through neon gas, the neon glows bright orange.\nNeon isn't the only gas that lights up when electricity passes through it. Electricity causes argon to glow blue and helium to glow pink. In fact, electricity causes every element in the entire periodic table to glow with a distinct color. As you might have guessed, the light from a glowing sample of neon or argon is very different from the light shining down from the sun. Unlike sunlight, which is white, elements such as neon and argon glow in colors, which means that the light they emit (or send forth) is missing certain wavelengths – if it wasn't, it would appear white to our eyes.\nRemember how sunlight spreads out into a rainbow, or a continuous spectrum, when you pass it through a prism? Well, when you pass light from a sample of glowing hydrogen through a prism, it doesn't spread out into a continuous spectrum. Instead, it spreads out into a discontinuous spectrum, with only four lines of colored light. A similar thing happens when you pass the light from a sample of glowing neon, or argon, or even sodium through a prism. Instead of getting a continuous spectrum, you get a discontinuous spectrum composed of a series of colored lines. The particular series of colored lines that you get out of any specific element is called the element's atomic spectrum or emission spectrum. Each element has an emission spectrum that is characteristic to that element. In other words, the emission spectrum from sodium is always the same and is different than the emission spectrum from any other element, like calcium or helium, or gold.\nEmission spectra are important to scientists for two reasons. First, because an element's emission spectrum is characteristic of the element, scientists can often use emission spectra to determine which elements are present or absent in an unknown sample. If the emission spectrum from the sample contains lines of light that correspond to sodium’s emission spectrum, then the sample contains sodium. You may have heard or read about scientists discussing what elements are present in some distant star, and after hearing that, wondered how scientists could know what elements are present in a place no one has ever been. Scientists determine what elements are present in distant stars by analyzing the light that comes from stars and finding the atomic spectrum of elements in that light. If the emission spectrum from the sample contains lines of light that correspond to helium's emission spectrum, then the sample contains helium. Second, and perhaps more importantly, the existence of atomic spectra and the fact that atomic spectra are discontinuous, can tell us a lot about how the atoms of each element are constructed. In general, an element's atomic spectrum results from the interaction between the electrons and protons within an atom of that element. The relationship between atomic spectra and the components of the atom will be the topic of the next lesson.\n- When scientists use the word continuous, they mean something with no holes, no gaps, and no breaks.\n- A continuous electromagnetic spectrum contains every wavelength between the wavelength on which the spectrum starts and the wavelength on which the spectrum ends.\n- A discontinuous electromagnetic spectrum is a spectrum that contains gaps, holes, or breaks in terms of the wavelengths that it contains.\n- Light from the sun and, in fact, any pure white light source, produces light that contains a continuous spectrum of wavelengths.\n- White is not a color of light itself, but rather, results when light of every other color is mixed together.\n- When an electric current or an electric spark is passed through an element, the element will give off a colored glow. This glow is actually composed of light from a discontinuous spectrum that is unique to the each and every element.\n- We call the discontinuous spectrum produced by passing an electric current through an element the element's atomic spectrum or emission spectrum.\n- Atomic spectra can be used to identify elements. They also tell us a lot about the nature of matter.\n- Decide whether each of the following spectra is continuous or discontinuous.\n- Decide whether each of the following statements is true or false.\n- (a) White light has a wavelength of 760 nm.\n- (b) Iron's atomic spectrum is an example of a discontinuous spectrum.\n- (c) Hydrogen's atomic spectrum is an example of a continuous spectrum.\n- Fill in each of the following blanks with the words \"must\", \"may\" or \"does not\".\n- (a) A continuous spectrum between 300 nm and 565 nm _____ contain light with a wavelength of 356 nm.\n- (b) A continuous spectrum between 1000 cm and 1.500 m _____ contain light with a wavelength of 1.234 m.\n- (c) A discontinuous spectrum between 234 mm and 545 mm ____ contain light with a wavelength of 300 mm.\n- Choose the correct word in each of the following statements.\n- (a) A continuous spectrum between 532 nm and 894 nm contains light of every wavelength (greater than/less than) 532 nm and (greater than/ less than) 894 nm.\n- (b) A discontinuous spectrum between 532 nm and 894 nm contains light of every wavelength between 532 nm and 894 nm (including/except for) light with a wavelength of 650 nm.\n- What is another name for an atomic spectrum?\n- When an electric current is passed through neon, it glows __________.\n- When an electric spark is passed through argon, it glows _________.\n- When an electric current is passed through helium, it glows _________.\n- LEDs, or light emitting diodes, produce light by passing an electric current through a mixture of different atoms (or molecules) and then using their combined emission spectra to light up a room, or a string of Christmas tree lights.

He was also able to predict the properties of these new elements from the position in his table.\nHis Periodic Table of Elements became widely accepted and developed as the one we know today when new elements discovered were found to match his predictions.\nWe now know that to make the patterns work properly elements must be ordered by their atomic number,\nnot mass as Mendeleev originally did.\nThe Modern Periodic Table\nThe Periodic Table is laid out in columns and rows, called groups and periods. The elements in each of these are related to each other in some way.\nThe vertical columns, called groups, go from 1, on the left side, to group 0, on the right hand side. Elements in the same group all have the same number of outer shell electrons. E.g. Oxygen and Sulfur both have 6 outer shell electrons. Types of elements e.g. halogens are all found in the same group.\nThe horizontal rows, called periods, go from 1 to seven and are labelled down the left hand side of the table. As the periods increase the atoms have more full electron shells, meaning as you move down the periodic table the atoms of elements become heavier and bigger. E.g. Sodium (2, 8, 1) and Aluminium (2, 8, 3) are both in period 3, and they both have electrons in three of their shells. An element's period can sometimes help us to predict its reactivity.\nGroup 1 - Alkali Metals\nFound in the very left hand column of the table, group 1, including lithium, sodium and so on...\nThese metals all have one outer shell electron and so they react by losing it. They become more reactive as you go down the group as the atoms are bigger so electrostatic forces between the nucleus and outer electron are less, meaning the outer electron is easily lost.\nThese metals ALWAYS bond ioncially, NEVER covalently.\nThey have relatively low melting and boiling points, they're low density and very soft.\nAll of the alkali metals react with cold water vigorously. They whizz, float and fizz furiously as hydrogen is produced. They form their hydroxide solution in water, which is alkaline hence the name 'alkali metals'. Sodium and Potassium even melt during the reaction, and Potassium often ignites, so you can imagine what the more reactive ones do...\nFound right in the centre of the periodic table, starting in period 4, including Titanium and Silver.\nThey are good conductors of heat and electricity. They're dense, strong and shiny. They have relatively high melting points compared with other metals and are much less reactive.\nThey often have more than one ion.. E.G. copper is Cu2+. Their compounds are very colourful and are responsible for hair colours. They are also known to be very useful catalysts in industry.\nMost importantly - Transition Metals have a very strange electron arrangement. The 3rd energy level/shell can actaully hold 18 electrons not 8 as is originally taught and you have to think of the extra ten as a reserve. The transition metals' electrons fill these reserve spaces hence their place in the table. So after Calcium with electron arrangement (2, 8, 8, 2) comes Scandium with electron arrangement (2, 8, 9, 2) and so on until Gallium in group three where electron arrangement returns to normal (2, 8, 18, 3).\nGroup 7 - Halogens\nFound in column 7, second to the right hand side, including Chlorine and Iodine.\nThey all have 7 electrons in their outer shell and so react by gaining one or sharing one, hence they can bond ionically or covalently. They also exist diatomically naturally, (meaning they're found in pairs).\nThe halogens will react vigorously with alkali metals to form salts called 'metal halides'. Also more reactive halogens will displace less reactive halogens in competition reactions.\nOppositely to the alkali metals, the halogens' reactivity decreases as you move down the group for a similar reason. As they need to attract another electron to react and the atoms become bigger as we move down the group, it means that the electrostatic forces between the nucleus and outer shell electrons are quite small so attracting another electron is quite hard, hence the larger the atom the less reactive it is...\nGroup 0 - The Noble Gases\nFound in the last column, on the very right hand side of the table, including Helium and Argon.\nThey were only discovered recently in relation to the other elements as their properties are hard to notice... They are all colourless gases, that don't react with anything, this is because they have a full outer shell of electrons so are stable.\nThey all have a slightly strange property, that they all give out a different colour of light if you pass an electric current through them, giving them useful everyday duties...\n- Neon lights are used in shop signs, the type you'd see in Las Vegas. They give out a bright red light.\n- Helium is used in baloons to make them float as it is less dense than air. It can also be used with neon in lasers.\n- Argon is used in lamp bulbs as a temperature control system, it can also be used as a more powerful laser."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:c0f12a26-7524-4083-b529-80c429c7176c>","<urn:uuid:1a22a8b9-e0aa-45b2-853d-2dd5ae2ef09f>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How many players are on the field in Polocrosse versus Inline Hockey?","answer":"In Polocrosse, there are 6 players per team on the field, divided into two sections of three players each. In contrast, Inline Hockey has 5 players per team on the floor (4 skaters and a goalie).","context":["Information courtesy of PASA\nAs the name of the game implies, Polocrosse is a combination of elements of the ancient game of Polo, which is believed to have originated in Persia, and the American Indian game of lacrosse. The game was first played in England in an indoor arena and was then designed to improve students’ riding skills.\nAn Australian couple, Mr & Mrs Edward Hirst, had read of the fledgling sport of “Polo Crosse” in an English horse magazine, and decided to see the game being played when on a visit to England in 1938. On their return to Australia, they developed the game concept with the assistance of Mr Alf Pitty, an experienced polo player.\nFrom these simple beginnings, a new and exciting sport was born! The game, now named “Polocrosse”, and suiting the Australian competitive temperament, grew steadily. Other countries began to show interest and the game was first played in Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) and in South Africa in 1948. Papua New Guinea and New Zealand followed a little later, with England, United States, Ireland and Canada now also playing the game at international standards. Other countries, such as Argentina, Chile, Uruguay and Denmark are known to play the game, as well as in the Middle East.\nThe game has developed to the extent that there are now in excess of 6 000 players worldwide, with international competition being held regularly at senior, junior and veteran levels.\nFor a more detailed history of the development of the game, visit http://www.ausport.gov.au/polox/polohist.html\nAccording to Jack Higgs, past President of Matamo Polocrosse Club, who compiled a history of the club, the sport was first played in South Africa at the Durban Riding Club in 1948, after two girls returned home having spent a short while in England where they had seen a match being played between Porlockvale and Taunton. The sport was well supported at the riding club and spread to Shongweni, but due to unknown reasons, died out in 1950.\nAt this time, Vaughan Winter, a stock farmer in the Estcourt district, read about the sport in an Australian magazine. Intrigued, he wrote to the editor of the magazine, asking for more information. To his surprise, the editor sent him a rule-book!\nVaughan discussed the possibility of starting the game in Estcourt with some of his friends, one of whom knew that the game had been played at Shongweni. Through this contact, they were able to take over some racquets and balls from the Shongweni Pony Club, and on 18th March 1951, the first chukka was played in Estcourt.\nOther clubs soon followed Matamo, with the formation of a club in Colenso in 1953. When Giffford Sparks, founder of the Colenso club was transferred to Cato Ridge in 1964, he started a club there, followed by the formation of a club at Mooi River the following year.\nAfter a tournament held at the Cato Ridge club on 17th July 1966, a meeting was held and it was decided to form the Natal Polocrosse Association, with Gifford Sparks being elected as President.\nPlease note this page will soon be updated with more international and local history.\nPolocrosse is an exciting team sport played on horseback between teams of 6 players each, with each team divided into two sections of three. Very simply, a “section” is made up of the “Attack” player (or No.1), who’s job it is to score goals, the “Centre” player (No.2), who acts as both an offensive and defensive player, and the “Defence” player (No.3), who’s ultimate duty is to prevent the opposing team’s No.1 from scoring.\nThe game is played with a soft, thick-skinned sponge rubber ball, which is about 100mm in diameter. Each player is equipped with a racquet (usually about 90cm long), which consists of a cane shaft with a thickened handle, at the end of which is a round head fitted with a loose string net in which the ball is carried.\nMost types of horse may be used to play polocrosse, varying in breed, size and age. In South Africa, one finds that Thoroughbreds are the most popular. The polocrosse horse needs to be in good physical condition, and should be agile, fit and have good stamina. During a tournament, a player may use only one horse. However, in the case of an injury to a horse, a substitute may be used.\nStallions, mares in foal or horses with eyesight problems may not be played.\nThe game is played on a field 55 metres wide and 146,5 metres long, with 2,5 metre wide goals at each end. The field is divided into 3 areas; two goal scoring areas measured 27,5 metres from each goal line, and the mid-field area of 91,5 metres. In front of each set of goalposts a semi-circle is marked, known as “the D”. The lines separating the goal scoring areas from the mid-field are called “penalty lines”.\nThe first section from each team play against each other for a 6 or 8 minute period of play, called a “chukka”, followed by the other sections of each team in the second chukka, while the first sections’ horses and players rest. The game continues in this fashion for a total of 6 chukkas (or 8 in international games).\nPlay starts with the two opposing sections lining up in order, in two parallel lines on the centre line of the field, near the sideline. One of the 2 mounted umpires then throws the ball in, above the players’ heads. The players attempt to gain possession of the ball by catching it or by picking it up from the ground with their racquets.\nAs the objective of the game is to score more goals than the opposition, the team in possession of the ball will pass the ball among themselves so that their No.1 player can get into the goal scoring area and shoot the goal. The opposition will try to prevent this by robbing the ball from an opposition player’s racquet, by intercepting a pass or by pushing a player out of the field of play.\nTo make the game more challenging, the ball may not be carried by a player over the penalty line (in either direction), but has to be bounced over the line or passed over the line to another player.\nThe only players permitted in the goal scoring areas are the attacking No.1 and the defending No.3. A goal is scored by throwing the ball from the racquet and between the goalposts. This may only be carried out while in the goal scoring area, but outside of the semi-circle or “D”.\nIf the attempt at goal is successful, then play starts again from the centre of the field, on the side opposite from where the ball was previously thrown in. If the attempt at goal is unsuccessful and the ball goes over the goal line, the opposition’s No.3 player takes the ball and plays upfield.\nObviously, the rules of play are very specific and are more detailed than described here. Above all else, the rules are designed with safety in mind, both for the players and their horses. Whenever a potentially dangerous situation occurs during play, the umpires will stop the game and a penalty is awarded.\nPlayers are required to wear a helmet that complies with specific safety standards. Horses must be protected by coronet boots and protective bandages or boots on all legs. In addition, bits with protruding side bars may not be used, nor spurs with sharp rowels. Saddles must be fitted with a girth, surcingle and breastplate.\nPolocrosse is for everybody – boys and girls from 7 or 8, teenagers, adults, even Granny and Grandpa! If you’re still learning to ride, there’s no better place to improve your riding skills than by playing this wonderful sport! There’s always a place for you in Polocrosse!!","Inline Hockey, also known as Roller Hockey or Inline Roller Hockey is typically played at room temperature. Several surface materials are used, including plastic tiles (sometimes known as sport-court flooring), wood, and sealed concrete; in general, surfaces try to balance the ability of wheels to grip against the ability of the puck to slide freely. None of these surfaces, however, are as smooth as ice; as a result, the puck is made of a much lighter plastic material, and rests on small plastic nubs to reduce friction with the rink surface.\nThe game is played between two teams with five players (Four Skaters and a Goalie) on the floor. A team usually consists of three lines of two forwards, three pairs of defencemen, and two goalies, each of whom is on inline skates.\nUnder FIRS rules, each team may carry a maximum of 14 players and two goaltenders on their roster.\nThe objective of the game is to score goals by shooting a hard plastic disc, the puck, into the opponent's goal net. Players may also redirect the puck with any part of their bodies, subject to certain restrictions. Players may not hold the puck in their hand and are prohibited from using their hands to pass the puck to their teammates, unless they are in the defensive zone. Players are also prohibited from kicking the puck into the opponent's goal, though unintentional redirections off the skate are permitted. Players may not intentionally bat the puck into the net with their hands.\nPlayer substitutions are permitted at any time during the course of the game, although during a stoppage of play the home team is permitted the final change. When players are substituted during play, it is called changing on the fly.\nSince inline Hockey is a contact sport, although body checks are usually not allowed, injuries can still be a common occurrence. Protective equipment is highly recommended and is enforced in all competitive situations. Most leagues punish fighting harshly, and body checking is usually a penalty. Leagues generally require players to wear full face masks, but otherwise, players tend to wear lighter clothes and less protective padding.\nThere are other rules differences as well. Each team fields only four skaters (plus a goaltender), rather than ice hockey's five. Many leagues do not stop play for icing. Offsides rules are generally looser as well; a few leagues call offsides only on the center line, while most omit the rule entirely.\nAll of this adds up to a game focused more on skill and speed and less on strength and intimidation. Skaters have more room to maneuver and fewer obstacles to slow them down. Games are typically faster-paced and higher-scoring, while still retaining many of the same skills and strategies as ice hockey.\nThere are two lines of sanctioning bodies for inline hockey : The International Ice Hockey Federation organizes IIHF Inline Hockey World Championships but the sport is recognized as being governed by the International Roller Sports Federation which organizes FIRS Inline Hockey World Championships.\nOne of the most fundamental differences between the IIHF and FIRS-sanctioned versions of inline hockey lies within the dimensions of the net. The IIHF simply retains the use of ice hockey nets. However the FIRS rulebook substitutes the traditional ice hockey cage for a lower and narrower model patterned after the one used in rink hockey, the FIRS' flagship sport, however most FIRS leagues in the United States and Canada opt for the more popular and common ice hockey nets.\nInline Hockey is being introduced to to boys and girls in many different countries, as seen here with some young Argentina girls learning the game.\nJohn Joseph Merlin was born September 17, 1735 in Huys, Belgium. He was the 1st recorded person to invent a roller skate / inline skate, doing so in the 1760s in London , England. Merlin wore a pair of his new skates to a masquerade party he was invited to at Carlisle House in London. He was well known as a inventor, but not a very good skater. Upon entering the masquerade party on his roller skates, playing a violin, he could not control the direction of his skates and crashed into a large mirror, crushing his violin and severely injuring himself on the broken mirror glass, ending his violin and roller skating careers, and possibly setting back the sport of roller skating many years.\nMonsieur Petitbled was the 1st to patent a roller skate / inline skate, doing so in 1819, while in Paris, France. The Petitbled skate was a inline skate with a wood sole, leather straps and three wheels made of wood, metal or ivory. These skates only went forward.\nThis is a circa 1910 version of a inline skate. Looks like a Hockey skate to us\nThe USA Roller Sports (USARS) predecessor organization was the Roller Skating Rink Operators Association (RSROA). In 1940 the RSROA published a set of roller hockey rules drawn from a booklet by the National Hockey League (NHL) which was designed to grow interest in playing hockey on roller skates. However, because of the intervention of World War II, the organization of roller hockey tournaments did not receive significant development until after this war in the late 1940s. At first skating club interest was confined to the northern tier of the United States, including the bordering Canadian cities. Puck roller hockey's spread in popularity during that period was helped along by the attention of local commercial television, which was getting its start and in desperate need for events to fill air time. The increased interest in the sport led in 1959 to the selection of a National Puck Hockey Committee to formulate special rules for the performance of puck hockey in the variety of rink sizes available to roller skates. The American Roller Hockey Association (ARHA) was formed with Joe Spillman, a roller rink operator from San Antonio, Texas as its first Commissioner. Under Spillman's direction, the sport of hockey on roller skates grew rapidly throughout the United States.\nDuring the 1960 RSROA National Roller Skating Championships held in Little Rock, Arkansas, exhibition games for ball and puck roller hockey were held. Following these Nationals, the first full competitive season officially began in North America for roller hockey. This, of course, had puck roller hockey entirely performed on quad skates, for at that time there were no in-line skates available. State and Regional competitions determined the teams that would move on to the North American Championships.\nIn 1962 at Pershing Auditorium in Lincoln, Nebraska both Ball and Puck Hockey took part in the North American Championships, with the Arcadia Wildcats from Detroit,Michigan becoming the first Puck Hockey national champions on quad skates. Inline skates were not commercially available during that era.\nOn September 1, 1965, during their semi-annual board meeting, the RSROA installed puck hockey as an equal and separate division of roller hockey, which included ball hockey, a format most popular in Europe and South America. It was decided that both ball and puck hockey would compete under the same rules and award separate gold medal winners. Budd Van Roekel, RSROA president, was quoted in the January 1965 issue of Skate Magazine, “We believe this move will spark further growth of our roller hockey program. While we recognize the popularity of the international ball-and-cane version of hockey, we also realize that thousands of potential United States and Canadian players are more familiar with the Canadian stick-and-puck type sport. We see no reason why the two versions of the sport cannot grow side by side.”\nThe 1966 North American Championships marked the return of puck hockey after a four-year hiatus. The final game was a nail biter and the crowd appreciated the fast pace and excitement of puck hockey. The final game was between the Canadians of Windsor, Ontario and the Wildcats of Detroit, Michigan, the defending champions from 1962. The score seesawed between the two teams and was finally decided in favor of the Canadians with a final score of 5 to 3. The win gave the Canadian team their only gold medal for the whole North American Championships. One Canadian team player was quoted in the 1966 Fall issue of Skate Magazine, “We simply had to win the (puck) hockey championships, otherwise our fathers wouldn’t allow us to return home.”\nAnother milestone occurred for puck roller hockey in 1977, when the North American Puck Hockey Championship was held in a venue away from ball hockey for the first time. The 1977 puck championships were staged in Houston, Texas to large crowds and a great amount of publicity, as fourteen newspapers and television stations covered the event. The year 1977 was also a milestone for women with this championship marking the debut of a women’s hockey national championship.\nTransition from quad roller skates to inline skates\nThe very first inline roller hockey team to earn a USA National Championship title did so at a USA Roller Sports National Championship held in San Diego in July 1993. At the previous 1992 USARS National Championships, also staged in San Diego, the San Diego Hosers won the Senior Gold Division title wearing their customary quad roller skates. As of that time, the Hosers manager/coach Paul Chapey felt that while inline skates were obviously faster, the advantage was to quad skates because of their assumed greater maneuverability. Some teams and individual players at the 1992 Nationals had been equipped with inline skates, but perhaps had not yet mastered their new vehicles. During the ensuing year, Paul Chapey became an inline convert and the San Diego Hosers came back to the USAC/RS Nationals in 1993 entirely on inline skates and recaptured their national title. This significant event took place at least a year before all the other major roller inline hockey organizations were even in existence, including National Inline Hockey Association (NIHA), USA Hockey InLine, North American Roller Hockey Championships (NARCh) and American Inline Roller Hockey Series (AIRHS).\nUSA Roller Sports, under the auspices of Fédération Internationale de Roller Sports (FIRS), established and hosted the first World Inline Roller Hockey Championships for men at the Odeum Arena in Villa Park, Illinois (a suburb of Chicago) in 1995. USA Roller Sports established the first Inline Hockey World Championships for Juniors, again in Chicago in 1996, following the USA National Championships. The first World Inline Hockey Championships for Women occurred under sponsorship of USA Roller Sports in Rochester, New York in 2002. Since the introduction of these events, FIRS National Federations around the world have annually perpetuated inline world championships. USA (Ice) Hockey and International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) began their men’s InLine Hockey World Championship in 1996, after the first such world championship by FIRS and has yet to organize a women’s inline hockey world tournament or one for juniors.\nIn March of 2002, the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) Membership and Credentials Committee officially reaffirmed that USA Roller Sports as the governing body for inline hockey in the United States, which continues to this day. This determination was based on a conclusion by the USOC that internationally the sport of inline hockey is recognized as a discipline of roller sports. Then, as now, USA Roller Sports is a member in good standing of Federation International de Roller Sports (\"FIRS\"), the international federation for roller sports as recognized by the International Olympic Committee, and FIRS is also recognized by the Pan American Sports Organization(PASO) as the controlling international federation for inline hockey, a sport of the Pan American Games.\nInline roller hockey was introduced to the World Games for the first time in 2005, an International Olympic Committee (IOC) sanctioned event under the jurisdiction of theInternational World Games Association (IWGA), an affiliate of the General Association for International Sports Federations (GAISF). The United States won the Gold Medal, with Canada taking the Silver and Switzerland the Bronze Medal. Inline roller hockey replaced rink roller hockey (ball and cane) on the World Games program forDuisburg, Germany at the 2005 quadrennial World Games. Rink roller hockey had been part of the World Games since its first organization in 1979 at Santa Clara,California, as have the other disciplines of roller sports.\nDuring the General Assembly of the IWGA, which took place in Madrid on May 14, 2003, the IWGA unanimously agreed that inline roller hockey was the responsibility of FIRS and that this variant form of roller hockey would be included on the program of the 2005 World Games in place of the previous format. This same scenario had previously played out before the Pan American Sports Organization in 1999, when inline hockey made its first appearance at the Pan American Games in Canada, and repeated again four years later in the Dominican Republic.

{"question":"How does the Global Magnitsky Act's jurisdictional reach compare with the Russian courts' handling of jurisdiction in the Oblastnaya Gazeta case?","answer":"The Global Magnitsky Act asserts universal U.S. jurisdiction over corrupt acts and human rights abuses without requiring any jurisdictional connection to the United States. In contrast, the Russian legal system's approach to jurisdiction, as seen in the Oblastnaya Gazeta case, allowed prosecutors from any region of Russia to initiate proceedings against media content regardless of the publisher's location, but ultimately respected territorial jurisdiction by permitting the case to be transferred to the publisher's home jurisdiction in Yekaterinburg for proper consideration of the matter.","context":["Global Magnitsky Sanctions Export Human Rights Framework of the Sergei Magnitsky Act Globally, Assert U.S. Universal Jurisdiction Over the Corrupt Acts and Human Rights Abuses, and Impose Financial and Immigration Sanctions\nLegal Pillars of the Global Magnitsky Sanctions Framework\nOn December 20, 2017, the U.S. President issued Executive Order 13818 “Blocking the Property of Persons Involved in Serious Human Rights Abuse and Corruption.”  The Order declares a “national emergency” with respect to “serious human rights” abuses and a broad range of corrupt acts that threaten “the stability of international political and economic systems” and “constitute an unusual an extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.”\nEO 13818 in substantial part implements the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act (“Global Magnitsky Act”), a 2016 law that authorizes the President to freeze certain property and restrict the entry into the United States of “foreign persons” that the President determines, “based on credible evidence,” are responsible for certain corrupt acts and human rights abuses committed wholly or substantially outside of the United States (the “Global Magnitsky Sanctions”).\n“The Global Magnitsky Act’s default position is the applicability of U.S. sanctions in response to acts wholly or substantially occurring outside of the United States.”\nThe Global Magnitsky Act builds and expands on the Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act of 2012 (the “Sergei Magnitsky Act”). The Sergei Magnitsky Act requires the President to identify and impose sanctions on persons that the President determines, “based on credible information,” to be responsible for the “detention, abuse, or death” of Russian lawyer and whistleblower Sergei Magnitsky, who in 2009 died in prison in Russia after publicly accusing Russian government entities and officials of corruption and other wrongs. The Sergei Magnitsky Act addresses corruption indirectly, such as by identifying ways in which corruption impedes human rights protections and permits human rights abuses against individuals “seeking to expose illegal activities” by government officials.\nAs the above description indicates, the Sergei Magnitsky Act targets persons and places tied to specific events that occurred in one country. Moreover, the Sergei Magnitsky Act can be read to have been adopted or operate as an alternative or last recourse for justice and accountability, following Congress’ findings that there was a denial of “any justice or legal remedies” to Mr. Magnitsky by “all state bodies of the Russian Federation” and “impunity since his death of state officials.”\nIn contrast, the Global Magnitsky Act contains no analogous Congressional findings, nor does it expressly state or imply that it is a last or alternative resort where adequate legal processes to adjudicate corruption or human rights abuses are unavailable in foreign countries where relevant events took place or parties are located, or before foreign tribunals to which relevant states have submitted to jurisdiction. Instead, the Global Magnitsky Act’s default position is the applicability of U.S. sanctions (supported by “credible evidence”) without the requirement of a jurisdictional nexus with the United States. Accordingly, the Global Magnitsky Act asserts U.S. universal jurisdiction over the corrupt acts and human rights abuses it targets. EO 13818 goes much further, as discussed in detail in forthcoming installments of this MassPoint series.\n“For human rights abuses and corrupt acts, the Global Magnitsky Act and EO 13818 authorize financial and immigration sanctions.”\nFor human rights abuses and corrupt acts, the Global Magnitsky Act and EO 13818 authorize financial and immigration sanctions. The Global Magnitsky Sanctions largely target foreign government officials and private parties (natural and legal). However, some U.S. persons are “foreign persons” under the Global Magnitsky Act and have sanctions exposure in connection with certain corrupt acts and human rights abuses. Moreover, all U.S. persons, like their foreign counterparts, are sanctionable for providing material and other support to certain conduct and persons. U.S. and foreign persons also face civil and criminal penalties for violating or evading sanctions.\n“The financial penalties imposed by the Global Magnitsky Sanctions are powerful, as they effectively cut off sanctioned persons from the U.S. financial system and, substantially, U.S. dollar transactions.”\nFinancial sanctions entail the “blocking” or freezing of the property or “interests in property” of sanctioned persons that is in or comes within the United States or the possession or control of a U.S. person, including U.S. banks and their foreign branches, U.S. branches of foreign bank and U.S. businesses and individuals. The property of a “blocked” person (a “Specially Designated National” or “SDN”) must be frozen and may not, without approval, be transferred or otherwise transacted in. The “interests in property” of a blocked person is property owned 50% or more, directly or indirectly, by one or more blocked persons individually or in the aggregate. Entities that are owned 50% or more by one or more blocked persons are also blocked, pursuant to the Treasury Department Office of Foreign Assets Control’s “50% Rule.”\nIn addition, EO 13818 prohibits transactions with or for the benefit of sanctioned parties, specifically (1) “the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, or to, or for the benefit of any . . . [blocked person]” and (2) “the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person.”\nU.S. Financial Sanctions Are Uniquely Powerful\nThe financial penalties imposed by the Global Magnitsky Sanctions (and other U.S. sanctions programs) are powerful, as they effectively cut off sanctioned persons from the U.S. financial system and, substantially, U.S. dollar transactions. Given the size and centrality of the U.S. financial system to international commerce and payments, persons without access to U.S. banks and other constituent parts of the U.S. financial system are largely shut out of the international financial system (this assumes, of course, effective enforcement and compliance by U.S. authorities, banks and international financial system participants).\nPut in context, the United States’ Global Magnitsky Act and sanctions program are singular in their force. Other countries have adopted versions of a Magnitsky Act (including Canada, which has imposed sanctions under its law), but none of these other Magnitsky frameworks rival the potential sweep and impact of the United States’ Magnitsky framework.\nThe Global Magnitsky Act and EO 13818 impose immigration sanctions that prohibit sanctioned persons from immigrant and non-immigrant entry into the United States. The Global Magnitsky Act excepts from immigration sanctions persons whose admission to the United States would “further important law enforcement objectives” or is “necessary to permit” the United States to comply with obligations vis-à-vis the United Nations. EO 13818 contains no such exception.\nEO 13818 prohibits transactions that, in effect or purpose, “evade or avoid” or “violate” the financial sanctions provisions, as well as conspiracies to violate “any of the [blocking] prohibitions set forth in” the Order.\nIn addition, the Global Magnitsky Act provides that persons who violate or attempt or conspire to violate sanctions authorized by the Act, or persons who “cause a violation” of sanctions, are subject to civil and criminal penalties pursuant to the IEEPA. Civil penalties under the IEEPA are up to $250,000 or twice the amount of a transaction that was the source of a violation. The IEEPA’s criminal penalties attach to willful violations and attempts or conspiracies to violate a relevant sanctions program, as well as the willful aiding or abetting of such acts, punishable by fines of up to $1,000,000 and/or imprisonment for up to 20 years.\n“It remains to be seen how the current Administration will enforce the Global Magnitsky Sanctions. For now, their existence alone is a powerful weapon in the Administration’s arsenal, a reality that should be taken seriously—and for different purposes—by a wide range of foreign government and private parties.”\nThe Global Magnitsky Sanctions are extraordinary for their scope and reach. They embody an unabashed assertion by the United States of universal sanctions jurisdiction over the corruption and human rights abuses they target. Particularly with respect to corruption, the Global Magnitsky Sanctions are a departure from U.S. and foreign anti-corruption laws, as well as international frameworks, that defer to national authorities to punish their own government officials for bribery and other corrupt acts. The Global Magnitsky Sanctions are also notable for their broad definition of corruption, which covers not just bribery, but also the expropriation of private assets for personal gain and corruption in government contracting. These corruption-related aspects of the Global Magnitsky Sanctions are discussed in a forthcoming installment of this MassPoint series\nAs stated in the first part of this MassPoint series, any number of foreign government officials and private parties could conceivably find themselves on the wrong side of the Global Magnitsky Sanctions, particularly for corrupt acts. It remains to be seen how the current Administration will enforce the Global Magnitsky Sanctions. For now, their existence alone is a powerful weapon in the Administration’s arsenal, a reality that should be taken seriously—and for different purposes—by a wide range of foreign government and private parties, from human rights and anti-corruption campaigners to government institutions and state-owned enterprises to banks or other financial institutions that do business with or on behalf of foreign government officials or entities.\nBlocking the Property of Persons Involved in Serious Human Rights Abuse or Corruption, 82 Fed.

Oblastnaya Gazeta\nCourt: Kirovsky District Court of Yekaterinburg\nDecision Date: September 30, 2019\nCase Number: N/A\nIssue: Wrongful prohibition of dissemination of information online\nGalina Arapova | Director and Senior Media Lawyer at Mass Media Defence Centre\nOlga Shatskikh | Lawyer at Mass Media Defence Centre\nElena Ovchinnikova | Media Lawyer\nThe Catalysts team is grateful to Marina Zalata from Mass Media Defence Centre, who was instrumental in enabling communications between the featured actors and the Catalysts team\nIn November 2017, the Oblastnaya Gazeta, a regional newspaper and media outlet based in Yekaterinburg, published a satirical article on their website titled ‘How to give and take bribes and not get caught’. The article was published as a joint project between Oblastnaya Gazeta and Krasnaya Burda, a publication famous for its satirical projects and often critiqued for the social critique it represents. The article depicted public servants asking for bribes with jokes such as:\n“Very sorry! I’m sorry I can’t help you, Although I could. But I cannot! Or can I? How do you think?…..My hands itch, that is how much I want to help you. So I wanted a number….. 1,000,000. But they gave 100. And I want 1,000,000. Do you have it? Then I can help you.”\nA prosecutor based in Khvalynsk in the Saratov region considered the publication illegal since it allegedly contained instructive information about offering and receiving bribes. Russia’s Federal Law on Information, Information Technologies and Information Protection allows prosecutors in any region of Russia, regardless of their geographical proximity to the publisher, to initiate proceedings to have information declared illegal for dissemination. Based on this law, the prosecutor requested the Volsky District Court in the Saratov region to impose a ban on the circulation of this online article, even though Oblastnaya Gazeta’s office was in Yekaterinburg, over 1200 kilometers away.\nThe editors of Oblastnaya Gazeta were not informed and not made a party to the proceedings against them. In December 2017, the District Court granted the prosecutor’s request to have the publication removed and added it to Russia’s unified registry of prohibited content to prohibit its republication. As a result, Russia’s media regulator known as the Roskomnadzor, sent Oblastnaya Gazeta a court order along with a request to remove the article from their website.\nThe editors of Oblastnaya Gazeta sought Mass Media Defence Centre’s (MMDC) support to appeal this decision at the Saratov Regional Court. Even though the media outlet was not a party to the initial proceedings, Russia’s civil procedure law permitted such an appeal as the Court’s decision affected its rights. MMDC argued that the District Court’s decision violated Oblastnaya Gazeta’s right to freedom of expression and their right to disseminate information as guaranteed under Article 29 of the Constitution of the Russian Federation and Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights. They highlighted that the article was a humorous work that exaggerated and ridiculed the practice of bribery and that it did not encourage violations of the anti-corruption measures in place in Russia. The appellants also noted that the article was a joint project between Oblastnaya Gazeta and Krasnaya Burda, an organization widely known and regarded for its satirical work.\nInstead of considering the case on merits, the Saratov Regional Court found that Oblastnaya Gazeta, as the publisher of an article that was banned, should have been given an opportunity of being heard in the court of first instance. In April 2019, it quashed the decision of the Volsky District Court and remanded the case for reconsideration. At Oblastnaya Gazeta’s request, the Volsky District Court permitted for the retrial to be held at the Kirovsky District Court in the Yekaterinburg region of Russia, where both Oblastnaya Gazeta and Krasnaya Burda were based.\nDuring the retrial, the lawyers from MMDC argued again that the prohibition of the satirical article amounted to a violation of Oblastnaya Gazeta’s right to freedom of expression. At this stage, they also engaged a linguistic expert to ascertain the genre of the article and to demonstrate that the aim of the article wasn’t promotion of criminal activity. The expert’s report reaffirmed that the article was indeed satirical and highlighted phrases and referenced linguistic literature to indicate that the notion of the text was humoristic.\nIn June 2019, however, the Kirovsky District Court dismissed the proceedings since the contested article had already been taken down in 2017 and was no longer available at its original URL. On this basis, it concluded that no further legal conflict existed between the prosecutor and Oblastnaya Gazeta. Oblastnaya Gazeta appealed this decision, arguing that there was a matter of principle at hand and that the article would be reinstated if it was not found to have violated any law. The appeal was successful, and the case was returned to the Kirovsky District Court for new consideration in September 2019.\nOn October 7, 2019, the Kirovsky District Court issued a decision on the merits of the case. The court noted that the article was indeed a work of satire and “did not contain an appeal to unlawful behavior or to commit acts prohibited by the criminal law. It was satirical, aimed at ridiculing corrupt officials.” Further, it agreed with the arguments of the appellants and noted that “in accordance with Article 5 of the Declaration on Freedom of Political Discussion in the Mass Media, the humorous and satirical genre was subject to a high degree of exaggeration and provocation and must be protected under Article 10 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.”\nAs a result, Oblastnaya Gazeta republished the article on their website. Only a few weeks later, another prosecutor in the Kalininsky district of the Krasnodar region of Russia requested his local District Court to ban the circulation of the same article on the same grounds as the previous prosecutor. The lawyers from MMDC representing Oblastnaya Gazeta relied on the judgment of the District Court of Kirovsky, which had prejudicial force over all courts across the Russian Federation. Once the District Court in Kalininsky was informed of this, the prosecutor in Kalininsky withdrew his claim.\nThe success of the litigation was due to extensive collaboration both within the legal team and with external partners.\nInternally, Galina Arapova, MMDC’s Director, and Olga Shatskikh, a lawyer on MMDC’s team, worked together to strategize the case. As Shatskikh stated, “We formulated a strategy for the defense and drafted the legal documents for the appeal. Our vast experience in dealing with similar cases was instrumental and enabled us to work within a very short time frame.”\nMMDC, an NGO set up in 1996 to protect the rights of journalists and media outlets and to promote freedom of expression, had vast experience in such cases because, in the words of Arapova, “It is the only organization of its kind in Russia and, therefore, our lawyers have the experience of engaging on similar issues in the past.” She noted that “A majority of media outlets in Russia can’t afford in-house counsel and, often, our organization is one of the only recourses to seek legal help. So, when the editors of Oblastnaya Gazeta reached out to us with the order from the Roskomnadzor, we immediately started working with the team to file an appeal.”\nThis case also showcases the advantages of having a pre-existing network of lawyers outside of the organization. Arapova stated, “The Court listed the case to be heard in a matter of days. Since our organization is based in Voronezh, over 600 km away from the Volsky District Court in the Saratov region, and both media outlets were another 1000 km away from the court in Yekaterinburg, it would have been impossible for us to collect the Power of Attorney from Oblastnaya Gazeta and reach the Volsky District Court in time for the hearing. Therefore, we reached out to Elena Ovchinnikova, a media lawyer who was based in Yekaterinburg itself. We had known her for many years. She was a part of an informal network of media lawyers, established and supported by MMDC. We use this network as a resource when we need media lawyers to be engaged in cases in remote regions of Russia, where MMDC lawyers cannot go themselves. Ovchinnikova immediately received the Power of Attorney from the Oblastnaya Gazeta since their offices were located nearby in the same city and coordinated with Olga to work on the case.”\nOvchinnikova’s close proximity to both the media outlets enabled her to access Oblastnaya Gazeta and Krasnaya Burda’s documents and to speak with teams of both media outlets. This made it possible to present a lot of evidence to the court in the form of awards and prizes that Krasnaya Burda had won for its satirical and humoristic content to show that the article was simply an attempt to increase awareness on the act of bribery through humor. Even though Krasnaya Burda was not a formal party to the case, they collaborated extensively to support Oblastnaya Gazeta since the article was a result of their partnership with Oblastnaya Gazeta.\nOvchinnikova had studied journalism as an undergraduate and had the experience of working as a journalist for over 20 years. She recalled, “The advantages of my experience of being a practicing journalist before becoming a media lawyer was very helpful. It is just like the advantages of being able to speak two languages – it helped me understand the situation better.” Arapova added, “She added a journalistic flavor to the arguments to appeal to the judges’ common sense.”\nThis was also helpful for Shatskikh when she was arguing the matter for the second time at the Kalininsky District Court in Krasnodar region of Russia. She stated, “Elena’s insights from the court proceedings in Volsky and Kirovsky were very helpful when I was engaging in the matter in Kalininsky.” Ovchinnikova added, “Even though we are yet to meet in person, we have collaborated extensively for this matter over video calls and messengers.”\nMMDC also engaged a linguistic expert to analyze the text of the article and determine its genre. Arapova noted that this strategy was not unusual. She stated, “In cases such as this one, which relate to online dissemination of information in Russia, we often refer to linguistic experts for their analysis of the text.” Ovchinnikovaadded, “It is important to engage experts because the Court’s degree of trust regarding non-legal matters lies with the experts of those fields.”\nIn this particular case, MMDC requested the expert opinion of Professor Elizaveta Koltunova, an Associate Professor at the Department of Theoretical and Practical Linguists at the Nizhny Novgorod State University in Russia, who they had also previously invited to provide expertise in other cases. Shatskikh noted, “We gave Koltunova a set of questions about the article. In her report, she answered all the questions, and this assisted the court in determining the nature of the text. Her opinion was very effective and visibly appealed to the judges.” Ovchinnikova concurred and stated, “The linguistic expert’s analysis was a decision-making argument since the court gave it the most importance in its judgment.”\nAn important lesson that the team learned was the need to sensitize the government and bureaucracy about free speech and journalistic freedom in Russia. All lawyers involved in the case were astounded that this type of publication, which was purely satirical in nature, would be considered illegal in Russia. Arapova highlighted the need for European Convention literacy in Russia to increase awareness about free speech and journalistic freedom. She noted “Such unexpected cases arise mainly due to two reasons. First, because individual prosecutors unnecessarily flag content as a bid to show those in power how proactive they are. Second, because they have limited knowledge in the area of digital rights and free speech.” Arapova further added that victories through strategic litigation can also be used to push for broader reforms outside the courtroom.\nIt is interesting to note that several collaborations, in this case, were a natural result of years of network and relationship-building efforts. Ovchinnikova, for example,was a part of MMDC’s network and instrumental in ensuring a positive outcome. Hence, this case is an example of how long-term collaborations help overcome short-term logistical barriers. It also shows how capitalizing on each other’s strengths can enable successful strategic litigation."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:248c4ee6-6be0-492b-bc05-f8de2136b888>","<urn:uuid:edc1feb6-75c0-4e33-88fe-9da4d6c2977f>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Why is the Montreal Protocol considered successful, and how does it relate to cancer prevention strategies?","answer":"The Montreal Protocol, finalized in 1987, is considered one of the most successful global environmental agreements because it effectively phased out ozone-depleting substances like CFCs, leading to the ozone layer's expected recovery by 2066 over Antarctica. The protocol has achieved a 99.7% reduction in CFC use, demonstrating successful global cooperation. This relates to cancer prevention through risk reduction strategies, as the protocol helps protect against UV radiation exposure, which is a modifiable risk factor for skin cancer. Like other cancer prevention approaches that focus on reducing known risk factors (such as smoking cessation or protection from workplace chemicals), the Montreal Protocol addresses environmental factors that can lead to cancer development.","context":["Ozone is in the stratosphere, formed naturally through the interactions of solar ultraviolet radiation with molecular oxygen. In 1985 Jonathan Shankin was a junior researcher at BAS when he discovered a Ozone hole in the invisible shield that protects us from solar radiation, which absorbs harmful UV rays from the sun. It’s 38 years since scientists first discovered the hole in the ozone layer.\nWhat is an Ozone hole?\nOzone hole refers to the depletion of the Ozone layer in the Stratosphere. Ozone depletion leads to an increase in the temperature as the solar radiation reaches the surface of the earth unhindered and unfiltered. This Ozone hole was once considered the gravest danger for planetary life on earth. This recovery is on track, due to the success of the Montreal Protocol.\nTable of Contents\nWhat is Montreal protocol?\nThe Montreal Protocol was finalized in 1987, it is a global agreement to protect the stratospheric ozone layer by phasing out the production and consumption of ozone-depleting substances. Ultraviolet rays can damage DNA and cause sunburn, increasing the long-term risk of skin cancer. Mainly, Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), which are commonly found in objects which we use for our daily kinds of stuff like fridges, foam insulation, and air conditioners, were blamed for damaging the ozone layer. So, this international agreement in 1987 was made to stop using harmful chemicals that damage the ozone layers. Human action hopefully worked, and it may recover in just decades, the UN reports.\nAccording to the Panel’s report, if current policies remain in place, then the layer may be expected to recover by decades. Over the Antarctic, this recovery is expected by around 2066. It is because of variations in the size of the Antarctic Ozone hole, particularly between the years 2019 and 2021. It is driven largely by meteorological conditions, UN reports.\nOzone recovery is on track according to the latest report in fantastic news. Over 38 years of maintaining protocol, has become a true champion for the environment. Many Scientists, professors tweeted about Ozone layer depletion.\nMentioning “Let’s talk about the most successful global scale cooperation in history: Montreal Protocol”\nDerek Thompson (The staff writer at The Atlantica) also tweeted regarding ozone depletion, “What happened is scientists discovered chlorofluorocarbons were bad for the ozone. The Montreal Protocol was signed and CFC use fell by 99.7%, leading to the stabilization of the ozone layer, perhaps the greatest example of global co-operation in history”.\nImpacts on Climate Change\nOzone depletion and climate change are linked in a number of ways, but ozone depletion is not a major cause of climate change. Actually, research says HFCs do not directly deplete ozone, but powerful climate change gases do.\nThe Montreal Protocol already benefitted efforts to mitigate climate change, helping avoid global warming by an estimated 0.5 degrees Celsius.\nThe panel said that it’s estimated the amendment will avoid 0.3-0.5 degrees Celsius of warming by 2100.\nWhile the report has been upcoming with positive side – and evidence that rapid international action to avert environmental crisis can work – it warns that continued progress on the ozone layer is not guaranteed. For example, the proposal to limit global warming by sending millions of tonnes of Sulphur dioxide into the upper atmosphere – known as stratospheric aerosol injection – could drastically reverse the ozone layer’s recovery.\nThe climate change crisis is worldwide and questioning what are the issue living and plantations going to have. So, much research is going through to find a precautionary method to save lives. What is climate change? And how Earth is going to tackle everything because of global warming. We are glad that we are getting into the safe zone from the gravest danger of ozone depletion.","Cancer prevention takes 2 basic forms: early detection and risk reduction. The purpose of early detection is to reduce the mortality associated with a cancer that already exists, but has yet to produce symptoms. This is the primary rationale for most cancer screening tests.\nThe purpose of risk reduction is to decrease the chances that a cancer will develop in the first place. The more we can learn about what causes cancer, the more likely we are to find ways to prevent it. In the laboratory, scientists explore possible causes of cancer and try to determine exactly what happens in cells when they become cancerous. Researchers also study patterns of cancer in the population to look for risk factors, conditions that increase the chance that cancer might occur and protective factors, which decrease the risk of cancer.\nWhat researchers do know is that cancer develops over time and is often due to a complex mix of factors including lifestyle, genetics, and environment.\nModifiable Risk Factors\nTo reduce the risk of cancer, concentrate on changing risk factors you can control.\nSmoking affects every cell in the body. When a cigarette is inhaled, the smoke and chemicals move into the bloodstream through the lungs. In the bloodstream, these harmful chemicals travel throughout the body. Some may be filtered by the kidneys, which produce urine. Urine is stored in the bladder until it is eliminated from the body. Other substances may be filtered by the liver or eliminated through the colon and rectum. Exposure to these chemicals causes irritation to cells and tissues. Long-term irritation is associated with changes in cells that can eventually lead to cancer.\nSmoking and using smokeless tobacco products and regular exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (secondhand smoke) are responsible for nearly one-third of all cancer deaths in the United States each year. Smoking is also associated with approximately 85% of all lung cancer deaths.\nPeople who smoke cigars or pipes have a risk for cancers of the oral cavity that is similar to the risk for people who smoke cigarettes. Cigar smokers also have an increased chance of developing cancers of the lung, larynx, esophagus, and pancreas. The use of smokeless tobacco (chewing tobacco and snuff) causes cancer of the mouth and throat.\nThere are several tools and options available to help you successfully quit smoking.\nWhile dietary factors clearly have a role to play, the connection between diet and cancer is complex and still not well understood. Some evidence suggests a link between a high-fat diet and colorectal, uterine, and prostate cancers. On the other hand, some studies suggest that foods containing fiber may help protect against colorectal cancer, though this has recently come into question. As a general rule, it is better to eat a well-balanced diet that includes nonsaturated fats, fruits and vegetables, and whole grains.\nObesity has been linked to cancers of the breast (among older women), prostate, pancreas, uterus, colon, and ovary. If you are overweight, talk to your doctor about how to safely lose the excess weight. A dietitian can help with meal planning. Once the weight is lost, it is important to take steps to maintain weight in a healthy range.\nIn the past, some studies suggested that antioxidant vitamins (C and E) and minerals (selenium) reduce the risk of certain cancers. More recent studies however, have failed to substantiate these findings. Similar conclusions are found with essential vitamins and dietary supplements, such as vitamin D and calcium. Herbs, vitamins, and supplements may interfere with traditional medications. Consult with your doctor before taking any medications. A dietitian can help with suggestions to get essential vitamins and minerals with proper nutrition.\nPhysical activity improves overall health and well-being. Regular exercise benefits the heart, blood vessels, muscles, bones, and mental health. Research also suggests a link between exercise and a reduced risk of cancer. Recommendations encourage at least 30 minutes of aerobic exercise per day on most days of the week. Aerobic exercise can be as simple as taking a brisk walk every day. Strength training can be done at least 2 days per week. More participation in physical activity increases health benefits.\nTalk to your doctor before starting any exercise plan.\nHeavy drinkers have an increased risk of cancers of the mouth, throat, esophagus, larynx, stomach, colon and breast, and liver. People who smoke cigarettes and drink heavily have an especially high risk of getting these cancers.\nThere is some evidence to support moderate drinking to reduce the risk of certain cancers. Moderate alcohol intake is 1-2 drinks per day for men and no more than 1 drink per day for women. It is not necessary to consume alcohol in order to gain health benefits if you choose not to drink.\nRadiation is all around us. Over time, exposure can lead to alterations in the cell structure or its DNA. These changes can sometimes lead to cancer.\n- Ultraviolet (UV) light from the sun—Causes premature aging of the skin and the 2 most common kinds of skin cancer, squamous cell and basal cell. UV light comes from other sources, like tanning booths and sunlamps. UV radiation has also been linked to melanoma, a skin cancer that can spread throughout the body causing death.\n- Ionizing radiation—From x-rays, radioactive substances, or other sources that cause cellular damage and DNA replication. Short- and long-term exposures increase cancer risk. Talk to your doctor or dentist before procedures that may expose you to radiation.\n- Radiation therapy for cancer may increase the risk of another cancer developing in the area where the treatment is aimed. Modern radiation therapy equipment is designed to deliver the minimum doses needed while still being effective. If you need radiation therapy, talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits.\nProtect yourself from UV light by:\n- Wearing protective clothing in the sun.\n- Staying in the shade when possible.\n- Wearing a wide-brimmed hat to protect your face.\n- Using broad-spectrum (UVA, UVB) sunscreen with sun protection factor (SPF)-15 or higher.\n- Using sunglasses that block UVA and UVB rays.\n- Avoiding the sun when it is strongest during the day (10 am-3 pm).\n- Avoiding the use of tanning booths or lamps.\nRepeated exposure to many chemicals commonly found in the workplace can increase the risk of cancer. Asbestos, nickel, cadmium, uranium, radon, vinyl chloride, benzidine, and benzene are examples of well-known carcinogens in the workplace. For example, inhaling asbestos fibers increases the risk of mesothelioma, a rare type of lung cancer. It is important to follow work and safety rules to avoid or minimize contact with dangerous materials. In general, employers are required to provide employees with information (material safety data sheets, [MSDS]) about dangerous chemicals in the workplace and the ways to protect against exposure.\nThese chemical may act alone or together with another carcinogen, such as cigarette smoke, to increase the risk of cancer.\nDoctors may recommend estrogen alone or in combination with progesterone (hormone replacement therapy) to control menopausal symptoms, such as hot flashes and vaginal dryness. Some studies have shown that the use of estrogen alone increases the risk of cancer of the uterus, which can be avoided by adding progesterone. Using both, though, has been recently shown to increase the risk of breast cancer along with other adverse effects. Because it is no longer clear that the risks of hormone replacement therapy outweigh the benefits, be sure to carefully review your options with your doctor.\n- Reviewer: Mohei Abouzied, MD\n- Review Date: 01/2016 -\n- Update Date: 05/13/2015 -"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:3e73b547-c2de-4505-abdb-a3ccaa7181f1>","<urn:uuid:438353b7-c02f-4761-b093-76463920a4a4>"],"error":null}

The final authenticated version is available online at: http://doi.org/10.1007/s00244-020-00724-z\nWetlands and their biodiversity are constantly threatened by contaminant pollution from urbanisation. Despite evidence suggesting that snakes are good bioindicators of environmental health, the bioaccumulation of contaminants in reptiles is poorly researched in Australia. We conducted the first broad-scale analysis of 17 metals and trace elements, 21 organochlorine pesticides, and 14 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the sediments (4 samples per site, December 2018) from four wetlands along an urban gradient in Perth, Western Australia, and from the livers (5 livers per site, February–April 2019) of western tiger snakes Notechis scutatus occidentalis captured at those sites. All 17 metals and trace elements were detected in the sediments of wetlands as well as 16 in the livers of tiger snakes. Arsenic, Cu, Hg, Pb, Se, and Zn were at concentrations exceeding government trigger values in at least one sediment sample. Two organochlorine pesticides and six of seven polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were detected in the sediments of a single wetland, all exceeding government trigger values, but were not detected in tiger snakes. Metals and trace elements were generally in higher concentration in sediments and snake livers from more heavily urbanised wetlands. The least urbanised site had some higher concentrations of metals and trace elements, possibly due to agriculture contaminated groundwater. Concentrations of nine metals and trace elements in snake livers were statistically different between sites. Arsenic, Cd, Co, Hg, Mo, Sb, and Se near paralleled the pattern of contamination measured in the wetland sediments; this supports the use of high trophic wetland snakes, such as tiger snakes, as bioindicators of wetland contamination.

{"question":"How do artists Omar Ba and Guy Woueté differ in their approach to addressing social issues in their artwork?","answer":"While both artists engage with social issues, they take different approaches. Guy Woueté creates works that explicitly focus on social criticism, particularly addressing borders, colonial history, and symbols of domination in globalization. He uses multiple mediums including performance, video, and installations to explore these themes, often drawing from historical sources to challenge discrimination and paternalism. In contrast, Omar Ba creates dense, painterly works using mixed media on corrugated cardboard, featuring a confusing and often threatening visual universe of competing images including flags, fighters, and logos. Ba specifically notes that while people often view such issues from a political angle, he prefers to approach them from a social perspective, creating more visually complex and symbolically layered compositions.","context":["En quête des marges fluctuantes\nFrench, English → NL, FR, EN\nFor five days during the festival, three people, one of whom is the Cameroonian visual artist Guy Woueté, will be holding up banners in public spaces in Brussels. The banners will feature thoughts and words, including some written by Woueté himself, alternating between quotations from poetry and political demands / slogans. By putting bodies to work in the public space for eight hours a day, En quête des marges fluctuantes challenges what people see. What is work today? What does statutory working time mean in a society in which the people who work the most are not always the ones with a job, and where those who do have a job feel they are getting a raw deal from the people who only argue in terms of growth, profitability, and optimisation? In this sit-in performance, Guy Woueté refutes the famous “work harder to earn more” slogan touted by governments on both the right and left who are refusing to start a debate on universal income or the retirement of future generations.

You helped found it I understand?\nLC: Yes, I became heavily involved with the inaugural year after Touria El Glaoui approached me to find out what I thought about the idea creating of a contemporary African art fair. Touria is connected to art through her family (her father is a renowned artist), but she didn’t have a background in the art business, so she had this great, fresh perspective on everything that was going on in the art world. I thought it was a great idea and we both felt the time was right given the lack of visibility around African art. That first year Koyo Kouoh and I helped as much as we could to get the fair off the ground but there was very little other support or understanding of what we were trying to do. We were running things on a shoestring. That first year we had 17 participating galleries, this year there are 40 galleries spread across three wings of Somerset House and the fair is now a fixture on Frieze week art calendar.\nNH: And so when was this?\nLC: 2012… What most people don’t know is that it took a year and a mammoth amount of research to get it going, looking at potential participating artists and galleries, and to see if the market was ready for the fair…\nNH: And what was the response of the market when you were testing the waters?\nLC: Well its interesting because there was when we started there were mixed reactions, some support but others were saying things like, ‘it’s a crazy idea… the market is not there yet… you’re ahead of the curve, not just by a few years, but by a lot!’ and some people even thought that it was a bad idea centre a fair on African art at all…\nNH: Because of the danger of pigeonholing artists as ‘African’ rather than just been artists?\nLC: Yes, precisely, the continent is so diverse even discussing ‘African’ art can seem nonsensical, but what came out of our research at the time was the fact that in the main fairs the proportion of African art on view was just 0.05%! So as far as we were concerned there was need for the focus the fair provides. Also given the continent is made up of 54 countries – hence the title of the fair – there’s a huge diversity and variety of artistic practice to draw which wasn’t getting the recognition it deserves.\nNH: Hussam, as a collector and, through Floreat, the sponsor, what’s your take on this issue of having a fair defined by an identity like African?\nHO: Well personally, I’m interested in great artists, wherever they’re from… at the same time we all have many identities and so I don’t have a problem with it. As a sponsor, I think there is something particularly interesting about 1:54. An art fair, by definition is about circulating art and creating new markets and, Laetitia, what you said about the low levels of representation of African artists in other fairs is, for me, a winning argument for establishing 1:54, even given the problematic nature of identity, or labels… and to put it simply we collected some spectacular artists at 1:54 last year, and all artists were new to me… so…\nNH: Obviously I agree. Equally, it’s interesting to watch the art market’s effect on content, and to see the kind of content that ends up being amplified by the market. I’ve been going to the Dubai Art Fair for a long time, since just after it started and I think a kind of market friendly Middle Eastern art aesthetic emerged, which often revolved around a sort of pop-art treatment of calligraphic forms…\ncontemporary art that was explicitly ‘Middle Eastern’… so I guess there’s a danger that by identifying a market as ‘Middle Eastern’, ‘African’ or ‘Chinese’, you might start encouraging collectors to look for work that ‘looks’ like whatever any of those identities is deemed to ‘look like’ in the market…\nLC: Yes…that could be a danger but the fair is extremely lucky to have Koyo Kouoh on board who works across Africa, Europe and the US. Her work has seen her serve as advisor to the artistic director for dOCUMENTA and serve as a member of the Golden Lion Jury at the Venice Biennale, she has a rigorous approach. This means that the way we look at selection is to simply look for outstanding artists, not for any particular practice, message, or view.\nHO: That’s true, because if I think back to last year, I mean, yes, there were some artists whose identity seemed to be ‘African’, in their concerns at least, but most of the artists, just seemed to me to be good, contemporary, artists.\nLC: After going round the fair, in any year, you realise that there may be some common threads but they’re not what you’d expect them to be. What’s also interesting is seeing how the art scene has evolved in Africa over the last few years. I’ve just came back from Accra, Ghana where the lack of state funding means the scene is driven by private galleries, collectives and self-funded street art festivals. It’s a great example of how artists themselves are forging ahead. Elsewhere new galleries and museums are opening and private collectors are looking to open institutions in Nigeria, Côte d’Ivoire and South Africa, to name a few. There has been increase in artistic infrastructure on the continent at all levels. Internationally, the focus on contemporary African art has grown massively. Sotheby’s have recently launched an African Art department and African artists have big solo shows in leading contemporary galleries and museums across the globe; for example, next year contemporary African art will take centre stage at Fondation Louis Vuitton with an exhibition dedicated to 15 emerging artists from South Africa and exhibition of works from the Jean Pigozzi collection. African artists both at home and throughout the diaspora have increasing prominence and I think 1.54, along with general rise in interest in contemporary African art, both in Africa and outside has helped make that happen. It’s a very exciting time for contemporary African art.\n“Maybe the most common theme within my work, the physicality and also the process of the work is… the idea of labour and capital”. Young, Ghanaian artist, (b. 1987), Ibrahim Mahama, captured the attention of the art world with a series of astonishing, epic public art works he staged initially in Ghana and subsequently seen internationally including at the last Venice Biennale, where he covered buildings and public spaces with vast blankets of jute sacks and cloth bags sewn together. Manama found something poetic and structurally revealing in the typical life cycle of jute bags in his city. Originally manufactured to carry cocoa once, the bags would often be reused to carry food and finally coal. As the sacks circulated they would often become marked with names and numbers and sometimes embroidered or ornamented. Mahama explains that, “the coal sacks began as an extension of how the body could be looked at”. The physicality of the works, the marks, their history, make visible, tangentially, the world of material exchange and the many flows within it.\nGeneva based, Senegalese artist Omar Bar (b.1977) creates, dense, both visually and materially, painterly, works using a rich mix of oil, gouache and acrylic, typically onto corrugated cardboard. His visual universe is a confusing, often threatening and dark scramble of images; flags, fighters, logos, strange animals, thick vegetation and boldly and often singly depicted figures all compete on paintings’ crowded surfaces for attention.\n“I wouldn’t say I am an activist but I am interested in social issues. I see human suffering. People usually portray it under a political angle; I prefer to do so under a social angle.” Abdoulaye Konaté (b. 1953, Mali) has, since the 1990’s, when he stopped easel painting, used dyed, painted and embroidered textiles as his medium. It was a development that drew on Konate’s deep engagement with Malian history and tradition, having worked at the National Museum of Mali for two decades – namely the importance of textiles as a medium of communication within West African culture. Critics have also referenced the Mandé – the Malian hunting tunic – as a symbolic influence on the form of his work. Whilst one strand of Konate’s work is abstract, another, of which Generation Biometrique no. 5 is a prime example, is figurative and directly political work. Finished in 2013 the work addresses the politics and power dynamics around the issue of immigration into Europe and the now standard biometric testing of all immigrants and the cataloguing of each person according to a standard set of metrics.\n“My work explores the theme of identity and what that means for me. It is concerned with the female experience both personal and universal.” Born in 1973 in Blantyre, Malawi, raised in Botswana and now based in Johannesburg, Billie Zangewa creates beautiful, figurative tapestries and collages, typically in cut silk. A self-confessed ‘fashion fanatic’ from the age of 10, Zangewa studied printmaking and graphic design and, upon graduation, started making elaborately decorated handbags, that, over the time, became increasingly deconstructed till they emerged as tapestries. Zangewa explains the process of how each work begins: “I start off with an experience that elicits an emotion. The emotion then inspires an image that examines and narrates the experience.’ Describing her work as often autobiographical, her work centres around a powerful depiction of her identity, without being circumscribed by that as a subject.\nAs anyone who saw Boomerang, his solo show at at the Serpentine own London last year, can testify, Pascale Martine Tayou’s art is bewildering, playful, frenetic, sprawling, absurd and serious by turns and uninterested in being easily defined. A lawyer by training Tayou (b. 1970 Cameroon), began making art in the 1990’s. He marked this transition in a very public and indicative act of self-redefinition, by feminizing his name, adding an ‘e’ to the end of Pascal and Martin. This ironic scrambling of received notions of identity embodied Tayou’s method of teasing out serious points from a playful and very personal perspective. Chalk Fresco is one of the largest of Tayou’s Chlak series, in which he fill frames with pieces of coloured chalk, creating vast, energetic, tactile, abstract surfaces. Tayou describes the series as an “act of revenge on a certain kind of education” in the sense that coloured chalks represented play, as against the white chalk of education and functionality, “it’s also a way of showing the origin of what I have become today”."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:c24895dc-1d6d-4cc6-8f34-6a4cff0525ce>","<urn:uuid:68c3f8b9-9708-439d-a211-d8eb28aefdbb>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What role does language learning play in global education, and what barriers exist in providing equal educational opportunities?","answer":"Language learning plays a crucial role in global education by enabling communication with people from different parts of the world and providing insights into other cultures. For example, learning Mandarin reveals cultural aspects through language structure, such as the use of 'da jia hao' (big family hello) reflecting collectivist culture. Additionally, language learning helps understand the subjective nature of language and world perceptions. However, there are significant barriers to providing equal educational opportunities, including social attitudes, economic disparities, and accessibility issues. These barriers particularly affect disadvantaged students and require addressing through community outreach programs, federal policy changes, and ensuring equitable resource allocation in public education.","context":["Student Voice: Three Ways My K-12 Education Gave Me a Global Mindset\nEditor's intro: Hana McMahon-Cole is a student of Minerva Schools at Keck Graduate Institute. Minerva students have no physical university campus. Instead, they study in different countries, taking classes online. Hana has already visited South Korea and India through her program. Here, she shares how her K-12 education has prepared her to be a global citizen.\nBy guest blogger Hana McMahon-Cole\nAs I reflect on the experiences I had this year, I realize that what both led and prepared me for my experiences abroad can be attributed to my K-12 education in Lincoln, Nebraska. Below, I share three of the opportunities I took advantage of throughout my K-12 education that prepared me for global citizenship.\nLearn Another Language\nLearning Mandarin at an early age prepared me to study and live abroad.\nI began working with a Mandarin tutor in second grade and continued studying with tutors all the way up until my third year of high school. Through these tutors I was able to get connected with a larger Chinese network in Lincoln, which led to other opportunities to practice speaking the language and to learn more about Chinese culture. I joined a weekend Chinese club for 6-8th graders in middle school and attended events hosted by the Confucius Institute, for example Chinese New Year celebrations. With each event or class, my interest and desire to pursue learning the Chinese language grew.\nAs I learned more Mandarin, studying categorization structures and picking up on grammatical nuances, I began to notice cultural differences embedded in the language structure. As an example, when addressing a large crowd in Mandarin, one often begins with \"da jia hao,\" which means \"big family hello.\" These linguistic choices underscore the homogeneity of the Chinese population (99 percent Han Chinese) and draw attention to the collectivist, rather than individualistic, nature of the culture. Similarly, in terms of categorization differences, Mandarin has a comparatively large vocabulary to describe different types of noodles, how they are cooked, and how they are cut, an area where English lacks the same extent of terminology.\nMy dedication to learning Mandarin both inside and outside of the classroom throughout my K-12 education led to my advancement in Chinese and resulted in numerous opportunities to pursue other languages.\nLearning a second language is incredibly valuable. Not only does it allow you the unique ability to communicate with people from a different part of the world, but it also offers insight into another culture, and it widens an individual's understanding of the subjective rather than objective nature of language and even our perceptions of the world.\nParticipate in Extracurricular Activities\nThroughout my K-12 education, I was involved in a range of sports, clubs, and extracurricular activities, including an afterschool sign language club, the school chess club, science Olympiad, cross-country running, and tennis.\nParticipating in extracurricular activities also helped balance my academic course load, make new friends, and learn new skills. There was no specific extracurricular activity that was the most important; rather, it was more about having the experience of pursuing activities that I was interested in outside of the classroom and having new experiences that expanded my horizons and helped me adopt a more global mindset.\nTake Global Education Courses\nWhile Mandarin has unlocked many opportunities later in life, the same could be said for my global education at Lincoln High School, a curriculum that emphasized rigorous courses, project-based learning, and international content.\nMy school offered a range of curriculum options: a traditional course load, Advanced Placement (AP) courses, International Baccalaureate (IB) courses, zoo school, entrepreneurship program, and art school. However, the International Baccalaureate (IB) program, which boasts an academically rigorous, internationally focused program was, for me, the most enticing option. This program resulted in a challenging but rewarding academic experience through project-based learning and global content.\nProject-based learning challenges students to focus on a problem or issue in an interdisciplinary way. For me, this project component was far more challenging than exams or testing. Like many students, I had mastered the art of test prep, easily able to regurgitate material in a way that resulted in high marks. However, when I needed to apply concepts to address abstract problems, I found that I needed to learn in a completely different way. Indeed, this early shift towards project-based, collaborative learning was immensely beneficial after high school, where problem-solving seldom involves a timed test, two #2 pencils, or calculator.\nThe International Baccalaureate program provided me with global content, pushing me to think, read, and reflect on events, people, and ideas from other countries and cultures. Being educated in this way has opened my mind to the similarities between people and cultures and the need for similar skills and knowledge.\nAs an example, between our first and second year of the program all students were required to complete an \"extended essay,\" which, as described by IB, is \"an independent self-directed piece of research\" of around 4,000 words. For this assignment, I focused on the rights of migrant workers in China. This choice resulted in hours of research on human rights, Chinese history, contemporary Chinese culture and migrant workers around the world. Putting together all the pieces of my research, I was able to hone in on the rights of migrant workers in China, placed within a global and historical context.\nWhile IB is an internationally-focused curriculum, it is by no means the only way to have a globally-oriented education. Most public high schools offer an array of courses such as language classes, world history classes, and geography that also provide global content and nudge students to think beyond national borders and to embrace diversity and difference.\nTime in Asia\nThis year, living in two different Asian countries, I was confronted with a range of exciting new opportunities, and I tried to take advantage of as many as possible. During my semester in Seoul, South Korea, I connected with a bubbly French researcher from Ewha Women's University at a school networking event. She pitched a biodiversity project she wanted to pursue, and I eagerly joined her team and began making a weekly trek to the green, forest-like Ewha campus to work with her. This casual proposal became a three-month project that I worked on with several classmates, during which we used GIS mapping technology to identify key species in Seoul, assessed the current state of biodiversity-related policies in South Korea, and synthesized information we found to make recommendations to the government's head of green spaces. Confidently pursuing an interdisciplinary project of this scale was no doubt a culmination of the many project-based learning experiences that had been spaced out through my K-12 education.\nBeyond taking advantage of this project in Seoul, I found tremendous value in the smaller, more casual invitations that I accepted. This was especially true in Hyderabad, India, where accessible, cheap transport and interesting opportunities led to trips with friends to a rural Indian wedding, a motorcycling adventure to the experimental community of Auroville, camping in Hampi, or lounging (and taking a class) on the beaches of Goa. I could have easily passed on these opportunities to get more sleep or to study, but, ultimately, those experiences allowed me to see India and learn about a country full of warm people, exciting tastes, and pulsing with 21st-century energy. Balancing these adventures with my academic workload was often challenging, but I was able to manage I had experienced throughout K-12, where I learned the value of managing school work with other commitments.\nMy K-12 education not only prepared me for these educational and research opportunities in college, but it also opened the door to amazing adventures, experiences, and friendships in Asia and beyond.\n- The first picture (mountains with Seoul in the background) was taken by Adrian Goe.\n- The second picture (featuring Hana) was taken by Antonio Fowl Stark.\n- The third picture was taken by Yasmin Bar-Tzlil, featuring Mason Noteboom and Hana.","Overcoming barriers to equal education—access to education series addressing the barriers affecting the disabled may help enhance access to education for all students barriers erected by social attitudes toward the disabled can be addressed by community outreach programs that raise awareness and dispel myths about disabilities.

{"question":"How does Madagascar's location affect the climate of mainland southern Africa?","answer":"Madagascar's location in the southwestern Indian Ocean affects mainland southern Africa's climate in two main ways. First, it reduces the impact of moist trade winds on the Mozambique coast and decreases the likelihood of tropical cyclone landfall there. Second, it contributes to the relative aridity of the Limpopo region in northern South Africa/southern Zimbabwe.","context":["Southern Africa extends from the equator to about 34°S and is essentially a narrow, peninsular land mass bordered to its south, west, and east by oceans. Its termination in the mid-ocean subtropics has important consequences for regional climate, since it allows the strongest western boundary current in the world ocean (warm Agulhas Current) to be in close proximity to an intense eastern boundary upwelling current (cold Benguela Current). Unlike other western boundary currents, the Agulhas retroflects south of the land mass and flows back into the South Indian Ocean, thereby leading to a large area of anomalously warm water south of South Africa which may influence storm development over the southern part of the land mass. Two other unique regional ocean features imprint on the climate of southern Africa—the Angola-Benguela Frontal Zone (ABFZ) and the Seychelles-Chagos thermocline ridge (SCTR). The former is important for the development of Benguela Niños and flood events over southwestern Africa, while the SCTR influences Madden-Julian Oscillation and tropical cyclone activity in the western Indian Ocean. In addition to South Atlantic and South Indian Ocean influences, there are climatic implications of the neighboring Southern Ocean.\nAlong with Benguela Niños, the southern African climate is strongly impacted by ENSO and to lesser extent by the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) and sea-surface temperature (SST) dipole events in the Indian and South Atlantic Oceans. The regional land–sea distribution leads to a highly variable climate on a range of scales that is still not well understood due to its complexity and its sensitivity to a number of different drivers. Strong and variable gradients in surface characteristics exist not only in the neighboring oceans but also in several aspects of the land mass, and these all influence the regional climate and its interactions with climate modes of variability.\nMuch of the interior of southern Africa consists of a plateau 1 to 1.5 km high and a narrow coastal belt that is particularly mountainous in South Africa, leading to sharp topographic gradients. The topography is able to influence the track and development of many weather systems, leading to marked gradients in rainfall and vegetation across southern Africa.\nThe presence of the large island of Madagascar, itself a region of strong topographic and rainfall gradients, has consequences for the climate of the mainland by reducing the impact of the moist trade winds on the Mozambique coast and the likelihood of tropical cyclone landfall there. It is also likely that at least some of the relativity aridity of the Limpopo region in northern South Africa/southern Zimbabwe results from the location of Madagascar in the southwestern Indian Ocean.\nWhile leading to challenges in understanding its climate variability and change, the complex geography of southern Africa offers a very useful test bed for improving the global models used in many institutions for climate prediction. Thus, research into the relative shortcomings of the models in the southern African region may lead not only to better understanding of southern African climate but also to enhanced capability to predict climate globally.\nStorms are characterized by high wind speeds; often large precipitation amounts in the form of rain, freezing rain, or snow; and thunder and lightning (for thunderstorms). Many different types exist, ranging from tropical cyclones and large storms of the midlatitudes to small polar lows, Medicanes, thunderstorms, or tornadoes. They can lead to extreme weather events like storm surges, flooding, high snow quantities, or bush fires. Storms often pose a threat to human lives and property, agriculture, forestry, wildlife, ships, and offshore and onshore industries. Thus, it is vital to gain knowledge about changes in storm frequency and intensity. Future storm predictions are important, and they depend to a great extent on the evaluation of changes in wind statistics of the past.\nTo obtain reliable statistics, long and homogeneous time series over at least some decades are needed. However, wind measurements are frequently influenced by changes in the synoptic station, its location or surroundings, instruments, and measurement practices. These factors deteriorate the homogeneity of wind records. Storm indexes derived from measurements of sea-level pressure are less prone to such changes, as pressure does not show very much spatial variability as wind speed does. Long-term historical pressure measurements exist that enable us to deduce changes in storminess for more than the last 140 years. But storm records are not just compiled from measurement data; they also may be inferred from climate model data.\nThe first numerical weather forecasts were performed in the 1950s. These served as a basis for the development of atmospheric circulation models, which were the first generation of climate models or general-circulation models. Soon afterward, model data was analyzed for storm events and cyclone-tracking algorithms were programmed. Climate models nowadays have reached high resolution and reliability and can be run not just for the past, but also for future emission scenarios which return possible future storm activity.\nWhat are the local consequences of a global climate change? This question is important for proper handling of risks associated with weather and climate. It also tacitly assumes that there is a systematic link between conditions taking place on a global scale and local effects. It is the utilization of the dependency of local climate on the global picture that is the backbone of downscaling; however, it is perhaps easiest to explain the concept of downscaling in climate research if we start asking why it is necessary.\nGlobal climate models are our best tools for computing future temperature, wind, and precipitation (or other climatological variables), but their limitations do not let them calculate local details for these quantities. It is simply not adequate to interpolate from model results. However, the models are able to predict large-scale features, such as circulation patterns, El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and the global mean temperature. The local temperature and precipitation are nevertheless related to conditions taking place over a larger surrounding region as well as local geographical features (also true, in general, for variables connected to weather/climate). This, of course, also applies to other weather elements.\nDownscaling makes use of systematic dependencies between local conditions and large-scale ambient phenomena in addition to including information about the effect of the local geography on the local climate. The application of downscaling can involve several different approaches. This article will discuss various downscaling strategies and methods and will elaborate on their rationale, assumptions, strengths, and weaknesses.\nOne important issue is the presence of spontaneous natural year-to-year variations that are not necessarily directly related to the global state, but are internally generated and superimposed on the long-term climate change. These variations typically involve phenomena such as ENSO, the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), and the Southeast Asian monsoon, which are nonlinear and non-deterministic.\nWe cannot predict the exact evolution of non-deterministic natural variations beyond a short time horizon. It is possible nevertheless to estimate probabilities for their future state based, for instance, on projections with models run many times with slightly different set-up, and thereby to get some information about the likelihood of future outcomes.\nWhen it comes to downscaling and predicting regional and local climate, it is important to use many global climate model predictions. Another important point is to apply proper validation to make sure the models give skillful predictions.\nFor some downscaling approaches such as regional climate models, there usually is a need for bias adjustment due to model imperfections. This means the downscaling doesn’t get the right answer for the right reason. Some of the explanations for the presence of biases in the results may be different parameterization schemes in the driving global and the nested regional models.\nA final underlying question is: What can we learn from downscaling? The context for the analysis is important, as downscaling is often used to find answers to some (implicit) question and can be a means of extracting most of the relevant information concerning the local climate. It is also important to include discussions about uncertainty, model skill or shortcomings, model validation, and skill scores.\nChristopher K. Wikle\nThe climate system consists of interactions between physical, biological, chemical, and human processes across a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. Characterizing the behavior of components of this system is crucial for scientists and decision makers. There is substantial uncertainty associated with observations of this system as well as our understanding of various system components and their interaction. Thus, inference and prediction in climate science should accommodate uncertainty in order to facilitate the decision-making process. Statistical science is designed to provide the tools to perform inference and prediction in the presence of uncertainty. In particular, the field of spatial statistics considers inference and prediction for uncertain processes that exhibit dependence in space and/or time. Traditionally, this is done descriptively through the characterization of the first two moments of the process, one expressing the mean structure and one accounting for dependence through covariability.\nHistorically, there are three primary areas of methodological development in spatial statistics: geostatistics, which considers processes that vary continuously over space; areal or lattice processes, which considers processes that are defined on a countable discrete domain (e.g., political units); and, spatial point patterns (or point processes), which consider the locations of events in space to be a random process. All of these methods have been used in the climate sciences, but the most prominent has been the geostatistical methodology. This methodology was simultaneously discovered in geology and in meteorology and provides a way to do optimal prediction (interpolation) in space and can facilitate parameter inference for spatial data. These methods rely strongly on Gaussian process theory, which is increasingly of interest in machine learning. These methods are common in the spatial statistics literature, but much development is still being done in the area to accommodate more complex processes and “big data” applications. Newer approaches are based on restricting models to neighbor-based representations or reformulating the random spatial process in terms of a basis expansion. There are many computational and flexibility advantages to these approaches, depending on the specific implementation. Complexity is also increasingly being accommodated through the use of the hierarchical modeling paradigm, which provides a probabilistically consistent way to decompose the data, process, and parameters corresponding to the spatial or spatio-temporal process.\nPerhaps the biggest challenge in modern applications of spatial and spatio-temporal statistics is to develop methods that are flexible yet can account for the complex dependencies between and across processes, account for uncertainty in all aspects of the problem, and still be computationally tractable. These are daunting challenges, yet it is a very active area of research, and new solutions are constantly being developed. New methods are also being rapidly developed in the machine learning community, and these methods are increasingly more applicable to dependent processes. The interaction and cross-fertilization between the machine learning and spatial statistics community is growing, which will likely lead to a new generation of spatial statistical methods that are applicable to climate science."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:1ec79811-8028-4320-b068-f49f5ab27742>"],"error":null}

Blue-Throated Macaws are highly endangered with only around 350 specimens remaining in the wild, primarily due to extensive capture for the pet trade over the last 30 years. Their capture and sale is now forbidden. Similarly, many Syngnathiformes, particularly seahorses and some pipefish species, are threatened and appear on the IUCN Red List due to exploitation for curios and Traditional Chinese Medicine. As a protective measure, all members of the Syngnathidae and Solenostomidae families are listed as protected species under the Commonwealth Environment Biodiversity and Conservation Act.

They share various specialisations of the skeleton, including the absence of anterior processes directly connecting the pelvic fins to the cleithra, the absence of supramaxillary, orbitosphenoid and basisphenoid bones and the absence of a strong ligament (Baudelot’s ligament) connecting the shoulder girdle to either the posterior cranial base or an anterior vertebra.\nSyngnathiformes vary considerably in size, ranging from one-centimetre long pygmy seahorses to 1.5 metre-long flutemouths. Although most species are cryptically-colored often with dermal appendages to camouflage themselves further, some pipefishes have striking colour patterns.\nBiology and behaviour: Although most are slow moving ambush predators and feed on small crustaceans, the larger flutemouths and trumpetfishes actively prey on other fishes. Pipefishes of the genus Doryrhamphus are known to clean parasites from other reef fishes.Reproduction and early life history: Syngnathiformes exhibit a variety of reproductive strategies. Some form monogamous pair bonds and have complex and elaborate courtship rituals. Members of some families release eggs and sperm directly into the water, whereas seahorses, pipefishes and ghostpipefishes are all egg brooders. Female ghostpipefishes brood their eggs in a pouch formed by their greatly enlarged pelvic fins. The family Syngnathidae – seahorses, pipefishes and their relatives – has the most highly evolved reproductive strategy whereby males brood the eggs. Females lay their eggs either into an enclosed pouch on the male’s abdomen or onto a highly specialised area on the male's underside. Males then incubate and nourish the developing embryos until they are born or hatch as miniature fully-formed young.\nFisheries and aquaculture: Many pipefishes and seahorse species are popular aquarium fishes. Fortunately several species are now aquacultured for sale in the live aquarium trade and the Traditional Chinese Medicine industry.\nConservation Status: Many seahorse and some pipefish species are included on the IUCN Red List of Threatened species due to their exploitation for sale as curios or their use in the Tradition Chinese Medicine Industry. All members of the families Syngnathidae and Solenostomidae are listed as protected species under the Commonwealth Environment Biodiversity and Conservation Act, 1999 (EPBC Act).\nFossil record: Gasterosteiformes have an extensive fossil record dating back to the Eocene. Fossil snipefishes have been found in deposits dating back at least 75 million years near Nardò, southeastern Italy. In addition, the Monte Bolca beds of northeastern Italy, dating back about 52 millions years, contain many fossils of five gasterosteiform families.\nBraga Goncalves, I., Ahnesjö, I. & Kvarnemo, C.

Still, what’s to be gained by finding out more about the Blue-Throated Macaw?\nWhat can we tell you about this bird?\nKnown by the scientific name of ara glaucogularis, it belongs to the parrot family and is endemic to the Moxos plains of northern Bolivia, where it is known as the bluebeard. Although it has been said that there may also be specimens in Paraguay and Chile, this is something that is being questioned today.\nDue to the great demand of the last 30 years for this species to be kept as a pet, its populations are diminished, leaving around 350 specimens at liberty right now and it is forbidden to catch and sell it.\nWithin the family of macaws, is the one that receives more names since it is also known as Caninde macaw, Wagler’s macaw and yellow (not to be confused with the yellow-brown macaw), caninde, canide macaw, light blue-throated macaw and a long etc. of names.\nAnd how is this bird?\nIt could be said that it is one of the largest specimens in the macaw family, measuring between 95 and 105 centimetres and usually weighing around 800 grams. There is no sexual dimorphism, so it is quite difficult to differentiate the male from the female without a DNA test.\nIts back has a blue tone like the back, while the tail gains a light blue tone as it approaches the end of it. Her belly is yellow. Some confuse it with the Ara ararauna, but the big difference is that in the throat it has a large turquoise blue barber, while in the other specimen it is black and less widespread. Its forehead is blue and it has a region without white feathers.\nIt seems that it is a bird that does not present many problems to the presence of humans or other birds, so it could be said that it is a bird entrusted by nature, which has caused many problems in the illegal hunting for subsequent sale with shops.\nIsn’t it possible to keep her as a pet bird?\nAs it is a bird with a high risk of extinction, it is not possible to choose to keep it as a pet bird. Those who have their houses are experienced breeders who have obtained the necessary permits to ensure their continuity by reproducing some specimens to extend the fauna of the same, although it seems that without much success.\nTo begin with, it is a nomadic species, unlike other bird species, which makes it difficult to establish a good habitat for these birds. Their breeding season is between October and December, coinciding with the rainy season, and it seems that they are monogamous birds that spend their entire lives with the same pair.\nNests make them inside dry tree trunks, creating a cavity with their beaks. The female incubates the eggs for an average of 30 days (two to three eggs), while the male incubates them. After that time, the chicks spend about three months in the nest with the mother, until they learn to fly and eventually leave the nest to explore other areas of the home or find a mate."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:426b5e05-f818-4330-bfaf-3cbf0f04467b>","<urn:uuid:288af688-e269-4a76-aa67-2a22e7e6bc4b>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the differences between how Ordinary Time and Advent are observed in terms of their liturgical colors and spiritual significance in the Catholic Church?","answer":"Ordinary Time uses green as its liturgical color, representing hope of Christ's resurrection. It is divided into two sections - one spanning 4-8 weeks between Christmas and Lent, and another lasting about six months after Easter Time, during which the Church considers Jesus' teachings and works. In contrast, Advent uses purple as its liturgical color, symbolizing penance, preparation, and sacrifice. Advent is a four-week season of preparation before celebrating Jesus' birth, and its purple color also represents royalty because historically purple dye was costly and rare. The purple thus symbolizes welcoming the coming of a King.","context":["Joe Paprocki, in his book “A Church On the Move,” says our local faith communities need to recover a sense for the importance of the liturgical calendar, starting with the most important events of all: the birth, passion, death and resurrection of Jesus.\nAfter that, Paprocki writes, “everything else the parish does, week in and week out, is directed toward the celebration of the death and resurrection of Jesus, with each Sunday of the liturgical calendar being a ‘mini-Easter.’”\nPerhaps we need to think about how Paprocki’s advice might be useful to the “Domestic Church” — the church in the home — as well.\nThere was a time in the not too distant past when various things, including the liturgical calendar, shaped Catholics’ daily lives.\nThe natural seasons of the year made a difference in how we lived, worked and played. Today, daily life isn’t all that much different in summer than in winter.\nSundays were once distinctly different from the other days of the week, but with extended business hours Sundays now are just another workday for some people — or another shopping day for others.\nFor middle class families, when kids aren’t in school, they’re in day care — or organized sports leagues, but never just at home with mom or dad.\nThere was even a time when there were separate seasons for major sports, but today, it’s hard to tell when one sports season ends and another begins.\nThe point I’m making is that life today is pretty much the same from day to day, week to week, month to month. Important events and big celebrations are short-lived — a day or two off work or school, then back to the routine.\nWhen everything’s pretty much the same, there are no really special times — not much to look forward to, and not much to remember afterward.\nA sense of rhythm, an ebb-and-flow, busy times and not-so-busy times are missing; life gets monotonous and boring, so people look for odd diversions and extreme, sometimes dangerous and destructive distractions in personal relationships, recreation, entertainment, maybe even politics.\nThe church’s liturgical calendar offers us an alternative. There is a rhythm to the liturgical year — it’s the rhythm of the Paschal Mystery, a pattern of living, dying, rising and living again in a new way. Big, really important events which we need to prepare for and celebrate afterward — things to remember and things to look forward to which shape how we live and work today.\nThis Sunday we begin the season of Advent — the first season in the church’s liturgical year. I think it might be a good time to look at how we could integrate the liturgical calendar into our daily lives as individuals and families.\nWhat do you think?\nFind suggestions on how to celebrate Advent in the family here: Facebook.com/FaithLeadersCorner/.\nPray and Reflect\nUse one or more of the following questions for personal reflection, group discussion or private journaling:\n- On a scale of 1 (low) to 5 (high) rate how aware you are of the liturgical seasons.

This on-going cycle of Salvation History is represented by the church’s liturgical year — a cycle of Sundays, feasts and special seasons which help us remember and celebrate God’s presence in human history.\nThe liturgical year consists of six seasons:\n- Advent – four weeks of preparation before the celebration of Jesus’ birth\n- Christmas – celebrating the Nativity of Jesus Christ and his manifestation to the peoples of the world\n- Lent – a six-week period of penance and renewal before Easter\n- The Paschal Triduum – the holiest “three days” of the church’s year, where the Christian people commemorate the suffering, death and resurrection of Jesus\n- Easter – 50 days of joyful celebration of the Lord’s resurrection and his sending forth of the Holy Spirit\n- Ordinary Time – divided into two sections (one span of 4-8 weeks between Christmas time and Lent and another lasting about six months after Easter Time); during these times we consider the fullness of Jesus’ teachings and works among his people[/ms-protect-content][ms-membership-login]","Today’s post is all about colors – purple, white, green, and red.

When the season ends on Pentecost Sunday, White is replaced with Red. This color reminds the congregation of fire—the symbol of the Holy Spirit.\nWhat are the colors of seasons in the church?\nThe symbolism of violet, white, green, red, gold, black, rose and other colours may serve to underline moods appropriate to a season of the liturgical year or may highlight a special occasion.\nWhat are the colors of each season in liturgical calendar?\nThe Use of Color in the Catholic Liturgical Year\n- Green: The color of vestments used during ordinary time.\n- Purple or violet: Used during Advent and Lent, and along with white and black, these colors may also be used at Funeral Masses.\n- White and gold: Most appropriate for Christmas and Easter.\nWhat are the 4 church seasons?\nGenerally, the liturgical seasons in western Christianity are Advent, Christmas, Ordinary Time (Time after Epiphany), Lent, Easter, and Ordinary Time (Time after Pentecost).\nWhat is the color for Easter 2021?\nWhite and Gold (The Colors of Easter Day)\nWhat color should you wear on Easter Sunday?\nWhite. At Easter, the color white symbolizes purity, grace, and, ultimately, the resurrection of Jesus Christ, which is the joyful culmination of the Easter season.\nWhat are the 4 Advent themes?\nThe four traditional advent themes for the four advent Sundays are:\n- God’s people -The Candle of Hope. Hope is like a light shining in a dark place.\n- The old testament prophets – The Candle of Peace.\n- John the Baptist – The Candle of Love.\n- Mary the mother of Jesus – The Candle of Joy.\nWhat color represents Christianity?\nGold is the color most used to symbolize the Divine connection and each figure connected to christ, including Jesus himself, has a golden halo drawn around their head to show their loyalty to Jesus during his crucifixion. The most symbolic color in this painting would be red.\nWhat do the different colors mean in the Catholic Church?\nRed: The color of blood and, therefore, of martyrdom. Pink: A special color worn only twice during the liturgical year. It represents a time of joy amid a period of penance and prayer. Green: The default color for vestments representing hope of Christ’s resurrection. Blue: Symbol of the Virgin Mary.\nWhat are the five liturgical colors?\nCatholic Liturgical Colors\n- Green. Green is the standard color for “Ordinary Time,” the stretches of time between Easter and Christmas, and vice versa.\n- Purple. Worn during Lent or the Advent, purple represents penance, preparation, and sacrifice.\n- White or Gold.\nWhat Colour is Pentecost?\nRed is used at Pentecost, recalling the fiery tongues that descended upon the Apostles when they received the Holy Spirit, and also at feasts of the Holy Cross, Apostles, and martyrs, as symbol of their bloody passions (sufferings and deaths).\nWhat is the advent Colour?\nThe colour associated with Advent is purple, which in ancient times was the colour of royalty because purple dye was costly and rare. So the liturgical colour of Advent is a symbol of looking forward to welcoming the coming of a King.\nWhat are the five vestment colors and when are they used in the church year?\nThroughout the year, the five main colours of vestments you will see are as follows:\n- White. Known for representing innocence, purity, joy, triumph, and glory, you will see this colour during celebrations such as Christmas, Easter, All Saints’ Day, and marriage ceremonies.\n- Violet Or Purple.\nWhat is Easter season Catholic Church?\nEastertide is the period of 50 days, spanning from Easter Sunday to Pentecost Sunday. It is celebrated as a single joyful feast, called the “great Lord’s Day”. Each Sunday of the season is treated as a Sunday of Easter. The first eight days constitute the Octave of Easter and are celebrated as solemnities of the Lord.\nWhich season begins the church year?\nThe Roman Catholic Church year begins on the first Sunday in Advent, which is the fourth Sunday before Christmas. Until 1969, after Advent and Christmas, there followed the seasons of Epiphany, Pre-Lent, Lent, Easter, Ascension, and Pentecost."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:0f35a9f9-65bb-455a-979f-973d7bfc60a9>","<urn:uuid:0a264525-d072-4455-a7e5-5be00792511e>"],"error":null}

Knowledge\nof wildlife diet not only helps me use the best baits to catch them, but also may tell me what nearby food sources are attracting the animals to the area. The life expectancy of an animal gives me an idea of its conservation\nstatus. I'd rather kill a rat - which can have up to 50 young per year and which has a 95% first-year mortality rate, than kill a precious bat, which has only one young per year and can live up to 16 years. Information is\noften the best tool when dealing with wildlife - more valuable than a steel trap or snare pole!

{"question":"How did both the Cabinet War Rooms and Selfridge's basement protect against German attacks?","answer":"Both facilities were fortified underground locations. The Cabinet War Rooms were located in a sturdy cellar suite, equipped with stands of rifles in the corridors for defense in case the war reached there in 1940. Similarly, Selfridge's basement communications center was protected by reinforced walls and ceilings specifically designed to secure it against bombing. Both locations served as protected command centers during the war - Churchill directed the war from the Cabinet War Rooms, while Selfridge's basement housed critical Allied communications operations.","context":["'I always had a passion for play-making,\" says Robert Landis, co-founder of the legendary Footlights Theatre of San Diego (1947) and equally legendary Scripteasers (1948). \"Theater has always been -- how to put this -- a source of decompression for me, something apart from the stress of business. I always loved to see a show, talk about theater, write plays, dream.\n\"Maybe,\" he adds, \"that's why I got that assignment during the war. They needed people who could write fiction\" -- the biggest fictional production, it turns out, of the 20th Century. The war was World War II. The assignment: construct an imaginary army to confuse the Nazis about Allied invasion plans for D-Day.\n\"It all started with a clerical error,\" says 86-year-old Landis, still tickled by the irony. He studied English and theater at DePauw University. During spring break of 1942, he enlisted in the Navy and received an on-the-spot commission. \"Wasn't that unusual...they had jobs to fill, needed bodies fast. They called us 'Golden Boots' -- instant officers.\"\nOne hundred Golden Boots assembled for training at Newport, Rhode Island. Owing to a clerical error William deLannoy -- \"should've been with the Ds, right?\" -- got put next to Landis. DeLannoy was from San Diego. \"I'd heard of the place,\" Landis chuckles, \"but couldn't tell you precisely where it was.\"\nThey discovered a shared love. DeLannoy had an MA in theater arts from USC and, before enlisting, had taught drama at San Diego High.\nLandis began writing and staging Sherlock Holmes mysteries when he was eight. Two years later he wrote, directed, and played the lead in a show about Tom Sawyer. \"That was fun! I got to cast the prettiest girl in class -- and kiss her!\"\nLandis says he didn't do much writing at DePauw, but before the war broke out he planned to do graduate study at Yale School of Drama.\nAt Washington D.C, Landis and deLannoy worked communications -- 12-hours-on/24-off shifts -- in the Navy Department's top-secret BritCom room. They sent and received encrypted messages from Washington and the admiralty in London. During his stay in D.C., Landis wrote a drama about a task force in battle. \"I hadn't even been on a warship and wrote the play anyway! What chutzpah, huh?\"\nThe minute they got leave, Landis and deLannoy beelined to Broadway to see theater. Their first show, Thornton Wilder's Skin of Our Teeth, \"knocked our socks off! It had Fredric March, Tallulah Bankhead, a young Monty Clift, and the production quality was unbelievable. I can't begin to tell you how thrilled we were!\"\nThey got to see Mary Martin in One Touch of Venus from backstage. \"We watched next to her suspicious husband, who was there every night keeping an eye on his wife. Even met her. Imagine that!\"\nEarly in 1943, they shipped to London on the Queen Mary. It was more a barracks than a luxury liner, \"just a troopship with all amenities removed. I came home on the Queen Elizabeth. Same deal.\"\nHis duty on the Queen Mary: watch for submarines and report anything that looked suspicious. \"We sailed -- zigzagged, really -- crossing paths where German U-boats sunk ships left and right. So the Atlantic Ocean was a dump, with barrels, lumber, oil slicks, wooden cartons floating on the surface. I reported all of it, and they didn't mind, 'cause you just never knew.\"\nLandis and deLannoy were members of SHAEF (Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force) assigned to Communications Central for Allied Forces in London (\"Ike was our boss\"). Their office was the basement of Selfridge's on Oxford Street. Above ground it was a prosperous, six-floor department store. Military personnel entered by a back door, got in an elevator, and went below. The elevator opened to a warehouse-citadel, the size of a city block, filled with the latest in communications equipment, wires, cables, and blinking lights secured against bombing by reinforced walls and ceilings. Winston Churchill's direct line to Washington, D.C., went from his Cabinet War Room through Selfridge's basement, where a computer scrambled his messages into code.\nLandis and deLannoy became part of a joint task force. Along with cohorts from Britain, they created disinformation about D-Day.\n\"By spring of '44, everyone knew an invasion was coming. The build-up was obvious -- you got all kinds of troop and supply ships crossing the Atlantic. But the question was when Allied Forces would land -- and where?\"\nHitler became convinced they'd choose the Pas de Calais, the shortest stretch across the English Channel from Dover. He believed it so strongly he kept several crack tank divisions in Paris. \"Our job,\" says Landis, \"was to keep him convinced and keep those Panzers in Pay-ree.\"\nIf the allies were attacking at Calais, they'd need an army in southeastern England. So the basement task force created one. They wrote \"bogus communications\" about a nonexistent base in Kent, where 28 imaginary divisions, allegedly led by General George S. Patton, prepared to make the major assault.\nA London film company constructed false barracks, shells of buildings, aircraft, \"even fake LSTs\" [landing ship, tank] in the water. Large swaths of obvious camouflage concealed empty fields. The fictional messages and fake movie sets created the impression that the Allies had almost twice the strike force they actually did (for a full account, see Roger Hesketh's Fortitude: The D-Day Deception Campaign).\n\"When it comes to misinformation, the Brits were already masters,\" says Landis. \"They taught us fast how to create coded tapes and radio them out to Patton's quote-unquote headquarters.\" Landis and others sent hundreds of urgent messages to Kent, and received hundreds back, building an entire fictional base, strategies, needs, imperatives.\n\"Another thing the Brits taught us: before an invasion, communications reach critical mass. Then, the day before, they drop off to nothing. That's a dead giveaway the Germans were alerted to.\" So instead, come the first week of June 1944, and even after D-Day, Selfridge's basement continued sending communiques: \"No drop off, as if plans were still being made for the big one.\"","- Historic Sites\nDecember 1991 | Volume 42, Issue 8\nShe did. In May 1940 Churchill, newly made prime minister, entered the sturdy cellar suite. “This is the room from which I’ll direct the war,” he said. With great care and skill the Imperial War Museum has made it possible to visit these chambers and to get a sense of the tremendous business that was conducted there. A tape-recorded tour lets you go at the pace you choose through the cabinet room (where you hear the proceedings of October 15, 1940, a day no better or worse than any other that appalling year: shortages everywhere, dire choices, business as usual), the radio room whence Churchill broadcast the speeches that, along with radar and the Spitfire, were about the only advantages Britain had just then, and the converted broom closet where Churchill spoke to his transatlantic counterpart over the world’s first hot line. This last was done in the greatest secrecy; a small brass washroom register on the door read “engaged” when he was inside, and while he patiently drew Roosevelt closer to the conflict, many of his aides thought the prime minister was suffering severe gastric difficulties.\nMost impressive, perhaps, is the map room, where wall-size charts of the Atlantic are peppered nearly black with the million pinpricks that marked the convoys’ progress. On the map of Europe a blue wool thread runs a zigzag line down through the suburbs of Moscow—as far east as the Germans ever got. While these pins and their threads moved back and forth by inches and fractions of inches, men fought their way up the spine of Italy and across France and Belgium, Hitler’s great corpse factories started up and ran full blast, and fifty million people died.\nNobody died in the Cabinet War Rooms (although the stands of rifles in the corridors remind us that in 1940 the occupants were prepared to have the war end here), and yet they are as haunting as the Normandy beaches.\nA very different echo of those times can be found half an hour outside London at Cliveden, the glorious country house that was home to Frederick, Prince of Wales, three dukes—and the Astors. Now a hotel, it is magnificently restored, and one can stay where Churchill and Mountbatten and Charlie Chaplin once visited. It’s ruinously expensive and worth every penny—the only way I know to get some idea of what it was like to be a guest in a grand stately home. A marvelously informative tape takes you on a two-hour tour of gardens splendid enough to touch even my mulishly nonagrarian soul. There is much history offered (you can swim in the pool where John Profumo met Christine Keeler), but what is interesting is that the thing the place is best remembered for is nowhere mentioned. The Cliveden Set, who gathered about Nancy Astor in the 1930s, despised Churchill as a reactionary. They all loved Britain, to be sure, but in Hitler’s dynamism and efficiency they saw a force that needed to be understood and accommodated.\nWhen Churchill, newly made prime minister, entered the cellar suite he said, “This is the room from which I’ll direct the war.”\nYou can feel the incalculable distance between 1935 and 1940 in the dark magnificence of Cliveden’s main hall. Go have a glass of whisky in the pleasant little library beyond it. The room seems to have been the repository for books left behind by weekend guests. There they are on the shelves, novels from the thirties, in moss-colored bindings with titles like Mist Be My Mantle. Then the decade turns, and on the next shelf is Squadrons Up with its frontispiece showing “The Hawker Hurricane, Miracle Fighter.” Inside, a fragile clipping from the Daily Express of December 4, 1940, carries the American publisher Ralph Ingersoll’s account of Pilot Officer Hart, a twenty-two-year-old flier who had been shot down six times (the last one wasn’t worth talking about, Hart said, because “absolutely nothing happened”).\nHart kept going up; they all kept going up, rising from the green folds of country beyond Cliveden’s wide windows, climbing through the beautiful weather of the long-ago summer of 1940 to meet the Heinkels and Messerschmitts so high up that no sound reached the ground below, where the watchers could only try to read their fate in the momentous white scribble of contrails. They kept going up while Churchill followed the progress from his War Rooms, and Roosevelt from across the ocean, until at last Hitler, frustrated, turned against Russia instead, and the Yanks came from the prairies, and from Niagara, and from gangster-ridden Chicago to add their weight to the balance."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:07277c09-2c81-4b4f-bfd8-0e68e11380ac>","<urn:uuid:4620eae2-97f9-42ab-8920-4dce62bd97f0>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Hello! As an animal nutritionist, I'd like to understand how digestive processes differ between bonnethead sharks and bearded dragons. What specific measures are taken to ensure proper digestion in each species?","answer":"Bonnethead sharks and bearded dragons have different digestive needs and support systems. For bonnethead sharks, their digestive system can break down both animal and plant matter, specifically processing fiber and soluble carbohydrates from seagrass, as evidenced by the degraded state of seagrass found in their bellies. For bearded dragons, several measures are taken to ensure proper digestion: they require regular warm water soaks for 10-15 minutes to keep their digestive system running smoothly and relieve constipation, calcium supplements and multivitamins are added to their food, and their vegetables must be chopped into appropriate sizes to prevent blockages. Additionally, bearded dragons need their insects to be 'gut-loaded' (fed nutritious foods that will benefit the dragon) and may need their food portions controlled to what they can eat in 5-10 minutes.","context":["A shark’s diet is typically a cornucopia of meats: seals, rays, squids, and krill. The idea that “fish are friends, not food” may be charming in Finding Nemo but a bloody bucket of chum is more of a shark’s style. That is, unless the shark in question is a bonnethead shark, a small member of the hammerhead shark genus. According to a new study, this broad, smooth fish is the only shark species known to be an omnivore.\nIt is, however, unclear if the bonnethead shark means to be an omnivore. In the study, released Wednesday in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B, scientists determined that these sharks are able to digest the copious amounts of seagrass they consume. Previous studies established that up to 62 percent of the shark’s gut content mass could be seagrass, but it was unknown if the sharks were actually digesting the plant matter. Now, it’s clear that they are digesting it, but like a weekend warrior downing a garnished Bloody Mary, the ingested greens are likely a byproduct of wanting something else.\n“It has mostly been assumed that they could not digest the seagrass and it was just incidental from scooping up blue crabs,” study co-author and Florida International University assistant professor Yannis Papastamatiou, Ph.D., tells Inverse. “We show that they can quite efficiently digest seagrass and get nutrients and energy from seagrass. I still believe they are getting it incidentally while chasing crabs, but they are getting some energy from the seagrass nonetheless.”\n“I still believe they are getting it incidentally while chasing crabs, but they are getting some energy from the seagrass nonetheless.”\nIn this case, digestion is key: What an animal ingests and what they digest are not always the same thing. Just because you can swallow a small battery doesn’t mean your body is going to break it down into nice, nutritious molecules your body can use. The fact that previously dissected bonnetheads appeared to have degraded seagrass — not fresh seagrass — in their bellies was the first clue that their bodies were breaking the plants down and gaining nutrients.\nIn their study, Papastamatiou and his colleagues fed captive bonnethead sharks a diet that was 90 percent seagrass and 10 percent squid. When they subsequently analyzed the animal’s digestive system and the biochemistry of food particles that passed through them, they determined that the sharks were able to digest both fiber and soluble carbohydrates from the seagrass.\n“The fact that this is the first known species of omnivorous sharks is very exciting!” Samantha Leigh, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of California, Irvine, and co-author on the study tells Inverse. “This means that we need to completely re-evaluate their role in crucial and fragile seagrass meadow ecosystems, as they likely play a different role in ecosystem dynamics than we had believed.”\nPapastamatiou says that people typically focus on what a predator eats, but neglect to think about what happens after that food is consumed. Digestion, he reasons, “is a fascinating but often neglected process.” It’s what happens after an animal eats that allows for nutrients to spread, disperse, and prompt growth. Bonnethead sharks might be after crabs, shrimps, and mollusks, but their seagrass snacks give them a boost of necessary energy as well.","So you’ve just brought home your very first Bearded Dragon…Like many, you’re probably wondering wondering what to feed it, how much to feed, and how often to serve up meals.\nIt can be difficult and time consuming to scour the internet in search of the best articles and advice – so we took the liberty of gathering everything you’ll need to know about feeding bearded dragons. Keep reading for some of the best tips and recommendations you’ll need to keep your dragon’s diet and eating habits right on track.\nBaby Bearded Dragon Diet\nFor younger bearded dragons, it is very important to keep their diets omnivorous with the right balance of plant and animal matter.\nThis ratio will change as dragons grow and mature – for baby dragons, bigger portions of leafy salads and smaller amounts of insects like Dubia Roaches or Phoenix Worms should be fed daily.\nBest Insects for Baby Bearded Dragons\nAs we covered above, insects are the backbone of any baby bearded dragon diet. Here are a few types of insects that we recommend for baby beardies:\n- Dubia Roaches\n- Phoenix Worms\nBest Greens for Baby Bearded Dragons\nAlthough greens make up only 20% of a baby bearded dragon’s diet, they are still extremely important. Here are a few types of greed that we recommend:\n- Collard Greens\n- Turnip Greens\n- Dandelion Greens\n- Mustard Greens\nModifying Meals as Your Dragon Matures\nJust like any animal, a bearded dragons’ diets change as it matures. After all, humans don’t eat the same foods their entire life, right?\nThe ratio between insects and greens used to create a baby dragon’s diet will flip as they mature – adults will be better nourished by a diet consisting of 80% greens/veggies and 20% insects.\nLarge leafy salads and an assortment of veggies should be readily available to your bearded dragon every day (with a few worms or roaches added to the mix). Their eating schedule will also change with time, and we’ve got details below on what to expect and what to watch out for.\nBest Insects For Bearded Dragons\nIt is recommended that, when feeding a bearded dragon, each meal should consist primarily of fresh salads and live feeder insects (with some calcium sprinkled in and a multivitamin to top it all off). When looking for the right insects to feed your dragon, there is a wide variety of good staples to choose from.\n1. Phoenix/Repti Worms\nA top recommendation from many experts, Phoenix/Repti Worms are a healthy choice for feeder insects. They are the larvae of Black Soldier Flies (and though they are small in size, they make up for it with a hefty amount of calcium). Their shells are soft enough to make them easy to eat for bearded dragons young and old.\n2. Dubia Roaches\nOf a higher quality and nutritional value than crickets, Dubia Roaches (Blaptica dubia) and Discoid Roaches (Blaberus discoidalis) are both great choices depending on what’s available. These are definitely some of the healthiest options out there!\nCrickets definitely aren’t the best option – there’s nothing bad about them, they just aren’t the most nutritious insect to feed you bearded dragon. That said, crickets are readily available (at almost any pet store) and can made more nutritious by dusting them with calcium and multivitamins.\n4. Silk Worms\nThe nutritional benefits of the Silk Worm can be helpful for bearded dragons of any age. They are packed full of protein and low in unhealthy fats. It is also recommended that you feed your dragon gravid (pregnant) female worms when available for extra nourishment.\nVarious types of superworm include Hornworms, Butterworms, and Silk Worms (also listed above). Juvenile to adult bearded dragons can be fed any kind of superworm and enjoy them as treats with their meals.\nOther Common (and safe) Worm Options\nWax worms, King worms, and earthworms also make great snacks for your Bearded Dragon. They may not pack as much of a nutritional punch, but dragons love them and they make for a great occasional snack.\nFeeding the Proper Greens\nProviding daily salads full of dark, leafy greens is important in maintaining the health of your bearded dragon. Some recommendations for the most nutritional types of greens are\n- Mustard Greens\n- Collard Greens\n- Dandelion Greens\n- Turnip Greens\n- Escarole (Chicory Greens\n- Coriander (occasionally)\nYou can also include Romaine Lettuce if you like, though only sparingly, as Romaine is limited in its nutritional value. For a healthy supplement, sprinkle some Repashy’s Superveggie (the perfect dietary supplement for omnivores like your bearded dragon) over the salad and the other vegetables that accompany it.\nIn addition to the daily salads, your bearded dragon should also have a wide variety of vegetables made available to them every day. For younger bearded dragons, make sure that you chop up any vegetable really good – otherwise, you risk blocking up your pet.\nOlder bearded dragons should be able to handle slightly bigger chunks. Some of the best choices are green beans, acorn squash, butternut squash, yucca roots, konnayu (purple yams), and red peppers. With a sprinkling of Repashy’s Superveggie, any of the listed veggies will provide the perfect nourishment for your growing bearded dragon.\nOther Options (Raw Only): There are several other common options out there, but some must specifically be served raw to be safest for your dragon to eat. These include bell peppers, shaved carrots, cabbage, lentils, zucchini, asparagus, and okra. You may also consider leaving any yams raw when you feed your bearded dragon as the texture might be preferable this way.\nFruits – Yes or No?\nIt is important to note that many fruits are high in natural sugars, so it is recommended that you only include fruits in your bearded dragon’s diet as an occasional treat (or for training purposes).\nDo: It is safe to feed your dragon mango, papaya, grapes, or blueberries as a treat or reward, as long as it’s not too often and you don’t give them too many. It is also safe to include the occasional slice of melon or banana as a fruity treat. Apples, cranberries, strawberries, and watermelon are also safe options, should you wish to vary your bearded dragon’s treats from time to time.\nDon’t: Oranges, Lemons, Limes, and Tomatoes are highly acidic and, along with other citrus fruits (or even rhubarb), are not recommended as a staple of your dragon’s diet. Avocadoes are too high in fat and are technically toxic in nature, so it is not recommended that you feed your dragon these fruits, either.\nFoods To Avoid (At All Costs!)\nThere are some specific foods that you should never feed you bearded dragon. Here are a few that you should at all costs:\n- Avocados: High in fat and very toxic to bearded dragons.\n- Spinach: Inhibits the binding of calcium, which can lead to deficiencies in your bearded dragon.\n- Beet Tops: Can be toxic to bearded dragons.\n- Tomatos: To acidic for bearded dragons. Can be fed in moderation, but probably best avoided.\n- Lettuce: Not the worst food on our list, but offers zero nutritional value.\n- Rhubarb: Known to be toxic to bearded dragons.\n- Acidic fruits (Lemon, Oranges, Grapefruits, etc.): Can be toxic to bearded dragons.\n- Fireflies: Extremely toxic to bearded dragons! Avoid at all costs.\n- Wild-caught insects: Wild-caught insects can very easily infect your bearded dragon with parasites and diseases. You should never feed your beardie anything that you catch yourself.\nHow Often Should Bearded Dragons Eat?\nAs babies, bearded dragons will often eat multiple meals a day at pretty regular intervals. They tend eat less often as they age, sometimes choosing to eat only once every couple days. This is perfectly normal and nothing to worry about – though it is suggested that you make fresh salads available to them every day, should they need a little snack.\nTo summarize the image above, here is a rough guide for insect feeding intervals based on your bearded dragon’s age:\n- 1-4 Months Old: 3 feedings per day\n- 4-12 Months Old: 2 feedings per day\n- 12-20 Months Old: 1 feeding per day\n- 20+ Months Old: 1 feeding every other day\nOnce your bearded dragon is over two years old, you can even reduce feedings down to every 2 days. Once again, this is purely a rough guide – if your beardie really likes to eat, you can still feed every day/every other day (even in older age).\nIt is also important to keep in mind that dragons can be highly sensitive to changes in their diet, so as you’re shifting from the younger dragon’s diet to a diet more suitable for an older dragon, your dragon may not eat for a couple days. This isn’t detrimental to their health in any way, and can actually be quite common. If this is the case for your dragon, experts recommend giving your dragon a warm soak.\nAvoided Food-Related Health Issues\nMuch like the body of a human, the body of a bearded dragon can suffer from many diseases and ailments (such as liver failure, gout, cancer, or even periodontitis aka gum disease). Keeping their diets rich in nutritious alkaline foods (fresh greens and vegetables) will help keep your bearded dragon in optimal health.\nAs we have stated a few times above, it is also be beneficial to include a calcium supplement and a multivitamin to their meals – these can help strengthen their skeletal structure, prevent Metabolic Bone Disease, and improve their nervous system.\nBearded Dragons tend to be aggressive eaters and may consume dangerous/large objects, so it is your responsibility to make sure any potentially hazardous materials are kept out of reach of your pet.\nThe Importance of Calcium and Multivitamin Supplements\nIt is equally important to supplement your dragon’s diet as it is to get their diet right in the first place. Sprinkling their insects with a high quality calcium supplement such as Repashy’s SuperCal HyD or Nutrobal will be beneficial to their diets.\nYou may find that lightly misting the insects with water first will help the powder stick a little better. Including a multivitamin like Repashy’s Supervite a few times a week will provide the perfect nutritional boost to their meals.\nSoaking Your Bearded Dragon\nSoaking your dragon in warm water for just 10-15 minutes will help them to stay hydrated and relaxed. In addition, these quick soaks will also keep their digestive system running smoothly and help relieve constipation.\nRemember – Dry your bearded dragon thoroughly when they’ve finished their soak. Not drying your bearded dragon thoroughly can mess with humidity levels in your tank (which is something that you definitely want to avoid).\nHelpful Feeding Tips\nGetting your Bearded Dragon to eat isn’t always easy! Even if you have the perfect foods prepared, there’s a chance that your bearded dragon may be a bit stubborn. Here are some great feeding tips to keep in mind:\n1. Dizzy the insects before feeding\nWhen feeding baby bearded dragons, it is recommended that you dizzy the insects before feeding them to your pet. To do this, just recycle an old container (maybe a tubular cardboard oatmeal box or a large Ziploc baggie), toss the live feeder insects into this container with a dusting of calcium powder, and give them a little shake for a few seconds.\nKeep in mind that the insects should still be alive when you feed them to your dragon (so try not to shake them too hard).\nThis practice makes the insects much easier to catch, which can be very helpful for clumsy baby beardies.\n2. Control the portions\nAlso important when feeding your bearded dragon their insects is to limit the portions of insects. Only feed as much as your bearded dragon can eat in 5-10 minutes\nAt meal time, your bearded dragon should eat all live insects in a single setting. Don’t let a ton of insects swarm around your tank!\n3. Prepare foods correctly\nThere are some fruits and veggies that will require a little extra preparation before being fed to your bearded dragon. Taking the peels off vegetables or cutting them down into more manageable bite-sized pieces should make them safer and easier to eat. You really only need to do this if the peels are really tough/hard to digest.\n4. Moderation and diversification are key\nWhen building your bearded dragon’s meal plan, it is also important to remember to feed them everything in moderation. Rather than offering the same salad mix every single day, try alternating with an assortment of different veggies every couple weeks. This will get them used to eating different foods and help them adapt to other changes within their tank.\nAlso, in diversifying their vegetables, you will help your bearded dragon receive a good balance of all the necessary vitamins. Too much of one vegetable and not enough of certain others might lead to hyper or hypo-vitaminosis (which is a condition that occurs when dragons get too many or too few vitamins). Rotating their veggies will keep their vitamin intake at the right levels.\n5. Make greens more appealing\nAnother good feeding practice is keeping your bearded dragon’s meals full of fresh greens. Dried, bagged, or preserved foods lack the necessary nourishment to satisfy the dietary needs of your pet.\nIt is key that your greens are fresh – fresh and organic produce will help your bearded dragon receive the best percentage and concentration of essential vitamins, minerals, and key nutrients that are required to build up both their immune system (for fighting off infections) and their digestive system (which will effectively eliminate waste). The failure of either of these systems could result in disease, parasites, or other deteriorating health conditions (so it’s vital that you help your bearded dragon keep them up and running).\nTo make sure salads are appealing to your dragon, it can be a good idea to add different colors and textures to the mix. Fresh chopped green beans, Konnayu (purple yams), or shaved butternut squash can provide a colorful assortment and varied texture to their meal. If your dragon hasn’t been eating, it is also okay to drop in a few worms to coax your pet back into a more regularly timed feeding schedule.\nThings To Know About Feeder Insects\nEvery variety of feeder insects requires different care and handling. Consulting with your supplier will give you the opportunity to learn all you need to know about important aspects of the insects’ care (like the storage requirements of whichever type you’re working with). It is also necessary that you feed your bearded dragon live, “gut loaded” feeder insects.\n“Gut-loading” is the technical term referring to the process of feeding your insects in a healthy way so that your dragon can reap the dietary benefits (since your bearded dragon is essentially eating whatever your feeder insects are eating). Make sure to ask about the supplier of your feeder insects and the source of the food they have been/are eating.\nDepending on where you and your bearded dragon are located, the availability for specific types of insects can vary widely.\nIn Florida, for example, Dubia Roaches illegal to own. In Canada, you’ll run into the same problem, though both Canada and Florida should still allow the purchase of Discoid Roaches (a good alternative).\nTo find out more about what is offered in your community, just check with your local breeder or a reptile store in the area and ask if there are any restrictions or available alternatives that you should be aware of.\nCommon Feeding Mistakes\nHere are a few common mistakes that owners make when feeding their new bearded dragon:\nOnly Feeding Crickets\nWhile it is very common among bearded dragon owners to feed their pets crickets as a staple insect, they usually aren’t the absolute best option. Uneaten crickets can be loud, a bit smelly, and can potentially try to bite/chew on your bearded dragon if left in the cage.\nRoaches are the nutritionally superior option and usually far less likely to carry parasites (a single roach nymph is the equivalent of two crickets). Crickets should only be used as a staple if nothing else is available to you for the time being (or if your dragon is an especially picky eater).\nOnly Feeding Mealworms\nAnother common mistake is feeding bearded dragons mealworms as their staple insect. These worms are simply empty calories for your bearded dragon and can be difficult to digest with their hard outer shells. Overall, mealworms are not worth the time or effort it would take your bearded dragon to consume them.\nUsing The Wrong Substrate\nBearded dragons can accidentally ingest some of the substrate around the food they’re eating.

{"question":"In terms of maintenance and safety protocols, how do adult supervision requirements compare between bounce houses and playground equipment?","answer":"For bounce houses, adult supervision is required at all times specifically to monitor capacity, ensure children's safety inside the structure, and watch the area around the bounce house to keep kids at a safe distance. Supervisors must also enforce specific rules like no shoes, food, or dangerous objects inside, and prevent wall climbing or excessive jumping time. For playgrounds, supervision is part of a broader daily safety protocol that includes conducting structural evaluations, checking for debris in surfacing materials, ensuring safe-use zones are clear, and inspecting for hazards like protruding bolts or entrapment gaps. Both require regular maintenance checks, but bounce houses need additional specific monitoring of blower efficiency and wind conditions.","context":["Bounce houses are an iconic part of childhood. Getting the opportunity to bounce up and down with one’s friends is something children will remember for a lifetime. Though most children love a kids bounce house, many parents are left to wonder, how safe is a kids jump house?\nBounce Houses and Safety\nJumping in a toddler bounce house or kids jump house is an experience that is often so beloved by kids because of how energetic and rowdy they can be when jumping. With all the excitement inside these kids party rentals, there is cause for concern. While bounce houses themselves aren’t inherently dangerous, parents should always exercise caution when allowing their child to jump into one.\nWhat to Watch Out For\nWhen children want enjoy a kids bounce house, parents don’t have to say no outright. By understanding what to watch out for when dealing with kids party rentals, parents will know whether the bounce house poses a danger for their child. Parents should pay attention to the following three things to determine if there is a safety risk or not:\nWind is a major threat to a bounce house and will significantly increase the risk of injury. Many of the bounce house-related incidents center around bounce houses that have blown away. According to manufacturers, if the weather indicates winds will be between 20 or 25 mph, the bounce house must be deflated and/or kids should be removed from the jump house.\nParents can monitor the winds on their phones, or they can play it by ear. If the wind is strong enough to flap at your clothes, this is a good sign that the wind is too strong for children to enter the toddler bounce house.\nWhen children want to enter a bounce house, parents must first look to see if there are any workers present to operate the bounce house. These workers are responsible for properly anchoring the bounce house rentals into the ground. The safest bounce houses use heavy-duty metal stakes to secure the jump house to the ground.\nParents should discuss how the jump house is anchored with the onsite workers or manufacturers if they are renting. If workers are present, it is important that they are actively attending to the bounce house. Surprise incidents can happen inside and around the bounce houses, so these operators must always be aware at all times.\nOperators should only allow children that are the same size to jump together. Moreover, they should always adhere to the rules of the rental, which are often posted to the side of the jump house.\nWhen assessing the safety of cheap jumper rentals, parents should request to see a warranty or insurance policy from the company. Similarly, parents can also inquire about state inspections to see if the company makes safety a priority. Though there aren’t any national regulations that bounce house manufacturers must adhere to, many companies do get inspected to help bolster their reputation.\nSafety Tips for Bounce Houses\nIn addition to addressing the potential risks of bounce houses, parents need to follow and teach their kids the best safety tips for bounce houses.\n1. Choose a Safe Brand\nParents that are looking for cheap jumper rentals must make sure the supplier or brand they choose is a reliable one and of commercial grade material. These products must undergo quality check processes that ensure they are as safe as possible before being put on sale. Before making your choice, do your research and read past customer reviews online.\n2. Review the Material\nThe material that a bounce house is made of will indicate if the bounce house is a higher quality product or not. Bounce houses are made from various materials including Nylon, PVC Tarpaulin, Commercial vinyl, Polyester oxford, and others. Heavy-duty bounce houses tend to be made with PVC Tarpaulin while lightweight options are made with materials like polyester.\nChoose the material that will best meet your needs when renting. As you are inspecting the quality of the bounce house, take a look at the stitching. The quality of the bounce house stitching will indicate how well it will hold together.\n3. Select the Right Size\nBounce houses have a limited capacity and parents should keep this in mind when renting a jump house. Compare your expected weight with the capacity by calculating how much weight will be inside the bounce house. Take a look at your guest list and tally your calculations to make sure you choose the right size.\n4. Assess the Blower\nMany parents forget to assess the blower used in a bounce house rental. Due to the fact that the airflow in the bounce house relies entirely on this blower, you should test the capacity and specification of this air blower.. If the blower isn’t working efficiently, the bounce house will begin to deflate as children are inside, which will likely result in injuries.\n5. Allow for Adequate Floor Space\nBefore going ahead and renting the jump house, parents need to ensure they have enough space for the house. This is especially true if the jumper rental is going indoors. To ensure safety in and around the jump house, there should be adequate floor space around the jump house.\nWhile the majority of the jumping will be happening inside the bounce house, children do run around outside, so this area needs to be clear. The blower cords, and any other equipment must be kept out of the way to ensure the kids don’t trip over them.\n6. Read the Safety Guide\nJump houses come with safety guidelines and instructions that parents should follow exactly to make sure everything is as safe as possible. This guide will detail the operating instructions, maintenance schedule, precautionary measures, and level of safety of the jump house. After setting everything up, keep the instructions nearby in case you need them later on.\nOnce the bounce house is inflated, make sure you do a few trial runs before allowing children into the jump house. If anything wasn’t set up properly, you’ll be able to work out these issues before it becomes a hazard.\n7. Follow Preventative Maintenance\nBefore setting up the rental, taking the time to perform preventative maintenance will help to ensure the jump house is as safe as possible. While the house itself may seem okay, all products require maintenance, and the rental is no exception. If any repairs need to be made, they should be done well in advance of when you intend to use the bounce house.\n8. Ensure Adult Supervision at All Times\nParents that rent a jump house should arrange for adult supervision at all times. Supervision is required to ensure everyone inside the jump house is safe, as well as to monitor the capacity. Moreover, adults need to watch the area around the bounce house to make sure kids are a safe distance away from the structure.\n9. Enforce the Rules\nIn order for parents to facilitate a positive jump house experience, they have to make sure the rules are enforced. Generally, children shouldn’t bring shoes, food, or dangerous objects into the bounce house. Additionally, children can’t climb the walls or jump beyond a specific time limit.\nWhile many parents avoid jump houses to encourage safety, when the proper precautions are taken and rules followed, bounce houses can be a positive experience for children. Keep this guide in mind when renting or assessing the safety of a jump house.","Completing a playground safety audit\nMaking playgrounds safe is one of our top priorities at NSP3. By performing regular playground safety audits you are able to provide a fun play space without the liabilities and injuries. The frequency of these checks will depend on the traffic at your site, but we do recommend following this Daily Playground Safety Checklist to keep your site in compliance.\nEnsuring that your playground has the proper type and depth of safety surfacing is the biggest factor in reducing life-threatening head injuries. Appropriate playground surfacing types include any material tested to ASTM F1292 such as Engineered Wood Fiber (EWF), Shredded/Recycled Rubber Mulch, Poured-in-Place Unitary Surfacing, Pea Gravel, or Sand.\nDifferent playground surfacing materials have different impact attenuation ratios that require a minimum depth to achieve their rated fall-height protection. These minimum depths are 6 Inches of Recycled Rubber Bark, and 9 Inches for most other surfacing materials. However, keep in mind that these are minimum depths and that loose materials compact as they settle. For instance, an initial fill of 12 inches of wood fiber will compact down to 9 inches within a short time.\nBecause surfacing materials, especially loose-fill materials compact, degrade, and get lost over time it is important to routinely measure the level of your surfacing material. This can be done with a simple ruler by measuring down to the hard base layer to the top of your playground surfacing.\nThis is best done after your surfacing has been re-leveled to ensure consistent and accurate measurements. In addition to ensuring adequate surfacing depth daily, inspections for debris and contamination are highly recommended as objects left in playground surfacing can compromise overall impact safety.\nThere are many steps in completing a structural evaluation of your playground such as ensuring safe-use zones are clear, and the structure is free of entanglement and cutting hazards. Bolts should be checked for protrusions by ensuring they have less than two threads exposed and that the bolt does not increase in diameter away from the mounting surface. In addition, all clamps should be checked as well for cracks and overall tightness.\nAll elevated structures require railings to protect children from falling off the structure. As such it is important to inspect railings for cracked welds as well as entrapment hazards. An entrapment hazard is where a child could potentially get their body stuck in gaps between bars and other objects. In order to prevent entrapment hazards all gaps in your playground structure should be less than 3.5″ or greater than 9″ so as to prevent children from going through the gap or conversely for them to easily exit a gap.\nSwings take a lot of punishment due to constant friction on the load bearing components. Shackles wear out, clamps can break, seats can tear, and hooks can bend. When inspecting swings it is important to look over all of these components for damage.\nSwing chains need special attention to ensure there are no entanglement or cutting dangers. S-hooks should be inspected to ensure that they do not have any open gaps for the chain to come disconnected or for clothing to get caught in. Swing seats should be inspected for tears and breaks as these can expose children to seat failure and cutting hazards from the metal within the seat rubber."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:c33bcdcd-457c-46ca-8c7b-4dd6f966f6dd>","<urn:uuid:1def8781-235c-40fc-a5c6-7c19cff79b27>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do mining operations handle resource transportation between facilities in space?","answer":"Mining operations handle resource transportation through various conveyance methods since facilities are typically separated due to factors like dust production and transportation energy optimization. Traditional conveyance techniques include conveyor belts, augers, vibratory conveyance, rail, and loaders/trucks. More specialized methods such as hydraulic, magnetic, gravitic, and pneumatic systems are also used for transportation between mining sites, processing facilities, utilities, and end-product users.","context":["Lecturer: Paul van Susante, Michigan Technological University\nDr. Paul van Susante is a senior lecturer at Michigan Technological University (MTU) in the Mechanical Engineering Department and founder and faculty advisor of the Mining INnovation Enterprise at MTU. He received a B.S. and M.S. in civil engineering from Delft University of Technology and a M.S. and Ph.D. in Engineering Systems from the Colorado School of Mines.

He has published over 60 conference and journal articles.\nTopic: Conveying technologies, Mining Cycles and Mining Requirements\nSeveral topics will be discussed in this seminar. A crucial first step in any mining operation is exploration of an area or planetary body for resources. This involves orbital, aerial and surface exploration techniques. Design of the mine, engineering, processing and equipment design and system trade-offs are enormously dependent on what the resource and waste mix are as well as the location and chemical and mechanical form it occurs in. More knowledge (risk reduction) is better, but it comes at a price.\nThe location of the resource is fixed but the location of the mine, processing facilities, utilities and end product users is not. Conveyance between these places is necessary since it is unlikely these facilities will be in the same place for reasons such as dust production, minimizing transportation energy use, etc. Within a processing facility conveyance is also required from one system to another. Traditional conveyance techniques such as conveyor belts, augers, vibratory conveyance, rail and loaders and trucks will be discussed as well as more specialized methods such as hydraulic, magnetic, gravitic, pneumatic methods.\nSizing of the components, equipment and processing facilities as well as a batch or continuous process is determined by the conveyance between the different steps. Mining cycles and their efficiency are the driving factor in any Earth mine design in both underground and surface mining. The entire supply chain has several cycles in it that all have to be sized together so there is no over or under capacity along the chain. This includes conveyance time, anticipated break downs, scheduled maintenance, communication delays, recharge time, throughput, buffer supplies, etc. Automation (and the level of autonomy) is of interest to many Earth companies and is a driving requirement for space mining. Typically when equipment stands still, it is losing money, and the maximization of utilization is crucial for profits in Earth’s mining industry. In space mining, instead of pure economy, custom equipment needs to be sized properly to maximize efficiency and minimize mass and power requirements.\nExploration, Conveyance and Mining Cycles are all determined fundamentally by the mining requirements, or how much feedstock/ore is required per day. Different options may exist to produce the same amount of end-product (e.g. water to produce Oxygen and hydrogen). In addition, other\noutpost needs require mining / material excavation and transport (roads, berms, landing pads, etc. civil engineering). The total outpost growth and needs over time determine the size, type and number of the mining equipment needed.\nMars Water ISRU Study (click here to download)\nProceedings of the ASCE Aerospace Division Earth and Space Conference series (formerly Engineering, Operations and Construction in Space / Extreme Environments) (click here to download)\nSpace Resources Roundtable / Planetary and Terrestrial Mining Sciences Symposium Proceedings (click here to download)\nLecture Slides: click here to download\nRecorded Talk: click to view"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:a67ed2e6-810b-4afd-9628-a9db8755c726>"],"error":null}

For instance, water cutters can cut a broader range of metal, but they also contain a risk hazard when compared to laser cutters.\nTherefore, the main question surrounding the selection of the type of metal cutter to use is, “which type of cutter should you use in cutting a piece of material?”. Continue reading the guideline below on how you can choose between water jet and laser cutters.\nWater Jet vs. Laser\nBefore looking at the ways to choose the suitable metal cutting technique between water jet cutting vs. laser cutting, we should first understand the technologies behind each of these services. The two types of cutting techniques are as discussed below.\nWater Jet Cutting Services\nThe water pressure cutter uses pressured water as the cutting tool. Water is subjected to high-pressure levels of around 90000 PSI, and the resultant pressure water is used to cut metals among other surfaces.\n· Benefits of Water Cutters\nWater is dense, but the extreme pressure level is what enables it to cut through a broad range of surfaces. Moreover, the high-pressure water gives room for fine cutting as the water jet has a cutting range of between 0.5mm and 0.1mm.\nMore so, water cutters have a nozzle that can be added to modify the abrasiveness of the cutter. The nozzle enables water jet cutters to cut specific sizes and shapes and is also important in assisting the machine in cutting materials that are softer than the abrasive used. This explains why water cutters are suitable for cutting granite and exotic materials.\n· Setbacks of Water Jet Cutters\nWater cutters have been found to injure users who are not careful. Controlling the cutting is a tiresome task that requires a high level of concentration and precision.\nLuckily, computer technology has come to the aid. Many modern cutters today are computerized. This has increased the accuracy of water cutters as well as enabling 3D cutting, which is still evolving.\nFind out more information concerning the functioning, benefits, and setbacks of Water Jet Cutters.\nLaser Cutting Services\nLaser cutting services, on the other hand, use laser gas for cutting action. Laser gas such as Carbon Dioxide (CO2) is directed through the machine using reflective mirrors. The source of the laser is located inside the machine and can generate 1500 to 2600 watts on each beam.\n· Benefits of Laser Cutters\nLaser cutters are highly precise due to their narrow cutting range of 0.12″ to 0.4″. The cutting slit size of laser cutter can be as minimal as 0.006″ but this ability depends on the speed of the laser.\nDue to this property, laser cutters have a broad range of applications, including cutting, engraving, structuring, and ablation. CO2 lasers are particularly useful in drilling, welding and in cutting flat metal sheets of medium thickness.\n· Setbacks of Laser Cutters\nWhile laser cutters can generate significant amounts of power in their cutting processes, these cutters find it difficult to cut through materials that are composed of elements with different melting points.\nBesides, the CO2 lasers cannot cut through sandwiched structures due to the composition of divergent materials. 3D cutting is also a huge challenge to laser cutters.\nWhich Cutting Service Should You Settle for?\nThe type of cutting service that you should go for is subject to multiple factors, as discussed below.\n1. Type of Operation\nWater jet cutters can only be used to cut materials, whereas laser cutters can be used to engrave in addition to cutting.\nHowever, laser cutting is limited to 2D cutting while water jet cutting can be used for 3D cutting.\nNevertheless, both technologies possess a disadvantage when cutting material with multiple elements. Laser cutters cannot cut through a material with elements that have different melting points, whereas delamination may occur when water jet cutters are used on sandwiched materials.\n2. Type and Thickness of Material\nBoth water jet and laser cutters can cut through a broad range of materials, including plastics, wood, and glass. However, water jet cutter can cut through thick material compared to their laser counterparts; for instance, they can be used materials of the thickness of up to 2″ whereas laser cutters can cut materials of thickness between 0.12″-0.4″.\n3. Level of Precision\nLaser cutters are more precise than water jet cutters. The minimum slit size of a laser cutter is 0.006” while that a water jet cutter is 0.02”. For this reason, laser cutters have a low processing tolerance of 0.002” compared to 0.008 for water jet cutters.\n4. Damage on Material\nBoth water jet cutting and laser cutting services possess a threat of damaging a material that is being cut. Water jet cutters use pressure, which may damage the region being cut. The pressure applied can lead to deformation in some instances.\nLaser cutters, on the other hand, can leave burn marks on the cut material. This is normally the case in plywood or MDF materials. Nonetheless, the dark burned parts can be cleaned in most of the cases. In some cases, the burned edges can serve an aesthetic purpose depending on the extent of the burn. Other materials such as cardboard and cyclic materials are safe from the burning effect laser cutting services.\nLaser cutters have low wastage and few risks. Safety goggles are not necessary when working with laser cutters, although they are highly recommended. Proper ventilation is also required as a laser cutter produce smoke and dust particles that are slightly toxic.\nLaser cutters also have low noise production and do not require much cleaning. You are always good to go once you vacuum the dust inside the laser cutters. However, the laser machine should be used with moderate speed to avoid thermal cracking.\nOn the contrary, water jets are quite noisy, wasteful, and involve high risk. You should wear protective gear, including earplugs due to the noise produced. The cutting areas can also get quite messy due to the mix up of abrasives and water.\nChoose the Right Cutting Service\nBoth water jet cutters and laser cutting services have their benefits and drawbacks. Using the guidance above, you can choose the type of cutting services depending on the circumstances surrounding the adoption of each cutting method.\nFor more information concerning water jet and laser cutting services and other related articles, visit our tech section."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:3a907606-8bbc-4680-ad97-3d2dd2305029>","<urn:uuid:55827edd-9f9d-4ea8-85d1-05bdc5b6eca0>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How does Napoleon Bonaparte's skill at military strategy compare with Chopin's talent for mimicry and impersonation - which leader showed more tactical brilliance in their respective domains?","answer":"Both showed remarkable tactical abilities in their domains, but in different ways. Chopin demonstrated exceptional mimicry skills, being able to transform his appearance completely while impersonating others, particularly when imitating other musicians. His talent was so notable that it was even referenced in Balzac's literature. Napoleon, however, displayed superior strategic brilliance in military matters, consistently moving troops with 'unbelievable alacrity' and knowing exactly where to strike to cause maximum damage. His tactical genius allowed him to defeat multiple European powers and move forces with 'amazing speed and cunning', making him 'one of the most brilliant generals of all time'. While both were masters of their craft, Napoleon's military achievements had far greater historical impact.","context":["In his lifetime Chopin had his portrait painted and drawn by a variety of professional and amateur artists, and judging by the discrepancy in physical characteristics many of these artists must have encountered some difficulty in capturing the composer’s likeness. Chopin had an expressive and extremely mobile face according to contemporary accounts, and could transform his appearance when entertaining friends with his brilliant impersonations. The pianist and composer Moscheles wrote of Chopin in 1839 (in a letter to his wife Charlotte): \"He was lively, merry, and extremely comic in his mimicry of Pixis, Liszt, and a hunch-backed pianoforte amateur.\" In his biography of Chopin, published in 1863, Liszt wrote: \"He displayed a rich vein of drollery in pantomime [\"il déployait dans la pantomime une verve drôlatique\"]. He often amused himself by reproducing the musical formulas and peculiar tricks of certain virtuosi, in the most burlesque and comic improvisations, in imitating their gestures, their movements, in counterfeiting their faces with a talent which instantaneously depicted their whole personality. His own features would then become scarcely recognizable, he could force the strangest metamorphoses upon them, but while mimicking the ugly and grotesque, he never lost his own native grace.\" Chopin's skill at mimicry was so well known it even appeared in a Balzac novel; in his 1844 novel \"Un homme d'affaires\" Balzac wrote: \"Gifted with the same talent for mimicking absurdities which Chopin the pianist possesses to so high a degree, he proceeded forthwith to represent the character with startling truth.\"\nDescriptions of Chopin’s appearance by those who knew him, including his piano pupils who often saw him on a daily basis, are fascinating in their psychological observations, though they are often short on physical detail. Wilhelm von Lenz, a pupil of Chopin, wrote in 1872, describing his first meeting with Chopin in Paris in October 1842: \"Chopin soon came out to me, the card in his hand; a young man of middle height, [Chopin was around 5 foot 7 inches in height], slim [Chopin weighed around 88 pounds, i.e. a little over 6 stone], haggard, with a sad, though very expressive countenance, and elegant Parisian bearing — stood before me. I have seldom, if ever, met with an apparition so entirely engaging.\" Zofia Zaleska née Rosengardt, another pupil of Chopin, described Chopin in her diary in 1843: \"Such noble features so full of expression but so pale, wan and thin that it seemed the smallest breath of wind would topple him over.” The newspaper The Scotsman offered the following description in an anonymous review published 10 October 1848 of Chopin's Edinburgh concert given on 4 October 1848: “The infinite delicacy and finish of his playing, combined with great occasional energy never overdone, is very striking when we contemplate the man — a slender and delicate-looking person, with a marked profile, indicating much intellectual energy.” Georges Mathias, one of Chopin's most gifted pupils, wrote this beautiful description of Chopin in a letter to his pupil Isidor Philipp on 12 February 1897: \"I see Chopin resting his back against a chimney place mantelpiece. I see his face, delicate clear cut features, his not very big eyes sparkling, radiant and shimmering, his smile of unspeakable charm... It does not seem that there has ever existed such harmony between the author and his work.\"\nThankfully three images exist that have preserved for posterity Chopin’s true physical likeness: they are the photographic copies of two now lost daguerreotypes (from c.1845 and c.1847) and a death mask molded by Auguste Clésinger [according to anecdotal evidence it took Clésinger two attempts to obtain an accurate death mask, his first attempt likely failing due to inexperience with the process and undue haste in its creation; the second attempt was successful in as much as its accuracy appears to be confirmed when compared with the photographic images].\nOn 16 January 2017 the Polish Institute of Paris issued a press release announcing the existence of a possible unpublished photograph of Chopin, recently discovered by \"a fine connoisseur of Frédéric Chopin\", M. Alain Kohler, a Swiss physicist who in 2015 through a detailed search of Pleyel's archives had been able to track down a Pleyel piano that had once been belonged to Chopin. Given the scarcity of photographic images of Chopin the thought that a third photographic image might exist was very exciting news. However, it is always wise to greet such dramatic announcements with caution and a certain amount of skepticism: in July 2006 a gullible music world was taken in by premature announcements in the press hailing as authentic a photograph said to show the 78-year-old Constanze Mozart. Having long outlived her composer husband, dying in 1842, it was not unreasonable to presume that a photograph of Constanze Mozart could exist, but scholars quickly proved that the image in question (which first appeared with its unusual claim in 1958) could not have been taken until after her death.\nHaving lived in close proximity to two reproductions of Chopin’s death mask for many years, as well as good reproductions of the 1845 and 1847 daguerreotype copies, all of which adorn my music studio, I was extremely surprised when I first saw the image purported to be of Chopin, announced by the Polish Institute of Paris in January 2017. In my initial reaction I felt it bore little resemblance to the known authentic images of the composer with which I was so familiar (in particular I felt the new image lacked Chopin’s distinctive oval face). At the same time I could clearly see that the image did bear a strong similarity to stereotypical images of the composer, produced in numerous portraits (and in movies) over the years. I could also see an affinity with both the famous unfinished 1838 Delacroix painting of Chopin and with certain details of the c.1847 Louis-Auguste Bisson daguerreotype image of Chopin.\nSince an announcement from the Polish Institute of Paris had to be taken seriously, I spent a great deal of time examining the new image, despite my misgivings, carefully comparing it to the Clésinger death mask. To begin with I made careful comparisons between the Clésinger death mask and the previously known c.1845 and c.1847 daguerreotype images, as a sort of control. The match up between the Clésinger death mask and these two images was easily accomplished and extraordinarily convincing: without doubt the c.1845 and c.1847 daguerreotype images and the Clésinger death mask all represent the same person in my view (and an important validation for the c.1845 daguerreotype copy whose authenticity some people still question).\nUsing the same method, I then compared the Clésinger death mask with the image recently unearthed by Alain Kohler. I made many attempts but could not get the features to match up. It was clear to me that the new image and the death mask had too many differences for them to be representations of the same person.\nOut of curiosity I also compared the Clésinger death mask to the 1847 Winterhalter drawing mentioned by Chopin, and the match up was very close, validating Chopin’s own assessment that the Winterhalter drawing was \"a very good likeness\".\nYou can also see the comparisons between all these images in this video.\nSo what is the significance of the similarities between the newly discovered image and the 1838 Delacroix portrait and with certain details in the c.1847 L.A. Bisson daguerreotype image?\nThe image discovered by Alain Kohler and the 1838 Delacroix portrait match up very closely indeed: the head is positioned at exactly the same angle in both images and when the two images are overlapped the facial features line up almost perfectly. This is strange for two reasons: firstly, we’re comparing a photographic image with a painting; secondly, though Delacroix’s portrait is a fine representation of the passion and nobility of Chopin’s spirit it is more an idealized image of the composer rather than an accurate portrait of the composer’s physical appearance.\nDelacroix’s 1849 pencil sketch of Chopin as Dante gives a slightly different representation of Chopin’s physical appearance, which may or may not be closer to reality (certainly this 1849 sketch held great significance to Delacroix, who kept the drawing in his bedroom for the remainder of his life, writing the words \"Cher Chopin\" beneath the image):\nComparing the newly discovered image with the c.1847 L.A. Bisson daguerreotype image of Chopin, the following similarities stand out:\n- both sitters appear to be wearing similar or identical collars and ties\n- the hairstyle of both is almost identical, even down to a small curl on the bottom left of the image\n- both sitters wear a slightly frowned expression, and with slightly hooded eyelids\n- there is a similar wood trim detail in the background of both images\nGiven these similarities it’s easy to understand why some might be convinced the newly discovered image is a photographic portrait of Chopin, possibly taken by L.A. Bisson in the same session at his Paris studio at 65 rue Saint-Germain l'Auxerrois that produced the famous Chopin daguerreotype image. But to come to this conclusion one would have to ignore the differences in the physical features of the two sitters. It’s also important to bear in mind that in the L.A. Bisson daguerreotype image Chopin is looking at the camera face on, and so it isn’t possible to assess the true shape of his forehead or nose; without that information the newly discovered image does appear closer in likeness than it actually is.\nSo what could be the explanation for these similar details? Could this new image perhaps have been created as an “hommage” to Chopin, or perhaps even a deliberate attempt at forgery? I certainly believe it's possible, but I should point out that the Polish Institute's original press release stated that Alain Kohler and his team had examined this possibility and ruled it out, without providing specific details in the press release to substantiate their position. It seems less likely that the similarities are merely coincidences, since certain features of Chopin, such as his hairstyle, are fairly unique to him, so for now there are still many puzzles that have yet to be resolved.\nSome other queries regarding the image also need to be addressed. The newly discovered picture appears to have been cropped, which is odd. If it has, what has become of the uncropped image and why would this have been done? Alain Kohler has raised this same concern himself. To date few details have been released regarding the current ownership of the image, the condition and age of the print (e.g. the kind of paper the image is printed on, any information written on the reverse side, etc.), the image's known history and how it came into its present ownership. It would be important to know if the image has ever previously been made public. With a lack of provenance all we are left with in assessing the picture’s authenticity is its appearance, which as I have outlined above, leaves a lot to be desired. In my opinion it is unfortunate that the Polish Institute in Paris issued their press release concerning the image before more efforts at verifying the image's authenticity had been made. In the rumour mill that is today’s internet a mere suggestion that the picture might be Chopin, and might have been taken by L.A. Bisson in 1847, is quickly transformed from suggestion to fact. All such statements regarding the history of the image are at this stage, pure conjecture. It is for this reason that I felt it important to issue my own statement on the image.\nIn conclusion, based on my own painstaking comparisons between the image discovered by Alain Kohler and announced to the world by the Polish Institute of Paris on 16 January 2017 and the known authentic images of the composer, there is little doubt in my mind that the newly discovered image is NOT an authentic photographic portrait of Chopin. Meanwhile I will eagerly await with great interest any new information that is released regarding the image, and how it came into existence.","Napoleon French Empire\nFavourite civic: Representation BASIC INFORMATIONS: Organized\nStrategy: military (5) and gold (2).\nFavourite religion: Christianity\nWonder Construct random: 10(from 0 to 50).\nBase Attitude: -1(from -1 to 2).\nBase Peace Weight: 0(from 0 to 10).\nWarmonger Respect: 2(from 0 to 2).\nEspionage Weight: 100(from 50 to 150).\nRefuse To Talk War Threshold: 10(from 6 to 10).\nNo Tech Trade Threshold: 10(from 5 to 20).\nTech Trade Known Percent: 60% (from 0 to 100).\nMax Gold Trade Percent: 5% (from 5 to 20).\nMax War Rand: 100 (from 50 to 400).\nMax War Rand: 100 (from 50 to 400).\nRaze City Prob: 0 (from 0 to 75).\nBuild Unit Prob: 40 (from 0 to 40).\nClose Borders Attitude Change: -3 (from -4 to -2).\nSame Religion Attitude Change Limit: 4 (from 2 to 7).\nDifferent Religion Attitude Change: 0 (from -2 to 0).\nFavorite Civic Attitude Change Limit: 5 (from 1 to 6).\nDemand tribute will be refused when: cautious or worse.\nRequest help will be refused when: cautious or worse.\nRequest technology will be refused when: annoyed or worse.\nRequest strategic bonus will be refused when: cautious or worse.\nRequest happiness bonus will be refused when: annoyed or worse.\nRequest health bonus will be refused when: annoyed or worse.\nRequest map will be refused when: pleased or worse.\nRequest declare war will be refused when: cautious or worse.\nRequest declare war them will be refused when: pleased or worse.\nRequest stop trading will be refused when: annoyed or worse.\nRequest stop trading them will be refused when: cautious or worse.\nRequest adopt civic will be refused when: cautious or worse.\nRequest convert religion will be refused when: cautious or worse.\nRequest open borders will be refused when: annoyed or worse.\nRequest defensive pact will be refused when: pleased or worse.\nRequest permanent alliance will be refused when: pleased or worse.\nRequest vassal will be refused when: pleased or worse.\nMax War Nearby Power Ratio: 120 (from 80 to 130).\nMax War Distant Power Ratio: 100 (from 30 to 100).\nMax War Min Adjacent Land Percent: 1 (from 0 to 4).\nLimited War Rand: 40 (from 40 to 200).\nLimited War Power Ratio: 120 (from 80 to 130).\nDogpile War Rand: 50 (from 25 to 100).\nMake Peace Rand: 40 (from 10 to 80).\nDemand Rebuked Sneak Prob: 60 (from 0 to 100).\nDemand Rebuked War Prob: 10 (from 0 to 50).\nBase Attack Odds Change: 6 (from 0 to 6).\nWorse Rank Difference Attitude Change: -1 (from -3 to 0).\nBetter Rank Difference Attitude Change: 1 (from 0 to 4).\nShare War Attitude Change Limit: 4 (from 2 to 4).\nVassal Power Modifier: 20 (from -20 to 50). DESCRIPTION:\nNapoleon Emperor of France Lived:\n1769 - 1821Background:\nNapoleon Bonaparte was born in Corsica where he entered military school at ten, displaying a great aptitude for mathematics, history, and geography, as well as total indifference to literature and the humanities. At fourteen he was commissioned as a sub-lieutenant in an artillery regiment. When the French revolution broke out, Napoleon sided with the Revolutionaries and was appointed lieutenant-colonel of artillery, where he quickly made a name for himself as a successful commander. By 1794 he was a brigadier-general, and by 1795 he was appointed command of the French Army of the Interior. He was 25 years of age.\nOver the next few years Napoleon led French armies, in defense of the new Republic, to major victories over various continental foes, including the extremely powerful Austrians. In 1798 Napoleon sailed against Egypt where he won great land victories however, the British navy destroyed the French fleet in Egypt, crippling his force. In 1800 Napoleon abandoned his weakened army and returned to France.\nNapoleon found Paris in a state of political turmoil, which he quickly took advantage of by overthrowing the government and making himself First Consul, with dictator-like power over all of France. An exceptional administrator, he rapidly reorganized the government, repealed the more radical and violent laws of the Revolution, and reopened the churches, gaining the love and respect of the French people, exhausted by years of revolution and chaos.\nHowever, France was still at war with most of Europe, and Napoleon once again took to the battlefields, where he won stunning victories against Austria, causing that country and England to make peace. In celebration Napoleon quickly declared himself Emperor and consol for Life.\nEngland remained nervous of France`s imperial intentions, and war resumed in 1803, with England destroying French shipping on the sea and France putting together a great invasion fleet in the unsuccessful hope of occupying the British Isles. Other countries were equally alarmed by France`s actions and they joined the English. France soon found itself facing a daunting alliance that included England, Austria, Russia and Sweden. Acting with amazing speed and cunning, Napoleon used his \"interior lines\" to concentrate his forces against the dispersed enemy. He rapidly marched across Europe, capturing the capital of Austria and then crushing the Russian forces at the battle of Austerlitz. Austria sued for peace once again, this time giving up all territory in Italy and along the Adriatic.\nFor several more years Napoleon would defeat every foe that came against him. He moved his forces with unbelievable alacrity, and he was always able to bring them against the enemy`s weakest spot. He crushed the Prussians, the Spanish, and the Austrians yet again. He tried to improve his political position by marrying his various relatives into the great families of Europe, with minor success.\nEventually Napoleon decided that he would never be safe in Europe as long as Russia, aided by the perfidious English, was on his flank, so he led half a million men to Moscow. The Russian forces retreated before his advance, taking or burning anything that might be of use to the invaders, while in the rear Cossack raiders destroyed his supply lines. He did reach and capture Moscow, but once again the Russians had removed or burnt anything there that might feed his men. By September he was forced to retreat, his army reduced to 120,000 weary and starving men. By the end of November his forces had been further reduced to 20,000. Napoleon had lost 96%% of his army.\nUpon returning to Paris, Napoleon immediately recruited another army of 350,000, but his image of invulnerability was gone and all Europe rose against him. Prussia, Russia and Austria allied against him. England threw more troops into contested Spain. Though Napoleon was to again win famous victories, his enemies sensed victory and continued their relentless attacks. Eventually the allies drove their way into Paris, and Napoleon abdicated. For his trouble he was given ruler ship of the island of Elba, along with an income of six million francs, to be paid by France.\nBut this wasn`t enough for Napoleon. Ten months later he re-entered France. The populace immediately went over to his side and he quickly regained his power and titles. He raised an army of 125,000 and headed to Belgium, where an English and Prussian force awaited him. At Waterloo, Napoleon was finally and irrevocably defeated by the English/Prussian forces under the leadership of English general Wellington. This time he was confined for life at the island of Sainte-Hélène, a thousand miles from the coast of Africa. He died there in 1821.\nNapoleon was one of the most brilliant generals of all time. He moved his troops with astounding rapidity, and he always knew exactly where to strike in order to cause the most damage. He turned out to be a decent ruler and France flourished under his control (until his endless wars sapped her strength and will to fight). His only major flaw was his unending drive for conquest and domination, driving other powers to oppose him for their own preservation.

{"question":"As a religious historian, I'm curious how ancient Iranian burial practices evolved from pre-Zoroastrian times to the Islamic period, and what role does Naqsh-e Rostam play in this history?","answer":"The evolution of Iranian burial practices shows significant changes across different eras. In pre-Zoroastrian times, people were buried in simple graves or deep shafts covered by earthen barrows. During the Zoroastrian period, the practice of exposure was adopted where corpses were left to be devoured by scavengers and then bones were collected and buried. In Islamic times, bodies had to be buried within 24 hours, washed, scented with Kafoor, and wrapped in white cloth facing Mecca. Naqsh-e Rostam exemplifies these changing practices, particularly through its Achaemenid royal tombs where four kings, including Darius the Great, were buried in rock-cut crypts. Some scholars suggest these crypts were used to avoid polluting the earth, reflecting early religious concerns about burial practices.","context":["Naqsh-e Rostam is a great treasure placed in the heart of the mountains in the historic region of Marvdasht. It is a region with the glorious and eye-catching mountains showing an ancient grandeur. Embraced several monuments belonging to Elamite, Achaemenid and Sassanid eras, Naqsh-e Rostam owes indeed its reputation to four Achaemenid kings who have been buried here. It is said that due to the similarity between Sassanid motives to Rostam, the famous Shahnameh hero, this region has been called Naqsh-e Rostam, while there are no traces of Rostam here.\nThe area presents a perfect depiction of monuments from different periods; the most ancient work here is an Elamite relief depicting two goddesses, king and queen sitting on a curled snake- like thrown. However, some parts of this memorial have been eliminated by the order of Bahram II to be replaced by the figure of the king and his courtiers.\nAnother significant monument in this mysterious land, which is standing in the heart of the vast plain of Fars, just like a glorious and authentic jewel, is the Ka'ba-ye Zartosht, or the Cube of Zoroaster; It is a cube building with a staircase right in the front, made of limestone and it is nearly twelve meters high. The main function of this building has not yet been clear; some believe that it had probably been a fireplace and some kind of temple. Others state that it is a tomb and some experts consider it to be the place of protecting the holy book and documents.\nA tomb for Darius the Great\nOne of the most principal monuments in Naqsh-e Rostam is the tomb of Darius the great, a notable king for Iranians. He fought with the untruth and deception, through killing the false Bardiya, to spread the justice in the land. Darius had ordered to be buried inside a crypt in the heart of the silence of the mountain, and after him, other kings like Xerxes I (the older son of Darius), Darius II and Artaxerxes I and some other relatives were also buried in the heart of the similar crypts. Some believe that these crypts were the invention of Darius and the other crypts imitated his invent. Some others say that kings’ bodies have been buried here to not pollute the earth.\nThese four crypts are similar and some little differences in size or details or the inscriptions have led experts to consider each to be belonged to a different Achaemenid king. There are also other tombs inside the crypt. For example, there are nine other tombs inside the Darius crypt which are probably related to his relatives.\nShapur I's victory relief over the Rom emperor is one of the other famous monuments in this area; here Shapur I, the Sassanid king, is standing on the horse on the body of this emperor. The other one is a relief depicting Ardashir I receiving the royal ring from Ahura Mazda which remind us of the historic importance of Naqsh-e Rostam.","Religious rituals in Iran\nLife after death has been a major theme with all the religions and the passage from this life into the other has been dealt with in a variety of ways, depending on the particular belief system. The major religions of Iran can be divided into three distinct periods. Pre Zoroastrian or proto –Indo- Iranian, Zoroastrian and Islamic period. Around the third millennium B.C., proto-Indo-Iranians had become identifiable by speech as two distinct peoples, the Indians and the Iranians.\nPRE ISLAM & ISLAMIC RELIGIOUS RITUALS IN IRAN\nThe Iranians loaded with their Indo-Iranian traditions were also influenced by the powerful civilizations of the ancient Mesopotamia. Elements of Sumerian, Babylonian and Elamite belief systems were incorporated into the Iranians ideas of cosmos and life after death. Influenced as such, they believed there was no end for the world or for humans, which were thought to follow one another ceaselessly.\nThe world after was a continuation of the earthly life with no notions of heaven, hell, reward or punishment. After death the disembodied spirit, the ‘urvan’ (ravan in modern Persian) lingered on earth for three days before departing downward to a subterranean kingdom of the dead. This place was ruled over by Yima (Sanskrit Yama, Persian Jam/Jamshid in Shahnameh) who had been the first king to rule on earth and the first man to die.\nIn this kingdom spirits (urvans) lived a shadowy existence, and were dependent on their descendants on earth for survival. Offerings were made to feed and cloth them through rituals at specified times. Most were made during the first year, when the newly departed urvan was assumed to be lonely, and not yet fully accepted into the world of the dead. Offerings would be made by the dead person’s heir, usually the eldest son for up to thirty years, the span of a generation.\nThe first three days right after death were the most important of all. The soul was very susceptible to evil spirits at this time and needed strength and support to make it to the underworld. The soul would have to cross a dark river in a ferry to arrive in the kingdom of dead (Gilgamesh’s boat ride to reach immortality). This ‘Crossing of the Separator’ is called ‘Chinvato Peretu’ in the Avesta texts of the later periods. To help the departed soul, the family would pray, fast and make a blood sacrifice during the first three days. There would be ritual offerings to fire and at the third night deceased’s cloths would be blessed so that the dead person can start the journey fed and clad. Food offerings would be consecrated for thirty days and then once every thirtieth day, till the end of the first year. All together there would be three blood sacrifices at the first year, with annual offerings for the next thirty years.\nAfter the first year the soul was believed to be fully incorporated in the underworld. To sustain the souls of all departed relatives, general offerings were made once a year at the feast of All Souls. In Avesta this is called Hamaspathmaedaya. This feast was celebrated on the last night of the year. They believed the souls would visit their old homes at night and depart at sunset on New Year’s day. Funeral rites involved burial of the dead. Leading members of the family would be buried at the bottom of deep shafts covered by earthen barrows. Ordinary people would be laid in simple graves in the earth. The Zoroastrian word ‘dakhma’ comes from this period and means ‘grave’.\nSometimes toward the end of the third millennium BC, new ideas are incorporated into the belief system. There is hope that at least some people like the warriors, princes or the priests who have served the gods might escape this eternally joyless existence. If they behave well, do their prayers sacrifices and perform the expected rituals, their souls could join the gods. They would end up in a sunlit Paradise, where all imaginable delights are possible. “Crossing of the Separator’ becomes a bridge (Chinvat Bridge in Avesta, Sarat Bridge in Quran) with one end resting on the mountain peak of Hara, the other on the road to heaven. Only those worthy of paradise would cross, the rest would fall off and end in the subterranean kingdom of the dead.\nWith the hope of attaining paradise comes the idea of resurrection. After all, experiencing the joys of heaven in sprit only was not much of a reward! It was assumed that within the first year after death the bones of the dead would be raised up, clothed in immortal flesh and would be unified with the soul in heaven. The Indian funerary rite to cremation comes from this belief. The mortal flesh was destroyed quickly and the bones would be buried, ready for resurrection. The Iranians, regarding fire as a sacred entity adopted the rite of exposure instead. The corpse would be left in a barren place to be devoured by scavengers. The bones would be collected and buried with offerings and rituals.\nWith the coming of Zoroaster in the middle of the second millennium BC, major changes are introduced. Humans are created by he Lord of Wisdom (Ahura Mazda) to help other divinities to gradually overcome evil and restore world to its original perfect state. Therefore, the departed soul will be judged on what it has done to aid the cause of goodness. Attaining paradise becomes possible for all. Women as well as men, priests warriors servants and masters could all go to heaven. Chinvat Bridge becomes a place for moral judgment. People are judged not only on the basis of their offerings, prayers and sacrifices, but also on their ethical achievements.\nMithra presides over the tribunal; accompanied by Sraosha (Soroush) and Rashnu (Eyzad of Justice), who holds the scales of justice. In the Indian Veda the spirits are brought in by two dogs (messengers of Yama / Jam in Persian). In Avesta the two dogs await the spirits at the Chinvat Bridge. Dogs are still venerated by Zoroastrians and if possible are present at their funerals. Once judged, if the scales are heavier on the good side, the soul is lead by a beautiful maiden, the personification of its own conscience (‘daena’) to the paradise. If the scales sink on the bad side, the bridge becomes narrow, sharp and a horrid hag grabs the soul and plunges with it down to hell. The concepts of hell, a place of torment presided over by Angra Mainyu (Ahriman, Shaytan in Koran); heaven, resurrection and individual judgment are Zoroaster’s own. These doctrines deeply influenced the later religious developments in the area, i.e. Judo-Christian and Islamic traditions.\nThe funerary rites were more or less the same as before. Flesh would be left exposed for a while. Bones would be buried to await judgment day. The old belief survived that the soul lingered on earth for three days after death. Since each person’s deeds were responsible for his acceptance or denial into the heaven, the number of rites and observances performed on behalf of the dead by family members was reduced. Traditional Zoroastrians today still follow many of the same rites. Unless the death occurs late in the day or at night, the funeral follows in a few hours. At the funeral all dress in white. The shrouded corpse is never touched and simple ablution after the funeral will purify all participants who touch the bier. The White cloths are washed after each funeral. Specific hymns are recited and Avesta prayers are said to pay homage to Soroush. The rite of exposure is still performed if possible.\nThe processions are normally in complete silence. This is to avoid breaking the power of prayers read to Soroush. Once entering the dakhma the rest of the prayers will be recited in Avesta. The language is assumed to ward off evil spirits. Candles or oil lamps will be lit for three days next to the dead body. Special foods are prepared and no meat is consumed during the first three days. On the third day more rituals are performed, prayers are said, a special cloth (Sedra) is blessed to provide a spirit garment for the departed soul. Other minor rituals are performed during the first thirty days. The next major ones are on the thirtieth of the month, ‘siroza’ and one-year after, ‘sal’. In between the two ‘roza’, recitals of the Farvardin Yasht, the Hymn to All Souls is performed on a regular basis. Crying and other extreme expressions of sorrow are not normally practiced by the traditionalists. They believe such behavior (Mooye in Persian, Amyava in Avesta) belongs to the world of Ahriman and should be avoided.\nMuslim conquest of Iran introduced many changes. Quranic concepts of life after death go back to Jewish, and so indirectly, to Persian and ancient Babylonian sources. The world after is a place for judgment, reward or severe punishment. After death, the departed soul will remain in Barzakh (interworld) till Rastakhiz (resurrection). The hour of judgment comes at the end of the world with a mighty blow and blast of trumpets or an angel’s summons. The earth trembles, mountains quiver, the sea overflows its shores; the sun turns on its axis, the moon darkens and split in two. The stars hurtle to earth and the other world is revealed before the eyes of mankind. All humans are resurrected; the Divine Book is opened in which all human deeds are recorded.\nEvery human receives a list of his/her deeds to read aloud. If the book is placed in the right hand he/she is destined for heaven, if in the left hand, they are doomed to hell. Crossing of the Sarat Bridge will decide their final fate. Blessed ones will cross and end in heaven, for the doomed, the bridge becomes sharp narrow and they drop in hell. Allah is the ultimate source of power. He is the only creator therefore; he creates both good and evil. Since Shaytan (Satan) himself is a creation of Allah, human life is not about defeating the bad for the sake of the good. It is about submitting to God’s will, following the rules, codes of conduct and performing the prescribed rituals.\nFor this reason purely ceremonial prescriptions, such as ablutions before prayer, are put on exactly the same level as commandments of an elevated moral value, such as that of honesty. The major sins (Gonahan e kabireh) are not about being evil and do despicable acts. They are about not performing prayers (Namaz), avoiding Roozeh (fasting) or drinking wine. In other words not adhering to Allah’s commands. Ablutions and other rituals such as prayer (Namaz), fasting, pilgrimage to Mecca and paying the religious tax are the primary canonical duty of believers. As a result, many of the rites performed at the time of death are to compensate any shortcomings related to the above acts by the deceased while alive. The relatives ask for Allah’s forgiveness of the deceased by reciting prayer of death (Namaz e meyet). Mullahs are paid to perform all prayers that the deceased might have missed and fast for them. All religious taxes owed will have to be paid off.\nThe body should be buried within 24 hours. It will be washed, scented with Kafoor (used by Zoroastrians as well) and wrapped in a white cloth (Kafan). Since segregation of sexes is a fundamental institution in Islam women are not allowed to participate in the funeral of male relatives (Modern Iranians do not observe the segregation any more). At all times the body and the grave should face Mecca (Ghebleh). The graves should not be marked, since only the almighty himself is worthy of such respects. The memorial service (Khatm) is on the third day (reminiscent of Zoroastrian tradition). The next major days are one week (Hafteh), forty days (Cheleh) & one year after death (Sal). At all the gatherings participants will be served with special meals. Rich people will give ‘nazry’ (free food) to poor people. Such acts are regarded as good deeds (Savab) and there is the hope that the act will elevate the deceased’s status in the eyes of God.\nIn summary, the rituals of death in Iran like all other cultures are closely related to the concepts of life after death. With the ancient Iranians their fate in the after life was decided by their choice of good or evil. For the Muslims adherence to the God’s commands and total submission to ‘Allah’s will’ decides their fate. The Shiite Islam transcends death and martyrdom as a unique form of esotherism through which the true faith is re-enforced by the believers participating and re-enacting the tragic events of the martyred saints.\nIranian version of Shiite Islam introduced a new dimension into the death rituals. Imam Hussein’s fatal journey in Karbala and Ali’s assassination in Kufa have made martyrdom the most important communal ritual. The actual practices were copied and adapted from the Roman Catholic Church by the Safavid kings in the 16th century, but were given a different meaning. Christian martyrdom is based on the notion of redemption, Christ and the saints were martyred to redeem human sin. Shiite Saints are martyred to guarantee rule by descent from Prophet’s blood line (Fatima and her children). Shiites believe in the embodiment of a luminous divine substance in Prophet’s family. They are the only true leaders of the Muslim community. The martyrs are supreme heroes who vanquish enemies of the faith with their lives. To mourn and weep for them is considered highly meritorious- rather, it is the key to Paradise. Hussein’s death in particular forms the core of the rituals. Communal mourning takes place through out the country. Self mutilation, beating oneself with chains and the sword is to remind the pious Shiites of the pain and the horrors the martyrs went through. The death of Hussein is mourned with Passion plays, poetry and prose resounding with laments about the tragic fate of the Prophet’s beloved grandson.\nLively story telling heightens real incidents of the heroes’ lives. Gaps are filled with details that may or may not seem probable. A common tragedy unites all (rites of intensification). The martyr’s fidelity to God could never be questioned and they triumph in death. Small tablets and prayer beads made from the clay of Karbala and other items symbolizing the tragic incidents are passed around and carried by the believers to convey blessings. The physical bodies of the martyrs become accidental. Death becomes a vehicle through which the ‘true faith’, is not only revealed and survives, but also triumphs. Through the rituals the spirits of the martyrs are embodied and the bodies of the participants are spiritualized."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:3ad4500d-5ed4-4e7b-9ef1-86ee80f20ed0>","<urn:uuid:537761d1-7eb3-488e-82ac-2d031d624d21>"],"error":null}
{"question":"¿Cuáles son las técnicas fundamentales empleadas en las pruebas unitarias y qué métodos específicos incluye cada una de ellas?","answer":"Unit testing employs three fundamental techniques: 1) White box testing technique, which includes branch testing, path testing, condition testing, expression testing, and statement testing. 2) Functional Testing Technique, which involves equivalence partitioning, boundary value, syntax checking, and input domain testing. 3) Error Based Techniques, which includes fault seeding, mutation testing, and historical test data.","context":["How Many Types Of Unit Testing Are There?\nConsidered the first level of software testing life cycle (STLC), unit testing is performed before executing integration tests. This testing aims to validate the correctness and completeness of the smallest component of the software- Unit, the smallest possible testable part of the software that can accept and produce and output, respectively. Integration occurs to enable these units to form the modules or the system.\nThis process, performed by a selected group of software developers, unit testing, involves the evaluation of each unit before it is integrated into the system. These units are verified and validated based on specified requirements by security testing them in isolation to identify, analyze and fix defects.\nTable of Content:\n- The necessity of unit testing\n- Kinds of unit testing\n- How unit testing is done\n- Techniques used in unit testing\n- Obstacles faced\n- Advantages and disadvantages\n- Unit testing Framework and tools\n- What to consider in unit testing\nThe Necessity Of Unit Testing\nIt is effective testing, which may prove economical in the software development process, in comparison to detecting the defects present in the integrated system is a lot more complicated. In contrast, it is easier to find the bugs and defects in the smaller units. This Early detection of the bugs in the development process enables the developer to be able to fix them at the initial stage of the development process, thereby saving both time and cost of the project.\nAdditionally, with the assistance of this testing technique, the team of software developers can tackle various issues that are related to the software product, as it is focused on:\n- It helps you Handle errors and defects.\n- It helps you Ensure the functional correctness and completeness of the software product.\n- It helps you Check input values and correct output data.\n- It helps you Optimize algorithms and performance testing.\n- It helps you identify, analyze, and rectify defects.\nUnit Testing Features\nThe objective is to test each unit of the software product independently; thus, this testing is executed during the first or initial stage of software testing in the development cycle. This testing is an integral part of computer programming and is utilized to evaluate the individual units of the product’s open source code.\nThe other features of this technique include:\n- It is Performed before the integration testing; unit testing is also referred to as component testing.\n- Load testing is a component of test-driven development.\n- It also forms the foundation of extreme programming, as it excessively relies on automated unit test frameworks.\n- Evaluate individual units of the software product.\n- The software developers write the test and run the test for testing so they can validate the compliance of the software code with its design alongside ensuring its intended function.\n- It may also include techniques such as walk-through, review, and inspection of programming code.\n- Demands strict possible test plans may also be needed for each isolated unit to produce effective results.\n- Usually, automated testing is preferred for this testing type. However, manual testing can also be used for this type of testing.\n- It will require plenty of time and patience on your part to focus and perform testing on each unit.\n- You are provided with access to an effective testing approach to trace & resolve the errors in the programming code base at an earlier stage.\n- It helps you save time and cost of finding and resolving the error at a later complex stage.\nHow Unit Testing Is Done\nAlthough the unit testing process is generally performed by the software developers or their peers, in some rare cases, this may also be executed by a team of testers. Whether the system testing is performed manually or through automated tools, it follows a set process, which usually consists of the following activities:\n- Defining and creating Unit Test Plans.\n- Unit test cases are designed and prepared based on the specified test plans.\n- There is the execution of these test cases on individual units.\n- Fix bugs (if any are found), and re-evaluate the unit.\n- This cycle of Testing keeps on repeating until the unit gets rid of all the bugs.\nKinds Of Unit Testing\nThere are three types of testing that can help the unit testers test each source code unit in isolation. Each of these types of unit testing caters to different requirements of the software and ensures its proper functioning. The types of unit testing include:\nBlack Box Testing: This type of testing that enables the team to test the software’s user interface and its input and output. The tester is usually conscious of internal functionality in this kind of testing. It is the internal structure of an item or function to be tested is that is justify unknown to them.\nWhite Box Testing: The White box testing is an important type of testing that is utilized by the developers who want to test the functional behavior of the software product and validate its execution.\nGray Box Testing: Is the third type of testing, gray box testing, is utilized to execute test suite and test cases, test various test methods, and perform a risk assessment.\nIt’s referred to as semi-transparent Testing. It is a combination of White Box and Black box testing. This combination is the type of testing in which the tester is aware of a method or unit’s internal functionality, but not at a more profound level like white box testing. In this, the (user acceptance testing) user is partially aware of the internal functionality of a system. Various types of Testing coverage under a Gray box testing is mentioned as follows –\n- Matrix testing.\n- Pattern Testing.\n- Orthogonal Pattern testing.\n- Regression Testing.\nTechniques Used In Unit Testing\nDevelopers can execute the process of unit testing with the assistance of three important techniques, which are:\nA white box testing technique utilizes the knowledge of the software system’s internal implementation and structure to design and create test cases. Then during the testing, the testers should have in-depth knowledge of the code coverage to facilitate test execution; thus, it is performed by the team of developers, with the assistance of the following methods:\n- Branch Testing.\n- Path Testing.\n- Condition Testing.\n- Expression Testing.\n- Statement Testing.\nFunctional Testing Technique\nPerformed to validate the software product’s functionality and ensure it behaves in an intended manner; the team executes functionality testing. It is a black-box testing technique that involves the following:\n- Equivalence Partitioning.\n- Boundary Value.\n- Syntax Checking.\n- Input domain testing.\nError Based Techniques\nThe Issues that are present in a code can be best tracked by the individual who designed it. For this, error-based techniques are used, which allow the team to identify defects, bugs, and other discrepancies in the software. It involves:\n- Fault Seeding.\n- Mutation Testing.\n- Historical Test Data.\nWhat Can I Do With Them?\nHammers are great tools to help you with various jobs — opening car windows or turning off alarm clocks. They can do many different things; they should probably only do a few. However, they are especially well suited to putting nails through hard surfaces. Tests are similar.\nTest-Driven Development, also called TDD, is a code design technique where the programmer writes a test before any production code is done and then writes the code that will make that test pass. The idea is that you gain a tiny bit of assurance that you have from that initial test / smoke test you do; the programmer can feel free to refactor and refactor some more to get the cleanest code that they know how to write. The idea is rather simple, but like most simple things, the execution is complex. TDD requires an entirely different mindset from what most developers are used to, as well as the tenacity required to deal with a learning curve that may slow you down at first.\nHelps you in Checking Your Work\nTDD is not new, but at this point, it is still mainly for the go-getters. Most of us are checking our work. After writing the production code, writing unit tests is the more traditional way of doing things, but it is no less valuable. It may also be something you are more familiar with if you have been in a math class any time in the past decade.\nAfter your work has been checked and it is clear that the code is doing what you think it is doing, it is normal that the value of the tests changes a little bit. Tests that can be efficiently run with every build of your product act as change detection, notifying you or your team when code changes in unexpected ways.\nHelps with the Code Documentation\nCode documentation is often a drag, and it shows mostly how little code documentation gets written. Component testing (beta testing) can help make the documentation burden a little easier by encouraging better coding practices and leaving behind code pieces that describe what your product is doing. Rather than constantly feeding the documentation beast with a code change, you will be updating a system of checks working for you or your team instead.\nAvoid the Danger Zone\nThere are minimal uses of unit testing techniques that you will want to avoid when possible—creating integration tests that You can do cross-system borders and touch databases or 3rd party systems quickly results in a test suite that takes a long time to run with each added test. There are several test frameworks out there that specialize in higher-level Testing. When you want to test larger pieces of your product at a time, you might want to investigate those other frameworks.\nOne other risky area is an end to end tests. These usually require you to order carefully, dependencies on other tests, and a detailed setup to get your system in a particular ‘test ready’ state. Much like integration testing, there are several automation tools to choose from made just for this purpose. You can do these things with unit frameworks, but it might quickly become more work than it is worth.\nObstacles faced : While executing the component testing process, the team can encounter various issues and challenges, hindering the smooth testing and inhibiting the team from developing expected results. Several of the challenges witnessed by the testers include:\n- They face Uncertainties or Trouble With Test Names: Names that don’t reflect the intent of the Testing or miscommunicate the test type can increase the challenge of Testing for your team. Furthermore, it can also increase confusion among team members, which further impacts the Testing of the software.\n- Challenges in Understanding the Entire Code: Software development requires excessive coding, and understanding the entirety of the code can be extremely difficult and tedious for the developers. Furthermore, it can delay the process of testing and product release.\n- Facing Problems With the Test Doubles: In this case, if the mock codes require more Testing than the production code, then this is a good indicator that there is an issue in the product, as these mock objects aim to simplify the process of Testing.\n- Being able to Find Dependencies: Finding dependencies in the software product can be a hassle-free task, hindering the testing process.\n- If they have Frequent debugging of Tests: Debugging is a complex task that requires great effort and time. Hence, if the tests fail constantly and it is often required that testing and debugging occur, it can increase the software’s challenges.\nAdvantages and Disadvantages of Unit Testing\nOne can gather a proper understanding of a process by getting an insight into its advantages and disadvantages. Ergo, to help you better understand unit testing, here are its advantages and disadvantages.\n|The Benefits of Unit Testing:||Disadvantages of Component Testing:|\nHow to Adopt Unit Testing?\nUnit test cases are automated software testing but still created manually; for you to do Testing with a testing automated approach, the following steps will need to be considered – You can write another piece of code in your application to test a function (application testing). To do this, unit test cases were created. Later on, this section of code was finally removed to test code when an application is complete or when an application is working.\nIsolation of a code: This Isolate function is put to the test more rigorously. The code can do Automated Unit Testing in a better way. Isolating functions/code aids in Testing in a good way. Because it helps to reveal dependencies between code functions, you can use the Test framework for developing automated test cases. During cases, the framework display logs for failed cases. Nowadays, many frameworks automatically flag and report failed cases in summary. Depending upon failure, failure may halt subsequent testing.\nUnit Testing Framework and Tools\nOne of the most critical advantages of unit testing is that it is often executed with the aid of testing tools and frameworks, which increase its effectiveness and efficiency. For instance, stubs. The benefits of utilizing a unit testing tool are numerous: from making the process agile and robust to helping the team get accurate results. Because tools are an essential part of unit testing, we have listed some of the most popular unit testing tools available to you in the IT industry/market.\nHence, the popular unit testing tools include:\n- REST Assured.\n- Quilt HTTP.\n- Spock Framework.\nWhat to Consider in Unit Testing\nWhile performing unit testing, there are manifold aspects that need proper consideration and monitoring to validate the quality, effectiveness, and accuracy of Testing. Hence, here are some critical things you should consider while executing uni testing:\n- Testing should be performed independently; this is done to ensure that any modifications and changes that are implemented in the software requirements are not affecting the unit test cases.\n- The test execution process needs to be concentrated on one code at a time.\n- Any of the bugs and defects detected by the team during the testing process should be resolved and fixed before there is any commencement of the next phase of the software testing life cycle (STLC).\n- Your Test cases need to be both comprehensive and understandable.\n- Your testing environment needs to be isolated from the development environment in unit testing.\n- You and your team should find an appropriate and effective tool for the process of Testing.\n- Perform rigorous and frequent unit tests."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:79c841ef-08da-451d-a520-83b8262e0b0c>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I live in a cold region - what's the science behind frost damage to plants, and what are the most effective methods to prevent it?","answer":"Frost damage occurs when temperatures drop below one degree on clear, still nights. Cold air settles at the lowest points, causing moisture inside plant cells to freeze and expand, bursting the cells. The damage becomes visible when the ice thaws. Plants are particularly vulnerable when temperature drops suddenly or when they break dormancy during winter warm spells. To prevent frost damage, several methods are effective: 1) Choose plants that match your climate zone's cold hardiness requirements 2) Use protective covers like frost cloth that allows 70% light transmission while preventing frost formation 3) Place sensitive plants in warmer microclimates like southern exposures or near structures 4) Apply seaweed-based tonics which can increase frost tolerance by 2-5 degrees 5) Maintain proper plant nutrition as healthy plants better tolerate cold 6) Ensure adequate soil moisture before freezes as wet soil retains heat better 7) Avoid late-season fertilizing with high nitrogen which promotes frost-susceptible new growth.","context":["The first day of winter marked the first significant frost this season at Sophie’s Patch and there have been more since then. Prior to this there had been some minor frosts in lower areas of the garden but last weeks finished off my summer crops. Frost can wreak absolute havoc on plants that are not adapted to cope like many of the succulents I grow on my back deck, so now is the time to be proactive.\nWhen does frost occur?\nIn the Adelaide Hills we are blessed with a cooler climate than on the plains – this gives up relief from the stifling summer heat, it gives us the spectacular displays of autumn foliage that is just drawing to a close, and it also allows us to readily grow a whole range of plants that require cooler temperatures, such as cherries and camellias. Frost helps the autumn tones, it can intensify the flavour of winter vegetables and improve fruit set on cool climate fruit trees such as cherries, and yet it can also cause challenges of its own. Not all areas of the hills experience frost, but for those gardening in low lying areas, such as Mt Barker, the Onkaparinga valley or around Mylor to name just a few examples, it can present a challenge.\nFrost occurs on clear still nights when the temperature drops below one degree. If there is no wind, cold air settles to the ground and pools to the lowest level such as the bottom of a valley. These cold temperatures cause moisture to freeze and expand, including the moisture inside a plant’s foliage. The expansion causes the cells to burst however we don’t usually notice the damage until it thaws is because the ice holds the plant rigid.\nFrost damage can be worse in particular areas of a garden. Cold air, being heavier than warm air, tends to collect at the lowest point. It can actually get trapped by a fence or hedge at the bottom of a garden so makes sure to leave a narrow exit for this cold air to escape. The canopy of evergreen trees and shrubs often protects the plants growing underneath and frost damage will not be as severe here. This is often seen with Cliveas, those wonderful shade loving, waterwise perennials with dark green strappy leaves and bright orange flowers. Out in the open they are frost tender and can actually be burnt off completely, however under an evergreen plant in the same garden, they may thrive.\nSeasonal variances, such as early autumn rains, can also help to cause frost damage in plants that are usually frost tolerant. For example early autumn rains and mild weather can cause plants to put on a spurt of growth, all of which was tender and can then be badly burnt by frost. This can even occur on plants that are indigenous to an area and well suited to their environment.\nThe obvious solution for gardeners in frosty areas is to choose plants that are frost tolerant, however understand that there are degrees of frost tolerance is vital. A plant that survives frost to -2 or -3 degrees like those we would get at my previous garden at Ashton may be killed by the -5 degrees we get at Mt Barker Springs. Unfortunately plant labels may not reflect this. Choose plants that come from places within Australia and overseas that regularly experience low temperatures and frost. Just as there are adaptations that help plants cope with heat and drought there are a number of adaptations that help plants cope with frost. Deciduous trees and shrubs have lost their leaves over winter, and in this dormant state are unaffected by frost. Herbaceous perennials have died down and are safely under the ground. Other adaptations include the downward facing foliage of conifers and any plant with tough leathery leaves.\nSo what do I do to prevent frost damage in my garden?\nFirstly I move tender plants if I can. If I am growing plants like succulents, lemon grass or ginger in pots, I simply move the containers under the eaves of my house and that protects them. Similarly if I want to grow plants that aren’t suited to my climate, I try to place them where there is a favourable microclimates. My frost tender night-scented Jessamine (Cestrum nocturnum), Plumbago and Iochroma are positioned against the stone walls of my house and they have survived really well with the protection that affords them.\nTreating my plants with a seaweed based plant tonic seaweed solution can also help increase a plant’s frost tolerance by 2-5 degrees, which can mean the difference between life and death. As well as this I spray tender plants with an anti-transpirant spray such as Droughtshield which puts a protective polymer film over the leaf and prevents frost damage for up to a month. In New Zealand this same product is sold as Frostshield. Also, the simple act of washing the frost off the foliage of sensitive plants before the sun hits will help to reduce the damage.\nSome trees and shrubs need to grow up high enough that their new foliage is above the frost line, and this may only be matter of a couple of metres. This is the case with Jacarandas which I am trying to establish on my front lawn. The main tree has grown well as it is closer to the paving which must increase the local temperature slightly. Over the past few years young plants further away from the paving which haven’t been covered have been killed or at least severely knocked by frost so this year I have them wrapped with frost cloth.\nSome plants may be frost hardy once established but can still be frost tender when young. So if you live in a very cold frosty area, unless you are planting known frost hardy plants, delay planting until the risk of frost is over (usually mid spring) even though autumn is often a better planting time from a waterwise point of view. If there are only a few possibly sensitive plants you want to plant, and you believe that they will only be frost tender for the first year or so until they get established, you can cover them at night when frost is predicted. Place a cloche like structure over the frost tender plant.\nIn early spring when I am planting small summer vegies which dislike our late frosts I use old glass flagons which have had their bases cut off. You can also create a protective cocoon using some sort of frame covered in frost cloth (available in a roll from good hardware stores or nurseries), clear plastic or hessian, or even an upturned plastic pot, but be sure to remove solid covers like pots in the morning. Frost cloth works the best as it becomes the surface on which the moisture freezes rather than the plant. It can also remain on the plant for long periods – during the day and night, providing an insulating layer while allowing about 70% light transmission as well as rain penetration. Draping frost cloth over small shrubs and trees and securing it to the ground with bricks or such, traps heat that has collected in the soil during the day and releases it slowly at night, preventing frost formation. Holding the material down away from the trunk allows more warm air to be trapped.\nFinally if you do have some plants damaged by frost this year, do not prune them back until the last frost has passed as even the dead foliage protects the plant underneath, and the act of pruning stimulates new growth which will be tender and very susceptible to frost damage.","Protecting Plants from Cold Temperatures\nAlthough we live in the South, winter sometimes brings cold temperatures that can cause severe damage to many of our landscape plants. A late freeze after the temperature rises in January or February could be more injurious than the same cold temperature in winter when these plants have become dormant and more resistant to changes in temperature. An example is the sudden drop in temperature in April 2007 that killed or severely damaged many plants. It is important to protect plants from these cold temperatures.\nTemperature Changes and Plant Damage\nA plant’s ability to withstand cold temperatures depends on plant species, and how low and how fast temperatures decrease. When temperatures gradually decrease, a plant can acclimate, or adjust itself, to withstand colder temperatures better. Sudden decreases in temperature cause more damage in fall or early winter than similar low temperatures well into winter. If temperatures increase during the winter months, some plants may break dormancy, or deacclimate, and begin leafing out or flowering. Plants that break bud dormancy become more susceptible to late frost because of their new, tender growth.\nCold injury can occur to all parts of the plant (flowers, fruits, leaves, stems, trunks, roots, and buds). Fruits and flowers are the least tolerant of cold injury because they have little ability to adjust or build up tolerance to colder temperatures. Leaf and stem tissues are injured and damaged when ice forms within the plant’s cells, which typically occurs during a rapid freeze. When this happens, the plant’s tissue dies; this is often characterized by plant parts turning brown and mushy. When the temperature drops slowly, ice sometimes forms between the walls of the plant’s cells. Hardy or cold-acclimated plants can often withstand this type of ice formation.\nWindy conditions can also cause plant damage by desiccation, or the drying out of the plant. Desiccation causes marginal or leaf-tip burn or totally brown leaves in severe cases. Desiccation occurs when a plant loses more water than it absorbs, or takes up, by its roots, especially when the ground is frozen.\nHomeowners in Mississippi can enjoy a wide variety of plants. They can increase their choice of available plants by careful selection based on growing conditions and location in the landscape. By planting a combination of tender and hardy plants and by protecting plants susceptible to cold temperatures, homeowners can have landscapes that survive cold temperatures.\nProtecting Plants from Cold Temperatures\nPlant and Site Selection\nThe best way to prevent cold injury to plants is to choose plants that tolerate the cold temperatures in your area. Mississippi is in USDA Cold Hardiness Zones 7b, 8, and 9a. Northern regions of Mississippi are in Zone 7b, which means that plants need to be hardy to 5–10ºF. Northwestern and central regions of Mississippi are in Zone 8a (10–15ºF); southern Mississippi is in Zone 8b (15–20ºF); and the coastal tips of Mississippi’s three coastal counties are in Zone 9a (20–25ºF). Select plants that meet the minimum cold-hardy requirements in your area; for example, if you live in Zone 8a, choose plants that are hardy to at least zone 8a and preferably zone 7 to ensure they can better withstand any sudden cold dips in temperatures in your area.\nIn addition to proper plant selection, proper site selection is essential. Assess your property to determine the location of the coldest and the warmest spots. During the winter, the coldest spots are often found on the north and northwest parts of the property and in low areas where cold air settles. The warmest spots are usually on the southern part of the property.\nAssessing the microclimates of your property is also important. Elevation, landform, soil properties, canopy cover, and proximity to structures or other plants determine a microclimate. You can help protect plants by placing cold-sensitive plants near the part of the house that receives southern exposure or near larger plants or other structures.\nMaintaining proper plant nutrition also helps protect your plants from cold damage. Proper nutrition of plants is critical. A plant that has been given the appropriate nutrition tolerates cold temperatures, withstands sudden temperature drops, and recovers from cold damage better than plants that are nutritionally deficient.\nFertilizing plants at the proper time of year is also vital. Fertilizing plants in the fall (after August or September) with a fertilizer high in nitrogen can result in a flush of new growth that is more susceptible to cold temperatures.\nDuring the fall and winter months, most plants enter a dormant period when they need less fertilization. Winterizing-formulated fertilizers, which are high in potassium and low in nitrogen, may be used.\nCanopies and Shade\nTree canopies can reduce cold injury from radiational freezes. Radiational freezes occur on calm, clear nights when temperatures drop because of radiational cooling or heat loss from the earth and from the surfaces of objects. Canopies help reduce radiant heat loss from the ground to the atmosphere by raising the minimum night temperature beneath them.\nPlants that grow in shaded areas are less susceptible to winter desiccation, or drying out, than plants that grow in open areas. But plants that prefer full sun do not do well in the shade and will be unhealthy and less tolerant of cold temperatures if you plant them in the shade.\nWindbreaks such as fences, buildings, and temporary coverings can help protect plants from cold injury. Windbreaks are most useful in reducing injury resulting from cold winds and advective freezes (freezes that occur when temperatures drop because of the invasion of cold air masses into the area).\nCovering and Heating\nProtect plants that are in containers either by placing them inside a protective structure (house, garage, greenhouse, or shed) or by placing a protective covering over them. Container plants are more susceptible to cold temperatures than a similar plant growing in the ground. Their roots are more exposed because they are above the ground. Roots that are damaged by cold temperatures may not show immediate signs of damage, but these plants will show signs of stress when temperatures increase.\nPush together container plants that are left outside, and mulch or cover them to decrease heat loss from the sides of the containers. Wrap the bases of the containers in plastic, burlap, or blankets to reduce heat loss.\nPlants that grow close to the ground are usually protected by heat radiating from the soil. Plants that are tall and more open do not receive this radiating heat and are not as protected from the cold.\nRemember to mulch the soil. Mulching protects the roots of plants and helps reduce heat loss, thus minimizing temperature fluctuations. As with shrubs and trees, protecting the roots is necessary for them to survive the cold and come back in the spring.\nCovering your plants helps protect them from frost as well as from extremely cold temperatures. Covers that reach the ground and do not come in contact with foliage form a layer of insulation from the cold temperature. To prevent foliage breakage, avoid having the covers (sheets, blankets) touch the foliage. Remember to remove these protective coverings from the plant canopy after cold temperatures have passed.\nWhen extremely cold temperatures are predicted, place a light bulb (60-watt is sufficient) or other heat source under the cover to provide heat. Be very careful when using a bulb or other heat source, which can be a potential fire hazard. Do not let the bulb or heat source come in contact with the plant or the cover. Remove the cover and provide ventilation during the day to allow release of the heat that is trapped by solar radiation. This precaution is critical when using plastic covers.\nWater Needs before and after a Freeze\nWatering plants before a freeze can help protect them from cold injury. Soil that is well watered absorbs more heat and then reradiates heat, helping to increase the elevated temperature around the plants. However, poorly drained soils result in plants that have weak and shallow roots, which are more susceptible to cold injury. Use mulch to help retain soil moisture.\nCheck the water needs of plants after a freeze. After very cold temperatures, water that is in the soil may still be frozen and unavailable to the roots. If plants are transpiring (losing water from their leaves) and water is unavailable to the roots, plants may dry out. To provide water for plants, apply water to thaw the soil and the ice.\nPruning in late summer or early fall can result in new growth that is more susceptible to cold injury; so avoid pruning at this time of year.\nWait to prune plants until new growth appears in late winter or early spring. Cold damage will be more apparent, making it easier to remove the damaged portions of the plant. Severely injured plants may not break bud in the spring and may take on an overall weak appearance. Branch tips are more likely to suffer cold injury than older wood.\nTo determine if wood has been injured by the cold, check the cambium layer (layer directly under the bark). To do this, carefully scratch through the bark layer or carefully slice through this layer with a knife. Healthy, undamaged cambial tissue will be green; damaged will be brown or black. Prune this wood below the discoloration.\nTo determine if your fruit plants have been damaged by the cold temperatures, wait several days after a freeze and remove several flower buds from the plants. Use a sharp knife or razor blade to cut a cross section of the bud’s top. If there is any discoloration in the bud, the bud has been damaged and will not produce fruit. Damage may be localized, however, and not all buds may have been damaged. Check several buds from different areas of the plant to get a better assessment of the damage.\nPlants can be protected from cold temperatures by proper selection, placement, and care. Healthy plants are more resistant to cold injury than plants that are weakened by disease, by insect damage, or by improper care. You can take measures to protect plants during sudden and prolonged exposure to cold temperatures.\nPublication 2303 (POD-02-19)\nRevised by Jeff Wilson, PhD, Assistant Professor and State Master Gardener Coordinator, North Mississippi Research and Extension Center.\nThe Mississippi State University Extension Service is working to ensure all web content is accessible to all users.

{"question":"What are the key considerations for preventing weed growth using landscape fabric, and how does this approach align with sustainable soil management practices?","answer":"Landscape fabric prevents weed growth by creating a barrier a few inches below the soil surface that stops weeds from sprouting roots, offering an alternative to harsh chemicals. When installing fabric for weed control, it's important to properly secure it and ensure it's dense enough to block weeds but porous enough for water penetration. However, from a sustainable soil management perspective, this approach needs to be balanced with maintaining soil quality parameters. While fabric can control weeds, sustainable soil management relies more on practices that improve organic matter content, maintain microbial diversity, and support proper nutrient cycling. Some experts prefer natural alternatives like proper ground cover and crop rotation to control weeds while preserving soil health and microbial biodiversity for long-term agricultural productivity.","context":["Landscape fabric is an excellent choice for sloped yards, gardens with weeds, and lawns with compact soil. If you hire a team of professional landscapers, it’s important to know everything they use and install in your yard. Not only does this fabric affect the soil, but it also changes how you maintain the plants.\nProfessional landscapers use fabric because it provides a barrier against weeds and compact soil. It also helps regulate water retention, drainage, and plant growth. Most landscapers use this fabric on sloped yards because they often have irrigation problems. Weed-ridden soil needs fabric, too.\nIn this article, we’ll explain whether or not professional landscapers use fabric, why they might advise against it, and if you need to replace the fabric. I’ll also talk about when it’s an essential requirement for your yard.\nCheck out the DynaTrap Mosquito & Flying Insect Trap – Kills Mosquitoes, Flies, Wasps, Gnats, & Other Flying Insects – Protects up to 1/2 Acre (link to Amazon).\nWill Professional Landscapers Use Landscape Fabric?\nProfessional landscapers often use landscape fabric. It’s an inexpensive solution to weeds, drainage issues, and compact soil. However, some of them steer clear of the fabric because it can cause difficulties. For example, germinating grass typically has problems pushing the roots below the fabric.\nConsider these five reasons some pro landscapers use fabric:\n- Landscape fabric promotes drainage. Most fabrics let a little bit of water through the soil. This process prevents soil compaction because it doesn’t soak and dry the dirt too quickly. It also helps your plants get enough moisture before it falls too deep. All fabrics have unique water retention properties.\n- You won’t have to deal with weeds too often. Landscape fabric is almost always designed to prevent weeds from growing. The fabric goes a few inches below the soil, which stops the weeds from sprouting roots. If they can’t grow roots, they can’t get above the surface. Some people use plastic instead of fabric for additional protection but it comes with additional issues.\n- You can start a new lawn or garden with landscape fabric. If you don’t like your grass or flowers, you can cut them, cover them with fabric, add a few inches of soil, and start over. Landscape fabric allows homeowners to design a brand-new yard without having to remove everything and start from scratch.\n- Some fabrics dissolve within a couple of years. If you don’t want to have fabric for too long, you’ll be glad to know that it typically goes away within two to three years. Ask for an all-natural fabric that decomposes. These fabrics keep the soil in good condition while the plants set deep roots.\n- They prevent stones from sinking into the dirt. You can use landscape fabric to prevent stones and gravel from sinking into the soil. Wet dirt is spongey and can make the rocks look uneven. However, a thin layer of fabric will keep the rocks level throughout the rainy season.\nWhile many professionals use landscape fabric, it’s not always required. If you’re on the fence about asking your landscaper to use fabric in your yard, you should review the following section.\nIs Landscaping Fabric Needed?\nLandscape fabric is needed if your yard has too many weeds. You can use this fabric to cover the garden and start a new plot of soil. Many landscapers use fabric to promote optimal drainage. Some landscape fabric comes with holes to let the water fall through and hydrate the roots below the soil.\nInstead of spreading harsh chemicals throughout your yard, you can use a thin layer of fabric. Since it sits below the surface, it’s always out of sight and out of mind. It’s also much less harmful to native animals and bugs in the area (source).\nIf you’re looking for a landscape fabric for your yard, try the Amagabeli 4ft x 100ft Weed Barrier Fabric (link to Amazon). This fabric is lightweight and comes with up to 400 square feet of material. It’s perfect for mulch, plant growth, rocks, and more.\nSo, should you ask your landscapers to add fabric? Ask yourself these questions:\n- Do you want to lay rocks, tile, or bark? Landscape fabric provides an excellent barrier that stops the soil from sinking. You can lay this fabric on the soil and cover it with numerous landscaping materials to give your yard a natural appearance without making everything look uneven.\n- Are there a lot of invasive weeds in your yard? Landscape fabric is also known as weed cloth. This is because it prevents weeds more than anything else. You can use it to keep weeds out of your lawn, bark, gravel, and garden. It’s also an excellent way to keep weeds from growing around a tree.\n- Are you planting new grass seeds? Some grasses can’t germinate through landscape fabric. If you’re laying new grass, we recommend using straw or burlap sheets. These materials are porous enough to prevent weed growth while letting the grass grow through the soil. You can rake or mow the straw after a couple of months of growth.\nShould You Have Them Replace the Landscape Fabric?\nYou should have your landscapers replace the fabric if it’s brittle, torn, or deteriorated. Landscape fabric can’t prevent weeds when it gets too porous. The experts will remove the old fabric and replace it with a new layer. Make sure you know if you need porous or dense fabric for your yard.\nKeep in mind that some expert landscapers won’t add another layer of fabric. Some homeowners use landscape fabric for the initial growth process, but it’s unnecessary after a few years.\nThankfully, most of the fabric deteriorates, and all you have to do is remove the other scraps to restore the soil.\nLandscape fabric is typically used for new projects rather than for maintaining a yard. While it can prevent weeds from growing, it’s not always the most reliable long-term solution.\nThe fabric breaks down over a few years, which means it quickly loses its effectiveness. The best way to prevent weeds is to fill dry patches of soil throughout the yard.\nMost weeds can’t grow without adequate space around the soil. If the dirt is covered in grass, trees, flowers, and other plants, the weeds won’t be able to spread.\nThe seeds can’t germinate because there’s not enough moisture, nutrients, and sunlight to spare. Mow your lawn and use natural herbicides to maintain a healthy, weed-free lawn if your landscaper doesn’t use fabric.\nIs Fabric or Plastic Better for Professional Landscaping?\nFabric is better for professional landscaping because it lasts longer and allows your plants to grow through the soil. It also provides much better drainage compared to plastic sheets. However, some experts prefer plastic for shallow-rooted plants because it can prevent weeds and maintain a lot of moisture.\nLandscape plastic is often the cheaper alternative. It doesn’t allow enough moisture through the soil, so it’s not the best choice for most plants. You can use it with some plants that don’t need to send their roots deeper than a couple of inches.\nHowever, it’s an excellent solution for rock beds because it doesn’t allow moisture through the surface.\nThe RolyPoly Plastic Sheeting Roll (link to Amazon) is a top-notch example of high-end landscape plastic. It’s 6 mil thick, which is more than enough to prevent all plants from growing through the dirt.\nEach roll has 10’ x 100’ of material. It’s UV-resistant to prevent sunlight damage, which means it’ll last much longer than the competition.\nIn most cases, we’d suggest asking a professional landscaper about which fabric or plastic you should use. All climates and soils are unique, which means there’s no one-size-fits-all material for every yard.\nAlmost all professional landscapers offer fabrics and other materials to prevent weeds from growing. However, some of them only use the fabric underneath rocks and bark.\nSee our detailed article Plastic vs. Fabric: Which Is Better for Landscaping?\nDo Landscapers Put Fabric Over the Grass?\nLandscapers put fabric over the grass to lay gravel and other rocks. These professionals usually cut the grass very short, layer it with fabric, and cover it with a dense layer of dirt, gravel, sand, or pebbles.\nPeople have been putting landscape fabric over the grass for a long time. It’s one of the best ways to suppress plant growth. However, there are a few things you should know before adding any material over grass or weeds to start a new layer of soil, bark, etc.\n- Dig a trench around the grass before laying the fabric. This trench helps the lawn staples secure the fabric to the soil. It also prevents water and fertilizer from aiding the grass growth. You should also mow the grass as short as possible beforehand.\n- Nut grass is strong enough to push through some landscape fabrics if it’s not short enough. Cut the nut grass and till the soil to prevent it from growing through the fabric. Remember to put something on top of the fabric to crush the grass, such as mulch, tile, or pebbles. See Can Perennial Weeds Grow through Landscape Fabric?\n- Make sure the soil is dry before covering it with landscape fabric. Trapped moisture can cause root rot and soil mildew, which smells gross. It can also sink the soil, causing anything on top of the fabric to dip into the ground. You can use a leaf blower to dry the soil, but we suggest waiting for a dry, sunny day.\n- You can place artificial turf on top of landscape fabric. This turf is dense and heavy enough to prevent the grass from growing. It’ll also smother weeds and other plants below the fabric. Always secure the fabric with lawn staples before adding artificial turf and other landscaping materials.\nWhy Don’t Some Landscapers Use Fabric?\nSome landscapers don’t use fabric because they don’t dig deep enough or they don’t want to disrupt the soil. Natural decomposition creates some of the best soil in the world. Digging into the dirt and placing a fabric layer disrupts the process, preventing your plants from getting enough nutrients.\nHere’s a list of additional reasons some landscapers don’t use fabric:\n- Too much landscape fabric can prevent proper drainage. Excessive amounts of fabric will stop water from getting to the plants’ roots. The fabric should be dense enough to prevent weeds from growing through the surface but porous enough to let water through the soil. See Can You Double Layer Landscape Fabric?\n- Not all soil needs landscape fabric. If your soil is aerated, healthy, and full of plants, you won’t have to worry about weeds and other invasive plants. You also might not need fabric or plastic if you don’t want gravel and other rocks in the yard. You can ask your landscapers if they think your soil could benefit from fabric.\n- Some roots can’t grow through the fabric, which could severely limit the plants’ potential. If you have new plants, they might not sprout far enough to reach the soil. You can wait to add the fabric until after the plants germinate, but you’ll have to transplant each of the plants for the best results.\n- Many yards can be weeded and treated to keep invasive plants from growing. If your yard doesn’t have an invasive plant problem and you don’t want to lay rocks, there’s no need to get landscape fabric. Some yards have naturally healthy soil with nutrient-rich plants. It’s almost always better to stick to natural solutions if possible.\n- Mulch and compost provide similar benefits in terms of drainage and dense plant growth. If you don’t want to put plastic or fabric in the soil, you can use mulch and compost as a nutrient-dense alternative. Most compost and mulch piles are compact enough to help water slowly move through the roots.\nProfessional landscapers use fabric when it’s necessary. Always talk to your landscapers before starting the job. It’s crucial that you know if there’s fabric or plastic because it influences the way you water, fertilize, and grow plants.\nIf the company suggests against the fabric, it’s typically best to stick with your soil’s natural composition.\n- Can You Lay Landscape Fabric Over Rocks?\n- Can You Double Layer Landscape Fabric?\n- Is Landscaping Fabric Food Safe? (The Research-Based Facts)","Soil Quality using Management Practices\nSoil quality is the most important factor for long term agricultural productivity . A good soil manager will monitor the organic content of the soil, water holding capacity, and a host of other soil quality parameters that are discussed in detail in the article below.\nSoil quality also relies on the diversity of beneficial soil microorganisms.\nWise management practices could improve soil quality\nSurface soil produces our food and is vital for life. This precious resource often is called “skin of the Earth” and, just as skin, it is important to protect and maintain its quality.\nSoil quality is the inherent capacity of a particular soil to support human health and habitation; maintain or enhance air and water quality; and, most important, sustain plant and animal productivity.\nFrom an agricultural standpoint, soil quality is vital for improving long-term agricultural productivity and maximizing profits through sustainable productivity.\nIt is important for soil both to function optimally for current needs and remain healthy for future use. Soil organic matter, tillage, soil compaction, soil structure, depth of soil, water-holding capacity, electrical conductivity, pH, ground cover, microbial biodiversity, carbon-to-nitrogen ratio and nutrient management are some of the important parameters of soil quality.\nImproving and maintaining soil organic matter content is the most important quality parameter. Increasing organic matter improves soil structure as well as water- and nutrient-holding capacity, supports soil microbes, and protects soil from erosion and compaction. Organic matter can be improved by using no-till or minimum till methods, growing cover crops, leaving crop residues and using rotations with crops that balance optimal water and nutrient management practices.\nUsing reduced tillage practices will protect the soil surface, which decreases soil erosion and soil compaction, and decreases the loss of organic matter. Reduction in tillage also decreases the potential for destroying soil structure. Soil compaction can be caused by using heavy equipment on the surface when the soil is wet. Compaction will reduce the amount of air, water and pore space for growth of both soil microbes and plant roots. Soil compaction can be reduced by minimizing equipment use when the ground is wet and combining multiple farm tasks, such as applying both herbicides and fertilizer in one trip.\nGrowing cover crops and leaving residue from previous crops is the best way to reduce soil erosion by wind and water. Ground cover can be increased by growing perennial crops such as grasses in a pasture situation. Ground cover will improve water availability, but care should be taken to manage it properly to prevent disease outbreak.\nSoil quality also relies on microbial organisms. Diversity in soil microbes may be helpful in controlling pest populations, diseases and weeds. Biodiversity can be achieved by increasing long-term crop rotations, since each plant in rotation contributes to unique soil structure and plant residue.\nUnderstanding how to improve soil quality is aided by knowledge of the carbon-to-nitrogen (C:N) ratio for managing cover crops and nutrient cycling.\nThe C:N ratio is the amount of carbon to the amount of nitrogen in a residue or other organic material applied to soil. If material with a higher C:N ratio residue is applied, it takes longer to decompose and may immobilize inorganic fertilizers that are applied. This problem can be reduced by growing a low C:N ratio crop (e.g., vetch or other legumes) in rotation with a high C:N ratio crop (e.g., wheat straw).\nFinally, efficient nutrient management is important in maintaining soil quality. Test your soils regularly and make sure that you store all your records. Examining records over time will tell whether the management practices that were followed increased or depleted soil nutrients. Too much fertilizer or manure may cause groundwater contamination or may run off and enter water bodies and degrade water quality.
