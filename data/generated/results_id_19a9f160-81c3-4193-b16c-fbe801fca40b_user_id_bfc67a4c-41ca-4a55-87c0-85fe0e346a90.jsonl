{"question":"What thermoregulation capabilities did megalodon and Salmon Sharks possess? Can you explain their temperature control mechanisms?","answer":"Both sharks had the ability to control their body temperature. Salmon Sharks are described as 'homoeothermic,' meaning they can control their body temperatures, which is particularly useful in the cold Pacific. Similarly, as a lamniform shark, megalodon was likely a mesotherm, meaning it could maintain parts of its body at higher temperatures than the surrounding water through specialized blood vessels that help retain and distribute heat created by muscle contractions.","context":["In this quick tutorial you'll learn how to draw a Salmon Shark in 6 easy steps - great for kids and novice artists.\nThe images above represents how your finished drawing is going to look and the steps involved.\nBelow are the individual steps - you can click on each one for a High Resolution printable PDF version.\nAt the bottom you can read some interesting facts about the Salmon Shark.\nMake sure you also check out any of the hundreds of drawing tutorials grouped by category.\nHow to Draw a Salmon Shark - Step-by-Step Tutorial\nStep 1: Draw a sideways V.\nStep 2: Draw another, longer V within the first and connect their points with a straight line.

Fishermen have caught the shark as far north as Alaska in the United States and as far south as the Sea of Japan. Although the shark is known to follow salmon populations, the Salmon Shark isn’t a picky eater. Salmon Sharks will eat many ocean fish like cods, Pollock, herrings, and some squids. Salmon Sharks are short sharks, they measure 3 meters long. Their snouts are cone-shaped and their skin is a blue gray color that can be any range of light and dark. Although Salmon Sharks aren’t fished for a lot, there are times when fishermen will catch on in its nets or the shark damages their equipment. There have been times when fishermen have killed a Salmon Shark on purpose to get it out of the way.\nDid you know?\n- Salmon Sharks give birth to live young and a litter is 3 to 4 pups.\n- Sometimes a Salmon Shark is mistaken for a White Shark. During mating season, a White Shark will eat a Salmon Shark.\n- In America, the fins of the Salmon Shark are made into soup and the skin is tanned into leather.\n- In Japan, the fins, skin, oil, and meat are all used. The Japanese use the Salmon Shark’s heart in a dish that is served raw.\n- A Salmon Shark is something called “homoeothermic.” That means they can control their body temperatures. That’s pretty useful out in the cold Pacific!\nLesson Plan Note: Turn your classroom into the Pacific Ocean!

At a maximum body size of 50 feet long, this ancient mako relative was the largest shark ever to chomp its way through the seas. No other shark species, even among its close relatives, grew quite so large. But how did megalodon become so exceptional?\nA new study, published today in Historical Biology by DePaul University paleontologist Kenshu Shimada and colleagues, suggests that cannibalism in utero may have helped set up the rise of the largest meat-eating shark of all time. The researchers suggest that a biological connection existed between having large, hungry babies, a metabolism that ran warm and increases in size—with the appetites of baby sharks driving their mothers to eat more and get bigger, which led the babies to get bigger themselves.\nShimada and colleagues focused on the size of existing lamniform sharks, using measurements of today’s makos and their relatives to estimate the size of prehistoric sharks. By figuring out how body size relates to tooth size, the researchers were able to look at the fossil teeth of various extinct sharks and come up with refined estimates of how big those prehistoric fish were.\nMost of the sharks were comparable in size to lamniformes alive today. Only four lineages of ancient lamniform shark got to be more than 20 feet in length, with Otodus megalodon being an extreme outlier at more than twice that maximum length. “We expected megalodon to be gigantic,” Shimada says, “but what surprised us was actually seeing in our data a 23-foot-gap between the size of megalodon and the size of the next largest carnivorous lamniform sharks.”\nPart of what allowed megalodon to get so big has to do with the fact that many lamniform sharks have warmer body temperatures than other sharks. A great white shark isn’t warm-blooded in the same way that we are, for example, but the great fish can maintain some parts of its body at higher temperatures than the surrounding water thanks to specialized blood vessels that help retain and distribute the heat created by the contractions of the shark’s muscles. Scientists know this as mesothermy, and it’s likely that sharks like megalodon were mesotherms, too.\nRunning warm may have given the ancestors of megalodon and other lamniform sharks a route towards body sizes impossible for other species. The physiological difference allowed lamniform sharks to swim faster and feed in colder waters than other species. “The evolution of mesothermy is related with enhancing prey intake,” says Swansea University paleontologist Catalina Pimiento, who was not part of the new study. A warm, energetic shark needs more food than a slow, cold-running one, and large prey like blubber-rich seals offer a more economical way to feed. The largest predatory shark alive today, the great white shark, frequently feeds on marine mammals because its body requires such rich food.\nBut how did lamniform sharks evolve warm metabolisms in the first place? Shimada and colleagues suggest that competition in the womb, even cannibalism, had an important role to play.\nToday’s lamniform sharks reproduce in a particular way. “Lamniform sharks don’t lay their eggs outside of the body, but instead the eggs hatch inside the mother,” Shimada says. From there, the pups develop until they’re ready to leave the womb. And they’re hungry. The little sharks that hatch early often eat unhatched eggs, and sometimes even their hatched siblings. And being that megalodon was a lamniform shark, it’s likely that the prehistoric giant’s babies would have acted like their modern counterparts.\nDrawing from the relationship between physiology and reproduction in modern sharks, Shimada and coauthors propose that cannibalism in utero may have pushed these sharks to turn up the internal heat. Giving birth to a small number of large offspring may have required that mother sharks consume a greater amount of food, which may have been an evolutionary nudge towards mesothermy, with the needs of the babies and mother sharks opening a new evolutionary pathway. “This new paper suggests that intrauterine cannibalism may have been another driving mechanism for the evolution of mesothermy,” Pimiento says.\nThe relationship between the two doesn’t always work in lockstep, though. Pimiento notes that some sharks, like the sand tiger shark, are not mesothermic but still have cannibalistic embryos. These sharks are not open-ocean cruisers that target seals and whales, like megalodon did, but instead live a slower life along the coast and mostly dine on fish. The difference for megalodon is that the shark lived during a time when marine mammals thrived in the seas, their blubbery bodies providing a surplus of high-energy food. The possibility for giant predatory sharks was set in place by the needs of embryos and their mothers, and a surfeit of marine mammals offered an unprecedented opportunity to megalodon to grow far larger than any carnivorous shark before or since.\nThe path to larger sizes may have been led by those larger offspring. While it’s energetically costly for a mother shark to raise large embryos, Shimada says, those big babies would already have an advantage of being born large enough to hunt and avoid the jaws of many other predators. Add to that the fact that the number and size of pups varied between individual sharks and natural selection had the raw materials for larger and larger sharks to make their mark on the ocean when there was enough food to support such predators.\nThe task at hand is to find the critical evidence. While paleontologists have yet to uncover direct evidence for how many pups megalodon had or how many were birthed at a time, some rare shark fossils have been found with embryos. It’s possible such a find could help provide just that much more context to how the largest meat-eating shark of all time came to be. As much as we’re fascinated with enormous, whale-crunching megalodon, the sought-after clues may lie with baby sharks that beat the odds before even being born."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:e6d8ee25-9a2f-4643-affe-68da98b62307>","<urn:uuid:c32fa18a-4c39-4a12-81dc-54f8672db33f>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do rising ocean temperatures and nutrient levels affect coral reef survival, and what are the potential solutions to protect them?","answer":"Rising ocean temperatures have caused severe damage to coral reefs, with summer sea surface temperatures increasing by 1.5 degrees Celsius over the last 10 years, leading to a 30% decline in coral growth. These temperature increases are linked to human-induced climate change and are predicted to continue rising. Additionally, nutrient level changes from fertilizer run-off can also trigger bleaching events. To protect coral reefs, two main solutions are proposed: a significant global reduction in greenhouse gas emissions to address temperature rises, and local improvements in water quality to manage nutrient levels. Without these interventions, some coral species could cease growing altogether by 2070 or sooner.","context":["As summer sea surface temperatures have remained about 1.5 degrees Celsius above ambient over the last 10 years, growth of the coral, Diploastrea heliopora, has declined by 30% and “could cease growing altogether by 2070” or sooner, they report in the July 16 issue of the journal Science.\n“The warming in the Red Sea and the resultant decline in the health of this coral is a clear regional impact of global warming,” said Neal E. Cantin, a WHOI postdoctoral investigator and co-lead researcher on the project. In the 1980s, he said, “the average summer [water] temperatures were below 30 degrees Celsius. In 2008 they were approaching 31 degrees.”\nCantin and WHOI Research Specialist Anne L. Cohen, the other lead investigator, said the findings were unexpected because D. heliopora did not exhibit one of the typical signs of thermal stress: bleaching. “These corals looked healthy,” said Cohen.\nBut CT scanning of the coral's skeletal structure in the laboratory revealed “the secrets that the skeletons are hiding,” she said. “The CT scans reveal that these corals have actually been under chronic stress for the last 10 years, and that the rates of growth were the lowest in 2008,” the final year of the study.\nThe other WHOI researchers who participated in the study are climate dynamicist Kristopher B. Karnauskas, coral biologist Ann M. Tarrant and chemical oceanographer Daniel C. McCorkle.\nCohen and WHOI graduate student Casey Saenger had previously used CT scanning to quantify skeletal growth in Atlantic corals, but she credits Cantin with “pioneering” the technique for this type of oceanographic research. “He really took it to another level,” she said. “What Neal really did was to adapt the imaging software, previously developed for bodies, specifically for our coral needs. This was an excruciatingly difficult task but it certainly paid off. We could not have used conventional techniques on this coral. The skeletal architecture is too complicated.”\nHistorically, scientists have used x-rays to examine coral skeletons, which display annual growth bands much like tree rings, Cantin explained. But that method usually entails cutting into the skeleton, he said. CT allows non-invasive 3-D observation of the skeletons and bands.\n“The biggest advantage we have over x ray is that we can scan intact cores without cutting the core into thin slices,” said Cantin. “Since corals do not grow in a straight line, when the core is cut, inevitably the growth axis will be lost from a thin cut. Maintaining the vertical growth axis is crucial for us to visualize the annual density banding patterns.\n“With CT scanning we are able to work with a complete 3-D reconstruction of the entire core. We can then make digital slices from the core, as many times as we need to in order to continually visualize the annual density bands. CT scanning is the evolution of x-ray.”\nWith CT, adds Cohen, “We have a 3-D visualization of the skeleton from which we can make ‘virtual’ cuts on the computer that have the exact thickness, orientation and location that we need for a particular coral to get the most precise measurements. X-ray requires that we cut the core ‘blind’ beforehand, before we know what the orientation of growth is. Whole cores can be sacrificed this way. With CAT scanning, our cores are imaged intact, nothing else is required. This is a huge leap forward over x-ray.”\nLike MDs diagnosing a sick patient, the researchers scanned six skeletal cores of D. heliopora and were able to pinpoint two high-density growth bands, indicating high thermal stress in 1998 and 2001. This correlates with an abrupt drop in skeletal growth after 1998, which has continued steadily since then.\nThe corals are building skeleton, or calcifying, at a progressively slower rate because they are losing symbiotic algae that live in the coral tissue. By performing photosynthesis, the algae provide the fuel for the corals to make new skeleton.\nBut, says Cohen, “when the corals are thermally stressed, they lose algae and many will eventually starve and die. When corals lose enough algae, they actually turn white, and that’s what bleaching is. We think these corals are on their way to bleaching.”\nIt was the CT technique that enabled early detection of the problem. “The corals look healthy, but looking inside at the skeleton gives you an idea of things to come,” she said. “It’s like osteoporosis. You look at a person and, on the outside, everything seems fine, but inside there are signs of trouble.\nThe same corals had a similar reaction to a “warm event” in 1941-42 but recovered within three years as the ocean cooled. The recovery was possible because that warming episode was probably triggered by El Nino, a natural, short-term climate anomaly.\nIn contrast, the current warming trend—which Cantin says has been going on since 1980--“is due to human-induced climate change,” he says, and appears unlikely to be slowed or reversed before coral health deteriorates further. Climate models from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predict that “summer temperatures in the central Red Sea will continue to rise as atmospheric CO2 concentration rises through the 21st century,” the WHOI researchers report in Science.\nCo-author Karnauskas concurs that there is little doubt that the Red Sea phenomenon is attributable to long-term climate change. “El Nino events typically last about one year, and in a few rare cases last for two years.,” he says. “El Nino--and its ‘cold’ counterpart, La Nina--are quite well known with a very distinct signature in the Pacific Ocean, where they originate. El Nino and La Nina events have been occurring for millions of years, and the past few decades have been no exception.\n“Therefore, there is no way El Nino could account for a ‘trend’ that persists for decades. These are simply superimposed upon the human/CO2-induced warming trend. There is probably nobody in the scientific community who would argue the rising temperatures in the Red Sea are related to El Nino. So, in the past few decades, the Red Sea temperature has been going up just like the global mean temperature, and the corals are suffering accordingly.”\nThe IPCC models forecast another 2.5-3-degree C rise in Red Sea temperature by the end of the 21st century. But the authors project that D. heliopora will cease calcifying altogether by 2070, when the models predict that temperatures will reach 1.85 degrees C higher than they are now.\nEven that “is probably a conservative estimate,” they say. Cohen suggests the end for this species of Red Sea coral may come as early as 2050.\nThe scientists point out that the results show that, at least in this case, the culprit is sea surface temperatures and not ocean acidification, another effect of CO2 emissions that has become an increasing concern for scientists.\n“We were able to pinpoint temperature as the driver of the declining growth rates because we have long records of skeletal growth going back to around 1930,” Cohen said, “and we were able to correlate skeletal growth with temperature records that span the same time period. We were also able to rule out ocean acidification because we have actual measurements of the aragonite saturation state of seawater--a measure of acidity--at our study sites.\nShe cautions against drawing conclusions about other coral species based on these results. “This study reports the impact of rising temperature on one coral species,” she says. “It’s an important reef-building coral in the Red Sea, but there are about 250 species of stony corals in this region and we have no idea what the other species are doing. Some might be doing much worse; some might be doing a little better in terms of thermal tolerances. We need much more of this type of work to be able to predict what the coral reefs will look like over the next few decades.”\nThese corals, Cantin says, have demonstrated that they are capable of recovering from the transient high-temperature event in the early 1940s. \"However\" he says, “\"this species [in this study] has not [recovered] from the last decade of global warming.”\nOn a long-term scale, he says, “This [CT] technique allows us to assess reef recovery rates without monitoring that reef for 30 years. We can establish an ecological baseline of coral growth for as far back as the corals lived. We can assess this coral colony’s physiological performance back through time.”But now, for D. heliopora, the outlook appears bleak. “The data in hand suggest that without immediate, aggressive global intervention to reduce carbon emissions,” they conclude in their report, “the pressures of predicted annual heat stress will most certainly result in further deterioration of coral health in the central Red Sea over the next century.”\nThe work was funded by King Abdullah University of Science and Technology.\nJoel Greenberg | EurekAlert!\nFurther reports about: > 3-D image > CAT scan > CO2 > CO2 emission > Climate change > El Niño > IPCC > Oceanographic Institution > Pacific Ocean > Science TV > Slows > WHOI > Woods Hole Oceanographic > coral health > coral reef > coral species > global warming > ocean acidification > sea surface > sea surface temperature > thermal stress\nHow fires are changing the tundra’s face\n12.12.2017 | Gesellschaft für Ökologie e.V.\nUsing drones to estimate crop damage by wild boars\n12.12.2017 | Gesellschaft für Ökologie e.V.\nMPQ scientists achieve long storage times for photonic quantum bits which break the lower bound for direct teleportation in a global quantum network.\nConcerning the development of quantum memories for the realization of global quantum networks, scientists of the Quantum Dynamics Division led by Professor...\nResearchers have developed a water cloaking concept based on electromagnetic forces that could eliminate an object's wake, greatly reducing its drag while...\nTiny pores at a cell's entryway act as miniature bouncers, letting in some electrically charged atoms--ions--but blocking others.

After the coral is exposed, it often breaks down and dies, altering the ecosystem for the diverse array of life that relies on it. Corals stand little chance of bouncing back from these events — but a new study suggests they have an unusual survival method: taking on a vibrant neon color.\nWhen bleaching events occur, extended heat spikes cause corals to turn a ghostly white, often leading to their death. Even slight increases in annual ocean temperatures can wreak havoc on this relationship, expelling the algae from the coral’s tissue and exposing its white skeleton. These corals can still undergo some of their normal functions for a short period of time as they hope their algae come back — whereas drastic changes in ocean temperature almost always lead to coral death. Reports of colorful bleaching during the most recent mass bleaching event in the Great Barrier Reef in March and April gave scientists hope that patches of the system have a chance to recover. “Bleaching is not always a death sentence for corals, the coral animal can still be alive,” said Dr. They found that colorful bleaching events occur when corals produce “what is effectively a sunscreen layer” on their surface to protect against harmful rays and create a glowing display that researchers believe encourages algae to return. The Ocean Agency describes the process as a “chilling, beautiful and heartbreaking” final cry for help as the coral attempts to grab the algae’s attention. “Our research shows colorful bleaching involves a self-regulating mechanism, a so-called optical feedback loop, which involves both partners of the symbiosis,” lead researcher Professor Jörg Wiedenmann of the University of Southampton said in a press release.

Scientists first spotted the mysterious neon coral a decade ago, but they had been unable to figure out why it occurred.

Scientists emphasized that while colorful bleaching is a good sign, only a significant reduction of greenhouse gases globally — in addition to improvement in local water quality — can save coral reefs beyond this century.\n“Now that we know that nutrient levels can affect colorful bleaching too, we can more easily pinpoint cases where heat stress might have been aggravated by poor water quality,” researchers said.

{"question":"Please compare the evolution of dancing styles in New Orleans Jazz and the Foxtrot, presented in chronological order from their origins to modern times.","answer":"New Orleans Jazz dancing began in the late 1800s with voodoo rhythms and evolved through the early 1900s, becoming known as 'hot jazz' or 'early jazz' and leading to the Lindy Hop dance in Harlem. The style continues to evolve through modern performers like Ellis Marsalis and Harry Connick Jr. The Foxtrot, on the other hand, emerged later as a Ragtime dance, credited to Harry Fox who performed a fast trotting dance in the Ziegfeld Follies of 1914. It was subsequently refined by dancing teachers and evolved into two distinct styles: the English/International Foxtrot (known as the 'slow foxtrot' or 'saunter') and the American Foxtrot (also called Social Foxtrot or Rhythm Dancing), which resembles slow quickstep due to Arthur Murray's influence.","context":["While Jazz is considered an American art form and particular to New Orleans, the question is often asked “Why?”\nIn all styles of traditional jazz (Chicago, swing, west coast, Kansas City or dixieland) New Orleans Jazz stands out for a number of reasons. First and foremost, New Orleans is where it all started. While most of Americans were moving their feet to military marches in the late 1800s, New Orleans was moving to voodoo rhythms and drums. Of course you didn’t have to travel far to have the influence of Delta blues to combine those drum beats into rhythm and blues but that is getting ahead of the story. The combination of rhythm and delta blues merged with the sounds of gospel hymns coming out of the churches of the early 20th century. This gumbo of sounds put together by local musicians in New Orleans created the very first jazz.\nAlthough Buddy Bolden is considered one of the first jazz men, he was surpassed by people such as Sidney Bechet, Jelly Roll Morton, and Louis Armstrong. It’s not a far leap from the days of those stars to the current flag waivers such as Ellis Marsallis, Wynton Marsalis and Harry Connick Jr. When Papa Jack Lanine’s band circa 1885 played, it was noted that he did so in a “ragged time”. It’s been said that the musicians played in various tempos and that made it “swing”. Perhaps so, but Papa Jack was also a consummate clarinetist, teacher and mentor to many of the early jazz musicians.\nAnother factor in the early New Orleans sound was the importance of improvisation. In classical music the goal is to play the same songs without varying from one note each time play a piece. Now as for jazz, the idea is to use the melody line as a guide and then to play extemporaneous passages based on that melody and chord structure.\nNew Orleans jazz is often referred to as “hot jazz” or “early jazz”, a style of music that led to the Lindy Hop dance in Harlem some years later. The unique cultural environment of New Orleans in the late 19th and 20th centuries with vestiges of Spanish and French colonial roots mixed with the influences of Africans freed from slavery cannot be over stated. Simply put, there’s no place like New Orleans.\nBy 1917, the early pioneers of jazz were taking their music on the road. From Chicago, to New York and from Kansas City to the West Coast, New Orleans jazz spread like wild fire. The long list of musicians who each left their stamp on the evolving jazz style continues to this date. New Orleans jazz is alive and well in the city of New Orleans and across America.\nFurthermore, many of the great musicians stayed at home in the 1920s which lead to such great bands as Papa Celestin’s Original Tuxedo Jazz Orchestra, A.J. Piron’s New Orleans Orchestra, The Sam Morgan Jazz band and many others. None of these musicians became famous in the manner of Louis Armstrong or Jelly Roll Morton, but the truth is the musical scene in New Orleans remains fertile ground for creative musicians united by a common love of that syncopated swing sound known as New Orleans Jazz.","A History of Dance\nby Chris & Terri\nI.

His whole life may be\ndevoted to tending the same few fertile acres, his eyes cast down to\nthe earth beneath his feet, as he plows, sows, or reaps. The\nplainsman develops a slow, heavy tread and walks with his weight on\nhis whole foot. He might develop running dances that take up a great\ndeal of ground.\nANCIENT ROUND DANCES: In ancient round\ndances, the dancers formed a circle around something or someone\nbelieved to hold special magical power -- a stone, a wooden object,\nor a witch doctor (modern-day Cuers?). As the dancers move in a ring,\npower is believed to flow from the object outward to the ring and\nback again. The dance becomes so absorbing that often dancers felt\nneither fatigue nor pain. As they whirl around, the performers\nbelieve that they themselves have become spirits. These round dances\ndate from earliest times and are found almost worldwide. They\nflourish wherever people believe that power can leave one object and\nenter another object by magic (kind of like that helpless look some\ndancers give the Cuer before a routine to help them remember what was\nin that new routine taught the week before). Long after their ritual\norigins had been forgotten, the round dances continued on. Round\ndances invaded the ballrooms of the 18th-Century Europe. Original\n\"Round Dances\" are still popular with the country people of\neastern Europe, and survive today in the children's game of \"Ring\nA Round the Rosie.\"\nII. North American Dances\nDid you ever wonder where dance rhythms\noriginated? Though many of the current Round Dancing rhythms\noriginated int the Caribbean, South America, and Europe, several have\ntheir true origins in North America. A few \"North American\nOriginals\" are below.\nBARN DANCE: A nineteenth-century\nAmerican couple dance in 4/4 time, taking its name from the rural\ncustom of dancing to celebrate the completion of a new barn. Known\nalso as the pas de quatre and the military schottische, the steps\ninvolved walking, hopping, sliding, turning, and foot stamping,\nwhich shocked many who believed all dancing should be decorous.\nBIG APPLE: A party dance that\nappeared around 1935 in New York, taking its name from the Big Apple\nClub of Columbia, South Carolina. Couples arranged themselves in a\nlarge circle and performed figures according to the instructions of\nBLACK BOTTOM: A dance employing\nstrong African- and Caribbean-style hip movements, which first\nappeared on Broadway in 1926, and which scandalized older dancers on\nboth sides of the Atlantic because of its gliding, skipping,\nleaping, and stamping -- not to mention its flaunting of the\nBOP: American solo dance popular\nin the mid-1950s, consisting of a sort of marching in place to music\nthat emphasized the upbeat. Variations were the scooter, the flea\nhop, the swister, and the rock and around.\nBOSSA NOVA: A combination of\nAmerican jazz rhythms and Brazilian samba, popular in the USA in the\nCHARLESTON: Originated in\nCharleston, South Carolina, where black dockworkers danced to amuse\nthemselves. Transported to New York, it became a hit in the Ziegfeld\nFollies of 1923, and was quickly adopted by the flappers.\nCONTRA: Contra is an American form\nof country-dance perfected in the late 17th century. Sets of couples\nfaced each other, usually in a square or rectangular pattern, and\nexchanged positions using various figures. The name also refers to\nthe fact that the dancers performed counter to, or opposite each\nother. May have originated from Court Dances.\nFOXTROT: Foxtrot was originally a\nRagtime dance best credited to Harry Fox, a music-hall entertainer\nwho performed a fast trotting dance that electrified the Ziegfeld\nFollies of 1914. Tamed by dancing teachers, it became a popular\nballroom dance to ragtime music. The English smoothed out its jerks\nand originally called it the saunter; it is now termed the Slow\nFoxtrot (also called English or International Foxtrot). Today,\nSocial Foxtrot (also called American Foxtrot or Rhythm Dancing)\nclosely resembles slow quickstep, due to the influence of Arthur\nMurray. It involves various combinations of short, quick steps.\nJITTERBUG: In the jitterbug\n(another name for lindy) athletic couples moved energetically, alone\nand together to a rapid beat, originally to 1930's boogie-woogie and\nswing music. There are two types of basic steps, those in which the\nfeet stay on the ground, and the \"air steps\" in which the\ndancer leaves the floor entirely.\nJIVE: Jive is a tamed version of\nthe jitterbug that came into fashion in the 1950s.\nONE-STEP: Also known as the turkey\ntrot,the most ubiquitous ragtime dance. It was universally popular\namong the young during the early twentieth century. The one-step\nsimply required a single step per beat.\nRAGTIME: Dances performed to\nsyncopated, jazzy music of ragtime, popular in the late 19th\ncentury. Ragtime also includes the mimic/animal dances (e.g., black\nbottom, bunny hug, cakewalk, turkey trot) popular in the first two\ndecades of the 20th century.\nROCK 'N' ROLL: Frenetic, solo or\noccasionally couple dances performed to the simple, compulsively\nrhythmic style of pop or rock music originating in the 1950s. These\ndeveloped out of jive.\nROUND DANCE (ancient definition):\nPrehistoric groups would dance around a central object or totem. In\nthe 19th century, these became country dances in a round or circular\nformation (as opposed to a square), in which the couples exchanged\npositions. The term is also used for the 19th-century, couple dances\nsuch as the waltz or polka, which feature a constant turning of the\nSQUARE DANCE: An American form of\ncountry dancing, developed from the early 19th-century contras and\nquadrilles. Couples face each other in a square formation and\nexchange places in relation to their partners and to the other\ncouples. Another addition is that of a caller who announces the\nfigures or floor patterns they are to perform.\nTWO-STEP: A dance requiring two\nsteps per beat, first performed to John Philip Sousa's Washington\nPost March (1891), and rapidly applied to other dances of the\nperiod, until ousted by ragtime and the one-step. An ancestor of the\nTWIST: Solo rock dance that first\nappeared in 1961, performed by Chubby Checker.\nIII. International Dances\nDid you ever wonder where\ndance rhythms originated? In Part 1 (last month), we discussed\nseveral \"North American Originals.\" This time, we will\ndiscuss the origins of several other popular dance rhythms in Round\nOriginally an erotic dance from the Caribbean and Argentina. The\ndance was tamed in France in the early 20th century, and became a\ncraze in England and the US, where \"tango teas\" took\nplace, offering a small space for fashionable dancers to show off\ntheir skill. It was further refined in England and a new dance was\ncreated, the INTERNATIONAL TANGO. There were innumerable different\ntango steps in 2/4 time, although the dance was standardized, at\nleast for ballroom performers, in the 1920s. The Argentine tango is\none of the Latin dances while the International tango is one of the\nSmooth/Modern dances. AMERICAN TANGO is a combination of Argentine\nand International figures and techniques. It is generally classified\nas a Smooth/Modern dance, too.\nBALLROOM DANCE: Social\ndancing usually performed for pleasure at \"balls,\" in\ndance halls, and the like. Ballroom dancing competitions, for\ncouples or for groups, are a popular form of entertainment.\nBOLERO: Spanish dance\nin 3/4 time that came from Provence in the Middle Ages, but which by\nthe 19th century had developed into a folk dance to a throbbing\nrhythm from vocal or guitar and castanet accompaniment.\nCHA CHA: A Cuban dance\nderived from the mambo, possibly named after the noise made by the\nslippers of Caribbean women (2 slow and 3 quick steps), to the Latin\nAmerican sound in 2/4 or 4/4 time. First popular in the middle\nCONGA: A Cuban dance in\nwhich performers formed a long chain by holding onto the waist of\nthe person in front, and snaked their way around the floor, house,\nor even town, performing a 1-2-3-kick to Latin American music. First\npopular in England and the US in the 1930s.\nMAMBO: Cuban dance\npopular in the US and Europe in the mid-1950s. The mambo is a\ncombination of Latin American and jazz. There is one beat in each\nbar on which the dancer does not take a step.\nMAXIXE: A ballroom\ndance, originating in Brazil as a festive folk dance with athletic\ndipping and swaying steps.\nMERENGUE: The merengue\nhas a \"limp\" step in which the right foot is brought up to\nthe left to Latin American music. Legend claims that a Dominican\nRepublic ruler/general who had a severe limp but loved to dance\noriginated this dance. It was first popular in the US in the 1950s.\nMINUET: A stately\nsocial dance developed in 17th-century France, involving short\ngraceful steps, bows, and curtsies.\nMORRIS DANCE: A folk\ndance originating in Spain (the name is a corruption of \"Moorish\")\nand developed in England. The dancers, wearing bells and waving\nscarves, move in patterns of skipping, trotting steps.\nPASO DOBLE: Spanish\none-step (a dance that requires a single step per beat of music)\noriginally popular in the 1930s.\nPOLKA: The polka came\nfrom Czechoslovakia and Bohemia. The name is connected to the Czech\nword pulka, meaning \"half\" (half steps are used in the\ndance). It is a wild and whirling athletic dance, with fast hopping\nand running steps. The catchy rhythm in 2/4 time made the dance\nwidely popular in Europe and the US after its performance on the\nParis stage in 1844.\ndance that gave birth to the quick fox trot (American Foxtrot/Arthur\nMurray Foxtrot). It was given the name \"quickstep\" in 1929\nand is performed smoothly with gliding steps and turns.\nRUMBA: From Cuba,\noriginally an erotic dance combining African and Caribbean rhythms.\nIt reached the US in the late 1920s in a tamed version in 2/4 or 4/4\nSAMBA: Brazilian dance\nin 2/4 or 4/4 time whose name came from the dances performed by\nAfrican slaves. A modified version was introduced at the 1939 New\nYork World's Fair and became popular in Europe after World War II.\nWALTZ: Probably the\nmost famous of all ballroom dances, the waltz was originally a\nGerman turning dance. This dance, in 3/4 time, conquered the rest of\nEurope in the early 19th century, though it had to contend with\nfierce criticism because of the close hold required and the speed\nwith which the dancers revolved around the floor. In the Viennese\nwaltz, couples turned in only one direction; in the slower American\nversion, the Boston, they could turn in any direction.\nIV.

These heat detection aids can generally be divided into three categories: mounting sensors which provide an indication of the cow in heat getting mounted by another cow, hormone synchronization protocols which time the cows' heat cycles and electronic heat detection aids.\nTail painting and mount sensors provide an indication to the farmer if the cow has been mounted by Heat Detection Cows (a typical heat-related behavior) and therefore is in heat. These methods do not provide a marked improvement in heat detection accuracy as they are affected by cow activities unrelated to heat, nor are they able to determine the exact timing of the beginning of the heat cycle to optimize insemination timing and require a considerable investment in labor to administer, maintain and monitor them.\nElectronic heat detection aids were first introduced into the market in the 1980s with the deployment of pedometers. Pedometers are strapped to the cow's leg and count the number of steps she takes – an increase in the number of steps taken by the cow provides a 70%-80% accurate indication of the cow being in heat.\nPedometers were never able to generate considerable market penetration due to their cost-benefit ratio. 70% accuracy was not enough to induce farmers to invest in these systems.","Scientists Explain How to Reduce Heat Stress in Cows Before It's Too Late\nCalifornia is home to nearly 1.8 million dairy cows.\nCalifornia is the nation’s top milk-producing state and home to nearly 1.8 million dairy cows. California is also hot, especially for cows, which have trouble keeping cool when the weather gets warm. And when cows get too hot, their milk production decreases. Severe overheating can threaten cows’ health and their ability to get pregnant and carry calves to term.\nDairy farmers use fans and sprayers to cool cows in their barns, but there is a substantial need for better options. Existing systems use a lot of energy and water, which is costly for farmers. And climate change is raising temperatures and stressing California’s water supplies.\nSee also: Dramatic Shrinking Animal Trend Will Make Cows the Biggest Mammals on Earth\nWith funding from the California Energy Commission, we are among the animal scientists and engineers collaborating at UC Davis to test new innovations and measure how they affect electricity and water consumption, as well as cows’ health and behavior. We are also evaluating the cost of these technologies and their potential for large-scale adoption in commercial dairies in California.\nThe Threat of Heat\nDaytime temperatures are regularly over 72 degrees Fahrenheit for more than five months of the year in California’s Central Valley, the state’s main dairy region. Above this threshold, cows start to feel the heat. Cows are particularly sensitive to hot weather: Their body temperature is 101.5 degrees Fahrenheit, three degrees higher than humans, and they create a large amount of heat as they break down feed in their stomachs and produce milk.\nWhen outdoor temperatures rise, it becomes increasingly difficult for cows to dissipate body heat to the outdoor environment. As they try to regulate their body temperature, their respiration rates begin to increase. Then they start to drool and breathe with their mouths open, much like dogs panting. If they cannot cool themselves, their body temperature will increase. These are all considered signs of heat stress. Once it sets in, cows will produce less milk. They may have trouble getting and staying pregnant, and in severe cases may die.\nWhen summer heat skyrockets, humans can jump into a swimming pool or retreat indoors under the air conditioning and feel relief, at least until we see our electrical bills. Dairy cows do not have these luxuries. To cool cows, dairy farmers use a combination of shade, fans, and water, usually when cows are in their barns. The cows are gently sprayed while they eat, usually for four to five hours per day, and while they wait to be milked.\nThese strategies help cows regulate their body temperature, but use large quantities of water and electricity. The average California dairy farm spends $140,000 annually on utilities.\nFurthermore, these systems may be insufficient during extreme heat waves. During one stretch in 2017, temperatures in the Central Valley of California reached highs above 90 degrees Fahrenheit for 53 days in a row. Extended hot spells like this increase the instances of heat stress in dairy cattle.\nOther Ways to Cool With Water\nOur study is comparing four different systems for cooling cows. Two of them utilize evaporative cooling processes, which take advantage of the fact that when water changes from a liquid to a gas, it absorbs a lot of heat. This process produces cooler, more humid air, but can also be used to cool liquid water.\nOur first cooling technology uses mats buried approximately 4 inches underneath the sand bedding where cows lie down. Water flows through the mats and absorbs heat from the cows through conduction. The heated water then flows to a device called a Sub-Wet Bulb Evaporative Chiller, where it is cooled using a high-efficiency evaporative cooling process and returned to the mats to absorb more heat from the cows. Because the chiller produces cool water using evaporation, it is ideally suited for hot and dry climates like California.\nThe second technology uses targeted direct evaporative cooling, sometimes referred to as a “swamp cooler,” and fabric ducts to blow cool air on the cows in the areas where cows eat and rest. Swamp coolers are simple systems that work by passing hot, dry air over water to cool it down.\nFor comparison, we also are testing two cooling systems that use traditional spray water and fans, similar to current technology on most California dairy farms. However, with one system we are working to reduce water use and improve cooling by moving the fan closer to the spray water to promote evaporation from cows’ bodies. As water evaporates off of the cows, it takes heat with it. To conserve water, we also are testing spraying the water for a shorter period of time.\nDuring our first test phase, we tested all four treatments on 32 cows at UC Davis and collected data on their respiration rates, body temperature, milk yield, and behavior, as well as weather, water use, and energy use. Data analysis is underway. We anticipate that we will identify at least one option that will cool cows as effectively as current options, but will also save water, energy, or both. Next summer we will test the most effective and efficient technology against the traditional spray and fan approach on a Central Valley dairy farm.\nFinding better ways to keep dairy cows cool is a high priority for this industry, as well as for cows’ welfare. We hope our findings can help California dairies improve their productivity and keep cows safe and cool, while helping California meet its energy and climate goals.\nThis article was originally published on The Conversation by Alycia Drwencke; Cassandra Tucker; and Theresa Pistochini.

{"question":"What are the key differences between physical presence nexus and economic nexus standards for sales tax collection after the Wayfair decision, particularly in terms of their thresholds and requirements?","answer":"Physical presence nexus and economic nexus represent two distinct standards for sales tax collection. Physical presence nexus requires businesses to have property, employees, or other physical presence in a state to be subject to sales tax collection. This expanded over time to include activities of affiliates, click-through, cookie, and marketplace facilitator nexus. Economic nexus, established by the Wayfair decision, allows states to require sales tax collection based on economic activity alone. The threshold established in South Dakota's law, which was upheld by the Supreme Court, requires merchants to collect 4.5% sales tax if they have either more than $100,000 in annual sales or 200+ individual transactions in the state, regardless of physical presence. Both standards continue to apply - sellers must evaluate their obligations under both physical presence and economic nexus rules, as they could be required to collect taxes by meeting either standard.","context":["Physical Presence Standard for Sales Tax VIA Quill Overturned - The Impact of the Supreme Court's Decision in Wayfair\nToday, the U.S. Supreme Court has issued its opinion in South Dakota v. Wayfair, No. 17-174, in a 5-4 decision in favor of the State of South Dakota’s imposition of sales tax under economic nexus principles. The case upholds South Dakota’s application of sales tax to internet retailers who sell into South Dakota but have no property or employees (i.e. physical presence) in the state. The South Dakota law, initially passed in 2016, required all merchants to collect a 4.5 percent sales tax if they had more than $100,000 in annual sales or 200 or more individual transactions in a calendar year into the state.\nThis law challenged the physical presence requirements for sales tax nexus previously established in the Supreme Court’s 1992 holding of Quill Corp. v. North Dakota, 504 U.S. 298, 318 (1992), which held that sales tax nexus cannot be established without physical presence, pursuant to the Court’s dormant commerce clause power to restrict state taxation of interstate commerce.\nMultiple companies, including Wayfair, chose not to register with South Dakota to collect sales taxes in the wake of this new law, resulting in South Dakota seeking suit with three of them (Wayfair, Overstock.com , and Newegg) to compel their registration and remittance. The holdings of the state courts prior to the Supreme Court’s review held for the internet retailers, and resulted in South Dakota’s appeal.\nThe Supreme Court’s majority opinion, authored by Justice Anthony Kennedy and joined by Justices Alito, Ginsburg, Gorsuch and Thomas in a 5-to-4 ruling, gave some insight into the Court’s reasoning, stating in dicta that:\n- “the Quill decision had distorted the nation’s economy and had caused states to lose annual tax revenues between $8 billion and $33 billion.”\n- “Quill puts both local businesses and many interstate businesses with physical presence at a competitive disadvantage relative to remote sellers”\n- “[Wayfair’s] advertising…states that we do not have to charge sales tax…Wayfair ignores in its subtle offer to assist in tax evasion is that creating a dream home assumes solvent state and local governments.”\nFurther, Judge Gorsuch, in his concurrence, indicated that remote sellers under Quill at present:\n- “…can avoid the regulatory burdens of tax collection and can offer de facto lower prices caused by the widespread failure of consumers to pay the tax on their own.”\nFour justices (Chief Justice John Roberts, and Justices Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan) dissented, agreeing that the Court was incorrect in its holding in Quill but arguing that it was on Congress and not the Court to change, as well as emphasizing the brunt of the negative impact will be on small business.\nPotential State Implications and Questions Moving Forward:\n- Under the South Dakota law, the tax applies to sellers that deliver more than $100,000 worth of goods or services into the state annually, or engage in 200 or more separate transactions for deliveries into the state over the course of a calendar year – this will serve as the constitutionally upheld standard states may seek to emulate; while the case decided focuses on South Dakota law, the Supreme Court’s ruling applies across all states.\n- 31 states currently have laws taxing internet sales; certain states may seek if their versions could survive to the extent they fail to follow South Dakota’s framework\n- Smaller companies may be the most impacted by the decision, as they may not have the tax expertise or professionals on-hand to follow the rules across multiple state tax jurisdictions.\n- Note that the Court specifically observed that South Dakota’s law, and its tax laws generally, minimizes the burden on interstate commerce. Other states are likely to craft their laws accordingly, and those states that deviate substantively may result in further litigation\n- The Court did not decide whether states may impose sales taxes retroactively, which certain states may do so depending on how aggressive they choose to be in their enforcement.\n- The Court is silent as to whether the other state economic nexus models are constitutionally valid (e.g. income and other similar taxes)\n- The Court did indicate the possibility that certain transactions were “so small and scattered that no taxes should be collected” which may keep a door open as to certain transactions which would be exempt from establishing nexus.\nPotential Federal Implications:\n- Congress has previously proposed several federal legislative solutions to apply across the states:\n- The Remote Transactions Parity Act – a destination-based system for collecting sales/use tax; states which meeting the simplification alternative can require out-of-state vendors to collect and remit the sales/use tax.\n- The Marketplace Fairness Act – also creates a destination-based collection system for the sales/use tax when the vendor and customer live in different states, in which the amount of tax due is based on the location of the buyer. More specifically, the tax due is based on the sales tax rate in the location where the buyer receives the product (or service), if it is known. The MFA allows qualifying states to require all out-of-state vendors to collect and remit the tax due for sales sourced to their state.\n- Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-VA) Proposal: An origin-based system, titled the Online Sales Simplification Act, requiring vendors would collect the sales/use tax based on their state’s tax rates and remit that amount to a clearinghouse. The clearinghouse would then send the amount to the state where the customer is located.\n- With today’s decision, there is increased potential for federal movement. State and Local Tax Professor Bruce P. Ely has opined that where such movement would previously have been viewed by the federal government as administering a new tax, it now has the potential to “bring clarity to the marketplace”\nThe multistate implications of the Wayfair decision will be ongoing as states seek to avail themselves of the ability to impose online retailers income tax.

Lenivy, Manager, BDO USA, LLP\nOn June 21, 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court issued what was likely its most significant state tax decision in more than 50 years. The ruling, South Dakota v. Wayfair (referred to as “Wayfair”), holds that states may require a business to collect and remit sales and use taxes even if the business does not have a physical presence in the taxing state.\nWhat does this mean? Bottom line: Consumers can expect to pay sales tax on many of their out-of-state online purchases. But it has significantly broader implications for companies selling in multiple states. Many states will now require businesses to charge and remit sales and use taxes based on an economic presence within their state, a concept referred to as “economic presence nexus.” (Previously, physical presence was required). Businesses that don’t comply with the states’ economic presence nexus rules will be liable for the sales tax they should have charged their customers and remitted, plus interest and penalties. The ruling also means that states may subject out-of-state businesses with an economic presence in their state to pay income taxes on income generated within the state.\n“Wayfair is a ‘game changer’ that dramatically increases the number of states where businesses will be subject to state taxes,” says BDO Partner Rocky Cummings. “Companies that fail to comply in states with economic nexus provisions will be exposed to potentially significant tax, interest and penalties.”\nCOMMONLY ASKED QUESTIONS\nDo the “physical presence” rules still apply?\nYes, sellers should evaluate their sales/use tax administration responsibilities under both the new economic nexus thresholds and the long-standing “physical presence” standards. For example, a seller may lack an economic nexus by reason of having sales and transaction volume below the state’s statutory thresholds, yet be required to administer sales/use tax by reason of having an in-state physical presence.\nSellers should note that physical presence nexus over the years has grown to include not only in-state employees (including nonresident/visiting) and property, but nexus may also exist through the activities of affiliates, “click-through,” “cookie,” and most recently marketplace facilitator nexus. Please note that traditional physical presence nexus rules should still be monitored.\nOf course, if a state has enacted an additional economic nexus rule, then a company should monitor its sales and transaction volume to see if the economic nexus thresholds have been reached.\nDoes Wayfair impact only online website transactions?\nNo, all remote sellers who ship or deliver goods or services across state lines may be impacted by Wayfair.\nIn light of Wayfair, will drop shippers (wholesalers) still be potentially required to administer sales tax in certain states?\nYes, wholesalers may be required to administer sales taxes on sales shipped or delivered to a state where the wholesaler has nexus (physical or economic) if the wholesaler does not collect a valid resale certificate from the retailer. However, we anticipate that in light of Wayfair, more remote sellers will register for sales/use taxes and, as such, wholesalers may be able to more easily collect a valid resale certificate from their customer, the retailer, who directs them to drop ship goods to the retailer’s customer. Wholesalers may now also incur business taxes in states where they have an economic nexus only.\nSome states sales/use tax laws do not impose a filing requirement if a seller is not making “retail sales of tangible personal property.” Other states laws require a vendor to register if the seller is making sales of any retail sales of tangible personal property. Furthermore, some states may impose a penalty for failure to file sales/use taxes, even if the tax amount due is zero. It would be prudent to file sales/use tax returns to start the statute of limitations for assessment, which reduces financial risk.\nIs there a generic form to use for sales/use tax reporting?\nNo, each state has its own unique sales and use tax returns.\nIs there any technology to help us manage tax rates and fillings?\nSeveral software vendors provide “front-end” tax calculation solutions and include state and local tax rates for the entire U.S. These applications also have taxability knowledge of many products and services sold by most companies. Regularly updated, these programs lessen the burden on a company from a rate and taxability maintenance perspective. The software does require upfront planning, system set-up procedures, and extensive testing in order to be sure the solution is configured properly.\nSome of these vendors also provide tax return preparation software which allows for the generation of signature-ready tax returns. Similar to the “front-end” sales tax calculation software, upfront planning, configuration and testing procedures are required, but on a smaller scale. An alternative to leveraging the tax return preparation software solutions is to outsource the return compilation process.\nIf a company has economic nexus for sales/use taxes in a state, must the company also register for income taxes in that state?\nIt depends! Even though there may be a “substantial nexus” between the state and the taxpayer, the state income tax statute may not extend to companies with only an economic nexus with the state. Even if it does, federal law may immunize the company from state income taxes. Also, as a general rule, the economic nexus thresholds differ by tax type.\nA consequence of the Wayfair decision is that states can apply economic nexus for all tax types, subject to certain federal constraints. State laws must adopt economic nexus for it to apply unless an existing statute can be interpreted to support economic nexus.\nPrior to the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Wayfair, a number of states had already asserted economic nexus based on their existing income tax laws. In addition, as more states have adopted market-based sourcing for purposes of determining the sales factor of their income apportionment formula, companies could now be found to have a taxable economic nexus in a state. We recommend that you consult your tax advisor to determine your state income tax requirements.\nComplying with the tax requirements created by the Wayfair decision can be complex.

{"question":"Which event lasted longer: the Battle of Stalingrad during WWII or the Human Resources for Health (HRH) Program in Rwanda?","answer":"The Human Resources for Health (HRH) Program in Rwanda lasted longer. It was a seven-year program that started in 2012, while the Battle of Stalingrad lasted approximately 5 months and 10 days, from August 23, 1942 until February 2, 1943.","context":["The ‘Spark’ That Led to Online General and Thoracic Surgery Education\nNumerous programs exist where physicians and healthcare staff travel to the developing world to treat patients and conduct surgical procedures. However, these visits often only last a week or two, and the medical experts return to their home countries with the equipment and the knowledge. As a result, there often is no sustainability of these efforts.\nThe founder of General & Thoracic Simulation Surgery Education for Developing Countries, Dr. Thomas Daniel, Professor Emeritus of Surgery at the University of Virginia School of Medicine, was selected as an instructor in 2013 for a program developed by the Ministry of Health in Rwanda, Africa.\nThis program, known as the Human Resources for Health (HRH) Program, was funded by a grant from the U.S. Center for Disease Control and started in 2012. It was a seven-year program whose goal was to accelerate the speed and quality of healthcare education in Rwanda by recruiting healthcare professionals from first world countries to come to Rwanda and teach for an extended length of time.\nThese doctors, nurses, midwives and hospital administrators came to Rwanda for periods of three months to a year or more. This length of stay allowed time to develop local relationships and to teach their Rwandan faculty counterparts. By teaching the teachers the program would have a sustained effect.\nAs Dr. Daniel prepared for his first trip to Rwanda in 2013, one fact kept going through his mind – “there is not a single trained thoracic surgeon in the entire country.” So, in addition to teaching general surgical procedures, he decided to introduce physicians in Rwanda to thoracic surgery. But he also wanted to create a sustainable teaching model that would continue long after he left the country.\nThis idea served as the spark for what is now an online General and Thoracic Surgery Education course focusing on six general surgery and four thoracic procedures — that would normally take months to see and learn. The online course can be combined with a hands-on simulation surgery workshop as part of a blended learning model.\nA one-day course in simulation surgery does not replace the intense training of surgeons in the developed world, but it does provide residents in the developing world with a head start at experiencing surgery.\nAccording to Dr. Daniel, surgery is not just a cognitive process about knowledge and anatomy that can be taught through textbooks alone. A surgeon-in-training needs to experience how their hands or instruments feel when applied to different tissue. Surgery also requires hand-eye coordination, as well as the judgment and skill that come with practice and repetition.\n“Simulation breaks the ice and provides the experience of having an experienced teacher directly walk you through a case,” says Dr. Daniel. “Simulation accelerates the learning process by creating environments where you can practice procedures and can afford to make mistakes, learn how to be captain of a team, and use assistants wisely.”\nAside from saving time, the online course reduces costs by not having to purchase textbooks and enables students to study and prepare prior to in-person simulation.\n“Simulation surgery is the wave of the future,” says Dr. Daniel, “and I’m thrilled to launch this unique venture of blended learning, teaching general and thoracic surgery by combining an online course with a hands-on simulation surgery workshop.”\nDownload the article “Creation, Implementation, and Assessment of a General Thoracic Surgery Simulation Course in Rwanda” (pdf) published in June 2018 issue of the Annals of Thoracic Surgery by The Society of Thoracic Surgeons. Vol. 105, Issue 6, p1842–1849.\nThis article was presented at the Sixty-fourth Annual Meeting of the Southern Thoracic Surgical Association, San Antonio, Texas, November 8–11, 2017.","World War two Timeline\nBefore the official beginning of World War II, many countries acted in an aggressive and warlike manner. In Germany, Adolf Hitler opened the first concentration camps as early as 1933 and became the “Fuhrer” or sole dictator of Germany in 1934.\nIn 1935, Benito Mussolini rose to power and became dictator of Italy. Both rulers quickly started enlarging their territory by taking over smaller countries. Germany took over Austria and Czechoslovakia while Mussolini absorbed Ethiopia and Abyssinia.

{"question":"What r the main differences between virtual hosting in Linux VPS vs Windows cloud servers when it comes to scaling? Necesito entender esto mejor!","answer":"Linux VPS and Windows cloud servers handle virtual hosting scaling differently. In Linux VPS, scaling is primarily managed through resource allocation within the virtual private server environment, where each VPS runs its own version of the operating system with dedicated resources. For Windows cloud servers, scaling is highly flexible and easier to implement - you can quickly add disk space and memory, and it offers on-demand scaling capabilities. Windows cloud servers are particularly suited for fast-growing businesses and websites with changing traffic patterns, allowing them to easily adjust resources based on needs. Both systems support virtual hosting, but Windows cloud servers emphasize immediate scalability and resource adjustment, while Linux VPS focuses on dedicated resource allocation within its virtual environment.","context":["Over the past few years, Linux has experienced an escalated growth and has become popular among the users who appreciate an open-source operating system. With Linux, a user has unparalleled flexibility which can aid in developing and altering the system as per their personal needs. Furthermore, Virtual Private Servers (VPS) when installed with Linux have proven to have a more successful relationship and is the preferred choice of many system administrators.\nWhat is VPS?\nA Virtual Private Server (VPS) is a virtual machine that appears to the user as a dedicated server but is installed on a machine serving multiple websites. It runs its own version of operating system and has dedicated resources. All VPS hosting providers rely on a virtualization software which is known as a hypervisor to abstract resources on the physical server and provide the user with access to an emulated Virtual Machine. All virtual machines run their own version of operating system, and this is where Linux comes into the picture.\nSignificance of Linux as an OS for Virtual Machine\nLinux is accompanied with Linux Security Modules framework which makes it secure, however, security depends on how you configure the operating system. It allows the Linux kernel to support a variety of security policies while being neutral to all security implementations. However, Linux VPS needs to be configured to meet your unique security needs and environment and can be preyed upon by hackers.\nThe open-source nature of Linux and the ever-changing requirements of the VPS users have contributed to the popularity of this duo. Nevertheless, security measures must be highlighted and implemented by the users of Linux VPS to ensure their websites are protected.\nPractices to Secure Your Linux VPS Server\n1)Disable Root Login – Secure the foundation of Linux VPS\nIn addition to being scalable, complete root access is one of the reasons why VPS hosting is popular. By default, every Linux administrator has a ‘root’ user or a ‘root’ account option which entitles and empowers the administrator to perform actions on the server.\nDisabling the root user adds another security layer, and can keep hackers at bay. Administrators can still execute root level commands using the ‘sudo’ command. Sudo is a restricted access right given to administrators or authorized users to run root level commands.\nMake sure to create a non-root user and give it proper authorization to execute ‘sudo’command.\nTo disable root login, open /etc/ssh/sshd_config in a Linux text editor like Nano or Vi. Find the parameter ‘Permit Root Login’ and change it to NO.\nIt should look like this –\n2) Keep Your Server OS Updated\nUpdating your system on a regular basis can eliminate security threats and vulnerabilities. It is recommended to update the operating system regularly and install the latest security patches and fixes.\nIf you are using CentOS or RHEL execute the following command to update your system –\nIf you are using Ubuntu or Debian, execute the following command to update your system –\nAlternatively, users can also configure the OS to send yum package notifications for update via email. A time-based job scheduler like Cron automates tasks in a Linux environment and can be setup to apply all available security updates.\n3)Use SSH to Securely Login Remotely\nSSH is also known as secure shell, and it is one of the protocols that is always running on the VPS server. It is used to operate network services securely over an unsecured network. Since SSH is always running, the hackers often eye it.\nThe first step to secure SSH configuration is to change the default port 22 to a different port which is not being used by another service. Changing the default port will prevent hackers to run malicious scripts from directly connecting to the port.\nTo change port number /etc/ssh/sshd_config\nAlternatively, implement the following actions –\n- Deny root access for users logging in from SSH\n- Disable password-based authentication and instead use key pairs for logging in\n- Install intrusion-detection software such as fail2ban or DenyHosts\n4)Ignore ICMP or Broadcast Requests\nInternet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is an error-reporting protocol network used to generate error messages to the source IP address when certain network problems prevent the delivery of IP packets. Most malicious attacks start with ICMP, which is widely known as ping scan.\nWhen the system responds to ICMP is disabled, it prevents the system from being discovered by a pin request.\nTo disable ICMP and Broadcast requests find /etc/sysctl.conf and add the following lines –\nIgnore ICMP request:\nnet. ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_all = 1\nIgnore Broadcast request:\nnet. ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts = 1\nReload the Sysctl configuration by entering the following command\nUse ping <your server name> to validate if the system is responding to ICMP requests or not.\nA user-space application program, iptables is used to set up, inspect, and maintain the firewall provided by Linux kernel. A user can set rules for filtering outgoing, incoming, and forwarding packets. It helps in preventing most Denial of Service (DOS) attacks and filters out unwanted traffic.\nIt is vital to disable unused network ports since open ports increase the vulnerability of the VPS server. Use iptables to close all open ports.\nnetstat will display all open ports.\n6)FTP or SFTP – Which to use?\nFTP or File Transfer Protocol is a standard network protocol which is used to move files between client and server on a network. FTP may seem handy to use, but it is an inherently insecure method of accessing the server since all authentications are sent in plain text format without any encryption. Anyone who is monitoring the connection between the user and their server can retrieve the password to the server.\nInstead of using FTP, switch to a more secure alternative like SFTP. The SSH File Transfer Protocol operates with the security of SSH protocol and transfers data with an end-to-end tunnel.\n7)Encrypt Sensitive Data\nAll data transmitted over the network between a server and a client can be monitored. Encrypting sensitive data might come at a price, but it is imperative to use encryption if you are concerned about data theft. Encryption transforms the data into an incoherent code and is inaccessible to anyone but the administrator with appropriate keys or password. Use GnuPG, also known as PGP to encrypt sensitive communication.\n8)Maintain a Strong Password Policy\nNever have empty passwords for user accounts or simple passwords that can be read easily by hackers using brute-force attacks. Make sure users can only login through SSH and enforce using stronger passwords.\nSet up a password policy by editing Pluggable Authentication Manager (PAM) configuration file. The location for PAM file in the following Linux distros –\nIn the above PAM configuration file, add the following lines to implement the use of minimum number of special characters, numbers, and uppercase letters.\npassword requisite pam_cracklib.so retry=2 minlen=9 difok=3 ucredit=2 dcredit=1 ocredit=3\n9)Set File Permissions Meticulously\nEven if the user has implemented security practices mentioned above, vulnerabilities can still exist if the file permissions are incorrect. If the system administrator has given rights to the users for incorrect files, it will make the VPS insecure and prone to vulnerabilities. In Linux, permissions are categorized into three groups, viz. owner, group and all users, and types – read, write, executable. Try providing permissions that are necessary. Review SUIG or SGID permissions, and never set 777 permissions to any file or folder.\nSecuring a VPS server is critical, and it must be the first thing you should do when you buy a VPS hosting plan. The security fixes mentioned above are necessary, but it also depends from user-to-user. One can fine tune these security settings as per their need and configure the VPS accordingly. A secure server is the basis of an unswerving website or application. The process of securing a VPS server is ongoing, and one must keep auditing their system, implement innovative solutions, and discover new practices to be a step ahead than malicious attackers.","Windows cloud server runs virtually in a cloud computing environment. This kind of server is constructed, hosted, and distributed through cloud computing programs through the internet. Cloud servers which are you can also call virtual servers, can be accessed remotely. Windows cloud server can run independently as a unit because it has all the software it needs to function properly.\nThe cloud refers to many servers linked to the internet and can be rented as a portion of an application service or a software service. Some of the services of a cloud service are the use of application or software, web hosting, data hosting, and data sharing. Using the cloud server helps decrease the creation of various file versions because you have shared access to data, documents, and files.\nThe cloud is also called cloud computing which involves linking many servers together for even sharing of the load. This means that complex processes can be used for distribution through various smaller computers as an alternative to using a single powerful machine. Federated storage clouds are an advantage of cloud storage. It means multiple distributed resources that act as one making the cloud bear faults because of data distribution.\nWhy Use Windows Cloud Server?\n- Windows cloud server ensures security and stability for your business because it will isolate your business environment from software problems. That means that your cloud server will not be affected by other cloud servers and the other way round. Unlike a physical server which lets server overload affect you, a windows cloud server won't let another user's cloud server overload impact your cloud server.\n- Windows cloud server gives you faster service as you’ll receive more resources and quicker services, giving you a website that runs very fast.\n- Security, speed, and stability are guaranteed when you use a Windows cloud server. It helps businesses to reduce their budget for IT, and they will not experience hardware problems.\n- Windows cloud server is highly scalable. It is also affordable and easy to upgrade by adding disk space and memory.\nVirtual Hosting Solution\nVirtual hosting is a common hosting solution for many websites. It uses virtualization to provide resources on a single server that many people use. Virtual hosting is safe and involves Web server hosting services so that businesses don't have to acquire and sustain their server and internet connections. Virtual hosting is also called hosting, and one who provides virtual hosting can be called a Webspace provider.\nBusiness owners whose businesses have outgrown shared hosting due to increased traffic but are not ready to invest in a dedicated server usually go for virtual hosting. They get their dedicated servers and have options to choose from various hosting plans. They get to choose the plan that best suits their business needs and can scale their site without stress when there is a need for extra resources.\nVirtual hosting helps you register domain names, various domain names that map to the domain name when registered, file storage distribution, and setting up the directory for web files, email addresses, and some other services. However, the virtual hosting user needs to have an FTP File Transfer Protocol program to help in file exchange with the virtual host.\nSome web hosting providers can make customers better control their e-mails, passwords, website file system, and other resources. In this way, they offer every customer a virtual server that completely looks like their server. If a customer wants to have a personal server, a web provider can let the customer rent a dedicated server at the hosting provider's location.\nCategories of Virtual Hosting\nVirtual hosting is of two varieties:IP-based virtual hosting and name-based virtual hosting.\n- IP-based: using IP-based virtual hosting means that every site points to an exclusive IP address, whether a group of DNA hostnames acting as the same or a DNS hostname. The webserver's configuration involves various physical network interfaces, virtual network interfaces on one physical interface, or many IP addresses on the same interface.\n- Name-based: this type of virtual hosting makes use of many hostnames for one IP address. A web browser that has HTTP/1.1 support is required for this hosting, and it consists of the hostname. The name-based virtual hosting lets a server host various sites behind one IP address to give the correct content of the site. Precisely, it means setting the HTTP header of the host which is compulsory in HTTP/1.1.\n- Improved Interaction: it has very interactive features and applications built in the hosting. This interactive feature lets the user appreciate the skill of developing a new website for his business.\n- Simplicity: users have always loved Microsoft for its simplicity and ease of use. Windows cloud servers are simple, have high quality, and also possess advanced programming language.\n- Effective Technology: windows cloud server has a great technology that is effective. The effective technology of this hosting helps to take your business to another level.\n- Beginner-friendly: usually, web developers can get overwhelmed by the various web platforms. But, the windows cloud servers are user and beginner-friendly. So, even a newbie developer is sure to get sufficient support.\nThe web server, which can open in two ways, uses the IP address to know the website to serve. The client not being a part of this process removes compatibility problems in this virtual hosting, unlike in the name-based virtual hosting with compatibility problems.\nHowever, the IP-based virtual hosting challenge is that the server will require a separate IP address for each website. This challenge increases the assigning of server addresses and puts the addresses to registries for use on the internet, which leads to exhaustion of IPv4 addresses.\nA major issue with this type of virtual hosting is the difficulty involved in hosting many secure websites that run SSL/TLS. The reason is that SSL/TLS handshake happens before sending the hostname to the server, and the server wouldn't know the certificate to show in the handshake. Although, Server Name Indication, a TLS extension, shows the name at the beginning of the handshake.\nPort-based websites are connected to an IP address and an exclusive port number. With this, an IP address can be used to host many websites. The exclusive port number for an IP address differentiates a website from other websites that are connected to a common IP Address.\nUses of Virtual Hosting\nVirtual web hosting is mainly used in companies that their business is based on low-budget website hosting for their customers. Most web hosting service customer websites are host on shared servers employing the technology of virtual hosting.\nA lot of businesses use virtual servers internally when they need to operate many distinct websites. Such reasons could be employee extranet, intranets for various departments, customer extranet website, and internal intranet. They can be joined to the same server with virtual hosting expertise, reducing administrative and management overhead, which cuts down the number of separate servers needed to keep the business running.\nWindows Cloud Servers\nWindows cloud servers are a great option for users who wish to build websites on coding language. It can be accessed through the Windows platform, and it keeps becoming popular with time. Whether a user has the technical knowledge or not, Windows cloud Servers are the best because the host providers will assist you in making the right choice for your website plan.\nThere are many benefits to using the windows cloud server, and user satisfaction is one of such benefits. You will have access to the means of succeeding in the global IT structure, and you'll also have important information available to you. Staff efficiency can improve through the hyper VPS cloud hosting solution that is also available in this service.\nFeatures of Windows Cloud Servers\nWindows Cloud Servers have many features that have been the best choice among users because they give superior results. Such features include:\nWindows cloud servers are affordable and cost-effective for users to build their businesses, whether big or small. The server has improved, flexible, and reliable features, ensuring that you don't run into difficulty while using it. They are fast and easy to install, and they work in a compatible setting with many software products.\nKey Factors of Windows Cloud Servers\nSome key factors of the windows cloud server include:\n- An integrated solution that allows easy operation and integration of all the windows operating systems for quicker outcomes.\n- Scalability, which increases to improve their web hosting service and leads to business support expansion. Users will enjoy more benefits with this high level of scalability.\n- The windows cloud server hosting helps the hosting provider give more offerings to their customers, making them sustain for a long time.\n- This hosting makes tracking easy because it uses a single control panel. It makes it able to keep monitoring many clients at a time.\nWindows Public Cloud Hosting\nWindows Public Cloud hosting is public cloud computing that involves creating different virtual machines by the service provider. They have to do with applications or storage which the public can reach. Public cloud services are intended for the public's access, and they can be obtained free without charges or at charges such as pay per use for each package.\nBenefits of Windows Public Cloud Hosting\nThe benefits of cloud hosting include:\n- Affordability: most host providers usually charge you for the resources you use when using windows public cloud hosting.\n- Capacity: public cloud hosting gives you the chance to utilize the much processing power that you require.\n- Scalability: windows public cloud hosting has to scale on-demand, which lets you increase your public cloud hosting in a short time.\n- Security: a multi-layer security architecture helps you to keep infrastructure secured.\n- Reliability: windows public cloud hosting is very reliable because it lets you use an entire network of servers, making it almost impossible to experience downtime.\nThose that need Windows Public Cloud Hosting\nWith the numerous advantages of windows public cloud hosting, let’s look at some of the sets of people that may use it and benefit the most.\n- Fast-Growing businesses: Fast-growing companies need to correctly plan out all the needed server resources and commit to them. This might be tedious and affect productivity. They should take complete advantage of this server with high scalability that is always available to concentrate on their growth.\n- Websites with Changing Traffic: Websites that have regular traffic spikes because of promotions, media coverage, business’ season, digital advertisement, and so on are another set that can benefit from Windows public cloud hosting. The reason that public clouds can adapt to the needs of a customer at different times. When such websites use the public cloud, they can reduce the cost of their hosting in low-traffic seasons and meet up to any unprecedented traffic increase with ease.\n- Small eCommerce Portals: Many small companies usually begin with shared hosting because it's an inexpensive plan. But when the company begins to get steady visitors and outgrow the shared hosting plan, there is a need for a strong alternative plan because extended downtime is not good for your brand's perception. You can therefore move to windows public cloud hosting to get all you need to become a reliable brand. It is budget-friendly and more affordable than an entire private server.\n- Non-Technical Team's: Windows public cloud hosting is easy to use and therefore the best option when there is no technical team. Businesses who don't have an engineer for technical can depend on public cloud hosting as it will always be available, growing with your company with minor changes. You can set it and let it run without stress, and you can also make some necessary adjustments when there is a need.\nUsing Windows Cloud Server comes with many benefits such as safety and security. It is easy to use, highly scalable, and budget-friendly. Companies and businesses can take advantage of these benefits to grow their business.\nLearn more :"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_synthesis"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:aebf7a62-2fa7-4e92-af11-85239824208b>","<urn:uuid:e7b198b0-b465-4bab-81ba-420eed3338d0>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do the legal requirements for overtime pay compare between Federal law and Minnesota state law for businesses, and how does this contrast with non-compete agreements enforcement across different states?","answer":"Federal law (Fair Labor Standards Act) requires overtime pay after 40 hours in a 7-day work week for businesses grossing over $500,000 or engaging in interstate commerce, while Minnesota state law requires overtime only after 48 hours. Regarding non-compete agreements, there's significant variation between states - they are completely unenforceable in states like California, Oklahoma, and North Dakota, while other states like Florida commonly enforce them. The enforceability generally depends on reasonable time duration and geographic scope limitations.","context":["Having employees is one of the most challenging aspects of running a business. There are many complicated laws governing when workers are considered employees, how they should be treated, how much they must be paid, and much more. Having an attorney may be very helpful in assuring your business is compliant with the myriad of laws and administrative rules. Attorney Patrick McGuiness has extensive experience in many facets of employment law and is a frequent author and lecturer on employment law topics.\nEmployees or Independent Contractors\nHow a business classifies workers is not the final determination about the workers’ status. If the Department of Labor audits a business, they apply the provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act to the employer-worker relationship which exists. Then they make a determination based on the total activity of the situation and how much the employer controls the workers activities.\nAmong the factors which the Court has considered significant are:\n1) The extent to which the services rendered are an integral part of the principal’s business. If they are, then the relationship looks more like that of an employer-employee.\n2) The permanency of the relationship. The more permanent and exclusive a relationship is, the more it looks like that of an employer-employee.\n3) The amount of the alleged contractor’s investment in facilities and equipment. If the business provides the worker with the facilities and tools with which to do their work, it looks like an employer-employee relationship.\n4) The nature and degree of control by the principal. When a business controls the time, place and methods of the workers work, it looks like an employer-employee relationship.\n5) The alleged contractor’s opportunities for profit and loss. When a worker is paid on an hourly basis, and cannot gain a profit by working more efficiently it looks like an employer-employee relationship.\n6) The amount of initiative, judgment, or foresight in open market competition with others required for the success of the claimed independent contractor. If a worker is allowed to hold themselves out as being “for hire” by others then they appear to be an independent contractor.\n7) The degree of independent business organization and operation. If a worker has a business entity such as a Limited Liability Company (LLC) or Corporation, and operate it independently of the company being audited, then they appear to be a legitimate independent contractor.\nNone of these factors alone proves a worker should be classified as an employee or independent contractor. The relationship in total is looked at and a determination is made. It is often helpful to have the assistance of an attorney when looking at the relationship a company has with workers.\nUnless there is a contract which states otherwise, employment in Minnesota is considered to be “At-Will”. This means that an employer can terminate or fire an employee at any time and for any reason as long as that reason is not illegal. Illegal reasons for termination in Minnesota include discrimination based on race, creed, color, sex, national origin, ancestry, religion, age, disability, sexual orientation or marital status.\nThere is also a common misconception that a “2 week notice” must be given before an employee can quit, or be laid off. Under Minnesota law, there is no need for any notice to be given in order to leave a position or be terminated.\nCompensation is important to every employee. How much a business must pay their employees depends on a number of factors, including figuring out what law applies to the business. It is also important to consider if any exemptions to overtime and minimum wage laws apply to any categories of workers at the business.\nMinnesota law and the Fair Labor Standards Act differ on overtime requirements. Some small businesses may only fall under Minnesota law, which requires overtime be paid at time and one half rate after 48 hours in each 7 day work week. Most Minnesota business fall under the Fair Labor Standards Act, this applies to businesses that gross more than $500,000 per year, OR “avail themselves of interstate commerce”. The Fair Labor Standards Act requires employees be paid time and one half rate overtime for all hours worked over 40 hours in a 7 day work week.\nA “7 day work week” is a period of 7 consecutive days which is designated by a business as their work week. There is no requirement that it be Sunday – Saturday, it can be whatever works best for the business. The work week can be changed from time to time, so long as the change is not designed to avoid paying overtime to employees.\nOnce again, Minnesota law and Federal Law differ on minimum wage requirements. Minnesota law requires employees of businesses grossing $625,000 or less be paid a minimum of $5.25 per hour. Further, an employer may pay $4.90 an hour as a “Training Wage” to new employees who are younger than age 20 during their first 90 consecutive days of employment. Permanent or current employees may not be displaced by new employees covered by the training wage.\nHowever, most business fall under the Fair Labor Standards Act, which requires workers be paid a minimum of $7.25 per hour. Generally speaking, if both Federal and State law apply to a given situation, it is safest to follow the law which is more protective of employees.\nEmployers are free to offer incentive pay such as “double time” pay for nights, however, neither State nor Federal law requires any additional pay for holidays, nights, or weekends. There is also no limit on the total number of hours an employee can work in a work week as long as the employee is compensated properly for overtime.\nThere is a common misconception that employees can be paid a salary in order to avoid the need to pay them overtime. This is not always the case. Under the law, the presumption is that employees must be paid overtime unless their position qualifies for an exemption to overtime requirements.\nTo qualify for the executive employee exemption, all of the following tests must be met:\nTo qualify for the administrative employee exemption, all of the following tests must be met:\nLearned Professional Exemption\nTo qualify for the learned professional employee exemption, all of the following tests must be met:\nCreative Professional Exemption\nTo qualify for the creative professional employee exemption, all of the following tests must be met:\nComputer Employee Exemption\nTo qualify for the computer employee exemption, the following tests must be met:\n1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional specifications;\n2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and related to user or system design specifications;\n3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer programs related to machine operating systems; or\n4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which requires the same level of skills.\nOutside Sales Exemption\nTo qualify for the outside sales employee exemption, all of the following tests must be met:\nHighly Compensated Employees\nHighly compensated employees performing office or non-manual work and paid total annual compensation of $100,000 or more (which must include at least $455 per week paid on a salary or fee basis) are exempt from the FLSA if they customarily and regularly perform at least one of the duties of an exempt executive, administrative or professional employee identified in the standard tests for exemption.\nBlue Collar Workers\nThe salary exemptions as outlined above, apply only to “white collar” employees who meet the salary and duties tests. The exemptions do not apply to manual laborers or other “blue collar” workers who perform work involving repetitive operations with their hands, physical skill and energy. Non-management employees in production, maintenance, landscaping, construction and similar occupations such as carpenters, electricians, mechanics, plumbers, iron workers, craftsmen, operating engineers, longshoremen, construction workers and laborers are entitled to minimum wage and overtime pay .\nFluctuating Work Week\nAnother method of compensating employees is called the Fluctuating Work Week method. The Fluctuating Work Week involves paying a worker the same base rate each week they work (similar to a salary), but there is still an overtime payment that must be made when the worker works more than 40 hours in a work week. In order to properly compensate an employee using the Fluctuating Work Week method, four criteria must be met:\nThese criteria may seem straightforward, but it is best to speak with an attorney when assessing whether paying employees using the Fluctuating Work Week is compliant for a business’s employees.\nEmployee handbooks are a great way of explaining company policies and procedures. They can provide employees with an overview of the company, the working practices & environment. A good handbook can also provide a business with a layer of legal protection by setting clear standards and expectations which employees must comply with. In short, a good handbook is essential to running a good business.\nOn the other hand, a poorly done employee handbook can cause a lot of harm. Business managers and owners tend to want very rigid policies in place that address almost every fathomable situation. Having policies in place that are too specific can make it hard for employers to be flexible in dealing with real situations. Policies that are too broad can have the opposite effect and make it hard for businesses to hold employees accountable. These seem like two sides to the same coin, and in a way they are.\nWhen drafting your handbook, it is important to include information on the following topics:\nA Contract is an agreement between two or more parties who agree to exchange something. Contracts are the way we document what is agreed upon between the parties. Every contract is different and may require specific assistance during drafting. The goal when drafting a good contract is to use plain language and meaningfully convey the shared understanding the parties have about their agreement.\nThere are many types of contracts. It could be a contract for the purchase of goods, for the purchase of services, or for purchasing real estate. Whatever type of contract is involved, it is important to make sure everything that has been agreed upon is addressed in the contract documents. This may result in a document that is lengthy and potentially confusing, underscoring the need to use plain language.\nFailing to draft a contract well and accurately express the agreement of the parties can result in a dispute. Contract disputes usually arise because one party feels that the other party failed to perform as outlined by their agreement.","What is a non competition clause in an employment contract?\nNon-Competition Clause. What is a non-competition clause? A non-competition (or non-compete) clause is a passage in an employment contract which purports to prohibit employees from working for another employer or starting their own business which competes with their employer during and after employment.\nCan a non-compete clause extend the reasonable notice period?\nAbacus Management, 2014 BCSC 938 (CanLII), the court considered the presence of a non-competition clause in extending the reasonable notice period. Accordingly, employers should not just blindly by boiler-plate insert into their employment contracts a non-compete clause for each and every employee.\nWhat happens if you violate a non compete clause?\nLike all legal agreements, a non-compete clause is only as meaningful as a court’s willingness to enforce it. If you violate your non-compete clause, your employer can take the matter to court (although not all do so).\nIs the non-compete clause unenforceable in California?\nNoncompete clauses are unenforceable in some states such as Oklahoma and North Dakota, whereas in California, for example, employers who require a non-compete clause can even be sued. Before signing, research the laws in your state.\nWhat does no compete mean?\nNon Compete Meaning: Everything You Need to Know. The non-compete meaning is a contractual agreement that exists between employer and employee that states that employee agrees not to use any information gained.3 min read.\nWhat is Employment Non compete?\nEmployment Non Compete Agreement Law and Legal Definition. A non-compete agreement is a promise by an employee not to compete with his or her employer for a specified time in a particular place. The agreement may cover such actions, among others, as opening a competing business or using customer information for business leads.\nWhat is a non competition clause?\nIn contract law, a non-compete clause (often NCC), or covenant not to compete (CNC), is a clause under which one party (usually an employee) agrees not to enter into or start a similar profession or trade in competition against another party (usually the employer). Some courts refer to these as “restrictive covenants.”.\nWhat is a non compete agreement?\nNon-Compete Agreement. What is a Non-Compete Agreement? A non-compete agreement is a contract between two parties, usually two individuals or one company and one individual, in which one of the individuals promises not to compete with the other individual or company once their relationship with the company has ended.\nWhat happens when you sign a non-compete agreement?\nNon-compete agreements can prevent workers from getting a job in their field if they leave a position after signing such an agreement. Non-compete agreements are signed when the relationship between employer and employee begins. They give the employer control over specific actions of the former employee—even after that relationship ends.\nAre there non-compete agreements in the state of Florida?\nThe enforceability of non-compete agreements in the state of Florida is quite common. Some law firms build their law practice around these agreements and represent employees, employers and potential new employers of an employee currently bound by a non-compete agreement.\nHow long can a non compete clause be enforced?\nGenerally, it should not be longer than one year. Most courts refuse to enforce any non-compete clause longer than a year. It is submitted that to be on the safe side, a non-compete clause should be six months. That is not to say that certain very long non-compete clauses will not be enforced.\nWhat does non compete clause mean?\nAre non compete agreements enforceable?\nNon-competition agreements are only enforceable to the extent they are reasonable in both geographic scope and time duration."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:ce86749a-fb50-4d09-87e6-41b0dcac8f58>","<urn:uuid:eb8fb404-ed77-41ed-994f-0f8f7f44b0f6>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do cryptocurrency exchanges and financial markets compare in terms of price determination?","answer":"Both cryptocurrency exchanges and financial markets determine prices through supply and demand dynamics. In financial markets, security prices depend on demand - higher demand leads to higher prices, while lower demand results in lower prices. Similarly, in cryptocurrency exchanges, buyers and sellers trade based on current market prices, though cryptocurrencies are inherently more unstable in value compared to traditional assets. Both types of markets provide liquidity and facilitate price discovery, but cryptocurrency values can change dramatically over short periods due to disruptive events, making them more volatile than traditional financial market assets.","context":["What does Cryptocurrency Exchange mean?\nA cryptocurrency exchange is any system that operates on the basis of trading cryptocurrencies with other assets. Like a traditional financial exchange, the cryptocurrency exchange’s core operation is to allow for the buying and selling of these digital assets, as well as others.\nA cryptocurrency exchange is also known as a digital currency exchange (DCE).\nThink about the ways that these new types of exchanges are different from traditional financial exchanges. Cryptocurrencies are inherently unstable in terms of value and sourcing. Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin have been associated with major disruptive events where bitcoin value changed dramatically over a short period of time, or where major exchanges went under due to theft, fraud or other problems.\nCryptocurrency exchanges have to build in protections from some of these events. However, these exchanges do serve as a key vehicle for liquid use of cryptocurrency assets.\nRead more on What is cryptocurrency and why do we need it?\nIn other ways, cryptocurrency exchanges work just like traditional exchanges. On many of these platforms, cryptocurrency buyers and sellers can make limit orders or market orders, and the brokering process works like it would for any other kind of asset. The cryptocurrency exchange helps with the transaction and collects the fees. The difference is the underlying asset – Bitcoin or Ethereum or some other cryptocurrency that does not have the same valuation properties as a national currency.\nThere are several types of cryptocurrency exchanges:\n“Traditional” Cryptocurrency Exchanges\nThese are the exchanges that are like the traditional stock exchanges where buyers and sellers trade based on the current market price of cryptocurrencies (with the exchange playing the middle-man). These type of trading platforms generally charge a fee for each transaction.\nSome of these types of exchanges deal only in cryptocurrency, others allow users to trade fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.\nCoinbase’s GDAX (AKA Coinbase Pro) is an example of this type of exchange, as is Kraken. There are those run by third parties (they have a middle man who supports and correct some problems) and Decentralized Exchanges or DEXs that mimic traditional exchanges like IDEX (trading is based on smart contracts and not facilitated via a centralized third party’s software for the most part).\nGenerally, centralized exchanges will require a lot of info, but often allow fiat trading, and DEX exchanges won’t allow fiat trading, but require less information.\nThese are website-based exchanges that are like the currency exchange at an airport. They allow customers to buy and sell cryptocurrencies at a price set by the broker (generally at the market price plus a small premium).\nHere the exchange is between the buyer or seller and the broker, not between a buyer and seller. Coinbase is an example of this type of exchange. Shapeshift provides a similar service as well (it lets you swap on a type of token for another).\nThis is the simplest solution for new users. You’ll generally pay slightly higher prices than you do on the exchanges due to the ease of use and the work the broker puts in.\nDirect Trading Platforms\nThese platforms offer direct peer-to-peer trading between buyers and sellers. Direct trading platforms of this type don’t use a fixed market price.\nSellers set their own exchange rate and buyers either find sellers via the platform and preform an Over the Counter (OTC) Exchange, or they denote the rates they are willing to buy for and the platform matches buyers and sellers.\nMany Decentralized Exchanges are of this type (although some are closer to being like traditional exchanges, which is why they are listed in the first category).\nThis type of exchange can be the only solution in some regions. In regions where trading is limited to direct exchange, but where trading isn’t smart contract based (like it is with DEX exchanges), make sure to do some extra research and ensure you are using a trusted platform and dealing with highly rated users.\nAlso, make sure to check market prices on Coinmarketcap, as you aren’t buying/selling at a fixed market price!\nFor an example of a decentralized peer-to-peer direct trading platform, see AirSwap.io (here the DEX facilitates direct swaps between users via smart contracts, and thus may require no information). For an example of a centralized peer-to-peer exchange that facilitates the exchange of fiat and crypto, see LocalBitcoins.com.\nFunds are pools of professionally managed cryptocurrency assets which allows public buy and hold cryptocurrency via the fund. One such fund is GBTC.\nUsing a fund you can invest in cryptocurrency without having to purchase or store it directly. As a trade-off, you can’t use crypto in a fund as money, these are strictly for investment.\nIn almost every case a person new to crypto trading will want to use an exchange or broker. Newcomers will generally only want to use a direct trading platform when their options are limited (either limited by regulation or limited by coin choice). Meanwhile, while funds might be ideal to some, they tend to have a range of restrictions. GBTC and ETCG are the only funds open to the public for example.","What is Financial Market?\nFinancial Market is a place where Buying and Selling of shares, bonds, securities etc. take place. A financial market may be a physical location or a virtual one(i.e, Internet).\nPrices of securities depend on the demand of the securities, if the demand of the security is high then the price will high if the demand will low then price will also low of the security.\nThe stock market is a financial market that connects buys and sellers.

{"question":"I'm curious about the different types of medical imaging scans! Can you compare how eye dissection imaging vs spleen scans work? Like what are they looking at and how do they help doctors understand what's going on? 🔬","answer":"Eye dissection imaging and spleen scans work quite differently. In eye dissection imaging, the physical structure is directly observed after careful removal, allowing examination of specific components like the rectus muscles, retina, and lens. The process involves making precise cuts to access and view the eye's three tunics (fibrous, vascular, and retinal layers). In contrast, spleen scans use nuclear medicine techniques where erythrocytes are labeled with radioactive materials like chromium-51 or technetium-99m. These labeled cells are infused and sequestered by the spleen, allowing visualization of spleen size and detection of space-occupying lesions. Spleen scans show a close correlation between scan length measurements and actual spleen weight post-splenectomy, making them particularly useful for evaluating spleen function and size.","context":["Dissection of the Eye and its Orbit in the Cat\nFollow protocol Notebook Illustrations\nThe brain should have previously been removed from your cat (see Removal and Study of the Cat Brain).

Another possible method to antiviral proteins secreted by t cells safe 1 mg medex demonstrate splenomegaly is to acute hiv infection symptoms mayo buy medex 5 mg with visa find an anteroposterior measurement up to two-thirds of the distance between the anterior and posterior abdominal walls. When the spleen is enlarged, the concavity of its visceral surface is often lost as the spleen assumes a more globular shape. Neoplasm, abscess, or cystic lesions can be appreciated; associated abdominal lymph node enlargement can suggest a lymphoma. Cirrhotic patients show characteristic alterations in the size and shape of the liver and in the prominence of the venous structures in the splenic hilum. An increase in the attenuation value of the spleen (as well as the liver) can be found in patients with hemochromatosis. Clinical Presentation the most common history is mild abdominal pain that is vague in nature. Associated symptoms and signs include febrile illness (infectious process); pallor, dyspnea, bruising, and/or petechiae (hemolytic process); symptoms of liver disease (congestive process); and weight loss and constitutional symptoms (neoplastic process). Examination should include palpation with the patient in the supine and right lateral decubitus positions. Additional signs that identify possible etiologies of splenomegaly include signs of cirrhosis (asterixis, jaundice, telangiectasias, gynecomastia, caput medusae, ascites), heart murmur (endocarditis, congestive failure), jaundice and scleral icterus (spherocytosis, cirrhosis), and petechiae (any cause of thrombocytopenia). A patient with an enlarged spleen is more likely to have splenic rupture from blunt abdominal or low thoracic trauma, leading to typical symptoms. In particular, in elderly persons the combination of capsular thinning with increased spleen weight and size makes splenic injury more common. These factors account for the increased likelihood of splenectomy for trauma in this subgroup. Gamna-Gandy bodies are spots of organized hemorrhage caused by portal hypertension and can be detected as multiple low-signal intensity nodules both on T1-weighted and T2-weighted images. Patients with splenic enlargement secondary to hematologic disorders generally show no consistent Splenomegaly. Patients affected by thalassemia have splenomegaly from extramedullary hematopoiesis and systemic iron overload from blood transfusions, with massive iron deposition in the spleen, which shortens T2. S Nuclear Medicine A spleen scan is a good noninvasive technique for evaluating spleen size; a close correlation exists between spleen length on scan images and spleen weight after splenectomy. Erythrocytes should be labeled with chromium-51, mercury-197, rubidium-81, or 99m-technetium, and the cells altered by treatment with heat, antibody, chemicals, or metal ions so that the spleen sequesters them after infusion. A spleen scan is useful for detecting space-occupying lesions in the splenic substance and for evaluating loss of spleen function. Figure 2 Gamna-Gandy bodies in a patient with splenomegaly who previously underwent liver transplantation. Multiple low-signal intensity nodules are shown both on axial fat-saturated T1-weighted (a) and T2-weighted (b) magnetic resonance sequences. Moreover, splenomegaly produces hypersplenism, which is characterized by anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, or combinations thereof. Increased splenic platelet pooling is the primary cause of the thrombocytopenia of hypersplenism. In patients with hypersplenism, as much as 90% of the total platelet mass can be found in the spleen. The etiology of the anemia observed in splenomegaly is the result of sequestration and hemodilution. A complete laboratory study must be done in patients without evident cause of splenomegaly. Imaging studies are useful to assess the splenic enlargement and identify the cause of the splenomegaly. Splenosis may cause recurrence of hematologic disorders after therapeutic splenectomy. Split-liver Transplantation Liver transplantation technique consists in cadaveric liver division so that the lateral segment of the left lobe may be transplanted into a pediatric patient and the remainder of the liver may be transplanted into an adult. Transplantation, Hepatic Splenosis Splenosis results from the autotransplantation of splenic tissue occurring after splenic trauma or after splenectomy. The incidence of splenosis after traumatic injury of the spleen varies from 27% to 67%. Splenic implants are usually numerous and are spread throughout the peritoneal cavity.\nThe tight junctions between the Sertoli cells appear to hiv infection blood count cost of medex form hiv infection in india cheap medex 5 mg line, at least in part hiv infection rash buy generic medex from india, a blood-testis barrier hiv infection rate dubai buy medex australia. Each seminiferous tubule is organized into a nonbranched closed loop, both ends of which open into the first portion of the excurrent duct system, the rete testis. A seminiferous tubule consists of a complex stratified germinal (seminiferous) epithelium surrounded by a layer of peritubular tissue. The peritubular tissue is separated from the germinal epithelium by a basal lamina and consists of collagenous fibers and flattened cells that, depending on the species, may contain numerous actin filaments. The production of testicular fluid by the germinal epithelium and its flow through the seminiferous tubules moves the spermatozoa into the excretory duct system. The germinal epithelium of the adult is unique among epithelia in that it consists of a fixed, stable population of supporting (Sertoli) cells and a proliferating population of differentiating spermatogenic cells. Developing germ cells slowly migrate upward along the lateral surfaces of the supporting cells to be released at the free surface into the lumen of the seminiferous tubule. Germ cells in the basal compartment are contained within an environment that has access to substances in the blood plasma, while the germ cells in the adluminal compartment reside in a specialized milieu that is maintained and controlled by the Sertoli cells. A number of plasma proteins are present in the basal compartment that are not found in the luminal contents of the seminiferous tubule that is, however, rich in other amino acids and ions. Sertoli cells are thought to provide all the nutrients for the avascular germinal epithelium. The androgenbinding protein binds testosterone, thus providing the adluminal compartment with the level of hormone needed for the normal differentiation and development of germ cells. The blood-testis barrier helps to confine the high concentration of testosterone to the adluminal compartment and thus allows a different environment to be established in the basal compartment. Many of the developing germ cells in the adluminal compartment are haploid and might be regarded as foreign material by the body if released into surrounding tissues. Although tight junctions contribute to the blood testis barrier, other factors may be involved. Sertoli cells phagocytize degenerating germ cells and take up the residual cytoplasm that normally is shed during release of mature germ cells into the lumen of the seminiferous tubule. In addition to providing mechanical and nutritional support for developing sperm, Sertoli cells also control the movement of germ cells from the basal lamina through the epithelium to the lumen and are important in the release of germ cells into the lumen. The microtubules and actin filaments in the cytoplasmic processes of the Sertoli cells provide these processes with the mobility they need to carry out their functions. The numerous gap junctions that occur between adjacent Sertoli cells facilitate communication between cells along specific segments of a seminiferous tubule during migration and release of germ cells. These are not separate cell types but represent stages in a continuous process of differentiation called spermatogenesis. The term includes the entire sequence of events in the transformation of diploid spermatogonia at the base of the germinal epithelium into haploid spermatozoa that are released into the lumen of the seminiferous tubule. Spermatogonia lie in the basal compartment of the germinal epithelium, immediately adjacent to the basal lamina. Type A spermatogonia replicate by mitosis and provide a reservoir of stem cells for the formation of future germ cells. Type A spermatogonia have spherical or elliptical nuclei with a fine chromatin distribution and one or two nucleoli near the nuclear envelope. The lighter-stained, spherical nuclei of type B spermatogonia contain variably sized clumps of chromatin, most of which are arranged along the nuclear envelope. Primary spermatocytes at first resemble type B spermatogonia, but as they migrate from the basal lamina of the germinal epithelium, they become larger and more spherical, and the nucleus enters the initial stages of division. Primary spermatocytes usually are found in the central zone of the germinal epithelium. How these large cells pass from the basal to the adluminal compartment is unknown. The primary spermatocyte undergoes the first meiotic division to produce secondary spermatocytes. Secondary spermatocytes lie nearer the lumen than the primary forms and are about half their size. Because they divide so quickly after being formed, secondary spermatocytes are seen only rarely in the germinal epithelium. Numerous spermatids in different stages of maturation border the lumen of the seminiferous tubule. Early spermatids appear as small spherical cells with round darkly stained nuclei.\nAs a consequence anti virus warning mac order medex 1 mg mastercard, tumor response is generally assessed after several weeks or months following the start of therapy hiv infection no symptoms medex 1 mg fast delivery. Patients who do not respond to hiv infection rates china discount medex 5mg visa chemotherapy may be treated over a long time period because of the lack of a sensitive parameter for early determination of therapy response hiv transmission statistics worldwide discount 1 mg medex with mastercard. This situation reflects a common problem in the therapy management of oncological patients and in particular in patients with solid tumors, a high percentage of whom do not respond to chemotherapy. The formation of scar tissue or edema following radiation therapy may be another obstacle in evaluating therapy response in oncological patients using radiological methods. This is particularly important in oncological patients who receive combined chemotherapeutic protocols, which may cause severe side effects without producing the expected therapeutic result. Characteristics Applications the main application of treatment response is for monitoring cancer therapy. Patients who respond to therapy demonstrate a decrease in glucose metabolism, whereas nonresponders show an increase even after one chemotherapeutic cycle. A detailed analysis of the kinetic data can be performed to acquire the most relevant information about the tracer pharmacokinetics. The input can be obtained by blood sampling (venous or arterial), or it can be derived from an early image of an arterial vessel, such as the aorta, within the field of view. In patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma who received a R Response to Treatment. By adding kinetic model parameters of the baseline study and of a study performed after completion of four chemotherapeutic cycles, it was possible to classify the majority (78%) of patients according to a 1-year survival rate. Therefore, a detailed analysis of tracer kinetics provides more accurate results for predicting individual survival rates. The situation may be different for other tumor types and other chemotherapeutic protocols used for treatment. However, it is unknown whether these data can be transferred to other tumors and treatment protocols. This is a difficult task because inhibitors of angiogenesis are not primarily cytotoxic, and therefore it takes a longer time to determine the clinical effect. Standardization of the Criteria Used for Metabolic Treatment Response At present, there are no generally accepted criteria for defining response. A threshold of at least 20% has been proposed by some authors as a response criterion. Although even a 20% change does not necessarily correlate with the survival rate, it is associated with at least a palliative effect. Thresholds depend on the tumor type and the expected curative or palliative treatment effect. In patients with malignant lymphomas, who primarily respond to chemotherapy, a decrease of 45% has been reported within 24 h after onset of therapy. The threshold for metabolic response in high-grade lymphomas is therefore higher, because the intention is to cure the tumor. Thus, using metabolic measurements seems to be feasible for individualizing and optimizing chemotherapy. Other Applications Perfusion studies can be used in patients with myocardial infarction to assess the effect of reperfusion. Another approach consists of apoptosis measurements with 9mTcAnnexin V, a procedure that is currently under evaluation. Annexin is a phospholipid-binding protein with high affinity for phosphatidyl-serine, which is externalized by cells undergoing programmed cell death. In patients with locally advanced breast carcinoma who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, an increase in tumor perfusion was noted 3. Targeted Microbubbles the most common soft tissue sarcoma of the pediatric age group. Approximately 8% of solid tumor in childhood, slightly more than half of pediatric soft tissue sarcomas. Pathology/Histopathology It is divided into botryoid, spindle cell, embryonal, and alveolar types with an increasingly poorer prognosis in that order. Botryoid usually occurs in hollow organs: the bladder, nasal sinuses, vagina, and common bile duct. The muscular tumor is of mostly alveolar histology in contrast with the embryonal type that is linked with the pelvic region and the head and neck. Rhabdomyosarcoma is a very aggressive tumor and infiltrates along fascial planes, lymphatic and hematogenous routes. Retrograde/Anterograde Urography (Pyelography) Conventional radiologic studies with retrograde contrast administration via cystoscopically inserted ureteral catheters or anterograde through percutaneous nephrostomies, both performed under fluoroscopic control, provide the most precise delineation of the collecting system.\nRectovesical most common hiv infection symptoms buy discount medex, rectourethral antiviral for shingles generic medex 1mg with amex, and rectovaginal fistulas are hiv infection rate zimbabwe purchase genuine medex on-line, respectively hiv early symptoms yeast infection buy medex 5 mg cheap, abnormal communications between the rectum and urinary bladder (rectovesical), rectum and urethra (rectourethral), and rectum and vagina (rectovaginal) due to abnormal formation of the urorectal septum. These fistulas are associated clinically with the presence of meconium in the urine or vagina. A rectourethral fistula that generally occurs in males is associated with the prostatic urethra and is therefore sometimes called a rectoprostatic fistula. Figure 7-7C Rectovesical fistula, rectourethral fistula, and rectovaginal fistula. The lower anal canal develops from the proctodeum, which is an invagination of surface ectoderm caused by a proliferation of mesoderm surrounding the anal membrane. The junction between the upper and lower anal canals is indicated by the pectinate line, which also marks the site of the former anal membrane. In the adult, the pectinate line is located at the lower border of the anal columns. Imperforate anus occurs when the anal membrane fails to perforate; a layer of tissue separates the anal canal from the exterior. Anal agenesis occurs when the anal canal ends as a blind sac below the puborectalis muscle due to abnormal formation of the urorectal septum. It is usually associated with rectovesical, rectourethral, or rectovaginal fistula. Anorectal agenesis occurs when the rectum ends as a blind sac above the puborectalis muscle due to abnormal formation of the urorectal septum. It is the most common type of anorectal malformation and is usually associated with a rectovesical, rectourethral, or rectovaginal fistula. Rectal atresia occurs when both the rectum and anal canal are present but remain unconnected due to either abnormal recanalization or a compromised blood supply causing focal atresia. Another telltale sign is that patients have a dysphagia involving both solids and liquids. Even though reflux esophagitis would present with heartburn, it is only limited to dysphagia of solids, not solids and liquid. However, due to the finding of the remnants, those two conditions can be excluded. There was no detection of a foreign body being found in the gastrointestinal tract on X-ray. Also, an indirect hernia was ruled out because of the nondetection of a patent process vaginalis, which is needed to make a diagnosis of an indirect hernia. The intermediate mesoderm forms a longitudinal elevation along the dorsal body wall called the urogenital ridge. A portion of the urogenital ridge forms the nephrogenic cord, which gives rise to the urinary system. The nephrogenic cord develops into three sets of nephric structures: the pronephros, the mesonephros, and the metanephros. Develops by the differentiation of mesoderm within the nephrogenic cord to form pronephric tubules and the pronephric duct. The pronephros is the cranial-most nephric structure and is a transitory structure that regresses completely by week 5. Develops by the differentiation of mesoderm within the nephrogenic cord to form mesonephric tubules and the mesonephric duct (Wolffian duct). The mesonephros is the middle nephric structure and is a partially transitory structure. Most of the mesonephric tubules regress, but the mesonephric duct persists and opens into the urogenital sinus. Develops from an outgrowth of the mesonephric duct (called the ureteric bud) and from a condensation of mesoderm within the nephrogenic cord called the metanephric mesoderm. The metanephros begins to form at week 5 and is functional in the fetus at about week 10. The fetal kidney is divided into lobes, in contrast to the definitive adult kidney, which has a smooth contour.\nGeneric medex 1mg fast delivery.

{"question":"Amigo doctor, can you explain que sucede with physician compensation después de private equity acquisition of medical practice?","answer":"When a private equity firm acquires a medical practice, physicians typically experience a change in compensation structure. While they may receive a large upfront payment, physicians become employees and may receive less long-term earnings. However, productive physicians can receive bonuses and other added compensation to help offset potential earnings loss. The new structure may also provide a more consistent revenue stream that's protected from market changes and payer policy modifications.","context":["When private equity calls, what do you need to know?\nVenture capital (VC) and private equity (PE) firms represent ready cash for physicians open to selling a practice or seeking outside investors. Are these financial players the right choice for when money and medicine mix?\nAt a high level, private equity firms are more likely to buy and build value in hopes of profiting from a relatively quick sale, and venture capital firms are more likely to invest for a longer time. Physicians faced with this decision now have new resources from the AMA to find what will work best for their practice.\nThe AMA’s guide, “Venture Capital and Private Equity Investments: How to Evaluate Contractual Agreements,” highlights key insights and considerations into the functioning of a VC or PE firm. Among the points raised in the resource, three stand out in terms of assessing a deal—change in physician income, day-to-day practice management, and retaining professional independence.\n1. Expect a change in compensation\nRemember that potential profit drives VC and PE firm purchase or investment decisions. However large an offer might be—and it may be very tempting—it is based on capturing a profit a medical practice might have made by going it alone.\nThe guide cautions that “VC/PE investment firms tend to offer high prices to purchase a practice, but with a catch.” In the case of a practice sale, physician owners who stay on become employees. The catch according to the guide if that “in many cases, VC/PE firms can alter the physician payment structure, meaning physicians may receive less long-term and sustained earnings.”\nCertain physicians may still find a substantial lump sum payment upfront desirable. This may provide “a potentially more consistent revenue stream insulated from changes in the market, modified payer policies, and other sources of volatility,” observes the guide, which also points out that productive physicians “may receive bonuses (among other added compensation) that may help soften the potential earnings loss.”\n2. Be ready to surrender some control\nTo protect their investment, VC and PE firms will want to make sure the practice is run in a business-like manner. As with compensation, there can be positive and negative elements attached to that too.\nSometimes the firm will require the physician practice to adopt back-end industry standards to streamline office management and administration. Some practices will welcome that and see it as “one of the more valuable assets VC/ PE-backed entities bring to the table (particularly for small, independent practices),” according to the guide\n“However, physicians not accustomed to this degree of control over their practices should be cognizant of the oversight the entity may have over day-to-day operations and understand the allocation of such responsibilities.”\n3. Retain professional independence\nThe guide is clear about protecting the boundary separating the professional side of the practice from the business side.\n“Physicians have the ultimate authority and responsibility to engage in the professional practice of medicine, and contracts should expressly acknowledge that the other parties to the transaction (e.g. the VC/PE firm) will not interfere with the physicians’ ongoing duty to exercise their own best medical judgment,” notes the guide.\nTo protect the patient and reserve the physician right to practice medicine as he or she deems fit, physicians may consider adding additional language regarding his or her exercise of that authority.\nA two-page snapshot from the AMA provides a basic orientation for physicians unfamiliar with venture capital and private equity investment. The AMA has also created a checklist that takes a point-by-point look at key topics, such as terms of sale for the practice, standardization techniques and economies of scale."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"advanced_reasoning"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:0ab9bfc5-be6e-46b6-bdd3-5addcb166323>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do scientists analyze the spectral properties of H3+ molecules from interstellar space, and what are the required safety protocols for handling hazardous chemical waste in related laboratory research?","answer":"Scientists analyze H3+ by studying its spectral lines through telescopes, which reveal specific wavelengths corresponding to the molecule's vibrational motions. The analysis helps determine the chemical composition of stars and understand H3+'s cooling abilities. When telescope precision increases, more spectral lines become visible, requiring detailed knowledge of H3+'s vibrational levels for proper identification. Regarding chemical waste handling safety, hazardous materials must be disposed of separately in properly labeled containers. Specific protocols include packing materials in containers with hazardous waste labels and chemical names, following local disposal regulations, and ensuring proper incineration and chemical treatment by licensed professionals. Additionally, mercury-containing waste requires special handling and must be disposed of in separate containers with appropriate hazard labeling.","context":["The molecule known as H3+ is believed to have had a vital role in cooling down the first stars of the universe, and may still play an important part in the formation of current stars. The unassuming molecule known as a triatomic hydrogen ion, or H3+, may hold secrets of the formation of the first stars after the Big Bang.\n\"Most of the universe consists of hydrogen in various forms,\" said Ludwik Adamowicz, a professor in the University of Arizona''s department of chemistry and biochemistry, but the H3+ ion is the most prevalent molecular ion in interstellar space. It's also one of the most important molecules in existence.\"\nBelieved to be critical to the formation of stars in the early days of the universe, H3+ also is the precursor to many types of chemical reactions, said Adamowicz, including those leading to compounds such as water or carbon, which are essential for life.\nEarly stars would have become hotter and hotter until they exploded before they ever formed, according to Michele Pavanello, who led the groundbreaking research, unless there was a way to release some of that pent-up energy.\n\"There wouldn't be any star formation if there weren't molecules that slowly cool down the forming star by emitting light,\" said Pavanello. Not many molecules can do that, he added, partly because very few molecules existed in the early days of the universe. \"Astronomers think that the only molecule that could cool down a forming star in that particular time is H3+.\"\nAnother molecule, molecular hydrogen, would have been present, but it would have had a much harder time cooling a forming star than H3+. \"Hydrogen does not like to emit light, while H3+ can bend and vibrate, and in doing so it is able to emit light.\" said Pavanello.\nH3+ is an electrically charged molecule, called an ion. It consists of three hydrogen atoms with only two, as opposed to a healthy three, electrons to share between them. Lacking a negatively charged electron, the molecule takes on a plus-one positive charge.\nH3+ has a triangular shape, explained Adamowicz. \"As it is excited it starts to vibrate in various ways.\"\n\"One has to involve a large amount of computations at the quantum mechanical level to predict those vibrations,\" said Adamowicz. \"The role of theory is essentially to simulate those vibrations in the computer and then describe how the molecule is swinging or dancing.\"\nUnderstanding the various vibrations of H3+ could help astronomers deduce to what extent it played a role in the formation of the early stars.\n\"In the 1990s, H3+ was observed surrounding stars,\" said Adamowicz. \"The stars emit radiation, which not only contributes to the production of H3+ but also excites the molecule to higher energy states. The molecule can also become excited through leftover energy from chemical reactions it was involved in or through collisions with other molecules. In the process of de-excitation the molecule emits photons that are detected by our radio telescopes.\"\n\"That can only happen with H3+ because molecular hydrogen is too symmetric,\" said Pavanello. \"And so H3+ has a very important cooling function in the formation of the first stars after the Big Bang.\"\n\"The only way we can predict how the stars form is if we know very well what the cooling abilities of H3+ are, and we cannot know its cooling ability until we know its vibrational spectrum. We need to know what these energy levels are,\" said Pavanello.\n\"With this paper we have pinpointed the energy levels up to a certain energy threshold that is already good enough to generate accurate predictions of the cooling ability of H3+,\" said Pavanello.\nThe group didn't set out to unlock the secrets of H3+, said Pavanello, who graduated from the UA in 2010 with a prestigious Marie Curie post-doctoral fellowship that took him to Leiden University in the Netherlands. He is now an assistant professor of theoretical chemistry at Rutgers University.\n\"It all happened almost by chance,\" he said. \"A friend of the mass-spectrometry facility in the UA's chemistry department happens to be a very good quantum chemist from Hungary. He once visited the department and talked to Ludwik about the possibility to do some H3+ calculations. At the time, I had just started. The code I was writing was almost done, and we thought H3+ could be a good system on which to test this code.\"\nThe researchers input a computer code into super computers at the UA's High Performance Computing Center that described the ways in which H3+ vibrates according to quantum mechanical principles. \"We couldn't have done this without their support,\" said Pavanello.\nDepending on the level of approximations made in the computer code, said Pavanello, the researchers can develop software that can describe the motion of small molecules very well, or large molecules very approximately.\n\"We decided to implement something that had essentially no approximations, but of course with the price that we can only apply it to very small molecules,\" said Pavanello. \"Our method simply did not exist before in a mainstream form.\"\nThe UA team's results were corroborated by teams from Hungary, France, London and Russia, and also by experiments done at the Max-Planck Institute in Heidelberg, Germany that created H3+ in a laboratory and verified that its spectral lines matched the predictions.\nThe UA team's contribution allowed the researchers for the first time to assign spectral lines of H3+ to particular types of the vibrational motions as the ion releases photons with near-visible wavelengths. These wavelengths contribute to the color of the light H3+ radiates toward us from interstellar space.\n\"If you point a telescope to the sky, you see spectral lines that are very specific to a certain molecule or atom,\" said Pavanello. Different molecules emit photons at different wavelengths, which result in different spectral lines that allow astronomers to determine the chemical composition of stars. But the more these telescopes get accurate and precise, the more spectral lines we see.\"\n\"We are at a point in which we see many, many more spectral lines than we can possibly identify, and we don't know what these lines mean,\" said Pavanello.\nKnowing the vibrational levels, and therefore the spectral lines of H3+, will allow astronomers and astro-chemists to sift through the inundation of spectral lines and further identify the elemental composition of objects in space.\nIt also allows scientists to predict the cooling abilities of H3+, and generate a possible scenario for how the first generation stars formed after the Big Bang, said Pavanello. \"We now have an important piece of the puzzle needed to embark on reliable modeling of the formation of the first stars.\"\nThese groundbreaking results have been published in a recent edition of Physical Review Letters.\nThe image at the top of the page was taken during Hubble's 100,000th orbit around the Earth when it peered into a small portion of the nebula near the star cluster NGC 2074 (upper, left). The region is a firestorm of raw stellar creation, perhaps triggered by a nearby supernova explosion. It lies about 170 000 light-years away near the Tarantula nebula, one of the most active star-forming regions in our Local Group of galaxies.\nThe three-dimensional-looking image reveals dramatic ridges and valleys of dust, serpent-head \"pillars of creation\", and gaseous filaments glowing fiercely under torrential ultraviolet radiation. The region is on the edge of a dark molecular cloud that is an incubator for the birth of new stars.\nThe Daily Galaxy via uanews.org","Safety of the researcher, environment, manufacturer and the consumer is of utmost importance in each of the processes from strain development experiments to manufacturing and packaging of the final product. To ensure the same, consideration of all the precautions and safety measures must be taken to make the work environment, manufacturing environment and consumer product safe and to prevent any hazardous situations. Material safety data sheets for all reagents should be kept handy (List of reagents used have been given in the handbook).\nFigure 1: Safe chassis bacteria\nOur entire project requires a Biosafety Level 1 (BSL-1) laboratory. This is because our project has proposed the use of Biosafety level 1 bacteria (Escherichia coli DH5alpha and Escherichia coli Nissle 1917) as our probiotic chassis iGEM - safety risk groups and therefore we consider our project to be harmless to researchers in this aspect. None of the designed experiments are expected to increase the pathogenicity of the bacteria.\nThe bacteria Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 is an extremely well studied probiotic strain with no known negative effects on health Pradhan, S., & Weiss, A. A., 2020. It does not have the ability to become an aerosol and has no known pathogenic effects on animals and plants as well. It is responsible for producing fitness factors called ‘colicins' that are toxic to other Escherichia coli strains. In our case, it would be an advantage as we want our bacteria to compete while it stays in the gut. Furthermore, its ability to form biofilms increases its long-term persistence in the gut.\nWe would not reveal important information like activation mechanisms, etc to ensure that dual use does not occur (unless it has all the required clearances).\nBiosafety & Biosecurity\nFigure 2: Dual Use\nTeam Bielefeld-CeBiTec 2015 proposed a detailed analysis of biosecurity, particularly the dual use issue, with respect to the iGEM competition in which they have mentioned several aspects and questions to be considered Bielefeld-CeBiTec, 2015. Some of the questions which we have answered are given below (More can be found in the handbook).\nCan you imagine any malevolent use of the knowledge and sequences published on your team's wiki? Could the knowledge you provide be used for the creation of products or organisms that pose a danger to humans or the environment?\nOur project involves the release of an anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10) whose release is regulated by a control mechanism involving SoxS and SoxR genes. The SoxR gene is also regulated to be released only in the presence of methylmercury using the MerR-PmerT mercury responsive genes.\nSelective mutation of any of these control mechanisms could lead to release of IL-10. This could lead to reduced immune response to pathogens. IL-10 also down regulates transcription and secretion of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, and G-CSF by activated monocytes and macrophages. This could lead to cancer Schreiber S, 1997. IL-10 upregulates ICAM-1 within neural tissues. This promotes massive macrophage influx, demyelination due to inflammation and subsequent loss of neural tissue, resulting in muscle weakness and paralysis Dru S., 2009.\nWho will use your product? If your product is successful, who will receive benefits and who will be harmed?\nOur product if successful will be used by people who are at risk for methylmercury poisoning. We have made sure to not use any allergens or preservatives which could potentially harm consumers.\nWHO also has a self-assessment questionnaire to ensure that good quality, ethical research activities are conducted in safe and secure facilities. Some of the important question relevant to biosecurity and biosafety aspects have been answered below (more in handbook) WHO - Responsible life sciences research for global health security :\n|Pillar 3: BIOSAFETY AND LABORATORY BIOSECURITY|\n|An assessment of the risk associated with research activities is conducted||Yes. The team has documented a Safety Handbook that covers various safety aspects and a detailed risk assessment for each experiment|\n|Risk assessments are able to identify requirements for risk reduction measures including the level of containment required||Yes. The Safety Handbook covers not only the risk reduction measures but also the level of containment required for each stage of the research that will be conducted.|\n|Legislation/regulations regarding hazardous waste disposal are followed||Yes. The team will strictly follow the regulations pertaining to hazardous waste disposal. (No Lab Experiments were performed this year)|\n|Valuable biological material is safely and securely stored||Yes. The team will ensure that the valuable biological material is safely and securely stored for future use. (No Lab Experiments were performed this year)|\nFigure 3: Methylmercury is extremely toxic.\nAll forms of mercury, both organic and inorganic are highly toxic. Exposure to mercury even in small amounts can causes severe health issues and can even affect the development of the child in utero and early in life WHO - Mercury and health.\n- To avoid mercury poisoning by accidental inhalation, ingestion, injection or absorption through the skin while working with it, the use of appropriate type of gloves (Nitrile (8 mil) over Silver Shield) and other essential lab attire like Chemical goggles/face shield, lab coat with full sleeves, full-length pants, and closed toe shoes must be ensured.\n- Mercury spill kits must be kept handy in the lab in case of an emergency.\n- All mercury containing waste must be disposed of separately by packing in a container with a hazardous waste label and chemical name on it.\n- We have taken into consideration all the hazardous waste disposal laws in India and have also enlisted the ones in the US for reference in our safety manual.\nIn the USA: Paraquat is categorized under ‘restricted use' by the US Environmental Protection Agency. Only those with a license are allowed to use this chemical. A blue dye and sharp odor are added as a warning, and another agent is added to induce vomiting in case of ingestion Paraquat dichloride-EPA.\nIn India: CIBRC (Central Insecticide Board and Registration Committee) has categorized paraquat dichloride as highly toxic Conditions of paraquat use in India - Pan-India.\nTo ensure safety while handling paraquat protective clothing, including gloves, safety glasses, respiratory equipment, full-sleeved lab coat, full-length pants, and closed-toe shoes must be worn. During disposal, suitable incineration and chemical treatment in accordance with local regulations must be followed (by a licensed professional).\nFigure 4: Gloves\nTo maintain aseptic conditions, all experiments must be performed inside the laminar flow chamber while ensuring the UV light doesn't cause any problems to the person performing the experiment.\nPrecautions must be taken while working with the autoclave and handling of hot autoclaved equipment must be done using appropriate heat proof gloves. Aseptic conditions must be maintained in order to prevent contamination by unwanted DNA or organisms. Gloves must be used not only for handling hot equipment and chemicals but also for cold samples taken out of the freezer to avoid cold burns. The stains and other hazardous substances should be handled with care during gel electrophoresis, sonication and gas chromatography.\nLabs must be equipped with an emergency shower, eyewash station, and a first aid kit and workstation must be cleaned. Disposal of all waste materials must be done properly.\nIsolation of all electronic components from any conducting media should be ensured. All wiring connections should be insulated properly, and care must be taken to avoid spilling or leakage of chemicals or fluids onto the motors.\nAfter experiments which involve methylmercury and paraquat, the dialysis tube must be discarded and other equipment components should be thoroughly cleaned following the handling protocols. Any leakage into the incubator should be prevented by placing the entire set up in a closed air tight container. All of the components used in the design are checked for temperature and pH resistance.\nFigure 5: Specialized disposal\nAll the experiments designed are relatively safe. The bacteria used should be highly tested for any safety concerns. However, any unexpected results or modifications must be handled with extreme care.\nGrowth Media experiments which utilize hazardous substances like mercuric oxide, concentrated HCl etc. must be handled in the fume hood in rooms with adequate ventilation. Protective equipment must be worn at all times. Disposal of inorganic peroxides and oxidants as well as bromine and iodine should be done by rendering them harmless by reducing it with acidic thiosulphate solution. Disposal of contaminants should be done separately with adequate labeling.\nInitially, we identified the worst cases in pharmaceutical cleaning validation Identification of worst case in cleaning validation- Pharmaceutical guidelines.\n- Potency of product\n- Solubility of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) in water\n- Toxicity of API\n- Concentration of API\n- Contact surface area\n- Product excipients\n- Manufacturing process\nThe quality and quantity of the API (bacteria) must be maintained at recommended safe levels (CFU count) ensuring optimal potency. The water released during drying or other process must be sterilized before discarding. The API in our case is Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 which is a non-pathogenic known probiotic strain. The API concentration must be at recommended levels for a probiotic. The equipment used must have minimum surface area and should be sterilized regularly with non-harmful substances. The excipients used must not contain any known allergens as well as preservatives. Contamination of the product must be prevented by repeated cleaning and sterilization of all components including air, equipment, media etc.\nSince the volume of the microorganisms present in bioreactors is much larger, extreme care must be taken to prevent the contamination of the bioreactor itself and also the surrounding environment.\nThere are possibilities of liquid spills and aerosol formation for some widely used bacterial chassis. However, the bacteria we have proposed is Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 which is a risk 1 non-pathogenic organism and does not have the capability to form aerosols.\nThe proximity of large volumes of liquid and mains electrical equipment (eg, from heaters, aerators, sensors, etc) presents a hazard. Commercially-designed equipment from a reliable source should prevent access to live conductors.\nIn case of any gas production, the gases must be vented out to prevent high pressure build up, and it should be kept away from fire.\nThe quality and safety of the manufactured product should be a key concern in order to ensure the client's safety Prevention of microbial contamination during manufacturing- Pharmaceutical guidelines.\n- Air filtration and air change rates must be set and done regularly.\n- In case of contamination in one area, the plant should have a HVAC system which would remove and prevent contaminants from spreading to other areas.\n- Ventilation dampers should also be positioned away from the production area for maintenance purposes.\nFigure 6: Personal Protective Equipment\n- The personnel handling the production must be trained on the importance of hygiene and it should be ensured that they would wear protective clothing such as hair cover, overshoes, over garments, beard covers, etc. to prevent any sort of contamination.\n- It is required to ensure that direct contact with the product or an equipment which comes in contact with the product is avoided.\n- Cleaning agents must be of a suitable grade to minimize any health risks. Cleaning and disinfection should be done regularly. Rotation of different disinfectants should be done to prevent any resistance development. The disinfectant must be sterilized using a 0.2 micron membrane filter in sterile conditions. The hold time of the disinfectants must also be validated.\n- The equipment for cleaning should not have direct contact with the pharmaceutical product.\n- The cleaning practice must be validated.\nEquipment maintenance and cleanliness must be ensured and all guidelines must be followed.\nA controlled area for pharmaceutical manufacturing would be maintained. Any harm to the manufacturers due to dust particles or micro-organisms should be avoided by providing quality equipment, adequate hygiene training and regular cleaning and sterilization. The capsule integrity and sterility must be ensured during filling. Quality control of capsules should be done at each key stage. Different processes must be performed at different sections of the plant to prevent contamination.\nThere are four different levels at which a sterile pharmaceutical company should grade its control production: A B C and D. Grade A should be the zone for high risk operations like filling zone and zone for making aseptic connections; this zone should have laminar airflow systems with homogeneous airspeeds. Grade B is the background environment for grade A that allows for aseptic preparation and filling. Grade C and D are classified areas that handle the less critical stages of SPM Controlled areas in sterile manufacturing - pharmaceutical guidelines.\nFigure 7: Packaging\nBlister punching machine is closed at the manufacturing part, thus remaining tamper resistant. The packaging must maintain the integrity and safety of the product.\nWaste Management & Recycling\nPharmaceutical waste is categorized into 2 categories An overview of waste management in pharmaceutical industry - pharma journal\n- Hazardous waste (any contaminants or chemicals).\n- Non-hazardous waste\nAn important method of waste management is the prevention of waste material being created, also known as waste reduction. Before processing, any unnecessary waste generation must be checked and adequate measures should be taken.\nRe-use means the use of a product on more than one occasion, either for the same purpose or for a different purpose, without the need for reprocessing. Re-use avoids discarding a material to a waste stream when its initial use has concluded. The integrity of the product or equipment must not be sacrificed.\nRecycling involves the treatment or reprocessing of a discarded waste material to make it suitable for subsequent reuse either for its original form or for other purposes. Unused or haphazardly filled capsules should be recycled keeping in mind sterility. Discard water must be sterilized and used for some other purposes.\nPlease refer to the full safety handbook for all details.\nThe Safety Handbook includes detailed and complete safety considerations of every reagent, process, experiment, device, equipment, etc described in the other handbooks as well as biosecurity and biosafety issues of our project.\nTo download this document, click here."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"content_constrained"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:dde83184-b4f4-4d02-8965-55606888fee2>","<urn:uuid:2a27203c-a30b-4801-918b-3b46181abf4a>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Can you compare the founding purposes of ASTM International and NFPA, considering when and why each organization was established?","answer":"ASTM International was founded in 1898 when engineers and scientists gathered to address the specific problem of frequent rail breaks, which led to standardization of steel used in railroad construction. In contrast, NFPA was established in 1896 with a broader mission focused on eliminating death, injury, property and economic loss due to fire, electrical and related hazards. While ASTM began with a focused industrial concern, NFPA was created with a comprehensive safety mission from the start. Today, ASTM develops over 12,000 standards across various fields, while NFPA maintains 300 codes and standards specifically focused on fire and electrical safety.","context":["Making Manufacturing More Sustainable\nSometimes zero is not zero.\nCase in point: Manufacturer X sends no byproducts or waste to landfills or to incinerators. Manufacturer Y doesn't dump waste in landfills, yet it does opt to burn refuse for energy. Both claim they have \"zero landfill\" programs. Which one is correct?\nUntil recently, there were no standards under way to determine what zero actually was. Enter new ASTM International Subcommittee E60.13 on Sustainable Manufacturing, which is working on its initial standards that in part will be critical for firms that want to quantify the success of their sustainability initiatives. That is just one aspect of the work of the subcommittee, which focuses on advancing measurement science to promote improvements in resource efficiency - both energy and materials - and waste reduction across manufacturing processes and product assembly.\n\"Sustainable manufacturing is manufacturing that utilizes processes and materials and has outputs that optimize the triple bottom line,\" explains Michael Schmeida, a member of Subcommittee E60.13 as well as vice chairman of ASTM Committee E60 on Sustainability. Schmeida, director of compliance and sustainability for Tremco Commercial Sealants &\\; Waterproofing, Cleveland, Ohio, says the triple bottom line encompasses social, economic and environmental attributes, and the focus of that triple bottom line is on reducing, reusing and recycling.\nHe uses his own firm as an example of the need for standards. Tremco is committed to the environment and employs a zero landfill program. In the case of his company, that means it does not send anything to landfills or directly to incinerators. In a \"worst-case scenario,\" it refers some byproducts to waste-for-energy, i.e., material is burned to produce energy rather than burned to eliminate it via incineration.\n\"When we started this approach four to five years ago, we didn't know what counted as being diverted from landfills,\" Schmeida says. \"We didn't know how to classify. We had to set our own scope and determine if we met it. My job would have been a lot easier to get everything going if I had a guide.\"\nAccording to Amy Costello, Subcommittee E60.13 on Sustainable Manufacturing, organized in July 2012, will outline just that guide.\n\"This subcommittee creates a forum for the development of international standards for sustainable manufacturing,\" says Costello, the first chairman of E60.13, a member of the ASTM International board of directors and an environmental sustainability manager for Armstrong World Industries, Lancaster, Pa. \"As companies develop sustainability goals and reports, it's important to have common international standards we can use to assess and measure our progress. For example, without a common way to classify waste from a facility, it is impossible to benchmark progress across a company or between industries.\"\nThe subcommittee, which first met in October 2012, has proposed four new standards:\nCostello says the subcommittee, which has about 100 members from 13 countries, including Canada, Italy, Malaysia, South Korea, the United Kingdom and the United States, brings many industries together to develop standards for sustainable manufacturing.\n\"It's a very diverse group. Name an industry and we have people in it,\" says Schmeida.\nThat's important because sustainable manufacturing crosses industry boundaries. To be successful and competitive, all industries have to operate efficiently and those efficiencies have to align with sustainable manufacturing, Costello says.\n\"That is why I think sustainability has grown the way it has,\" Costello adds. \"It's a perfect win-win for everybody. It reduces costs and helps the environment.\"\nSubcommittee E60.13 came about in part because of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, which approached ASTM International about establishing standards for manufacturing sustainability.\nSudarsan Rachuri, Ph.D., computer scientist in the life cycle engineering group in the Systems Integration Division and program manager for sustainable manufacturing at NIST in Gaithersburg, Md., says, \"We had a program at NIST four years ago on sustainable and life cycle impact-based manufacturing.\" That program evolved into sustainability initiatives, including NIST workshops on the topic.\nIn the course of developing those workshops, Rachuri and others in his division realized the need for standards that directly dealt with issues surrounding manufacturing.\nThe focus on sustainability in manufacturing is very important, which is why NIST has been investing significantly to develop a trusted system of metrics and the underlying measurement science to compute those metrics, according to Rachuri.\n\"ASTM is the right place for this as it is the largest producer of standards in this area that significantly help industries,\" Rachuri says.\nNIST representatives, including Rachuri, presented about sustainable manufacturing at Committee E60's April 2012 meeting in Phoenix, Ariz., discussing the need for sustainable manufacturing standards and E60's potential role in developing them. That summer, ongoing discussions between NIST and E60 resulted in a scope and initial working documents for a new subcommittee.\n\"Product, process and supply network issues are critical for manufacturing,\" says Rachuri, who is vice chairman of the subcommittee. \"Without focusing on the entire life cycle of manufacturing, we cannot understand the life cycle impact of a product.\"\n\"Very, very quickly we put the idea together,\" Schmeida notes. \"Within a few months, it went from an idea to an actual subcommittee.\"\nSchmeida adds, \"This is the first we are aware of and the only consensus organization putting together standards that are going to be utilizing how we all, regardless of industry, could be potentially measured by consumers.\" He and other subcommittee members acknowledge that the concern about the environment goes well beyond manufacturing firms.\"We do get customers who ask what we're doing as far as our landfill footprint,\" Schmeida says.\nIt is important, Rachuri notes, for businesses to be able to compare such elements as energy, materials and water involved with the development of a product and the disposal of waste to fully understand the manufacturing and production processes involved.\nTraditionally, manufacturing industries are concerned with quality, cost and productivity. The new dimension of sustainability is a business megatrend, according to the Harvard Business Review.1\nSustainable manufacturing is more proactive. \"You're to be responsible for the efficiency from the extraction of raw materials and manufacturing to the use stage of the product, to the end of life of the product,\" Rachuri says.\nCompanies today want to be proactive, he adds, because of a sense of responsibility to the environment as well as consumer demand, innovation and global competition. \"To do that they need to capture and exchange information,\" Rachuri says, and that need inspired the request for ASTM International to develop standards.\n\"Standards play a vital role in making sure all of your tools work together,\" he explains, noting that standards enable companies and consumers to compare and contrast products. \"Firms can use standards to differentiate their products and to evaluate how efficient their manufacturing process is.\"\n\"The standards provide a system for the manufacturing industry to compute the total life cycle impact of the product,\" says Rachuri.\nAccording to Rachuri and Kevin Lyons, group leader, life cycle engineering, Systems Integration Division, NIST, there is a heightened awareness of the economic and competitive importance of sustainable manufacturing technologies in U.S. manufacturing. Concurrently, a body of research results is emerging that will support incorporating sustainability considerations in manufacturing processes.\n\"Further, industrial organizations that predict and plan for a sustainable future are more likely to survive into the next generation,\" Rachuri says, citing information from the Institute for Manufacturing at the University of Cambridge.2 In addition, awareness of the business benefits of sustainability is increasing. \"There has also been an increased effort by the manufacturing sector to collect sustainable manufacturing information using energy management systems, data collection systems, material declaration systems and best practices,\" Rachuri says. According to a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency report, the research issues and challenges in transitioning from lean to sustainable manufacturing provide an excellent opportunity to address the measurement science needs for sustainable manufacturing.3\nIn essence, the future lies in measurement science and standards that will serve a significant role in determining sustainability performance. Through these methods, sustainability efforts will have a higher chance for success and reuse for subsequent analysis and decision-making, and impact, the NIST representatives indicate.\n\"Most companies have no way to track and compose sustainability-related data of processes, factories and supplier networks,\" Lyons says, \"This subcommittee looks to develop the measurement science for sustainable manufacturing, which is often very complex and hard because it usually involves various scientific and technical disciplines, and the necessary expertise and competence may not be available in the company to deploy the standards.\"\n1.

Those discussed here include: American National Standards Institute (ANSI), ASTM International, FM Global, National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), Safety Equipment Institute (SEI), Underwriters’ Laboratories Inc. (UL) and Canadian Standards Association (CSA) Group.\nThe American National Standards Institute (ANSI) is a diversified and unique nonprofit organization that includes industry, standards developing organizations, trade associations, professional and technical societies, government, labor and consumer groups. ANSI oversees the creation, promulgation and use of thousands of standards and guidelines that directly impact businesses in nearly every sector. ANSI is also actively engaged in accreditation – assessing the competence of organizations determining conformance to standards. ANSI was formed originally as the American Engineering Standards Committee on Oct. 19, 1918. ANSI’s mission is to enhance both the global competitiveness of U.S. business and the U.S. quality of life by promoting and facilitating voluntary consensus standards and conformity assessment systems; and safeguarding their integrity.\nASTM International, originally known as the American Society for Testing and Materials, was formed in 1898, when a group of engineers and scientists got together to address frequent rail breaks. Their work led to standardization on the steel used in railroad construction. ASTM International is a not-for-profit organization that provides a forum for the development and publication of voluntary consensus standards for materials, products, systems and services. It is one of the largest voluntary standards developing organizations in the world. Standards developed at ASTM International are the work of over 30,000 members. Technical experts represent producers, users, consumers, government and academia from over 1400 countries. Members belong to one or more committees, each of which covers a subject area. These committees develop more than 12,000 ASTM International standards that can be found in the 77-volume Annual Book of ASTM Standards.\nFM Global is one of the world’s largest commercial and industrial property insurance and risk management organizations specializing in property protection. It was formed in 1835 by Zachariah Allen, who felt the need for an industrial insurance group to focus on loss control. FM Global has six business units:\n- FM Global Group – Mitigating business risk through all its business units\n- AFM – Commercial property insurance and property insurance expertise for the Middle Market\n- FM Approvals – Third-party certification for company products worldwide\n- FM Global Cargo – Comprehensive cargo coverage and risk engineering services\n- Mutual Boiler RE – Provides breakdown treaty reinsurance and related support services for boiler systems\n- Emergency Response Consultants – Offers hands-on emergency response training to all levels of fire brigades, hazardous material emergency responders, technical and confined-space rescue teams, emergency medical services and local fire departments\nEach unit helps its clients manage their property risks through a variety of products and services. The FM Approvals business unit certifies industrial and commercial products and services. When a product or service meets FM Approvals’ standards, it is issued the FM Approved mark to signify it will perform as expected and support property loss prevention. The FM Approvals business unit backs its evaluations with scientific research and testing and lists more than 45,000 certified products in its approval guide.\nThe National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) is an international nonprofit organization founded in 1896, devoted to eliminating death, injury, property and economic loss due to fire, electrical and related hazards. NFPA membership totals more than 60,000 individuals and more than 80 national trade and professional organizations. NFPA’s mission is to help save lives and reduce loss with information, knowledge and passion. NFPA’s 300 codes and standards influence every building, process, service, design and installation in the U.S. and many of those used in other countries. The National Electric Code (NFPA 70), Life Safety Code (NFPA 101) and Flammable and Combustible Liquids Code (NFPA 30) are widely used.\nThe Safety Equipment Institute (SEI) was organized in 1981 and is headquartered in Arlington, Virginia. It is a private, nonprofit organization with third-party certification programs to test and certify a wide array of safety equipment. SEI’s certification programs are accredited by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the Standards Council of Canada (SCC) in accordance with ISO Guide 65 General Requirements for Bodies Operating Product Certification Systems. SEI has an alliance with INSPEC International, Ltd., a notified body located in the UK. Together, they offer a variety of testing services, CE Marking and ISO Registration.\nSEI certification programs include ongoing product testing and quality assurance audits of product models voluntarily submitted by manufacturers. All product testing is done in accordance with the selected voluntary, government or other standards available for the given product. SEI will certify the manufacturer’s product model and grant the right to use the SEI certification label when:\n- The testing lab has determined that the product model has been tested and successfully meets the appropriate product standard.\n- The quality assurance auditor has determined that the manufacturer complies with SEI quality assurance requirements.\nSEI publishes a certified product list and it is continuously updated to reflect the latest information. SEI does not offer a warranty for the performance of the product, but having a product certified by SEI shows that the manufacturer is taking responsibility for producing a quality product.\nUnderwriters' Laboratories Inc. (UL) is an independent, not-for-profit product safety certification organization that has been testing products and writing safety standards since 1894. UL publishes 1,614 safety standards, and performs approximately 96,000 product evaluations of components, materials and systems with 22 billion UL marks appearing on 71,000 manufacturers’ products each year.\nUL’s mission is to conscientiously advance safety science through careful research and investigation, applying their efforts to prevent or reduce loss of life and property and to promote safe living and working environments for all people. This is supported by 170 testing and certification facilities and a staff of 11,615 employees located in 40 countries.\nThe Canadian Standards Group (formerly the Canadian Standards Association) is an independent, not-for-profit, member-based association dedicated to advancing safety, sustainability and social good. It is an internationally accredited standards development and testing and certification organization. They also provide consumer product evaluation and education and training services. They provide a broad range of knowledge and expertise that includes: industrial equipment, plumbing and construction, electro-medical and healthcare, appliances and gas, alternative energy, lighting and sustainability.

{"question":"How do these two famous impact craters compare: the Puerto Mínguez impact structure in Spain and the Ries crater in Germany? What is biggest difference between them?","answer":"The Ries crater and Puerto Mínguez impact structures differ significantly in their characteristics. The Ries crater is a well-preserved impact structure with a clear circular shape, measuring about 25 kilometers in diameter, formed approximately 15 million years ago in the Bavarian landscape by a meteorite about one kilometer in diameter. In contrast, the Puerto Mínguez structure is characterized by its ejecta deposits that extend over 5 kilometers, consisting of uncemented mixed materials from different geological periods (Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and Lower Tertiary). While both structures show evidence of impact-related deformation, the Puerto Mínguez site is primarily studied through its ejecta characteristics, while the Ries crater is notable for its intact crater structure.","context":["STRIAE, POLISH, IMPRINTS, ROTATED FRACTURES, AND RELATED FEATURES FROM CLASTS IN THE PUERTO MÍNGUEZ IMPACT EJECTA (NE SPAIN)\nFerran Claudin 1, Kord Ernstson 2, Michael R.

By road construction meanwhile continuously exposed over 5 km length, the deposit is now considered part of an enormous impact ejecta blanket around the Azuara and Rubielos de la Cérida twin impact structures [2, 3].\nFig.1. Location map for the Puerto Mínguez. Encircled are the Azuara and Rubielos de la Cérida impact structures.\nFig.2. Typical diamict aspect of the impact ejecta.\nStratigraphically, the Puerto Mínguez deposits consist of uncemented and frequently intermixed Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and Lower Tertiary material. The mixed cobble and block components show variable morphology (well-rounded, sub-rounded, and angular), and are supported by a sandy and marly matrix. Megablocks with preserved stratification and original characteristics are also intermixed within the deposit.\nFig.3. Mesoscopic deformations in the Puerto Mínguez impact ejecta: Striae, grooves, polish, imprints, and faceted sculpture.\nMost of the pebbles, cobbles and blocks are strongly deformed (Figs.3-5). They show striations all around (including nailhead striae), penetration marks, deep grooves, rotated fractures, and irregular fractures with complex bifurcations. An intense internal torsion of many cobbles and blocks is documented by hinges and rotated fractures (Fig.4). The rotated fractures (first described for the Pelarda Fm. ejecta ), may result from pure torsion, or from a superposition of torsion and tension. Fractured components frequently resemble bread cut into slices, but the clasts remain coherent (as do the clasts with the rotated fractures), and are not broken into pieces (Fig.5).\nFig.4. Rotated fractures in clasts from the Puerto Mínguez ejecta.\nFig.5. «Bread-cut-to-slices» features in a clast from the Puerto Mínguez ejecta (left) and from the Ries Crater Bunte Breccia ejecta (Belemnite rostra and carbonate concretion, middle and right).\nConclusions. – From the analysis of the lithologic characteristics, surface features, and intense deformations of the components and the matrix of the Puerto Minguez deposits, we conclude that the origin of these features is connected with simultaneous plastic and brittle deformation, acting rapidly, and under high contact pressure between the matrix and larger components. Especially the rotated fractures and the «bread-cut-to-slices features» are regarded as typical of dynamic, rapid deformation. Deformations as observed at the Puerto Mínguez occur under high confining pressure in an impact event and are observed in other impact ejecta (e.g., the Ries Crater (Fig.5), the Azuara and the Chicxulub impact structures) [4-6, and others]. They are not compatible with an origin from fluvial deposition, quasi-static tectonics, the action of glaciers, or syn-tectonic sedimentation .\nThe observations and analyses presented here may serve as a strong diagnostic tool for impact-related diamictites.\nReferences:  Moissenet, E. et al.

Now, magnify that to gigantic proportions and instead of a pebble make that a meteorite hurtling through outer space and splashing down on Earth. That gives you a picture of what happened some 15 million years ago in southern Germany.\nRight: A three-dimensional view over the Ries crater from south with the distribution of ejected masses. Digital terrain data courtesy of Bayerisches Landesvermessungsamt and Landsevermessungsamt Baden-Württemberg. View created with ArcView and Photoshop.\nThe Ries crater was formed when a meteorite about one kilometer in diameter struck the Bavarian landscape. One of the best preserved large impact structures in the world, the crater is about 25 kilometers in diameter and is accompanied by a smaller crater, the Steinheim Basin, about three kilometers in diameter. These two geological features represent the only two confirmed impact structures in Germany and have generated a lot of interest not only from within the geoscientific community but with anyone who is fascinated with the fused glass beads that were formed on impact and are found as far away as the Czech Republic.\nMapping the Crater\nScientists from many countries have been studying the craters for decades and not just because they are rock hounds. Impacts are a dominant geologic process in the formation of planetary bodies, and as rare finds, these intact impact structures are providing researchers with extensive geological, geophysical, and geochemical data for studying this phenomenon.\nIn 1973, the Bavarian Geological Survey began a research drill hole in the center of the crater with a final depth of 1,206 meters. Many of the modern concepts of impact cratering and their structural significance have been tested at the Ries Crater according to Erwin Geiss, a geophysicist and GIS specialist with the survey.\nLeft: The southeastern part of the crater (impact point is circle in the upper left corner).\nGIS came to the project when work began on a revised geological map (1:50,000 scale) of the crater. The map was completely produced with Esri's ArcInfo and published not only as a paper map but also on CD-ROM as an ArcView and ArcExplorer project, which included outcropping descriptions, photographs, and topographic maps.\nExplaining the significance of the mapping project, Geiss says, \"The impacting body hit a very well-stratified target, which gave us a great advantage because we were able to determine the original depth and layer of the material that was thrown out during the impact. To get a better understanding of the impact process itself, I suggested using the digital map to do a geostatistical analysis of the age, size, and range of distribution of the ejecta.\"\nWhat Does It All Mean?\nWorking with a well-known impact specialist, Dr. Jean Pohl from the University of Munich, and two other GIS specialists, Geiss used the GIS to help analyze the properties of the ejected masses. They looked at each material separately according to its geological unit before the impact and studied the combination of directional distribution of the ejecta and the height dependency (digital terrain model). \"Much of these analyses are only possible with a digital map,\" says Geiss. \"GIS helped us get a clearer picture of the chaos after the impact, and it also helped us communicate the results to others.\"\nAlong with the maps generated for the project, Geiss designed a poster, which won the first place most unique award at the 1999 Esri International User Conference in San Diego, California. The design is unusual and reflects the chaotic nature of the project. \"We were working with something absolutely chaotican impact that within seconds completely turned around the tertiary landscape. I wanted to show that geology is not always static with changes over millions of years,\" he says.\nLooking to the Future\nStudying impact craters on Earth is helping Geiss and other researchers understand Earth's early development process. For instance, there is now evidence that links a large impact to a mass extinction eventthe disappearance of dinosaurs. Some oil and gas reservoirs and mineral deposits are also related results of large-scale impacts.\nAnother reason for the importance of studying these structures is that it is enabling scientists to assess the risks of impacts. Large impact events, such as the fireballs portrayed in the movies Deep Impact and Armageddon, are readily recognized as hazards for the cataclysmic events they can cause. But on a smaller scale, there are other things to worry about than just blowing a hole in the atmosphere. Even relatively small impacts can bring about subtle but significant changes in the biosphere, terrestrial climate, and chemical atmosphere and cause tsunamis.\nGeiss is convinced that there is a lot more to be learned, and he's not about to go back to studying paper maps. \"Counting tiny colored patches on paper maps would be no fun at all,\" he says. His next step is to analyze remote sensing data of the crater taken from space. Satellite imagery provides an overall view in a large-scale context. In this vein, he intends to put ArcView 8.1 with the Geostatistical Analyst extension to good use.\nFounded in 1850, the Bavarian Geological Survey is among the oldest institutions of its kind and is responsible for the collection, evaluation, and dissemination of geoscientific data for the State of Bavaria.\nFor more information, contact Erwin Geiss (e-mail: email@example.com)."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:3127cbc6-21c3-41cb-bf4f-ac2a63474d68>","<urn:uuid:a45685de-3115-44ac-9700-5e640d27de63>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the key differences between single-sided ventilation and mixed-mode ventilation systems in terms of their operation and effectiveness?","answer":"Single-sided ventilation and mixed-mode ventilation operate quite differently. Single-sided ventilation involves openings only on one external wall, typically facing the wind direction, where air exchange occurs through wind turbulence. It is considered less effective compared to other natural ventilation methods. In contrast, mixed-mode ventilation combines natural ventilation from operable windows (either manually or sensor controlled) with mechanical systems that include air distribution and refrigeration equipment for cooling. Mixed-mode systems offer greater flexibility and efficiency, providing backup during power outages or mechanical failures, and can achieve 47-79% in HVAC energy savings while improving occupant satisfaction through greater personal control over thermal comfort.","context":["Openings in building envelopes are major design elements in any building. They not only connect you to the outer world but are also a way of getting fresh air into the interiors. Natural-ventilation, also called Passive-ventilation is a method of supplying fresh air and removing stale air from a space. It does not use any mechanical means to carry out this process. Mechanical means consume energy, may emit harmful substances and contribute towards global-warming. Natural ways are always economic and nature-friendly.\nThere are three methods to carry out natural ventilation:\n- Single-sided ventilation\n- Stack effect\nMethods to carry Out Natural Ventilation:\n1. Single-Sided Ventilation\nThis method involves having openings only on one external wall and generally towards the wind-direction. Air exchange happens through wind turbulence. Single-sided ventilation is not used as often as it is ineffective compared to the other two ways.\nIn this method, openings are located such that the ones at the receptive end allow maximum inflow of fresh air and the outlet openings are placed such that the air gets circulated in the space efficiently and is pushed out with the inflow of fresh air.\nIn areas with high wind speeds, smaller openings are preferred in the wind-ward directions and larger in the lee-ward or exhaust direction. In case of lower wind speeds, the opposite of the previous is preferred to get better quality air.\n3. Stack Effect\nThis method is based on the fact that cooler air is light in weight and hot and stale air is heavier. Receptive openings are given on the lower sides in the wind-ward directions and for outlet, openings are given on the upper side. This arrangement pushes out the stale air from the space whenever fresh air is drawn inwards.\nAdvantages of Natural Ventilation System\n- Energy saving\nBuildings are one of the highest energy-consumers and producers of carbon dioxide. Natural ventilation systems do not emit carbon dioxide or any other harmful substance. They do not require electricity or any other fuel to carry out ventilation\n- No pipelines and ducting\nUnlike mechanical ventilation or air-conditioners, natural methods do not require pipelines or ducts which incur extra expenditure and also in some cases spoil the aesthetics of the building\n- More natural light\nAnything natural is good for health. At least, most of the times. Large openings not only bring in more natural air but also more natural light. In case of harsh sunlight, you can always cover them up with beautiful drapes!\n- Efficient use of space\nAir handling units or any other machinery require space for installation, whereas, natural ventilation needs only openings. The space that could be occupied with machinery can now be used for various other purposes.\n- Low maintenance\nThe absence of pipes, ducts and machinery will need no maintenance except for regular dusting the openings, which, is definitely not a herculean task!\n- Less expensive\nExcept for spending on frames, shutters and drapes for openings, there is no expenditure for anything else. No machinery means, no extra costs. Fresh air is free, isn’t it?\n- Less health-issues\nMechanical ways might cause disorders and unpleasant sounds (if machines are not maintained properly). Natural ventilation can reduce such sick-building syndrome symptoms.\nFactors on Which Natural Ventilation Depend:\nNatural ventilation is dependent on factors like:\n- Wind direction and Orientation of building\nNorth-East and South-West are generally considered as the direction of winds. Therefore, the placement of openings should be done considering these directions\nAn uneven topography may hinder the movement of wind due to which the placement, size and types of openings may be altered.\n- Vegetation / Landscape\nHaving more vegetation definitely cools the surroundings and absorbs noise. But, apart from these, trees also act as source of fresh hair.\n- Size and types of Openings\nAvoid parallel placing of inlets and outlets and partitions near inlets. Openable windows are more efficient as they could be closed and opened whenever required. Glass panels could be used for shutters to get sunlight even while shutters are closed.\n– Yashaswini Poddar","Natural VentilationExisting Commercial\nWhat is Natural Ventilation?\nNatural ventilation uses passive strategies to supply outdoor air to a building’s interior for ventilation and cooling. Natural ventilation systems rely on natural forces, such as wind and temperature differences between a building and its environment, to drive the flow of fresh air through a building. Cross ventilation uses air-pressure differentials caused by wind, and stack ventilation uses the increased buoyancy of air as it warms up. Both work on the principle of air moving from a high-pressure to a low-pressure zone.\nMany modern commercial buildings utilize tightly sealed building envelopes and mechanical HVAC systems to achieve energy efficiency (see Air Infiltration). Natural ventilation strategies can introduce fresh air to airtight buildings, replacing all or part of a mechanical system, and reduce energy and operating costs and improve indoor air quality. Mixed-mode systems use a combination of natural ventilation from operable windows (either manually or sensor controlled) and mechanical systems that include air distribution equipment and refrigeration equipment for cooling (see Demand Control Ventilation).\nHow to Implement Natural Ventilation\nImplementing a successful natural ventilation design or mixed-mode system requires an understanding of the local climate, intended building use, building geometry, and occupant behavior (see Building Orientation, Tree Protection and Placement, and Building Evaluation). For example, in coastal locations, desirable cool sea breezes can reduce cooling loads. It is important to be aware that outdoor air in these areas may also have high moisture content that needs to be managed (see Moisture Control). Other locations may not be ideal for natural ventilation due to local sources of air pollution, allergens, or outdoor noises. The design of internal spaces and the size and placement of openings in the building impacts ventilation as well. Operable windows, fans, and corridors help direct airflow using natural ventilation principles (see Individual Comfort Controls and Views and Operable Windows).\nFor naturally ventilated spaces, the Minimum Indoor Air Quality Performance requirement for LEEDv4 Operations + Maintenance Existing Buildings refers to the natural ventilation procedure from ASHRAE Standard 62.1–2010 (or a local equivalent, whichever is more stringent).\nCoolVent is a natural ventilation simulation tool developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to evaluate the effects of different natural ventilation strategies on a building’s energy use and occupant comfort. The CoolVent website also provides resources and case studies about natural ventilation (see Energy Modeling).\nThe Passive House Institute US (PHIUS+ 2018) building certification sets standards for airtight construction, and natural and controlled mechanical ventilation for all types of high-performance, energy-efficient buildings. The International Passive House Association (iPHA) provides a program and resources that address refurbishment with passive house components. The Passive House Institute developed the iPHA to promote the Passive House Standard wordwide.\nHigh, operable, clerestory windows, controlled by the building’s energy management system, cool the Zion Canyon Visitor Center by allowing hot air to escape while low windows introduce cool air at ground level (see Figure 1).\nNatural ventilation strategies can reduce energy use, and lower energy bills and installation and maintenance costs by allowing for smaller mechanical systems and extending the life of HVAC equipment. When part of a mixed-mode system, natural ventilation can increase occupant satisfaction and indoor air quality by offering occupants greater personal control over thermal comfort, ventilation levels, and connection to the outdoors (see Biophilia).\nA study by Carnegie Mellon found that natural ventilation and mixed-mode conditioning can achieve 0.8-1.3% savings on health costs, 3-18% productivity gains and 47-79% in HVAC energy savings, for an average ROI of at least 120%.\nIn the event of power outages and the loss of air conditioning, natural ventilation can maintain thermal comfort for building occupants, particularly at night, when colder outside air can mix with warmer air inside the building (see Building Flush). Mixed-mode systems add redundancy and flexibility to the building’s ventilation and HVAC systems, providing back-up during power-outages, mechanical failures, security threats, or the release of air-borne contaminants.\n Whole Building Design Guide (WBDG).

{"question":"What are the key parts of an aircraft cantilever wing?","answer":"An aircraft cantilever wing consists of one or more strong beams called spars that run along the wing's span. The end fixed to the central fuselage is called the root, while the far end is the tip. The wing typically has a main spar and a smaller drag-spar near the trailing edge, connected by additional internal members or stressed skin. This structure helps resist vertical lift loads, horizontal shear stresses, and twisting forces.","context":["A cantilever is a rigid structural element that extends horizontally and is supported at only one end. Typically it extends from a flat vertical surface such as a wall, to which it must be firmly attached. Like other structural elements, a cantilever can be formed as a beam, plate, truss, or slab.\nCantilever construction allows overhanging structures without additional support.\nIn bridges, towers, and buildingsEdit\nCantilevers are widely found in construction, notably in cantilever bridges and balconies (see corbel). In cantilever bridges, the cantilevers are usually built as pairs, with each cantilever used to support one end of a central section. The Forth Bridge in Scotland is an example of a cantilever truss bridge. A cantilever in a traditionally timber framed building is called a jetty or forebay. In the southern United States, a historic barn type is the cantilever barn of log construction.\nTemporary cantilevers are often used in construction. The partially constructed structure creates a cantilever, but the completed structure does not act as a cantilever. This is very helpful when temporary supports, or falsework, cannot be used to support the structure while it is being built (e.g., over a busy roadway or river, or in a deep valley). Therefore, some truss arch bridges (see Navajo Bridge) are built from each side as cantilevers until the spans reach each other and are then jacked apart to stress them in compression before finally joining. Nearly all cable-stayed bridges are built using cantilevers as this is one of their chief advantages. Many box girder bridges are built segmentally, or in short pieces. This type of construction lends itself well to balanced cantilever construction where the bridge is built in both directions from a single support.\nThese structures rely heavily on torque and rotational equilibrium for their stability.\nIn an architectural application, Frank Lloyd Wright's Fallingwater used cantilevers to project large balconies. The East Stand at Elland Road Stadium in Leeds was, when completed, the largest cantilever stand in the world holding 17,000 spectators. The roof built over the stands at Old Trafford uses a cantilever so that no supports will block views of the field. The old (now demolished) Miami Stadium had a similar roof over the spectator area. The largest cantilevered roof in Europe is located at St James' Park in Newcastle-Upon-Tyne, the home stadium of Newcastle United F.C.\nThe Forth Bridge, a cantilever truss bridge.\nA cantilevered railroad deck and fence on the Canton Viaduct\nA cantilever barn in rural Tennessee\nCantilever barn at Cades Cove\nCantilever occurring in the game \"Jenga\"\nBusan Cinema Center in Busan, South Korea, with the world's longest cantilever roof.\nThis radiograph of a \"bridge\" dental restoration features a cantilevered crown to the left\nRonan Point: Structural failure of part of floors cantilevered from a central shaft.\nThis section does not cite any sources. (April 2018) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)\nThe cantilever is commonly used in the wings of fixed-wing aircraft. Early aircraft had light structures which were braced with wires and struts. However, these introduced aerodynamic drag which limited performance. While it is heavier, the cantilever avoids this issue and allows the plane to fly faster.\nHugo Junkers pioneered the cantilever wing in 1915. Only a dozen years after the Wright Brothers' initial flights, Junkers endeavored to eliminate virtually all major external bracing members in order to decrease airframe drag in flight. The result of this endeavor was the Junkers J 1 pioneering all-metal monoplane of late 1915, designed from the start with all-metal cantilever wing panels. About a year after the initial success of the Junkers J 1, Reinhold Platz of Fokker also achieved success with a cantilever-winged sesquiplane built instead with wooden materials, the Fokker V.1.\nIn the cantilever wing one or more strong beams, called spars, run along the span of the wing. The end fixed rigidly to the central fuselage is known as the root and the far end as the tip. In flight, the wings generate vertical lift and the spars carry this load through to the fuselage.\nTo resist horizontal shear stresses from either drag or engine thrust, the wing must also form a stiff cantilever in the horizontal plane. A single-spar design will usually be fitted with a second smaller drag-spar nearer the trailing edge, braced to the main spar via additional internal members or a stressed skin. The wing must also resist twisting forces, achieved by cross-bracing or otherwise stiffening the main structure.\nCantilever wings require much stronger and heavier spars than would otherwise be needed in a wire-braced design. However, as the speed of the aircraft increases, the drag of the bracing increases sharply, while the wing structure must be strengthened, typically by increasing the strength of the spars and the thickness of the skinning. At speeds of around 200 miles per hour (320 km/h) the drag of the bracing becomes excessive and the wing strong enough to be made a cantilever without excess weight penalty. Increases in engine power through the late 1920s and early 1930s raised speeds through this zone and by the late 1930s cantilever wings had almost wholly superseded braced ones. Other changes such as enclosed cockpits, retractable undercarriage, landing flaps and stressed-skin construction furthered the design revolution, with the pivotal moment widely acknowledged to be the MacRobertson England-Australia air race of 1934, which was won by a de Havilland DH.88 Comet.\nPresently, cantilever wings are almost universal with bracing only being used for some slower aircraft where a lighter weight is prioritized over speed, such as in the ultralight class.\nIn microelectromechanical systemsEdit\nCantilevered beams are the most ubiquitous structures in the field of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). An early example of a MEMS cantilever is the Resonistor, an electromechanical monolithic resonator. MEMS cantilevers are commonly fabricated from silicon (Si), silicon nitride (Si3N4), or polymers. The fabrication process typically involves undercutting the cantilever structure to release it, often with an anisotropic wet or dry etching technique. Without cantilever transducers, atomic force microscopy would not be possible. A large number of research groups are attempting to develop cantilever arrays as biosensors for medical diagnostic applications. MEMS cantilevers are also finding application as radio frequency filters and resonators. The MEMS cantilevers are commonly made as unimorphs or bimorphs.\nTwo equations are key to understanding the behavior of MEMS cantilevers. The first is Stoney's formula, which relates cantilever end deflection δ to applied stress σ:\nwhere is Poisson's ratio, is Young's modulus, is the beam length and is the cantilever thickness. Very sensitive optical and capacitive methods have been developed to measure changes in the static deflection of cantilever beams used in dc-coupled sensors.\nThe second is the formula relating the cantilever spring constant to the cantilever dimensions and material constants:\nwhere is force and is the cantilever width. The spring constant is related to the cantilever resonance frequency by the usual harmonic oscillator formula . A change in the force applied to a cantilever can shift the resonance frequency. The frequency shift can be measured with exquisite accuracy using heterodyne techniques and is the basis of ac-coupled cantilever sensors.\nThe principal advantage of MEMS cantilevers is their cheapness and ease of fabrication in large arrays. The challenge for their practical application lies in the square and cubic dependences of cantilever performance specifications on dimensions. These superlinear dependences mean that cantilevers are quite sensitive to variation in process parameters, particularly the thickness as this is generally difficult to accurately measure. However, it has been shown that microcantilever thicknesses can be precisely measured and that this variation can be quantified. Controlling residual stress can also be difficult.\nChemical sensor applicationsEdit\nA chemical sensor can be obtained by coating a recognition receptor layer over the upper side of a microcantilever beam. A typical application is the immunosensor based on an antibody layer that interacts selectively with a particular immunogen and reports about its content in a specimen. In the static mode of operation, the sensor response is represented by the beam bending with respect to a reference microcantilever. Alternatively, microcantilever sensors can be operated in the dynamic mode. In this case, the beam vibrates at its resonance frequency and a variation in this parameter indicates the concentration of the analyte. Recently, microcantilevers have been fabricated that are porous, allowing for a much larger surface area for analyte to bind to, increasing sensitivity by raising the ratio of the analyte mass to the device mass. Surface stress on microcantilever, due to receptor-target binding, which produces cantilever deflection can be analyzed using optical methods like laser interferometry. Zhao et al., also showed that by changing the attachment protocol of the receptor on the microcantilever surface, the sensitivity can be further improved when the surface stress generated on the microcantilever is taken as the sensor signal.\nIn storage applicationsEdit\nA cantilever rack is a type of warehouse storage system consisting of the vertical column, the base, the arms, and the horizontal and/or cross-bracing. These components are fabricated from both roll formed and structural steel. The horizontal and/or cross bracing are used to connect two or more columns together. They are commonly found in lumber yards, woodworking shops, and plumbing supply warehouses.\nA folding cantilever tray is a type of stacked shelf that can be unfolded to allow convenient access to items on multiple tiers simultaneously. The shelves can be collapsed when not in use for more compact storage. Due to these properties, folding cantilever trays are often used in baggage and toolboxes.\n|Wikimedia Commons has media related to Cantilevers.|\n- Hool, George A.; Johnson, Nathan Clarke (1920). \"Elements of Structural Theory - Definitions\".

{"question":"Could you explain why system flexibility is considered a key pillar of enterprise quality management systems and what are its main attributes?","answer":"System flexibility and extensibility is a key pillar because no one can predict future needs. It has three main attributes: connectivity (ability to connect with other systems across and outside the enterprise), expandability (capability to add unlimited workflows with pre-built templates), and configurability (ability to make changes without altering source code, using tools like drag-and-drop configuration).","context":["5 Pillars of Modern Enterprise Quality Management Systems\nAfter decades spent helping companies develop and implement enterprise quality management systems, a consistent pattern has emerged in all effective system implementations. Regardless of industry, a few very important quality system elements are consistent in building effective quality management systems.\nThis blog focuses on these elements, or “pillars.” Each of the pillars connect to help a company deliver quality products and services to customers and clients. These five attributes are not only powerful building blocks of effective enterprise quality management systems, but they are also industry agnostic.\nPillar 1: Process Integration\nWhile most companies execute on these functions, the degree of integration and automation varies greatly from company to company. The concern of the first pillar is how well these processes are integrated together. For example, if the Customer Complaint process is completely separated from the Corrective Action process, then there is room for improvement.\nThe graphic below is a live workflow diagram. Note that the Customer Complaint Event is linked to the Corrective Action process. The workflow is configured such that if the Customer Event meets certain criteria (such as an identified design problem) a Corrective Action is automatically launched.\nBy clicking on the Customer Complaint ID number, the record opens. The form indicates a problem with Product A1. The Event Description notes that one of five products that were shipped to the customer does not work. Because this is due to a Design Problem, a Corrective Action will be assigned with pre-populated information from the Complaint. See below.\nThis example illustrates the benefits of integrating processes. Integration improves cross-department visibility, increases efficiency and improves accuracy.\nPillar 2: System Flexibility and Extensibility\nUnfortunately, no one can predict what the future holds. Being able to adapt and continuously innovate is extremely important. In summary, the second pillar is all about connectivity, expandability, and configurability. Look for three main attributes when evaluating the adaptability of a quality management system:\n- How easily can it be connected to other systems?\n- How easy is it to automate new processes?\n- For each of those processes what is the effort required to configure that system?\nConnectivity is the ability to connect with other processes or systems across the enterprise and outside of the enterprise. Referring to the figure below (Diagram E3), the MRP system and Quality Management Systems are separated by the corporate cloud.\nIt would be desirable if both systems had a web services interface to connect these processes together in a reliable and secure manner. Alternatively, we may want to connect the MRP system with the MES system. It would be advantageous if each had a programming interface that would allow data to be passed between the two systems. Without these types of connectivity capabilities systems are destined to remain islands.\nExpandability enables you to add unlimited workflows. The beauty of an expandable system with pre-built templates is you don’t have to turn them on unless you need them. If you are evaluating software, look to see how much room for expansion there is. Ensure you can add an unlimited number of additional workflows beyond those delivered to accommodate unforeseen future needs.\nConfigurability eliminates the time and expense of changing low-level source code, reconfiguring databases and building workflows from scratch. Look for systems that have tools including drag-and-drop configuration.\nPillar 3: Centralized Monitoring and Management\nA best of breed enterprise quality management system should provide the following capabilities:\n- Alerts & Notifications: The system should remind users when tasks are due and go late. This helps ensure that projects are completed on schedule which reduces response times and increases customer satisfaction. In addition, alerts should be automatically triggered to let users know of trending problems and performance dips.\n- Reporting: Reports are essential for the monitoring and management of a quality system. Most systems come with canned reports. However, it is important to fully evaluate the reporting capabilities in detail. Enterprise quality management systems should allow you to easily modify existing reports and create new reports without changing source code or database settings. Reports should display real-time data and allow you to drill down into the report details.\n- Measurements & KPIs: Measurement or KPIs are goal-based reports. For example, you have a goal to respond to customer issues within 24 hours. Therefore, you would set up a measurement that tracks responses to that 24-hour goal. Ensure your system allows you to configure these types of reports and automatically notify you when goal thresholds are crossed.\n- Management Dashboards: A good management dashboard allows you to display a user’s work in one easy to read screen. Management dashboards display tasks, reports, and measurement. It helps manage progress, identify trends, monitor goals and be alerted to pending and late tasks.\nPillar 4: Compliance Enablement\nAlmost all industries have regulatory standards and requirements. A modern enterprise quality management system should have compliance built into the system. Compliance should not be an afterthought. For example, your industry may have regulatory requirements for how electronic signatures are handled or how security is controlled. Confirm that the software system you are using provides built-in compliance to these standards.\nAdditionally, it is important to configure enterprise quality management systems to guide users through collecting information required to comply with regulations and standards. In the image shown above, the audit form displays all of the questions required for a specific type of audit. This prompts the user through the correct set of steps for conducting the audit and managing any findings where audit criteria is not met.\nPillar 5: Culture of Quality & Compliance\nEstablishing a culture of quality and compliance, perhaps the most important quality management pillar, shows a commitment from the top that flows down throughout the rest of the organization. A quality system, no matter who well designed, cannot work if there is no visible management buy-in. The attributes of this pillar include:\n- Top-down commitment to quality and compliance\n- Active engagement and communication from management\n- Accountability by executive staff and management\nTop-down commitment means that adequate resources and budgets are committed for quality functions to be effectively performed. When employees see a lack of funding or emphasis on quality functions and systems, it sends a message that quality is not important. Alternatively, active engagement by management can drive a company’s commitment to quality. For example, recognition of quality initiatives and achievements help to build a culture of compliance. Visibility into quality improvements result in a stronger drive for continuous improvement within the company as well as for its customers and clients. Accountability means that company leaders are making decisions that are in the best interest of the customer as not strictly bottom-line driven.\nRegardless of industry or organizational complexity, these five pillars allow companies to form a solid foundation for any quality management system. These pillars are as important to a life science company as they are to an energy company. They apply equally to companies in aerospace, general manufacturing, automotive, or high tech industries.\nWhile establishing these five pillars does require investment, in the long run a company will grow faster and be more profitable when there is an effective enterprise quality management system in place.\nWant to dive deeper?

{"question":"Which fossil site is older - the Ediacara fossils in South Australia or the sponge-like fossils found by Princeton scientists?","answer":"The sponge-like fossils found by Princeton scientists are older. These fossils were found beneath a 635 million-year-old glacial deposit in South Australia and represent primitive sponge-like creatures that lived around 650 million years ago. The Ediacara fossils from the Flinders Ranges in South Australia date to the Ediacara Period, which was from 600 to 543 million years ago.","context":["Possible discovery of earliest animal life pushes back fossil record\nIn findings that push back the clock on the scientific world's thinking about when animal life appeared on Earth, Princeton scientists may have discovered the oldest fossils of animal bodies, suggesting that primitive sponge-like creatures were living in ocean reefs about 650 million years ago. The shelly fossils, found beneath a 635 million-year-old glacial deposit in South Australia, represent the earliest evidence of animal body forms in the current fossil record by at least 70 million years.\nPreviously, the oldest known fossils of hard-bodied animals were from two reef-dwelling organisms that lived about 550 million years ago -- Namacalathus, discovered in 2000 by John Grotzinger's group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Cloudina, first found in 1972 by Gerard Germs of the University of Cape Town, South Africa. Additionally, there are controversial fossils of soft-bodied animals that date to the latter part of the Ediacaran period between 577 and 542 million years ago. These fossils were first observed in the 1940s by Australian geologist Reginald Sprigg, and the oldest evidence to date of undisputed Ediacaran animals -- organisms called Kimberella -- was found in sediment about 555 million years old in Australia and Russia.\nPrinceton geosciences professor Adam Maloof and graduate student Catherine Rose happened upon the new fossils while working on a project focused on the severe ice age that marked the end of the Cryogenian period 635 million years ago. Their findings, published in the Aug. 17 issue of the journal Nature Geosciences, provide the first direct evidence that animal life existed before -- and probably survived -- the severe \"snowball Earth\" event known as the Marinoan glaciation that left much of the globe covered in ice at the end of the Cryogenian.\n\"We were accustomed to finding rocks with embedded mud chips, and at first this is what we thought we were seeing,\" Maloof said. \"But then we noticed these repeated shapes that we were finding everywhere -- wishbones, rings, perforated slabs and anvils. By the second year, we realized we had stumbled upon some sort of organism, and we decided to analyze the fossils. No one was expecting that we would find animals that lived before the ice age, and since animals probably did not evolve twice, we are suddenly confronted with the question of how some relative of these reef-dwelling animals survived the 'snowball Earth.'\"\nFind viewed as significant\n\"These scientists have found that animals may have appeared on Earth 90 million years earlier than previously known,\" said H. Richard Lane, program director for the Directorate for Geosciences of the National Science Foundation's Division of Earth Sciences, which funded the research. \"This is comparable to resetting modern times to begin during the late Cretaceous.\"\nAnalyzing the fossils turned out to be easier said than done, as the composition and location of the fossils made it such that they could not be removed from the surrounding rock using conventional techniques, nor could they be imaged using X-ray scanning techniques. This is because X-rays are only able to distinguish between materials with different densities, which is why they can be used to image bones that are inside the human body or buried within a rock. But the most ancient skeletal fossils are made not of bone, but of calcite -- the same material that makes up the rock matrix in which they are embedded. Therefore X-rays could not be used to \"illuminate\" the newly discovered fossils and the researchers had to develop and refine another method.\nMaloof, Rose and their collaborators teamed up with professionals at Situ Studio, a Brooklyn-based design and digital fabrication studio, to create three-dimensional digital models of two individual fossils that were embedded in the surrounding rock. As part of the process, team members shaved off 50 microns of sample at a time -- about half the width of a human hair -- and photographed the polished rock surface each time. The team ground and imaged nearly 500 slices of the rock.\nUsing specialized software techniques developed specifically for this project, the researchers then \"stacked\" the outlines on top of one another to create a complete three-dimensional model of the creature. The technique is similar to the way in which CAT scan technology combines a series of two-dimensional X-rays to create a three-dimensional image of the inside of the body. The technique that was developed served to automate the process -- turning a prohibitively time-consuming task into an efficient and effective method for fossil reconstruction.\n\"For Situ Studio, the most exciting aspect of this collaboration is that we were able to successfully employ knowledge developed within an architectural practice to help solve problems in an entirely different field -- applying design tools to spatial problems on a completely different scale,\" said Bradley Samuels, a founding partner of Situ Studio. \"It became an exercise in marrying disparate bodies of knowledge to address pressing questions in the geosciences.\"\nWhen they began the digital reconstruction process, the shape of some of the two-dimensional slices made the researchers suspect they might be dealing with the previously discovered Namacalathus, a goblet-shaped creature featuring a long body stalk topped with a hollow ball. But their model revealed irregularly shaped, centimeter-scale animals with a network of internal canals.\nThese critters looked nothing like Namacalathus.\nAfter considering a variety of alternatives, the researchers decided that the fossil organisms most closely resembled sponges -- simple filter-feeding animals that extract food from water as it flows through specialized body channels. Previously, the oldest known undisputed fossilized sponges were about 520 million years old, dating to the Cambrian Period.\nBut evidence has suggested that sponges appeared on the scene much earlier in Earth history. For example, scientists have conducted detailed analyses of genetic material in a wide range of organisms to create \"molecular clocks\" that suggest how long ago a given species evolved. According to these clocks, sponges existed millions of years before the Cambrian. This has been supported by the relatively recent discovery of lipid biomarkers -- essentially, traces of recalcitrant fats that resist degradation over millions of years -- in sedimentary rocks from Oman of nearly the same age as those studied by the Maloof group in Australia.\n\"For many years the great Marinoan ice age has formed a hard floor to the fossil record of animals, even though most molecular clocks suggest a deeper history, at least for sponges,\" said evolutionary biologist Andrew Knoll of Harvard University, who was not part of the research team. \"Adam and his students are digging deeper and finding that there is much to catch our attention in pre-glacial carbonate rocks … . I'm convinced that the structures Adam's group have found are not simply shards of material, formed and deposited by purely physical processes. That said, it isn't easy to be sure what they are. Adam's group has carefully spelled out the biological alternatives and built a reasonable case for interpreting the structures as sponge-like animals. At the very least, this should drive paleontologists back to the field to seek similar or better evidence in other rocks of comparable age.\"\nIn future research, Maloof and his collaborators intend to refine the three-dimensional digital reconstruction technique to automate and increase the speed of the process. This could have a significant impact on paleontology, enabling the analysis of myriad early fossils that are currently inaccessible to the tools of modern science.\nIn addition to Maloof and Rose, Princeton researchers on the team included geosciences professor Frederik Simons, former postdoctoral fellow Claire Calmet, Nan Yao, the director of the Imaging and Analysis Center in the Princeton Institute for the Science and Technology of Materials (PRISM), and PRISM senior research specialist Gerald Poirier. The team also included Douglas Erwin of the Smithsonian Institution and Samuels, Robert Beach, Basar Girit, Wesley Rozen, Sigfus Briedfjord and Aleksey Lukyanov of Situ Studio. The work was funded by the National Science Foundation.","Australia's fossil past\nAustralia, the world's oldest visible geology\nEdiacara fossils from the Flinders Ranges. Photograph courtesy of the Australian Heritage Council.\nA fossil is the impression of a living organism that has been preserved. Fossils are preserved in substances such as sediments, coal, tar, oil, amber, or frozen in ice. There are three main types of fossils: body, trace and chemical.\nAs well as body fossils, which are actual skeletal remains, there are impressions of soft animals, plants and footprints which have been left as mud hardened. Chemical fossils are the organic compounds and microscopic organisms that have left their mark in the rocks.\nLarge numbers of fossils indicate that an enormous number of plants and animals have lived on Earth since life evolved more than 3,500 million years ago.\nBecause of its relative isolation over millennia, Australia has a rich, unique fossil record, dating from approximately 3.2 billion years ago, close to when the Earth was stabilising its formation. Since separation of the former continent Gondwana, an almost continuous record of the distant past is present in Australia today. This includes Pleistocene era Aboriginal body fossils, many of which were removed and sent overseas. The repatriation of many of these human remains is now being negotiated.\nRiversleigh, north-west Queensland, one of the most important fossil sites in the world. Photograph courtesy of the Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities.\nAustralia has the world's best example of dinosaur tracks. At the heritage listed Dinosaur Stampede National Monument, near Winton, Queensland, it is possible to see where nearly 200 dinosaurs left about 30,000 footprints. Because of the likelihood of theft or damage, important fossil sites in Australia are protected, and often kept secret.\nThe Riversleigh fossil site, near Mount Isa Queensland, is recognised as one of the most important fossil sites in the world. Large, now extinct, crocodiles, carnivorous kangaroos and enormous birds are some of the unusual animals that have been identified and studied from fossils. Consequently, there are very few small mammal fossils at the Riversleigh site due to the large predators.The fossils are now displayed at the Riversleigh Fossil Centre. The Riversleigh and Narracoote (SA) fossil sites together form the World Heritage Australian Fossil Mammal Site. They are also on the National Heritage List.\nThe Darling Downs region contains fossilised remains of prehistoric megafauna - gigantic creatures such as large goannas, kangaroos and giant horned turtles. The megafauna lived during the Pleistocene epoch (1.8 million to 11,550 years BP), and included Diprotodon opatatum that grew as large as a rhinoceros and Thylacoleo carnifex, a marsupial lion.\nThe Nullarbor Plains also has a fossil site in an underground cavern where the skeletons of Thylacoleo and other species were discovered, such as giant wombats the size of cars, birds and a kangaroo with horns above its eyes.\nFossil finds have suggested the relatively recent arrival of marsupials. Fossils at Lightning Ridge reveal that 110 million years ago Australia supported a number of different monotremes (egg-laying mammals), but did not support any marsupials. The first evidence of marsupials in Australia comes from the 55 million-year-old fossil site at Murgon in southern Queensland.\nProfessor Michael Archer examining rocks at the Tedford locality, Lake Palankarinna Fossil Reserve, Tirari Desert, South Australia.\nThere are many eminent palaeontologists in Australia, including Geoffrey Archer (University of New South Wales), Malcolm Walter (Macquarie University, Neil Archbold (Deakin University), Neil Marshall, Alan Partridge, David Haig (University of Western Australia), John Laurie (Geoscience Australia), Dana Milder and John Mortimer.\nKey institutions include the Australian Museum, whose collection includes 'Eric', the opalised pliosaur from Coober Pedy. Both Museum Victoria and the South Australian Museum hold significant fossil collections. The Queensland Museum is responsible for collecting, describing and storing the rich fossil heritage of Queensland.\nGeological time periods\nPalaeontologists subdivide the four geological time periods that define geological events occurred in Earth's history, to reflect important apparent changes in flora and fauna.\nThe age of a fossil may be determined using isotope dating, but this is only accurate to within 50,000 years with a 500 year margin of error. The surrounding rock may also be dated in this way. This process is explained in detail by the Australian Museum.\nPrecambrian Era (more than 545 million years ago)\nVery little was known of life in this period until the discovery in 1946 of fossils of soft-bodied animals at Ediacara in the Flinders Ranges, South Australia. Since then, the oldest recorded life forms were discovered at North Pole Dome (near Marble Bar) in the Pilbara region of Western Australia. These microbes, known as stromatolites, have been estimated to be 3.2 billion years old. According to the Australian Centre for Astrobiology, the proximity of the age of these microbes is significantly close to the stabilisation of the planet after its formation.\nEdiacara Period (600 to 543 million years ago)\nThe enormous importance of the Ediacara find led to the naming of this geological period after the area. Many of the fossils may now been seen in the South Australian Museum. Some of the organisms seem to be similar to living samples. Others appear to be extinct today.\nPalaeozoic Era (543 to 248 million years ago)\nThis era is usually divided into six periods. Much of the highland area of Victoria dates from this period. Museum Victoria records that most of these rocks were deposited in an ancient sea.\nDicynodon skull from the Palaeozoic Era. Photograph courtesy of Museum Victoria.\nThe Cambrian Period (543 to 490 million years ago) is also known as the 'Age of Trilobites'. Beginning with life in the sea, it also marks the first signs of vertebrate life forms. The Ordovician Period (490 to 443 million years ago) is noted for Graptolites, a form of invertebrate plankton. It is in the Silurian Period (443 to 417 million years ago) that the first evidence of land-based plants and animals were found. Land tracks of a giant water scorpion called Eurypterid have been found in Kalbarri, Western Australia.\nDuring the Devonian Period (417 to 354 million years ago) there was an explosion of life forms including fish, amphibians, insects, spiders, ferns and seed-ferns. The 'Coal Age' or Carboniferous Period (354 to 290 million years ago) refers to the period when forests flourished. These forests formed our present coal deposits. During the Permian Period (290 to 248 million years ago) fossil deposits rich in mammal, reptile and insect specimens, as well as a diverse number of plants, were formed. The era ended with the third, and most catastrophic, extinction event in recorded history.\nMesozoic Era (248 to 65 million years ago)\nMuttaburrasaurus langdoni, named after the town of Muttaburra in Queensland. Image courtesy of the Queensland Museum.\nSince the discovery of the first fossils of this era, it has become the most publicised and popularised of all. It saw the rise and fall of the largest creatures to live on this planet. This was the 'Age of the Dinosaurs'. The era begins with the Triassic Period (248 to 206 million years ago). A large number of fossils have been found in the Arcadia Formation in the Rewan area of Queensland, the Blina Shale in Western Australia, the Knocklofty Formation near Hobart, Tasmania and the Sydney Basin.\nDuring the Jurassic Period (206 to 144 million years ago) Australia was home to the Rhoetosaurus, one of the world's oldest sauropods. The Cretaceous Period (144 to 65 million years ago) is marked by the discovery of Australia's largest dinosaur, 'Elliot' in 1999 and the Muttaburrasaurus, named after the town of Muttaburra in Queensland. The world's best example of dinosaur tracks is also to be found in Queensland, discovered near Winton in the 1960s.\nCainozoic Era (65 million years ago to present day)\nThere has been much recent activity in the discovery of fossils of this era. There are two time sub-divisions.\nThe Tertiary Sub-era (65 to 1.78 million years ago) has been revealed through the exploration of several sites. Fossils found at Lightning Ridge suggest that 110 million years ago Australia supported a number of different monotremes, but did not support any marsupials. Marsupials appear to have evolved in the northern hemisphere about 95 million years ago and spread to South America.\nThe first evidence we have of marsupials in Australia comes from the 55 million-year-old fossil site at Murgon in southern Queensland. This Murgon site has yielded a range of marsupial fossils, many with strong South American connections. At Murgon there is also evidence of a placental mammal, known as a condylarth. Placental mammals were also found in North America and South America at this time.\nAfter decades of work a collaboration between more than 80 scientists at a number of key fossil sites in Australia an amazing array of strange, unexpected beasts are being discovered. Undoubtedly the key sites in this understanding are Riversleigh in north-west Queensland (added to the World Heritage List in 1994) and Naracoorte in South Australia. The fossils from Riversleigh represent an almost complete story of the evolution of Australia's terrestrial ecosystems over the past 25 million years. Riversleigh has been recognised as one of the most important fossil sites in the world.\nThe Quaternary division (1.78 million years ago to present day) marks the beginnings of Homo sapiens. The age of the origins of humans in Australia is hotly debated by the experts, but skeletal remains like those at Lake Mungo in New South Wales, by Jim Bowler in February 1974, have been dated between 15,000 and 50,000 years old. John Mulvaney's work at Kenniff Cave between 1960 and 1963, established Aboriginal occupation of Australia many thousands of years into the Pleistocene (Quaternary).\nPleistocene epoch (1.8 million to 11,550 years BP) and Aboriginal body fossils\nA cast of the skeleton of the giant Pleistocene wallaby, Protemnodon. Photograph courtesy of the South Australian Museum.\nAustralian Aboriginal body fossils\nGreat care is now taken to balance palaeontological and archaeological interest in Aboriginal heritage and material culture with protecting the rights of Aboriginal peoples and their sacred burial sites. Aboriginal material culture is often part of a study program with palaeontology. Previously, palaeontological study of Australian Aboriginal body fossils involved the practice of scientific investigation of Aboriginal remains. These remains had often been removed from burial sites and were stored in boxes and bags in museums, both overseas and in Australia.\nIn 2002, ATSIC identified more than 50 institutions in 18 countries which acknowledged holding Aboriginal remains in their collections.\nIndigenous remains held in museums overseas\nThe Royal College of Surgeons became the first English institution to hand over Aboriginal remains in 2002. Among them were said to be the hair and skin of Truganini, a Tasmanian Aboriginal leader, who died in 1878. Other Aboriginal leaders such as Pemulwuy, a Bura man of the Eora people Sydney, and Yagan of the Tondaryo Ballaruk clan of the Nyungar people of south-western Australia, had their heads severed and pickled. It is Aboriginal belief that while skeletal remains are incomplete, the person's spirit remains earthbound, unable to continue its eternal journey (Ken Colbung, 2003).\nIn 2007, Britain's Natural History Museum and the Tasmanian Aboriginal Centre finally reached a conclusion to the 20 year negotiations for the repatriation of human remains. The remains of 17 Tasmanian Aborigines were reclaimed from the museum. The museum, which had wanted to conduct scientific tests on the bones before they were returned, dropped this demand. The two parties agreed to share responsibility for DNA already taken from the remains by storing the material in Tasmania.\nIn 2009 the remains of 17 Indigenous Australians were handed over to a delegation of Aboriginal people from the Kimberley region in Western Australia and Moreton Bay in Queensland at a ceremony in Austria.\nA traditional smoking ceremony was performed by Kimberley men, Terry Murray and Tom Lawford to cleanse the remains in preparation for their journey home. The remains from the Goorenpul community of Moreton Bay, Queensland were handed to community representative Jody Coghill. The Pathology and Natural History Museum in Vienna handed over the remains. Some of the remains will be brought back to the National Museum of Australia.\nThe return of remains has also been initiated by Australian museums. Recently, the skeleton of an Aboriginal man, Dick Cubadjee, a Warumangu man, was returned to his descendents for burial in his traditional country near Tennant Creek. Cubadjee acted as a tracker and interpreter for explorer David Lindsay in the 1880s.\nIn 2005, the Australian Museum and the National Museum of Australia returned the remains of 11 adults and 3 children, members of the Ku-ring-gai clan, near Manly, whose bones had been displayed for more than a century. The remains were repatriated to a site which was close to where they lived in Manly, in negotiation with the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Metropolitan Aboriginal Land Council. In a private ceremony, the bones were wrapped in paperbark and smoking ceremonies were conducted to accompany the burials.\nRepatriation of and respect for Indigenous remains\nToday, a balance is sought between the needs as defined by scientific investigation and the needs of the descendants of Aboriginal people whose bodily remains were removed to museums as body fossils, to allow these people to 'rest in peace'.\nMore than 1,000 Aboriginal ancestral remains are held in museums around the world.

{"question":"What are the main differences between pediatric physical therapy and aquatic therapy for kids?","answer":"Pediatric physical therapy and aquatic therapy have distinct approaches and environments. Pediatric physical therapy typically occurs in a clinic setting where therapists create a welcoming environment, play games, and work on developmental milestones like crawling, jumping, running, and walking. They focus on building strength, motor control, and independence through activities that may involve role-playing as pirates or athletes. In contrast, aquatic therapy takes place in a pool environment, using water properties like buoyancy and hydrostatic pressure to promote movement and balance. The aquatic environment naturally reduces gravity's effects, allows for unique positioning and movements not possible on land, and provides enhanced sensory input. Both approaches aim to improve children's functional abilities, but aquatic therapy specifically leverages water's physical properties to achieve therapeutic goals.","context":["One of the benefits of being a pediatric physical therapist is the relationship the therapist can build with their young patients. Some children may need physical therapy for an extended amount of time throughout their childhood. This allows the therapist and child to form a special relationship based on trust and compassion.\nAs pediatric physical therapists, we have mastered the ability to create a welcoming and friendly environment for the children we treat. The child’s needs always drive the treatment, which change as they grow. When we treat infants and toddlers, we focus much of our attention on setting up the environment, encouraging the children to move in such a way as to meet their gross motor needs. We often work on the child’s development, helping them to learn how to crawl, jump, run or even walk for the first time. These are exciting milestones that we get to be a part of. It’s so rewarding to see how proud the parents are when a child takes a step for the first time. Parents grab their phones to take pictures and sometimes become a little teary eyed.\nAs the children get older, we play fun games that require them to move in and out of desired postures for strength, stabilization, flexibility, agility and endurance. We build strong muscles, powerful hearts, improved motor control, healthy habits, and great friendships. It is fun for the therapist to let our inner child out. Often we are sillier than the children – we come up with creative and entertaining ways to achieve our desired goals. In the same day we can be a pirate, a fairy, an airplane, a major league baseball player, a rock star, a coach, a teacher, and a shoulder to cry on. Together with parents, caregivers, and friends we are the loudest cheerleaders and the warmest huggers.\nWhen children reach school age, particularly as they approach middle school, many of them can become burned out on therapy. They are tired of the clinic, the hard work, and being different from their friends. It’s a challenging time, but it can also be the most rewarding. It’s at this point that many children begin to take ownership of their therapy. Because we have developed a trusting relationship over the years, we are able to have honest conversations with them. The children tell us their concerns and their frustrations and we work together to overcome them in a way the children can relate to and enjoy. Sometimes that means revolving everything around basketball, sometimes it’s cranking up the music and hosting “Dance Party Friday!” It’s wonderful to hear the children say, “Look, I can hop on this leg now,” “I wheeled my chair all the way to the cafeteria by myself,” or “I was able to play a full game of soccer today!” They begin to realize that they’re working together as a team with their physical therapist and parents to become stronger and achieve their goals, while having fun at the same time.\nFinally, as high school comes around and college and careers loom, we focus the majority of our attention on maximizing independence. Participation is no longer just about the classroom and the playground, it’s about adult life, health, work, and relationships. The physical therapist helps the adolescent enter adulthood with a toolbox full of strategies, exercises, and confidence to help him reach his full potential.\nAs we work with the kids throughout their lives it feels as if we have become part a part of their family, and they a part of ours. There is a special bond that is created over the years between the child and the physical therapist and we are so grateful for that feeling each and every day.\nMaureen Suhr is a doctor of physical therapy and board certified pediatric specialist. She is assistant manager of the Hospital for Special Surgery Rehabilitation Network.","By: Sam Develli, OTR/L\nWhat is Aquatic Therapy?\nAquatic Therapy is the provision of therapeutic activities and exercises in the aquatic environment in order to promote functional improvements on land. In the adult population, this might include exercises after hip or knee replacements or pain reduction/muscular relaxation for back or shoulder pain. In the pediatric population, our focus shifts to a focus on achievement of developmental milestones and fostering age-appropriate skill acquisition.\nFor our pediatric clients, we focus on the utilization of the affordances offered by the pool (i.e. gravity reduction, enhanced sensory input, etc) to promote the skills mentioned above. The aquatic environment is a naturally motivating and rewarding environment with its typical association with ‘fun’ and ‘play’. Additionally, it provides a good break from the typical clinic environment by moving intervention to a community-based site, therefore providing intervention in a child’s natural environment.\nIn the realm of aquatic therapy, physical therapy is the more commonly discussed and understood intervention. Aquatic physical therapy utilizes the physical properties of water to promote gait, improve balance, address myofascial restrictions provide muscular strengthening and endurance. Physical therapists are experts in movement, with great knowledge of the muscular and neurologic systems, and take advantage of the affordances offered by buoyancy and surface tension to decrease weight-bearing and therefore ease movement to provide the just-right level of challenge. They can also adjust the levels of resistance to activities with movements in the aquatic medium. The hydrostatic pressure aids in balance and providing a delayed requirement in righting reactions, giving longer time for learning. The aquatic environment also allows for positioning and movement of children that is not possible on land, leading to a variety of manual practices that can ONLY be accomplished in the water. As movement is possible in many planes, not just upright, many of our clients can move independently in the water in ways not possible on land.\nAs additional research is released demonstrating the overarching benefits of the aquatic environment on occupational achievements, occupational therapy has embraced the use of the aquatic environment to deliver holistic, evidence-based interventions in a child’s natural environment in order to enhance skill development and advancement on land. Aquatic occupational therapy also utilizes the physical properties of water to provide a just-right level of challenge, but approaches skills through a very different lens. Occupational therapists are experts in daily occupations, the sensory system, and task analysis to promote achievement of valued activities (i.e. occupations). Therefore, we utilize the affordances of the aquatic environment to develop the motor patterns required to achieve valued occupations and to reduce symptoms which interfere with occupational achievement (i.e. tactile sensitivity, behaviors, hyperactivity, etc).\nA few of the models of practice that we pull from include Halliwick, task-based, motor learning, Ai Chi, and reflex integration.\nWhy is it special?\nFor children with reduced movement abilities, perceptual development is significantly impacted, which contributes to difficulties in accomplishing motor skills and developing independence in daily living skills, play, and school participation. Even in the presence of passive movement, normal perceptual and visuomotor development will not be obtained without active motion of the body.\nThe aquatic environment provides a beneficial environment that allows for greater freedom of movement, and the development of active motion that is so vital to development of underlying skills that contribute to occupational independence. Hydrodynamic principles such as buoyancy and turbulence help increase reaction time to more adequately actively move the body and develop these core skills.\nAdditionally, the properties of the water provide a number of benefits on symptom reduction, allowing for far more sustained independence and growth in everyday life skills as compared to land-based therapy alone. The support provided from buoyancy helps relieve pain and tension, and offsets the effect of gravity on the body. Further, the aquatic environment reduces spasticity, improves head control, strengthens weak muscles, increases joint range of motion, improves balance and coordination, and encourages participation in functional activities.\nThe activities that can be attained in the aquatic environment that are unable to attain at present on land help complement our land-based goals and contributes to overall developmental skill training as it relates to our functional land-based goals. According to physicians Andrew Cole and Bruce Becker, “the gravity-friendly aquatic environment promotes enhanced opportunities for movement activity, enabling children to learn desired motor skills with increased range of motion, fluidity, and motor control. Children often experience success with motor skills in the water first and then later generalize those skills to land” (Comprehensive Aquatic Therapy, 2004).\nWho can it help?\nPediatric aquatic therapy, whether delivered through physical or occupational therapy, is beneficial for a wide variety of children across developmental and skill levels. Pediatric physical therapists often see individuals with musculoskeletal or neurologic conditions such as cerebral palsy, hypotonia, muscular dystrophy, scoliosis, spina bifidia, spinal muscular atrophy, concussions/traumatic brain injuries, and spinal cord injuries. Pediatric occupational therapists also commonly see individuals with cerebral palsy and hypotonia in the aquatic environment. Additional common diagnoses seen include autism spectrum disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorders, fine motor coordination difficulties, upper limb/bilateral coordination difficulties, visual-motor deficits, behavioral or mental health conditions (i.e. anxiety), and developmental delays.\nHowever, this is not an exhaustive list of conditions that we have worked with in the aquatic environment or that would benefit from aquatic interventions.

{"question":"Could you explain how both CML and CLL affect the body's ability to fight infections and maintain normal blood cell counts, comparing their impact on the immune system?","answer":"Both CML and CLL impair the body's immune system and blood cell production, but through different mechanisms. In CML, the Philadelphia chromosome translocation leads to the formation of abnormal cells that affect the bone marrow's ability to produce normal blood cells. In CLL, the abnormal lymphocytes crowd out normal white blood cells and don't fight infection themselves, leading to a higher risk of infection (neutropenia). In both conditions, as the disease progresses, the bone marrow fills with leukemia cells, leaving less room for healthy red cells and platelets. This can result in various health problems, including anemia (from too few red cells) and bleeding or bruising (from thrombocytopenia, too few platelets).","context":["Chronic myeloid leukemia in patient with the Klinefelter syndrome\nSummary. Aim: Genetic inborn along with acquired diseases arise due to the lesions in genome of multipotent hematopoietic stem cells. The aim was to study an influence of constitutional anomaly, Klinefelter syndrome, and additional structural rearrangements on the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeted therapy efficacy. Material and Methods: We describe a 32-year-old male patient with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) who was detected to have sex chromosomal abnormality during evaluation for Philadelphia chromosome. Results: At diagnosis of CML, two clones were detected by standard cytogenetic investigation of bone marrow cells: 1) clone with translocation t(9;22)(q34;q11), with two sex X chromosomes and absence sex chromosome Y; 2) clone with t(9;22) and unbalanced t(Y;20)(q11;q13). Analysis of blast transformed lymphocytes from peripheral blood showed karyotype 47,XXY. Monitoring of targeted therapy with second generation inhibitor of BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase indicated a cytogenetic remission and absence of BCR-ABL1 fusion signals after 11 months. Conclusions: Absence of translocation t(9;22)(q34;q11) in blast transformed T-lymphocytes at diagnosis of CML evidences that this translocation may appear not only at the level of multipotent haemopoietic cell progenitors but also may have oligo lineage myeloid origin. Presence of additional structural chromosomal abnormality in the clone with t(9;22)(q34;q11) does not affect the efficacy of therapy with the use of second generation BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor.\nSubmitted: July 14, 2016.\n*Correspondence: Fax: +38 (044) 4402722\nAbbreviations used: BM — bone marrow; CML — chronic myeloid leukemia; KS — Klinefelter syndrome; PB — peripheral blood; PHA — phytohemagglutinin.\nChronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is an acquired disease that arises due to the lesions in genome of multipotent hematopoietic stem cell, and makes up approximately 14% of all types of leukemias. CML is a disease of middle age with manifestation peak in 40–50 years old. The cause of the disease is not currently established, but in the history of some patients the chemotherapy and radiation have been registered [1, 2]. CML cytogenetic feature is the translocation t(9;22)(q34;q11) with the breakpoints in chromosome 9 in the band q34 (ABL gene) and chromosome 22 in the band q11 (BCR gene). The latter was designated the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph՛-chromosome) . As a result of this translocation, two chimeric genes are formed: ABL1-BCR on chromosome 9 and BCR-ABL1 on chromosome 22. Considering that the anomaly occurs at an early precursor of hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues, it is believed that this rearrangement might be registered in all bone marrow (BM) cells, including the peripheral blood (PB) T-lymphocytes stimulated by phytohemagglutinin (PHA) . Other authors indicate lack of translocation t(9;22)(q34;q11) in T-lymphocytes .\nThe use of inhibitors of BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase allows achieving both the clinical and hematologic, and also long-term cytogenetic and molecular genetic remission. This also concerns to the cases of variant translocations t(9;22) and additional abnormalities in the clone with t(9;22) in BM cells at diagnosis of CML [2, 6].\nTo confirm the genetic remission following the therapy with inhibitors of BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase, cytogenetic and molecular genetic control is always required. Achievement of the cytogenetic remission in 3 months of treatment with first generation BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors as well as molecular genetic remission (one abnormal cell in 105 of BM cells) during the twelve months therapy, are considered as the gold standard of effective CML therapy .\nKlinefelter syndrome (KS) is the most abundant anomaly of sex chromosomes in men occuring in 1:500 cases . The classic form of KS is described as 47,XXY. However, sometimes the increase in sex chromosome X number up to four copies and sex chromosome Y up to two copies, or mosaic form 47,XXY/46,XY appearance are reported . The cases of CML registered in patients with KS are quite rare [10–14]. Among these cases, two patients are described in whom the effectiveness of BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors-based therapy was assessed. In one of these cases, the patient remained in complete hematological and major molecular remission after 2 years of the therapy with first generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor , while in the other case no response to the same inhibitor was achieved and persistent molecular genetic alterations were documented during the therapy with the II generation inhibitor .\nWe, therefore, aimed to study an influence of the constitutional anomaly, KS, and additional structural rearrangements on the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeted therapy efficacy.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nThe patient D., 32-year-old male, was referred to hematologist for the first time in October 2013 complaining of the expressed weakness, skin pallor and weight loss during the year (height 175 cm, weight 104 kg). The patient gave written informed consent for the publication of his data analyses. Primary observation showed that the patient had narrow shoulders and wide hip. The PB contained 126.5•109/l leukocytes and 39.0 g/l hemoglobin. Spleen size measured by ultrasound investigation of peritoneum was 60×120 mm. To diagnose the patient, the sternum puncture has been done along with the BM morphological evaluation and further cytogenetic investigation for confirmation of the probable CML diagnosis. BM and PB cell counts are presented in the Table.\nTable. BM and PB cells indexes\nFor cytogenetic study of BM cells, the slides of metaphase chromosomes were prepared according to the conventional method followed by GTG staining. Considering that besides classic translocation t(9;22)(q34;q11) typical for CML, mosaics of sex chromosomes was detected in patient, both the molecular genetic assay (FISH) on BM cells and karyotyping of PB blast transformed cells were performed. To define the nature of additional sex chromosome X, the conventional cytogenetics of blast transformed lymphocytes was carried out after 72 h cultivation of PB and addition of PHA in the medium. Slides were stained by GTG-method. Presence of clonal chromosomal abnormalities was described according to ISCN 2013, when two or more metaphase plates had identical structural or additional (trisomy) chromosome abnormalities and also in appearance of three or more metaphase plates with identical chromosomes monosomies . The presence of translocation t(9;22)(q34;q11) during the targeted therapy was revealed by conventional cytogenetics and after fluorescence staining per se (on slide) in interphase nuclei (i-FISH). i-FISH assay was carried out on interphase cell nuclei after 24 h cultivation. The probe set Vysis LSI BCR/ABL Dual Color, Dual Fusion Translocation Probe (Abbott, USA) was used.\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nStandard cytogenetic study on BM suspension cells revealed mosaic karyotype consisting of three clones: 46,XX,-Y,t(9;22)(q34;q11) / 46,XX,t(Y;20)(q11;q13),t(9;22)(q34;q11),-der(Y)t(Y;20)(q11;q13)/4n± . The first clone with two sex X chromosomes, absence of sex Y chromosome and translocation t(9;22)(q34;q11) was detected in 15 metaphase plates (Fig. 1). The second clone with two sex X chromosomes, unbalanced structural rearrangement, namely translocation between chromosomes Y and 20 and loss of derivative chromosome due to translocation between chromosomes Y and 20 was detected in three metaphase plates (Fig. 2), and the third clone (near tetraploid) was detected in two metaphase plates. The results allowed us to suspect that the patient might have innate genetic disease, the KS. Moreover, it is known that during formation of abnormal karyotypes the losses of sex chromosomes could occur. Therefore, cytogenetic study on blast transformed PB lymphocytes was carried out to confirm the constitutional nature of additional sex chromosome X. The study showed karyotype 47,XXY in 20 analyzed metaphase plates (Fig. 3). That was confirmed by cytogenetics as KS. The results suggest the involvement of sex chromosome Y in the formation of two abnormal clones with translocation t(9;22). In the first clone with a translocation t(9;22), a loss of sex chromosome Y was observed; in the second clone with a translocation t(9;22), the unbalanced translocation was registered involving sex chromosome Y and chromosome 20 with the loss of derivative chromosome Y, which was formed as a result of this translocation. The episode of the formation of different clones in BM cells karyotype at CML diagnosis in patient with the KS is reported for the first time. The absence of t(9;22) in PHA blast transformed PB T-lymphocytes at diagnosis of CML has questioned the previous statement that this translocation can be detected in lymphocytes. Perhaps in some cases the translocation could occur not only at the level of multipotent hematopoietic progenitor cell but also may have oligo lineage myeloid origin.\nFig. 1. Cytogenetic analysis of BM cells shows a clone with two sex chromosomes X and balanced translocation t(9;22)(q34;q11)\nFig. 2. Cytogenetic analysis of BM cells shows a clone with one sex chromosome X, balanced translocation t(9;22)(q34;q11) and unbalanced translocation t(Y;20)(q11;q13)\nSince November 2013, the patient was scheduled to hydroxyurea chemotherapy at a dose of 4000 mg/day; there was a reduction in the leucocyte count to normal value while anemia remained.\nFig. 3. Conventional cytogenetics shows karyotype 47,XXY in blast transformed T-lymphocytes of PB\nSince December 2014, the therapy with the II generation inhibitor of BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase at a dose of 600 mg/day has been prescribed, which is still continued. As a result of the treatment, the patient recovered to normal PB and myelogram parameters, spleen size reduced to 100/60 mm on ultrasound examination, and significant increase in weight (125 kg) was observed. Cytogenetic and molecular cytogenetic monitoring of the therapy effectiveness was conducted in 11 months. Analysis of metaphase chromosomes in BM cells has revealed the karyotype containing additional sex chromosome X: 47,XXY (in 20 metaphase plates). Simultaneously, iFISH assay was carried out on 200 interphase BM nuclei, and registered an absence of fusion signals of BCR-ABL1 and ABL1-BCR formed due to t(9;22) (Fig. 4).\nFig. 4. Molecular cytogenetic study shows normal distribution of BCR and ABL1 signals\nThus, in patient with CML in the presence of constitutional chromosomal abnormality, KS, two independent clones were recorded in BM cells at diagnosis: translocation t(9;22) in clone with two sex chromosomes X and without sex chromosome Y, and translocation t(9;22) and unbalanced structural rearrangement involving sex chromosome Y. The molecular cytogenetic remission was achieved following 11 months of the treatment with second generation inhibitor of BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase. Absence of translocation t(9;22)(q34;q11) in blast transformed T-lymphocytes may indicate that not all hematopoietic cells carry this abnormality. The data would be important to assess the effectiveness of targeted therapy for patients with the KS in the presence of additional structural abnormalities in clone with translocation t(9;22).\nWe thank Prof. Danylo Gluzman, RE Kavetsky IEPOR of the NAS of Ukraine, for the confirmation of the diagnosis and disease stage.

It is also known as chronic lymphatic leukaemia.\nCLL develops when the body makes too many abnormal white blood cells. Because they live too long or multiply too quickly, there will be large numbers circulating in the blood. They crowd out normal white blood cells and don’t fight infection themselves, so there can be a higher risk of infection (neutropenia).\nAs leukaemia progresses, the bone marrow fills with leukaemia cells and there is less room for healthy red cells and platelets to be produced. This may cause various health problems, such as anaemia (from too few red cells) or bleeding or bruising (from thrombocytopenia, too few platelets).\nLearn more about:\n- The difference between chronic and acute leukaemia\n- Who gets CLL\n- What causes CLL\n- Blood cells and leukaemia cells\n- The lymphatic system\nWhat is the difference between chronic and acute leukaemia?\nWhile all types of leukaemia start in the bone marrow and affect white blood cell production, they are grouped according to which type of white blood cell is affected (lymphoid or myeloid), whether there are abnormalities in the bone marrow, and how quickly the disease develops.\nChronic leukaemia usually affects partly immature cells, appears gradually, and develops slowly over months to years.\nAcute leukaemia affects fully immature cells, occurs suddenly, and develops quickly. See Acute Leukaemia for more information.\nWho gets CLL?\nEach year in Australia, about 3700 people are diagnosed with a form of leukaemia, and more than 1700 of these cases are chronic leukaemia.\nCLL is the most common type of chronic leukaemia, with about 1400 people diagnosed each year. CLL is twice as likely to occur in men than in women and is very rare in children.\nWhat causes CLL?\nChronic leukaemia is caused by changes to one or more of the genes (DNA) that control the growth and development of blood cells. These changes happen over time, but it is not known why they occur in some people and not others. The exact cause of CLL is not yet understood.\nSome people have genetic abnormalities that can lead to CLL. These genetic defects are not usually inherited, but there are rare cases where CLL may occur more commonly in families. If you are worried about this, talk to your doctor, who may refer you to a genetic counsellor.\nBlood cells and leukaemia cells\nBlood is pumped around your body to provide oxygen and nutrients to your tissues, and to remove waste products. It is made up of blood cells carried in a clear fluid called plasma. The three main types of blood cells have specific functions:\n- red blood cells – carry oxygen around the body\n- white blood cells – fight infection\n- platelets – help the blood clot\nAll three types of blood cells have a limited life span and need to be continually replaced. Most are made in the bone marrow, which is the spongy part in the centre of the bones.\nThe bone marrow contains stem cells. These are unspecialised blood cells that first develop into immature cells known as blast cells. Normally, the blast cells then become mature red or white blood cells or platelets and carry out their set functions.\nThere are two families of stem cells:\n- myeloid stem cells – develop into myeloblast cells and then into red blood cells, most types of white blood cells, and platelets\n- lymphoid stem cells – develop into lymphoblast cells and then into lymphocytes, which are a type of white blood cell.\nIf myeloblast or lymphoblast cells do not mature properly or if there are too many in the blood, it can cause leukaemia.\nHow blood cells are made\nIn leukaemia, blast cells never develop into mature white blood cells. These abnormal blast cells are also called leukaemia cells.\nThe lymphatic system\nThe lymphatic system works with the white blood cells to protect the body against infection. A large network of thin tubes (lymph vessels) carries a clear fluid called lymph. The lymph travels to and from areas of lymph tissue, including the lymph nodes, spleen and liver. When leukaemia causes abnormal white blood cells to build up, the lymph tissue becomes swollen.\nLymph nodes – Also known as lymph glands, these are small bean-shaped structures that are found in the neck, underarms, chest, abdomen and groin. The lymph nodes filter out toxins and help fight infections, and also produce some blood cells.\nSpleen – This is an organ on the left side of the body under the ribs. It clears out old or damaged blood cells.\nLiver – This large organ removes toxins, controls sugar levels, and stores vitamins."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:0f8652d3-9678-4f82-94ae-800f64cdad62>","<urn:uuid:70228508-adbf-4cd7-b6ca-be6d947c510b>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Could you explain how both coastal restoration projects and fishing regulations are being used to protect endangered species in different parts of the United States?","answer":"Coastal restoration projects and fishing regulations are being implemented differently across the U.S. In Rhode Island, the restoration of Ninigret Pond's salt marshes aims to bring back native species and protect communities from coastal flooding. The project involved innovative dredging techniques and extensive planting of native vegetation, with Save the Bay monitoring the return of bird and fish species. In contrast, on the California coast, protection efforts focus on regulations and legal action against harmful fishing practices. A lawsuit challenges the Trump administration's permits for longline fishing, which threatens endangered sea turtles and Guadalupe fur seals. This fishing method was previously banned in 2004 to protect sea turtles, and scientists predict Pacific leatherback sea turtles could face extinction within 20 years if not properly protected.","context":["Restoring Ninigret Coastal Salt Pond Helps Protect Coastline\nThe coast of Rhode Island is home to gorgeous beaches, charming seaside towns, coastal wetlands, and a unique ecological feature called “coastal salt ponds,” or wetland estuaries that provide valuable habitat for an array of wildlife.\nNinigret Pond in Charles Town, Rhode Island is the state’s largest coastal salt pond. The Pond and its surrounding salt marshes are a resource situated between the residents of Rhode Island and the cold waters of the Atlantic Ocean, serving as a natural buffer to storms.\nSeveral years ago, in 2014, scientists studying the area observed that the salt marshes at Ninigret Pond were starting to drown, essentially transforming them into mud flats. Funding from the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation’s Hurricane Sandy Coastal Resiliency Fund made it possible for the Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Council to step in and work to restore and enhance the existing salt marsh in an effort to bring back native species as well as protect the community from coastal flooding.\nThe CRMC, a Rhode Island state agency, and its partners developed a plan to use sediment from the nearby Charlestown Breachway to build up the elevation of the marsh to create a new surface to restore the coastal salt pond.\nCaitlin Chaffee, Project Manager for the Rhode Island CRMC, said the project “started to look a whole lot worse at first, before it started to look better.”\n“This is a new technique, a new approach to marsh restoration for us,” Chaffee said. “There were a lot of hurdles we faced in permitting.”\nThe contractor for the project, JF Brennan Company, dredged the waterway and deposited the dredged materials on the marsh throughout December 2016 into January 2017. They then spread the materials out over the marsh and leveled the new surface.\n“In the past, when we think about human impact on marshes we are talking about marshes that have been filled and we want to remove the filling,” Chaffee said. “We want to undo the human impacts. This project is more intensive, and in some ways, goes against our traditional thinking.”\nTeams of volunteers from Save the Bay came to Ninigret Pond to plant thousands of native plants, sourced from the New England Wildflower Society, on the newly deposited material on the marsh.\n“It’s been a great opportunity for us to engage volunteers and educate them on the importance of coastal marshes,” said Wenley Ferguson of Save the Bay.\nSave the Bay has been involved in the monitoring and adaptive management of the upgraded marsh. Ferguson lead a team to build a drainage network in the salt marsh to allow groundwater and precipitation to flow out of the marsh.\nSave the Bay volunteers have spent the last six weeks planting approximately 23,000 plants, adding to the 48,000 beach grass plants that were planted last year.\n“These dune grasses have helped to stabilize the sand,” Ferguson said. “This spring, we are re-defining some of the drainage channels and grading the salt marsh surface. We are working a lot on the adaptive management component of the project.”\nFerguson said, “a number of the grasses have recolonized in a multitude of places, “but only where the drainage is good,” Ferguson said. “These marsh grasses don’t want to grow with their roots in water.”\nIt was essential for Chaffee and the team to understand the water levels and vegetation patterns at Ninigret Pond before the restoration project started.\n“We used a lot of information and a lot of data to come up with the project design,” Chaffee said. “Any natural system is very complex and there are a lot of processes at work.”\nThe dredging technique used at Ninigret Pond is common for marsh restoration work in Louisiana, but this project was the first of its kind in New England. Chaffee is now touring the area educating conservationists on the technique. “Everyone is really interested in our results,” Chafee said.\nThe team from Save the Bay is managing teams of volunteers who are monitoring the results of the restoration. They are recording bird and fish species spotted at Ninigret Pond, as well as the tidal flow in the area. “Things are really coming back and it’s exciting to see,” said Ferguson.\n“Save the Bay has been an invaluable partner for us,” Chaffee said.\n“We love having the opportunity to demonstrate the benefits of coastal restoration,” said Ferguson. “Our volunteers get to see new species each time they spend time with us at the site, and that’s really special. It’s really an amazing volunteer effort.”\nRead this story as it originally appeared here: https://patch.com/rhode-island/newport/restoring-ninigret-coastal-salt-pond-helps-protect-coastline","For Immediate Release\nJune 6, 2019\nPress Contacts: Catherine Kilduff, Center for Biological Diversity, (530) 304-7258, CKilduff@BiologicalDiversity.org\nTodd Steiner, Turtle Island Restoration Network, (415) 488-8752, TSteiner@SeaTurtles.org\nLawsuit Challenges Trump Permits for Longline Fishery Off California Coast\nSAN FRANCISCO— The Center for Biological Diversity and Turtle Island Restoration Network sued the Trump administration today for permitting a new longline fishery in the Pacific Ocean.\nThe fishery, authorized in May by the National Marine Fisheries Service, would operate off California despite a federal ban on longline gear created in 2004 to protect sea turtles. Longlines stretch up to 60 miles, with 1,000 hooks intended to catch swordfish and tuna. This fishing will threaten endangered leatherback sea turtles, as well as olive ridley and loggerhead sea turtles and Guadalupe fur seals.\n“Leatherback sea turtles need to catch a break, not a longline hook,” said Catherine Kilduff, a Center senior attorney. “Californians demand more selective and sustainable fishing for swordfish. But the indiscriminate longlines authorized by the Trump administration will hook, injure and drown endangered species off our coast.”\n“This is basically the same fishery the agency outlawed fifteen years ago, and the same agency is using a backdoor maneuver to get the fishery reopened,” said Todd Steiner, executive director of Turtle Island Restoration Network. “Sea turtles could go extinct if deadly longline fisheries are expanded. And it’s not just in California— the Hawaii longline fleet has been forced to close early two years in a row because they have exceeded their legal turtle take. It makes no sense to re-authorize this wasteful fishery off of California.”\nSea turtles become hooked while trying to take longline bait or become entangled while swimming through the walls of nearly invisible lines and hooks. That can drown the turtles or leave them fatally injured. Seabirds such as Laysan and black-footed albatrosses also dive for the bait and become hooked; worldwide, longline fishing has caused precipitous declines in most albatross populations.\nPacific leatherback sea turtles are highly endangered, with scientists predicting their extinction in 20 years. Yet the “exempted” fishery will occur in an area that includes the Pacific Leatherback Conservation Area, which prohibits swordfish fishing using drift gillnets to protect leatherback sea turtles.\nLoggerhead and olive ridley sea turtles are also endangered. Guadalupe fur seals are threatened, and have been stranding on California beaches, sick and malnourished, for five years in a row in an “unusual mortality event.”\nThe California Coastal Commission requested approval to review the proposed permit to determine whether it was consistent with the California Coastal Management Program, but the Trump administration denied the request. Despite being likely to catch sea turtles and Guadalupe fur seals — imperiled animals protected by state and federal law — the Trump administration found the fishery would not affect California’s coastal resources.\nToday’s lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, notes that the Fisheries Service’s issuance of the permit violated several environmental laws, including the Endangered Species Act and National Environmental Policy Act. The suit seeks to invalidate the permit, protecting the turtles and seals from longlines.\nThe Fisheries Service issued the permit May 8, about a year after a federal court ordered the Hawaiian shallow-set longline fishery closed to protect endangered loggerhead sea turtles following a lawsuit filed by Turtle Island Restoration Network and the Center for Biological Diversity, represented by Earthjustice. After the court invalidated the inflated limits on incidental catch of sea turtles, the lower limits compelled an immediate closure of the Hawaiian shallow-set longline fishery.\nThe Center for Biological Diversity is a national, nonprofit conservation organization with more than 1.4 million members and online activists dedicated to the protection of endangered species and wild places.\nTurtle Island Restoration Network is a global nonprofit whose mission is to inspire and mobilize people around the world to protect marine biodiversity and the oceans that sustain all life on Earth.\nLinked Documents & Resources:"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:2a629d76-8c74-4b72-927d-3f8379ad4608>","<urn:uuid:76b35163-96a0-49e4-948b-bf7117528aae>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What's the growth pattern of mangroves along the shoreline? Which species grows where?","answer":"Along the shoreline, there is a specific pattern: red mangroves (Rhizophora mangle) grow closest to the water, black mangroves (Avicennia germinans) grow inland from the red mangroves, and white mangroves (Laguncularia racemosa) grow furthest inland. Together, these three species stabilize the shoreline, provide storm surge protection, trap debris, and create habitats for wildlife.","context":["|Black mangrove growing in Guanacaste Province, Costa Rica|\n|Distribution of Avicennia germinans|\nThe black mangrove (Avicennia germinans), is a shrub in the acanthus family, Acanthaceae. It grows in tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, on both the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, and on the Atlantic coast of tropical Africa, where it thrives on the sandy and muddy shores that seawater reaches. It is common throughout coastal areas of Texas and Florida, and ranges as far north as southern Louisiana and coastal Georgia in the United States.\nUnlike other mangrove species, it does not grow on prop roots, but possesses pneumatophores that allow its roots to breathe even when submerged. It is a hardy species and expels absorbed salt mainly from its leathery leaves.\nThe name \"black mangrove\" refers to the color of the trunk and heartwood. The leaves often appear whitish from the salt excreted at night and on cloudy days. It is often found in its native range with the red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle) and the white mangrove (Laguncularia racemosa). White mangroves grow inland from black mangroves which themselves grow inland from red mangroves. The three species work together to stabilize the shoreline, provide buffers from storm surges, trap debris and detritus brought in by tides, and provide feeding, breeding, and nursery grounds for a great variety of fish, shellfish, birds, and other wildlife.\nThe black mangrove grows just above the high tide in coastal lagoons and brackish water estuaries. It is less tolerant of highly saline conditions than certain other species that occur in mangrove ecosystems. It can reach 10–15 m (33–49 ft) in height, although it is a small shrub in cooler regions of its range. The seeds germinate in midsummer, but may be seen all year on the trees. The seeds can remain viable for over a year once released.\nThe heartwood is dark-brown to black, while the sapwood is yellow-brown. It has the unusual property of having less dense heartwood than sapwood. The sapwood sinks in water while the heartwood floats. The wood is strong, heavy, and hard, but is difficult to work due to its interlocked grain and is somewhat difficult to finish due to its oily texture. Uses include posts, pilings, charcoal, and fuel. Despite growing in a marine environment, the dry wood is subject to attack by marine borers and termites. Like many species, it contains tannin in the bark and has been used to tan leather products.\n- \"Avicennia germinans (L.) L.\". Germplasm Resources Information Network.

{"question":"wat difference between alcoholic vs non alcoholic fatty liver - etiology and prevalence in asia?","answer":"Both conditions involve excessive fat in the liver, but they have different causes and prevalence. Alcoholic fatty liver disease (AFLD) is caused by excessive alcohol consumption, particularly affecting about 30% of the Indian population with higher prevalence in men. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is not caused by alcohol but is often diagnosed in people who are obese, sedentary, and consume highly processed foods. It affects around 30% of Asian adults, with potentially higher rates in Singapore according to SingHealth studies. Both conditions can lead to serious complications like liver scarring and liver failure if left untreated.","context":["Alcoholic fatty liver disease (AFLD) is a condition characterized by the accumulation of fat in the liver due to excessive alcohol consumption. India has a high prevalence of AFLD due to the high rates of alcohol consumption, particularly in the northern states of the country.\nAccording to a study published in the Journal of Clinical and Experimental Hepatology, AFLD affects approximately 30% of the Indian population, and the prevalence is higher among men than women. AFLD is often asymptomatic in the early stages, but as the disease progresses, it can lead to serious complications such as liver cirrhosis, liver failure, and even liver cancer.\nAlcoholic liver disease can manifest as a chronic condition, beginning with fatty liver and progressing to chronic hepatitis, fibrosis (scarring), and cirrhosis. Acute involvement can result in alcoholic hepatitis, which can be fatal.\nWhereas fatty liver is a generally harmless ailment, the development of cirrhosis of the liver signifies a significant reduction in life expectancy. The real stage of cirrhosis is determined by the occurrence of complications such as portal hypertension with bleeding, esophageal varices (blood vomiting), ascites (abdominal distension), or hepatic encephalopathy (confusion, coma). Patients with advanced cirrhosis have a 6- to 18-month median survival duration. Serious alcoholic hepatitis has a 50% death rate.\nOne of the main risk factors for AFLD is the consumption of homemade alcoholic beverages, such as toddy and country liquor, which are often contaminated with toxins that can damage the liver. Additionally, the lack of awareness about the dangers of excessive alcohol consumption and the absence of regulations on the sale and distribution of alcohol in many parts of the country contribute to the high prevalence of AFLD in India.\nPrevention and management of AFLD require a multi-faceted approach, including measures such as increasing public awareness about the risks of alcohol consumption, regulating the sale and distribution of alcohol, and providing access to affordable healthcare services for early detection and treatment of AFLD.\nComplete abstinence is required for each form of treatment of alcoholic liver disease; the other therapeutic treatments are just supportive. Steroids can be used to treat severe alcoholic hepatitis. Cirrhotic individuals who stop consuming alcohol can be eligible for transplantation, resulting in a significantly increased life expectancy.\nIn addition to lifestyle modifications, such as reducing alcohol consumption and adopting a healthy diet and exercise routine, medication and other therapies may also be used to manage AFLD. However, early detection and intervention are key to preventing the progression of the disease and reducing the risk of serious complications.\nAm I drinking too much?\nThe ‘CAGE’ questionnaire is often used in the assessment of patients with alcoholic liver disease, as excessive alcohol consumption is a major cause of this condition. It consists of four questions that ask about the respondent’s drinking habits:\n- Have you ever felt you should Cut down on your drinking?\n- Have people Annoyed you by criticizing your drinking?\n- Have you ever felt Guilty about drinking?\n- Have you ever taken a drink first thing in the morning (Eye-opener) to steady your nerves or to get rid of a hangover?\nThe majority of patients with alcoholism have a favorable reaction to at least two questions, and roughly 50% have a good response to all four questions. In comparison, more than 80% of non-alcoholics respond negatively to all four questions.\nIn conclusion, AFLD is a significant public health issue in India due to the high rates of alcohol consumption and lack of awareness about the risks associated with excessive drinking. Addressing this issue requires a comprehensive approach that involves public education, regulatory measures, and access to quality healthcare services. By taking proactive steps to prevent and manage AFLD, India can improve the health and well-being of its citizens and reduce the burden of liver disease in the country.\n–Dr. Debasis Datta, Director- Department of Gastroenterology and GI Surgery, Fortis Hospital Anandapur","If you’ve always considered fatty liver disease to be an alcoholic’s burden, you may want to think again. There are actually 2 types of fatty liver disease – alcohol-induced and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Around 30% of Asian adults suffer from one of the 2 forms, and a recent study done by SingHealth suggests that the rate in Singapore could be even higher.\nToo much fat in the liver\nIf you have the disease, it means you have too much fat in your liver, which makes it less efficient at flushing out toxins from the body. More seriously, the disease can lead to liver scarring and eventually liver failure which is irreversible, so being in the know about how to lower your risk is valuable information indeed. While excess alcohol obviously plays a role in you falling foul of alcohol-induced fatty liver disease, other bad lifestyle choices increase your risk of developing NAFLD.\nWhile the exact cause is not clear, NAFLD is often diagnosed in people who are obese, lead a sedentary lifestyle and those who consume a highly processed foods diet. Patients with NAFLD also tend to have high blood pressure and high blood cholesterol levels.\nChange your diet for a healthier liver\nThe good news is you can adapt your diet to reduce your risks for both types of the disease. If you are overweight, you should target to lose at least 10% of your body weight by switching to a lower-calorie diet high in fresh vegetables, fruit and high-fibre plants, and by avoiding added sugar, salt, trans fat, refined carbohydrates and alcohol.\nEasier said than done, we know, which is why we’ve put together a little cheat sheet for you on foods that can help you reach your weight goals and combat a fatty liver.\nIf you are yet to be convinced of the health benefits of doing what your mum always urged and eating your greens, here’s one more reason to munch down beans, spinach, brussel sprouts and more green vegetables: tests have shown that broccoli helps to prevent the build-up of fat in the liver. Eating any greens can help you lose weight, which in turn will help your liver. It gives you early satiety (filling of fullness) and is low in calories. Its fibre-rich content can help you lower your blood cholesterol levels.\nIronically, eating fatty fish helps combat a fatty liver. Salmon, sardines, tuna, and trout are all high in omega-3 fatty acids, which can help lower the levels of fat in the liver and can bring down inflammation. It is also a healthy alternative to meat as it gives you the opportunity to avoid consuming the fats and skins from meat or poultry.\nIf you are not a keen fish eater, you can still get your omega-3 fatty acids from walnuts. They are great to eat as a healthy snack, add to your stir fry for that extra texture or sprinkle over your favourite salad. Limit portion to a small handful per day.\nWhen you need to control your weight and lower liver enzyme levels, you can’t go wrong by reducing the amount of fat/oil in your diet. When choosing fat/oil, opt for healthier unsaturated type. Flaxseed oil is an example of unsaturated oil. It is a good source of omega-3 fatty acids. You can dash over a salad, drizzled over bread or used for light frying adds a distinct flavour to all your dishes without you feeling guilty for the indulgence.\nNow we are starting to see a pattern. Here’s another delicious food choice that’s high in healthy fat, yet great for heart and liver health. Avocado appears to contain chemicals that might slow liver damage. Spread a small amount over toast with lemon juice and black pepper, add to a sandwich or wrap, or get really adventurous with the many avocado recipes you can find online.\nProtein helps repair body tissue. Milk is a great source of protein, go for skimmed or fat-free version. Or why not splash it on a healthy oatmeal breakfast in the morning to set yourself up for the day?\nCoffee often gets a bad rap, but the good news is that it isn’t always the enemy to health it’s sometimes made out to be. Coffee appears to lower the amount of abnormal liver enzymes in people at risk for liver diseases. Just make sure you do not add unnecessary creamer or sugar to increase the calories. Instead, using low fat milk, and artificial sweeteners if you cannot fight your sweet tooth.\nVitamin E is a powerful antioxidant that could protect the liver from damage, and sunflower seeds are a tasty little source of this important vitamin. Not only do they offer protection, but they add a wonderful texture when sprinkled over a salad, or to munch on as a healthy mid-day snack but in small amount.\nIf you have fatty liver disease and are not a great fan of garlic, garlic powder supplements may be your answer to reducing fat levels, if experimental studies are to be believed. Nevertheless, garlic helps flavour your dishes, so you don’t end up using too much sauce, which are also excessive calories.\nNew studies seem to point to green tea reducing fat storage in the liver and improving liver function. While this research is in its early stages, there’s no harm in drinking green tea anyway for all the health benefits we know it has, including lowering cholesterol and helping you sleep – and a regular good night’s sleep does wonders for keeping your weight down too.\nSo there you have it – 10 great suggestions for adding liver-preserving ingredients into your diet – all readily available on the shelves of your local supermarket.\nArticle contributed by Louis Yap, dietitian at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital\nAbdel-Hamid, M., Dawood, A.

{"question":"What signal stations were operational in North Carolina's New Berne district as of August 31, 1864?","answer":"In the District of North Carolina, there were several operational stations: One at General Harland's headquarters in New Berne that communicated with Fort Anderson, Fort Gaston, and Camp Palmer. Another station at Batchelder's Creek (headquarters of colonel commanding outposts) communicated with Red House, Harrison's house on Neuse road, and through the latter station with Beech Grove on the right of picket-line.","context":["HDQRS. DEPT. OF VIRGINIA AND NORTH CAROLINA, OFFICE OF THE CHIEF SIGNAL OFFICER, September 2, 1864.\nDuring the month of August the same signal stations and lines were operated that were worked through the month of July, and the following new ones opened: On the 5th a line of sight was cut through the\n+For portion of report here omitted, see Vol. XXXVI, Part II, p. 20, and Vol. XL, Part I, p. 681.\nwoods and signal communication established by direction of General Harland, between his headquarters in New Berne, N. C., and the headquarters of his cavalry picket at Camp Palmer, near Harrison’s house, on Trent road. In the Army of the James, on the 1st of August, a signal officer was placed on lookout at Mill’s house, on the south bank of the Appomattox, two miles above Spring Hill. He was to carefully watch the enemy’s signal stations and works, and report anything of importance that he night observe. On the 2nd general Birney’s signal officer commenced the building of a tower near the Sawyer battery, on the James River, from which, when finished, it is thought will be obtained a view of the Petersburg and Richmond and turnpike opposite our right, Drewry’s Bluff, and the pontoon bridge near it, and other points of importance. On the 10th a signal party was sent to open a station at Dutch Gap, where a force, under Major Ludlow, was engaged digging a canal across the neck. Communication was established between that point and gun-boats, Crow’s Nest, and Battery Spofford (or Water Battery), through which latter communication was had with general headquarters. A station was placed at the Crow’s Nest for the convenience of Major Ludlow, and to give warning to the working party at the gap and to the gun-boats of the approach of the rebel rams, and to direct the fire of our gun-boats upon them. On the 13th enemy opened fire upon our working party from the Howlett and Signal Hill batteries and the rams, but the signal communication between the aforesaid points was maintained uninterruptedly. On the 14th the signal officers who accompanied the Tenth Corps to Deep Bottom opened communication by signals between General Birney’s headquarters, on the west side of Four-Mile Creek, and the headquarters of General Hancock, east of the creek. On the 15th, by direction of General Birney, the same party established communication between the gun-boats Agawam and Mendota, and a signal officer placed on shore to direct the fire of those boats upon the enemy in case he attacked. During the latter part of the month the Tenth and Eighteenth Corps exchanged positions, and the signal officers of those corps also exchanged stations.\nOn the 31st of August the following signal stations and lines remained in good working order, and almost constantly employed:\nIN THE DISTRICT O NORTH CAROLINA.\nStation at General Harland’s headquarters, New Berne, N. C., communicating with stations at Fort Anderson, Fort Gaston, and Camp Palmer (headquarters cavalry picket); station at Batchelder’s Creek (headquarters colonel commanding outposts) communicating with Red House (headquarters officer commanding left of outposts), with Harrison’s house on Neuse road (picket reserve), land through the latter station with Beech Grove (the right of picket-line).\nIN THE ARMY OF THE JAMES.\nStation at Fort Pocahontas, communicating with one at Forth Powhatan, on James River, seven miles distant; stations at general headquarters, Cobb’s Hill tower, Battery Anderson (or Numbers 3), General Carr’s headquarters, Hatcher’s house (headquarters Eighteenth Corps), Water Battery (or Spofford’s), Dutch Gap, and flag-ship Onondaga, forming a line of signals around the front of the intrenchments between the general commanding, the officer commanding Eighteenth Corps, the commander of the James River flotilla, and Major Ludlow’s working party at Dutch Gap; station of observation at Crow’s Nest,\nJames River, communicating with flag-ship Onondaga and Dutch Gap. Station at General Graham’s headquarters, near pontoon bridge, communicating with general headquarters through the Cobb’s Hill tower; station of observation at river-bank, Spring Hill, communicating with Cobb’s Hill tower, and through the latter with general headquarters Tenth Corps, in front of Petersburg, communicating with station of observation (officers watching enemy’s movements) at Avery’s house and Friend’s house.\nA map is herewith inclosed showing by the signal flags placed upon it where the stations now in operation are located, and by deterred red lines those with which they communicated. In reviewing the operations of the signal detachment in this department for the four months and a half herein recorded, I find that seventy signal stations were established and operated, and of those twenty-seven were worked under the fire of the enemy, and twenty-four still remain in operation. Of the importance of the information of the enemy’s movements given by the detachment, and of the information of the enemy’s movements given by the detachment, and of its other labors, the commanding general, of course, is best able to judge. Although nearly all of our signal officers and flagmen have been freely exposed to the severest fire of the enemy in the performance of their various duties, I am happy to be able to state that the casualties have been small; we have lost but 1 officer and 2 men killed, and 2 men were slightly wounded.\nAll of the officers of the detachment have performed their duties to my entire satisfaction, but the following are especially mentioned as having made them conspicuous for gallantry, uncommon zeal, and close attention to duty, viz: First Lieutenant H. W. Benson, signal officer on the flag-ship of the James River flotilla, frequently under fire. First Lieutenant W. Bruyn, signal officer of the Water Battery, who remained at his post making observations of the rebel rams and directing the fire of our gun-boats upon them, himself under a severe cross-fire from the roams and the Howlett and Signal Hill batteries. First Lieutenant C. F. Cross, signal officer at Dutch Gap, who maintained constant communication with the gun boats and the Water Battery during the severe fire of the enemy upon Dutch Gap, August 13, 1864. His flagman was wounded by his side. Second Lieutenant O. B.

{"question":"In what ways do unintended consequences manifest in both system accidents and cybersecurity breaches?","answer":"Unintended consequences in system accidents often emerge from the organization and configuration of the system itself, rather than specific unit properties. Examples include flash crashes in stock markets and increased industrial errors at shift ends. In the cybersecurity domain, similar unintended consequences arise when organizations rapidly transition to remote work without proper preparation. This leads to increased security incidents, data loss, and oversharing. While these outcomes are typically unintended by both individual actors and system architects, they result from embedded features of the system. The chaotic nature of rapid organizational changes, such as the sudden shift to remote work during the pandemic, creates opportunities for threat actors to exploit system vulnerabilities, demonstrating how unintended consequences can arise from seemingly routine organizational changes.","context":["Quite a few posts here have focused on the question of emergence in social ontology, the idea that there are causal processes and powers at work at the level of social entities that do not correspond to similar properties at the individual level. Here I want to raise a related question, the notion that an important aspect of the workings of the social world derives from “system effects” of the organizations and institutions through which social life transpires. A system accident or effect is one that derives importantly from the organization and configuration of the system itself, rather than the specific properties of the units.\nWhat are some examples of system effects? Consider these phenomena:\n- Flash crashes in stock markets as a result of automated trading\n- Under-reporting of land values in agrarian fiscal regimes\n- Grade inflation in elite universities\n- Increase in product defect frequency following a reduction in inspections\n- Rising frequency of industrial errors at the end of work shifts\nHere is how Nancy Leveson describes systems causation in Engineering a Safer World: Systems Thinking Applied to Safety:\nSafety approaches based on systems theory consider accidents as arising from the interactions among system components and usually do not specify single causal variables or factors. Whereas industrial (occupational) safety models and event chain models focus on unsafe acts or conditions, classic system safety models instead look at what went wrong with the system’s operation or organization to allow the accident to take place. (KL 977)\nCharles Perrow offers a taxonomy of systems as a hierarchy of composition in Normal Accidents: Living with High-Risk Technologies:\nConsider a nuclear plant as the system. A part will be the first level — say a valve. This is the smallest component of the system that is likely to be identified in analyzing an accident. A functionally related collection of parts, as, for example, those that make up the steam generator, will be called a unit, the second level. An array of units, such as the steam generator and the water return system that includes the condensate polishers and associated motors, pumps, and piping, will make up a subsystem, in this case the secondary cooling system. This is the third level. A nuclear plan has around two dozen subsystems under this rough scheme. They all come together in the fourth level, the nuclear plant or system. Beyond this is the environment. (65)\nLarge socioeconomic systems like capitalism and collectivized socialism have system effects — chronic patterns of low productivity and corruption in the latter case, a tendency to inequality and immiseration in the former case. In each case the observed effect is the result of embedded features of property and labor in the two systems that result in specific kinds of outcomes. And an important dimension of social analysis is to uncover the ways in which ordinary actors pursuing ordinary goals within the context of the two systems, lead to quite different outcomes at the level of the “mode of production”. And these effects do not depend on there being a distinctive kind of actor in each system; in fact, one could interchange the actors and still find the same macro-level outcomes.\nHere is a preliminary effort at a definition for this concept in application to social organizations:\nA system effect is an outcome that derives from the embedded characteristics of incentive and opportunity within a social arrangement that lead normal actors to engage in activity leading to the hypothesized aggregate effect.\nOnce we see what the incentive and opportunity structures are, we can readily see why some fraction of actors modify their behavior in ways that lead to the outcome. In this respect the system is the salient causal factor rather than the specific properties of the actors — change the system properties and you will change the social outcome.\nWhen we refer to system effects we often have unintended consequences in mind — unintended both by the individual actors and the architects of the organization or practice. But this is not essential; we can also think of examples of organizational arrangements that were deliberately chosen or designed to bring about the given outcome. In particular, a given system effect may be intended by the designer and unintended by the individual actors. But when the outcomes in question are clearly dysfunctional or “catastrophic”, it is natural to assume that they are unintended. (This, however, is one of the specific areas of insight that comes out of the new institutionalism: the dysfunctional outcome may be favorable for some sets of actors even as they are unfavorable for the workings of the system as a whole.)\nAnother common assumption about system effects is that they are remarkably stable through changes of actors and efforts to reverse the given outcome. In this sense they are thought to be somewhat beyond the control of the individuals who make up the system. The only promising way of undoing the effect is to change the incentives and opportunities that bring it about. But to the extent that a given configuration has emerged along with supporting mechanisms protecting it from deformation, changing the configuration may be frustratingly difficult.\nSafety and its converse are often described as system effects. By this is often meant two things. First, there is the important insight that traditional accident analysis favors “unit failure” at the expense of more systemic factors. And second, there is the idea that accidents and failures often result from “tightly linked” features of systems, both social and technical, in which variation in one component of a system can have unexpected consequences for the operation of other components of the system. Charles Perrow describes the topic of loose and tight coupling in social systems in Normal Accidents; 89 ff.","Employees who work from their homes may be putting their companies’ systems at risk.\n“Many employees do company work from personally managed and owned systems and these machines are often the ‘Wild, Wild West’ in terms of how they are secured,” said Mike Gentile, the chief executive of San Clemente-based cybersecurity company Cisoshare.\n“The majority of complex attacks, such as ransomware, etc., right now are still often caused by a simple phishing attack or an employee mistake like clicking on a bad link.”\nCisoshare is one of several cybersecurity firms that are emerging in Orange County, which is carving a strong position in internet security due to the proliferation of hackers from Russia, China and North Korea who demand eye-popping sums in ransomware.\nCrowdStrike Holdings Inc. (Nasdaq: CRWD), a Sunnyvale-based firm that now has a $55 billion market cap, started in Orange County where it still has a large local presence. Irvine’s Cylance sold for about $1.4 billion to BlackBerry in 2019 and also counts a base of operations here.\nIn Newport Beach, the ioXt Alliance started by Mobilitie founder Gary Jabara, wants to make sure the interconnections among the various devices used each day—such as cellphones, smart home lighting controls and automotive technology—are also secure.\nUC Irvine’s Cybersecurity Policy & Research Institute studies ways to make the internet and networks safer, including running mock attack drills. Cybercriminals\nIrvine-based Netwrix Corp. is expanding so quickly that it’s made four acquisitions since January.\n“Most organizations did not have time to prepare a transition plan and provide security training to the employees” when they started working from home last year, said Ilia Sotnikov, security strategist and vice president at Netwrix.\n“Hence the increase in reported incidents that included data loss or oversharing.”\nAttackers know that ransomware is arguably the quickest way to get money from a company without breaking into its system, he said.\n“The cybercriminals took advantage of the global pandemic and highly divisive political scene in the U.S. last year,” Sotnikov said. “We’ve seen considerable changes in how the threat landscape evolved over the last couple years with ransomware as a service, more specialized groups.”\nThe Coronavirus Chaos\n“There was so much chaos during the first few months of the lockdown that every CISO will need to go back and review all of the access and changes that happened,” said Bil Harmer, who is the chief information security officer (CISO) and chief evangelist at computer identity security software maker SecureAuth.\n“When there is chaos and change, the threat actors will be there looking for ways in.”\nHe predicted that companies “will begin putting more and more focus on digital identities and a continuous authentication methodology that will allow them to adjust access on the fly as the landscape or the user behavior changes.”\nCisoshare, founded by Gentile, placed No. 21 on this year’s Business Journal list of Best Places to Work in Orange County and No. 2 on last year’s list of fastest-growing companies, both in the small-firm category.\nCompanies who let employees work from their homes face an increasing threat level similar to that of an apartment owner who adds more apartments to a portfolio: the more units there are, the greater the business risks, Gentile said.\n“When employees are working from home, it expands the digital footprint and perimeter of the organization,” Gentile said during a recent interview.\nProviding security also requires using precious resources and talent—both of which are in short supply at plenty of companies, Gentile said.\n“The majority of security risk lives in the cracks when people don’t effectively collaborate and ‘cover all the bases’ when building something,” he said.\nTraining on workstations from which a network is accessed can reduce the risks when employees work from home in a decentralized environment, Gentile said.\nCompanies that opt for a “hybrid” model combining both work-from-home and the office should be wary.\n“Hybrid can be risky due to any time rules change, there is a higher likelihood of mistakes,” Kevin McDonald, the chief operating officer and chief information security officer of Alvaka Networks in Irvine lists 16 points of vulnerability. They include use of bootlegged software, browsing illicit sites, opening infected files that would otherwise be blocked, communicating with unverified individuals and illegal sharing of various contraband such as movies, images, and games.\n“Gambling, pornography, sports, gaming sites, alternative bulletin boards, messengers, even terrorism and extremist sites lead to infections of the host that then connects to the company,” he said.\n“We all suffer from a bit of that-won’t-happen-to-me syndrome. We’re not a target, we don’t have anything they want, we’re not that rich of a company.”\nHe says ransomware attackers are well aware of the potential payoffs: “One hit and you can retire.”\nCompanies are starting to nudge employees into coming to their offices though the daily back-and-forth from the COVID-19 Delta variant makes it difficult to set firm guidelines.\nFor example, data analytics software maker Alteryx Inc. has “voluntarily opened a number of our offices, including our Irvine location for those who are comfortable coming in,” Chief Financial Officer Kevin Rubin said on Aug. 5. “There’s no mandate that they do.”\n“We will more officially begin asking associates to start coming back no sooner than January,” he added.\nSotnikov sees some bright spots.\n“I think many of the WFH (work-from-home) specific dangers were mitigated over the last 12 months, as organizations had a chance to catch their breath, get new budgets in 2021, catch up on trainings for both admins and employees,” he said.\nThe Senate included more than $1.9 billion in cybersecurity funds as part of the roughly $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure package, The Hill website said on Aug. 10.\nThe funds will go toward securing critical infrastructure against attacks, helping vulnerable organizations defend themselves and providing funding for a key federal cyber office, among other initiatives.\nExperts point to the targeting of Colonial Pipeline and JBS meat packers earlier this year as examples of the dangers of ransomware demands.\nThe picture is acute on the international front, with both Sotnikov and McDonald noting President Joe Biden’s warning last month that a significant cyber-attack on the U.S. could lead to “a real shooting war” with a major power, highlighting the growing threats posed by Russia and China.\n“That is a very aggressive and provocative statement,” McDonald said. He points to China in particular as he surveys global cybersecurity threats to the U.S.\n“I should be worried about China finally deciding it’s time to become the sole world power and using its understanding of our weak infrastructure to show us how much we don’t really have control of the world anymore,” McDonald said.\nAnd the ultimate piece of bad news?\n“Replacements are made in China,” he said.\nDangers, Positive Signs: OC Cybersecurity Experts Look at Internet Risks\nOC Cybersecurity Experts Give the Business Journal These Tips:\nKEVIN MCDONALD, chief operating officer/chief information security officer, Alvaka Networks in Irvine\nSome dangers are “removed or reduced” if the equipment is owned by the employer.\n“Employee-owned computers are far less likely to be patched and kept up-to-date against vulnerability. This includes the operating systems, office applications, third party applications such as Adobe, Internet browsers, etc.\n“Having a system shared with non-employees (of unknown behavior tendency, character, education, intent) means that there is a high potential for risky behaviors that can result in a compromised local computer.\n“Big time execs and powerful people are targets and they’re the most reticent to participate in this whole process.\n“Cryptocurrency is the “primary reason” for the rise in ransomware in which hackers hijack a computer system and demand payment to release it.”\nMIKE GENTILE, founder/chief executive, Cisoshare in San Clemente\nThe biggest risk to work from home or hybrid for security “is that collaboration and effective small team dynamics are hindered when people can’t work together in person.”\n“The good news is that some of the strongest safeguards when a workforce is decentralized is a strong security training and awareness program, as well as a communication system so employees know how to get in touch with the security team and vice versa. Both of these items are highly effective, but also much more inexpensive than almost all technical safeguards.”\nBIL HARMER, chief information security officer/chief evangelist, SecureAuth in Irvine\n“The hybrid model will not go away, there is far too much upside for companies in it. From 48 extra minutes per day per employee in productivity to reduced footprints in the office (desks, power, coffee, etc), this is a model that will continue.\n“Companies will begin moving to Secure Identity as the first line of defense. They will begin putting more and more focus on digital identities and a continuous authentication methodology that will allow them to adjust access on the fly as the landscape or the user behavior changes.\n“This will allow the user to move around the physical world and have their authentication and authorization adjust as they do to keep them within the acceptable risk profile.”"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:1e5062bc-320c-42de-92ca-cd3cd1eabd7f>","<urn:uuid:ad45c4f6-8fbd-4d17-b17d-404d81708d47>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Hey guys! I'm fascinated by ancient deities of wealth - could you compare how Dis Pater and Lakshmi were depicted handling riches and prosperity? Really curious about their divine money management skills! 🤔","answer":"Dis Pater and Lakshmi had different associations with wealth. Dis Pater was originally a Roman god of riches focused specifically on earthly wealth like gems, precious metals, and fertile agricultural land. As time progressed, his association with underground wealth led to him becoming more connected with the underworld and death. Lakshmi, on the other hand, remains actively worshipped as the Hindu goddess of wealth, fortune and power. She is depicted more comprehensively, with four hands representing her ability to grant four types of human attainments: righteousness, wealth, bodily pleasures, and spiritual liberation. She is often shown holding various symbolic items like lotuses, a conch shell, and a pot of ambrosia, representing her control over various aspects of prosperity and creation.","context":["Dis Pater, or Dispater was a Roman (Gaulish) god of the underworld, later subsumed by Pluto or Hades. Originally a chthonic god of riches, fertile agricultural land, and underground mineral wealth, he was later commonly equated with the Roman deities Pluto and Orcus, becoming an underworld deity.\nDis Pater was commonly shortened to simply Dis. This name has since become an alternative name for the underworld or a part of the underworld, such as the Dis of The Divine Comedy.\nDis Pater was originally a god of wealth, much like the Roman god Pluto (from Greek Πλούτων, Ploutōn, meaning “wealthy”), who was later equated with Dis Pater. Dis is contracted from the Latin dis (from dives meaning “rich”), and pater (“father”), the literal meaning of Dis Pater being “Wealthy Father” or “Father of Riches.”\nJulius Caesar writes in Commentarii de Bello Gallico that the Gauls considered Dis Pater to be an ancestor. In thus interpreting the Gauls’ god as Dis, Caesar offers one of his many examples of interpretatio Romana, the re-identification of foreign divinities as their closest Roman counterparts. The choice of Dis to translate whatever Celtic divinity Caesar has in mind – most likely Cernunnos, as the two are both associated with both the Underworld and prosperity – may in part be due to confusion between Dis Pater and the Proto-Indo-European deity Dyeus, who would have been addressed as Dyeu Phter (“Sky Father”). This name is also the likely origin of the name of many Indo-European gods, including Zeus and Jupiter.\nLike Pluto, Dis Pater eventually became associated with death and the underworld because the wealth of the earth—gems and precious metals—was considered in the domain of the Greco-Roman underworld. As a result, Dis Pater was over time conflated with the Greek god Pluto.\nIn being conflated with Pluto, Dis Pater took on some of the Greek mythological attributes of Pluto/Hades, being one of the three sons of Saturn (Greek: Cronus) and Ops (Greek: Rhea), along with Jupiter and Neptune. He ruled the underworld and the dead beside his wife, Proserpina (Greek: Persephone). In literature, Dis Pater was commonly used as a symbolic and poetic way of referring to death itself.\nIn 249 BC and 207 BC, the Roman Senate under Senator Lucius Catelli ordained special festivals to appease Dis Pater and Proserpina. Every hundred years, a festival was celebrated in his name. According to legend, a round marble altar, Altar of Dis Pater and Proserpina (Latin: Ara Ditis Patris et Proserpinae), was miraculously discovered by the servants of a Sabine called Valesius, the ancestor of the first consul. The servants were digging in the Tarentum on the edge of the Campus Martius to lay foundations following instructions given to Valesius’s children in dreams, when they found the altar 20 feet (6 m) underground. Valesius reburied the altar after three days of games. Sacrifices were offered to this altar during the Ludi Saeculares or Ludi Tarentini. It may have been uncovered for each occasion of the games, to be reburied afterwards, a clearly chthonic tradition of worship. It was rediscovered in 1886–87 beneath the Corso Vittorio Emanuele in Rome.\nIn addition to being considered the ancestor of the Gauls, Dis Pater was sometimes identified with the Sabine god Soranus. In southern Germany and the Balkans, Dis Pater had a Celtic goddess, Aericura, as a consort. Dis Pater was rarely associated with foreign deities in the shortened form of his name, Dis.","HINDU GODDESS OF WEALTH - LAKSHMI\n|Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth, seems to be more sought after than Saraswati, the goddess of learning. As the power and consort of Vishnu, the preserver, she is the power of multiplicity and the goddess of fortune, both of which are necessary for preservation. Sri or Lakshmi, depicted in the vedas, is the goddess of wealth and fortune, power and beauty. One may suppose that Sri and Lakshmi are two separate deities. Since their descriptions are so similar, one may conclude that the two represent the same deity. Some scholars believe that Sri was a pre-vedic deity connected with fertility, water and agriculture. She was later fused with Lakshmi, the vedic goddess of beauty.|\nAccording to the puranas, she was incarnated as the daughter of the sage Bhrigu and his wife Khyati. She was later born out of Ksheer Sagar (ocean of milk) while being churned. Hence, her appellation, Ksheera Samudra Raja Kanya. As consort of Vishnu, she is born as his spouse whenever he incarnates. When Vishnu appeared as Vamana, Parasurama, Rama, Krishna, she appeared as Padma or Kamala, Dharani, Sita and Rukmini, respectively. She is as inseparable from Vishnu as speech from meaning or knowledge from intellect, or good deeds from righteousness.\nVishnu represents all that is male and Lakshmi, all that is female. Lakshmi is enchantingly beautiful, and is standing on a lotus holding lotuses one in each of her hands and is called Padma, or Kamala. She is also adorned with a lotus garland. Often, elephants are shown on each side, emptying pitchers of water over her, the pitchers being presented by celestial maidens. She is variously described as dark, pink, golden, yellow or white. We attempt an explanation that is behind this highly symbolical picture. If Lakshmi is pictured as dark in complexion, it is to show that she is the consort of Vishnu, the dark god. If golden yellow, that shows her as the source of all wealth. If white, she represents the purest form of prakriti (nature) from which the universe developed. As she is the mother of all, the pinkish complexion reflects her compassion for creatures.\nLakshmi Worship and Depiction\n|In the company of Vishnu, she is shown with two hands only. When worshipped in a temple, she is shown seated on a lotus throne, with four hands holding padma, shankha, amritha kalasha (pot of ambrosia) and bilva fruit. Amritha kalasha also signifies immortality. Sometimes, another kind of fruit, the mahalunga (citron) is shown instead of bilva. Her four hands signify her power to grant the (chatur vidha) four type of purusharthas (ends of human life), dharma (righteousness), artha (wealth), kama (bodily pleasures), moksha (beatitude).|\nThe lotuses in various stages of blooming, represent the worlds and beings in various stages of evolution. Mahalakshmi, an aspect of Durga, is shown with eight hands. The bow and arrow, mace and discus are added. The fruit denotes the fruits of our labor. Without the grace of Lakshmi, out toil is of no avail. The coconut with the shell, kernel and water connotes that she is the origin of the three levels of creation, the gross, the subtle and the extremely subtle. When the fruit is a pomegranate or a citron, it signifies that the various created worlds are under her control and she transcends them all. A bilva fruit, incidentally, not tasty or attractive, but good for health, represents moksha - the pinnacle of spiritual life.\nSome sculptures depict Lakshmi with an owl as her vaahana (carrier). This oddity can be appreciated when the symbology is unravelled. In Sanskrit, Uluka stands for an owl. Uluka is also one of the names of Indra, the king of gods, personifying wealth, power and glory. Thus, Lakshmi, the goddess of fortune, could not have found a better person to ride on, than the king of gods. This comparison of Indra's glory to a partially blind and uncouth bird warns the seekers of secular instead of spiritual wealth. When the owl is compared to the sthitha prajna, the enlightened person described in Bhagavadgita (Ch.2.69), the symbol means that Lakshmi is the mistress of spiritual wisdom. Another interpretation is \"Shut not thy eyes to the light of wisdom from the Sun of knowledge\". Out of consideration for mankind, the all compassionate mother has kept this personification of ignorance under her control.\nLakshmi pooja or worship is performed differently in the different parts of India. In the North of India, Lakshmi is worshipped on the occasion of Diwali (festival of lights) while in the South of India, she is worshipped on Vara Maha Lakshmi vratham day, the first Friday of the month of Shravan."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"language-ambiguous"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_synthesis"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:ab580802-10f6-4c20-aa77-0f1d984ffaf3>","<urn:uuid:720767ac-c8b2-4d54-a6d8-6cca32510d53>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What's so special about Japanese bullet trains - both their speed experience and their environmental impact?","answer":"The Japanese bullet train (shinkansen) offers a unique high-speed travel experience while being environmentally conscious. Running at 185 miles per hour, it provides an incredibly smooth ride with gentle G-forces and no shake-and-rattle, covering 227 miles between Tokyo and Kyoto in just 2 hours and 8 minutes. The train maintains perfect aesthetic harmony and precise timing. Regarding environmental impact, JR East (the railway company) has committed to achieving net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050 through their \"Zero-Carbon Challenge.\" Currently, about 25% of their train operations use renewable energy, and 98% of their rolling stock has been replaced with energy-efficient railcars.","context":["Learning to Appreciate the Small Things From a 1,000-Year-Old Japanese Writer\nEric Weiner on Reading Sei Shōnagon\nOn board Japan Rail East Train No. 318. En route from Tokyo to Kyoto. Speed: 185 miles per hour.\nSpeed, I’ve learned, is the enemy of attention. Swiftness fragments our awareness, splinters it into a million tiny pieces, none large enough to grasp.\nWhat about beauty? Does it, too, decrease as we accelerate? Or does speed possess its own blurred beauty? A hummingbird’s wings, flapping eighty times per second. A flash of lightning, arcing across the sky. The quiet whoosh of a Japanese shinkansen, or bullet train, rocketing from city to city.\nWhen I boarded the one I’m on now, at Tokyo’s shiny Shinagawa station, I didn’t know whether to gasp or laugh. With a flat platypus nose attached to a toned swimmer’s body, the train looks ridiculous. And beautiful. The shinkansen is the Robin Williams of trains: an absurdity blatantly flouting the laws of physics but doing so at such mind-boggling speed that all is forgiven.\nJust as Robin Williams didn’t compete with other comedians, the shinkansen doesn’t compete with other trains. It competes with the airlines. Japan Rail has done its best to mimic the feel of an airline cabin. I could be on board an Airbus, with the notable absence of seat belts and canned announcements about what to do in the unlikely event of a water landing.\nAs we departed Shinagawa station, precisely on time, the echoes of air travel grew louder: the high-pitched whoosh, the G forces gently pressing me against my seat—smoothly, without even a hint of Amtrak shake-and-rattle.\nIf all goes according to plan, and in Japan it almost always does, we will cover the 227 miles from Tokyo to Kyoto in a brisk two hours and eight minutes. We are flying. We are not flying. Only when I glance out the window—not at the horizon but at a nearby house or railroad crossing—do I experience an inkling of our exceptional velocity. Speed is relative. Without reference points, it is meaningless. A conductor walks by and scoops up a chopstick shard that somebody (okay, me) had dropped. In my mind, it was too small to qualify as litter. Clearly he felt otherwise. My stray speck of wood had upset the aesthetic harmony of the train. In Japan, something is either just right or it is not right at all.\nI retrieve my little black notebook, not the gem I lost in England (it is irreplaceable), but a more pedestrian model. I unfurl the elastic band that contains my thoughts. I turn to a fresh page, blank with possibility, and start a list. I like lists. List making is, I believe, a profoundly philosophical activity. Don’t take my word for it. Ask Plato. He made lists. He listed the attributes of a philosopher-king, and of the good life. His student Aristotle outdid him. Aristotle was philosophy’s great list maker. Keen to superimpose order upon messy reality, he created layers of categories and subcategories.\nSome two thousand years later, Susan Sontag offered this eloquent and characteristically cerebral defense of her chronic list making: “I perceive value, I confer value, I create value, I even create—or guarantee—existence. Hence, my compulsion to make ‘lists.’ ” Umberto Eco put it more succinctly: “The list is the origin of culture.”\nMy list-making is considerably less grand. My lists do not guarantee existence or establish cultures. My lists do not, as far as I know, perceive value, but they do help me corral my thoughts. They help me make sense of the world, of myself, and what is more philosophical than that?\nThe key to good list making is getting the category right. It must be large enough to encompass a variety of entries yet small enough to wrap your mind around. “The Greatest Music Ever” is too broad while “The Greatest Polkas Composed by Polish-Americans of 1930s Chicago” is too narrow.\nI glance at the list I’ve just created in my notebook. “Foreign Countries Where I Have Lived.” It is not a long list, only three entries, but it has, more than any other list, shaped how I think, and who I am.\nEach country on the list taught me something important, even if inadvertently. India taught me how to find stillness in chaos. Israel taught me the importance of savlanut, patience. Valuable lessons all, but nothing compared to Japan. Japan taught me, a person of the book, a head-heavy aficionado of words and the people who use words, how to shut the fuck up for five minutes and experience a different way of being. Japan opened my eyes to a philosophy of things. Beautiful small things.\nThe Pillow Book. What a strange title, I thought, when I first learned of its existence, nearly two decades ago. I was living in Tokyo, working as a correspondent for NPR. It tickled my interest. What is this peculiar book named after a nocturnal accessory and penned a millennium ago by a little-known courtier from Kyoto? And how does it attract readers ten centuries later?\nMy investigations started and ended there. I was busy filing reports about the Japanese economy or the country’s aging population or jetting off to cover some simmering conflict in Indonesia or Pakistan. I didn’t have the time—or, to be honest, the inclination—to read a thousand-year-old book about nothing in particular. The book, though, the idea of the book, stayed with me, relegated to the exurbia of my brain, waiting patiently for space to open up downtown.\nI snuggle with The Pillow Book while, appropriately, resting my head on a pillow. I am in a hotel room in Tokyo’s Shibuya neighborhood, though in Japan, “room” is a matter of opinion.\nBoth in style and scale, the alleged room reminds me of a ship’s cabin. A masterpiece of spatial efficiency, it supposedly sleeps three, but there’s a catch. These three bodies must remain at rest. Any motion requires the sort of advance coordination typically demanded of presidential visits and premarital sex. It is less room than nook.\nNooks don’t get their fair due. Not with adults at least. Children appreciate a good nook. They instinctively seek them out, and if none is available create one. I recall, as a melancholic five-year-old, transforming our Baltimore living room into a labyrinth of nooks by stringing together dozens of blankets and sheets, then anchoring them to anything within reach: chairs, couches, the dog. I was too young to articulate my motives, but I now realize what it was I craved: the sublime combination of coziness and wonder, confinement and expansiveness, security and adventure, that only a nook provides.\nI still like nooks. I suffer (if that is the right word) from claustrophobia’s opposite. I am drawn to confined spaces, thrive in them. Maybe this is why I am so fond of Japan. No one confines like the Japanese. People of the Nook. They shoehorn themselves into subway cars and bars and alleged hotel rooms. Remarkably, they do all this without killing one another.\nI turn to the first page. The Pillow Book reads like a private diary, and for good reason: it’s a private diary. “I merely wrote for my personal amusement things that I myself have thought and felt,” writes the author, Sei Shōnagon. She never expected her words to be read by others, which explains why others find them such a joy to read. The Pillow Book is written with the naked honesty typically reserved for the anonymous and the dying.\nAs I turn the pages, adjusting my pillow, I am drawn into Shōnagon’s world, seduced by her boldness, her love of details—and how she finds beauty in the most unexpected places.\nThe title, like so much of The Pillow Book, is a mystery. Why a pillow? Perhaps Shōnagon kept the manuscript by her bedside, like a pillow. Perhaps she found comfort in the words it contained the way we find comfort in our favorite pillow. No one knows.\nThe Pillow Book is not a book, at least not in the conventional sense.\nIt contains no narrative thread, no recurring characters, no overarching theme. The Pillow Book is a jambalaya of observations large and (mostly) small, “a crazy quilt of vignettes and opinions and anecdotes,” notes Meredith McKinney, who translated Makura no Sōshi, The Pillow Book into English.\nThe book that is not a book is arranged in 297 numbered entries, ranging in length from a single sentence to several pages. Some entries relay anecdotes from the Imperial Palace in Kyoto, while others are simply opinionated lists. The lists are my favorite. In Shōnagon, I have found a kindred spirit, a list-making ally.\nShōnagon refuses to stay in a single lane. She swerves from “Refined and elegant things” to “Worthless things” then back to “Things that are truly splendid.” It’s tempting to conclude she is lost. She is not. She is engaging in zuihitsu, or “following the brush.” It’s a Japanese literary technique that is not a technique, which strikes me as the perfect way to write a book that is not a book. A writer practicing zuihitsu isn’t afraid to follow a hunch, scratch an intellectual itch, then circle back, or not. The writer doesn’t impose structure but, rather, allows one to emerge.\nAll of us, I think, could use a bit more zuihitsu, and not only when it comes to writing. Set clear goals and channel all your energies into reaching them, the self-help books advise. This approach assumes we’ve identified our destination before beginning our journey. Life doesn’t work that way. Sometimes you don’t know where you’re going until you start moving. So move. Start where you are. Make a single brushstroke and see where it leads.\nShōnagon doesn’t describe the world. She describes her world. No observation is neutral. She knows what she likes and what she doesn’t. She subscribes to perspectivism, the philosophical theory advanced by Nietzsche centuries later. There is not one truth but many. Choose one, says Shōnagon. Make it your own.\nYou might object that it is a surplus, not a dearth, of opinions that bedevils us. Thanks to social media, anyone can opine about anything anytime. These opinions, though, are heavily mediated—by friends and “experts” and, most insidiously, algorithms. The result: we see the world through a cloudy lens; our convictions are paper thin. Do you like that new sushi joint or do you only think you do because people give it five stars? Is the Taj Mahal really beautiful or have all of those swooning Instagram posts merely convinced you it is? Sei Shōnagon strived to ensure her lens was clean and clear, her opinions wholly her own.\nFor every one thing Shōnagon likes there are three she finds unpleasant or disturbing or repulsive or, her ultimate smackdown, infuriating. Among these, she says: “A guest who arrives when you have something urgent to do. A very ordinary person who beams insanely as she prattles on and on. A dog that discovers a clandestine lover as he comes creeping in, and barks. Fleas. Someone who butts in when you’re talking and smugly provides the ending herself. (Indeed anyone who butts in, be they child or adult, is most infuriating.) Flies. A mosquito that announces itself with that thin little wail just as you’ve settled sleepily into bed. Rain all day on New Year’s Eve.”\nShōnagon is opinionated, but flexibly so. Consider the blossoms of a pear tree. The Japanese considered them ugly, and deployed them in insults, such as “he had a face like a pear blossom.” Yet the Chinese adored them, she notes, so “there must be something to it after all.” Sure enough, upon further reflection, she concludes they do possess a certain beauty. If you take a “careful and sympathetic look at it, you may notice that just at the tips of the petals there is the barest hint of a rather lovely luster.”\nLike Gandhi, Shōnagon was fussy. Consider this observation: “I cannot bear people who wear a white shirt that is slightly yellowed.” Normally this sort of fastidiousness irritates me no end, but I grow to appreciate Shōnagon. She’s not so much picky as she is sensitive.\nLike Epicurus, Shōnagon invents a taxonomy of pleasure. She distinguishes the merely pleasurable from the truly okashii, or delightful.\nDelight, unlike pleasure, contains an element of surprise, an unexpected frisson. And delight, unlike pleasure, leaves no bitter aftertaste. You never saw the delight coming so you don’t miss it when it’s gone.\nFor Shōnagon, the smallest detail can tip the balance. She approves of a three-layer fan, but not a five-layer one (“too thick, and the base looks ugly”). It is delightful when there’s a feeling of snow in the air but “it ruins the mood of the occasion if the skies are instead heavy with the threat of rain.” Hers is the philosophy of just-so-ism. Something is either just right or it is not right at all. Miss by an inch and you might as well have missed by a mile. An ox should have a tiny splash of white on its forehead, while cats should be completely black, “except for its belly, which should be very white.” Musical performances are delightful but only at night, “when you can’t see people’s faces.”\nSomething need not be perfect for Shōnagon to declare it delightful, but it must be appropriate. It must fit the mood, or the season. It must align with its essence. Thus “summer is best when it is extremely hot, winter when it is excruciatingly cold.”\nShōnagon engages all her senses but especially the olfactory. She de- lights in the “sudden unfamiliar smell of the ox’s leather crupper” and “taking a midday nap snuggled up under a lightly padded kimono that gives off a faint whiff of perspiration.” She adored “scenting frames,” wooden contraptions designed to infuse an article of clothing with the smell of a certain incense, and she enjoyed a good “scent-off,” fierce competitions to see who could mix the most aromatic incense.\nMost philosophers dismiss smell. Tomes have been written about the aesthetics of vision and the philosophy of music, yet hardly a word on scent. (Kant denied the sense any aesthetic status at all.) Yet smell is the most deeply rooted of senses. An infant as young as six weeks shows a strong preference for his mother’s scent over that of another woman. Smell triggers memory in ways the other senses do not. Sadly, smell is now the bastard sense. To say something “smells” is to imply it smells badly. If something is suspect, we say it “smells fishy.”\nAs Thoreau taught me, we only see what we’re prepared to see. Most of us are ill-prepared to see the small. Not Shōnagon. She knew our lives are nothing more, or less, than the sum of a million tiny joys. “Shaved ice with a sweet syrup, served in a shiny new metal bowl. A crystal rosary. Wisteria flowers. Snow on plum blossoms. An adorable little child eating strawberries. A tiny lotus leaf that’s been picked from a pond.”\nLike many Japanese, then and now, Shōnagon was fond of sakura, cherry blossoms. The trees are famously fleeting. They bloom for two or three days, and then are gone. Other flowers—plum blossoms, for instance—last considerably longer. Why go to such great lengths to cultivate something so fragile?\nThe Buddhist concept of mujo, or impermanence, holds clues. Life is ephemeral. Everything we know and love will one day cease to exist, ourselves included. Most cultures fear this fact. A few tolerate it. The Japanese celebrate it.\n“The most precious thing in life is its uncertainty,” wrote Yoshida Kenkō, a fourteenth-century Buddhist monk. He suggests we pay more attention to branches about to blossom or a garden strewn with faded flowers rather than blossoms in full bloom. The cherry blossom is lovely not despite its short life span but because of it. “Beauty lies in its own vanishing,” says Japan scholar Donald Richie.\nAppreciating life’s small, fleeting pleasures demands a loose grip. Hold them too tightly and they break. What has been said of Thoreau applies equally to Shōnagon. “He is paying attention to things, but he is not grasping them, manipulating them, trying to figure them out.”\nThis skill does not come naturally to me. My grip is too tight. I am always trying to figure things out, unearthing hidden meanings that may or may not exist. As for impermanence, it terrifies me.\nExcerpted from The Socrates Express, by Eric Weiner.

On the other hand, due to the fact that we run around 12, 000 trains per day and about 17.9 million passengers take them every day, JR East would annually consume 5 billion KWh as the power sources for train operations, stations, and office buildings. The amount of our consumption is equivalent to power approximate 1.4 million average homes. Considering our business that costs vast amount of energy, we have to make all the effort to reduce CO2 emissions in the long term. Therefore, JR East set in May 2020 a long-term environmental goal, “Zero-Carbon Challenge 2050” and will challenge “Net-Zero CO2 Emissions” by 2050 in order to make the contribution to limiting the rise in the global average temperature within 2℃.\nJR East not only procures the electricity we consume by buying from electric power companies but also generates in both thermal and hydroelectric power plants we own and renewable energy ones we developed with our subsidiary; we supply the electricity through our own power grid. By introducing cutting-edge environmental technologies in every aspects of our energy network shown above, we will proactively tackle the reduction of CO2 emissions. Additionally, we accelerate the innovation for the new technologies by collaborating with external entities such as energy suppliers, electric manufacturing firms and universities and laboratories.\nIn the following part, we will show some notable menus of our new challenge considered or researched in each aspect.\n- Challenge of “Creating”\n- Aligning with local communities, JR East will address more proactively new business projects of renewable energy and develop mega solar power plants and large-scale wind power generators, leading to the increase in the ratio which the renewable energy would account for in our energy creation. To complete these projects continuously, we will have difficulty in researching and identifying ideal areas, including the pre-consensus of the transmission of the renewable energy we will generate.\n- We will try to supply decarbonizing power by introducing electricity generators fueled by carbon-free hydrogen in our own thermal power plant. According to METI’s roadmap, however, it might take further 10 years to commercialize hydrogen-only combustion after the technology is expected to be establish in 2030’s. Additionally, it is essential to produce carbon-free hydrogen massively and install the infrastructures such as pipelines for supply in order to realize the roadmap.\n- Challenge of “Delivering & Storing”\n- JR East will develop the effective way to utilize and store the regenerative power generated by trains when stopping. Although installing regenerative power storage systems in the substations for our local lines, we need to overcome several obstacles to deploying them further; it is necessary to minimize the device, maximize the capacity, and prolong the duration.\n- We will deploy superconductive feeder in the power lines from electrical substations to wires to reduce dramatically the loss of electricity in delivering electricity. We need to overcome the following problems; the installment of freezers to maintain the superconductivity, the construction of relevant facilities along our railroad track, and the advance of cooling capacity enough to create energy-efficiency.\n- Challenge of “Utilizing”\n- JR East will develop the optimal driving patterns according to train lines that minimize the energy consumption when trains accelerate or break, introducing the individual patterns for each lines.\n- We will tackle the technology innovation to manufacture advanced energy-saving rolling stock.\n- We will try to invent the accumulator railcar train that can travel long distance and to commercialize fuel cell railcar using hydrogen in order to replace the rolling stocks for non-electrified sections. To complete the replacement, we have to clear several restrictions such as horsepower, travel distance, and maintenance cycle of railcars since the railroad condition varies line to line; some lines suffer from steep slope, another from heavy snow. To put fuel cell rail car in practical use, additionally, it is essential to establish the hydrogen supply chain network and utilize hydrogen as one of the major energy source universally in the society.\n- We will propel community development incorporating cutting-edge environmental technologies and energy solutionsand practice several strategies.\n- JR East will take measures towards carrying out carbon dioxide capture, storage and recycle. One major problem is to make the technologies practice such as the segregation and absorption of CO2; another is to seek and identify appropriate layers in the ground to store it.\nWe have taken advantage of several power sources: hydroelectric, thermal, solar, wind, and biogas power. Around 25% of the energy consumed during train operations were generated from renewable energy. Additionally, we have committed the reduction of CO2 emissions by replacing 98% of the rolling stock with energy-efficient railcars. As the global environmental problems such as climate change get serious, however, it is urgent that all of business entities including our company take further measures to handle these problems.\nTo solve various problems shown above and achieve the challenging goal we set, JR East will embark on the innovation beyond conventional perspectives. To realize the decarbonized society, we JR East group will challenge proactively.\n- JR East Press Releases “Zero-Carbon Challenge 2050”URL(Japanese only)\n- JR East Group Management Vision \"Move UP\" 2027\n- JR EAST Group Sustainability Report2019\nSimilar Innovation Challenges\nAccelarating the penetration of renewable energy resources with “Open Energy System”\nSony Group Corporation\nAchieving net-zero carbon emissions from plant factories using full artificial lighting\nAdvanced technology for buildings providing energy-saving and comfortable indoor environment (under Net Zero Energy condition)\nMitsubishi Electric Corporation\nAI control reduces base station power consumption by up to 50%\nBalancing greenhouse gas emissions and absorption by using bioplastics\nMitsubishi Chemical Holdings Corporation"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:e2ff404c-6f2b-43f5-a43d-af7a25883739>","<urn:uuid:393e4a65-6659-4f4c-ba7c-3b5c0ee2924e>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Which has longer games - vintage base ball or softball?","answer":"While vintage base ball follows baseball's format which traditionally has 9 innings per game, softball games are shorter with only 7 innings in a full game (and even fewer - 5 innings - in college leagues). The vintage base ball games were played in open pastures without modern amenities like dugouts or spectator stands, but the basic format followed baseball's 9-inning structure.","context":["On a green pasture a group of nine people in blue uniforms take up their positions. Their formation looks similar to the players on a baseball field. Except on this field there are no pitcher’s mound, dirt infield, dugouts or stands for spectators.\nOn one end of the pasture a man in a gray wool uniform and maroon cap paces intently with a bat on his shoulder. Behind the man with the bat stand a barn, a cabin and a gentleman who appears to be in charge. However he’s not dressed like an umpire but nattily attired in a top hat, vest and tie. On the opposite end of the pasture there is no outfield fence, just a line of trees leading into the woods.\nSuddenly the man in the top hat (the Judge) bellows “Striker to the line!” and the game is afoot. The game (or match) looks very similar to baseball but with a few differences: The pitcher (or bowler) throws underhanded as in a softball game, none of the field players (or ballists) wear gloves and an out is called when the ball is caught after the first bounce. When a ballist scores a run (or tally) his teammates yell out a hearty “Huzzah!” The game they are playing is not baseball as we know it today, but the game of base ball in its original form–when base ball was two words. (Sportswriters would condense the name to baseball in the late 1800s.)\nToday, vintage base ball is part athletic competition and part living history, like a reenactment at the Alamo. The game is played by the rules of base ball in the 1860s, long before there were ballparks or stadiums. Participants play in period uniforms, use period terms and have nicknames like Pepper, Cornbread or Cactus. Spectators who attend a game can enjoy a friendly competition and also learn about the origins of America’s favorite pastime and how the game evolved over time.\nFor instance, in vintage base ball a batter is out when the ball is caught after the first bounce. Barehanded, it is much easier to catch a ball on a bounce than in the air. Back in the early days of base ball, catching the ball on one bounce became commonplace. Fans (or cranks) began to heckle the ballists by calling them Muffins for making the easier play. This led to a rule change that only balls caught on the fly would be counted as outs. Catching a fly ball barehanded can really sting, so this rule led to the addition of a baseball glove.\nVintage base ball has become quite popular, with almost 500 teams in the United States and Canada. Here in the metroplex there are vintage teams in Farmers Branch (the Mustangs), Carrollton (the Elite), Irving (the Estelle) and Rockwall (the Retros). Recently the Heritage Farmstead Museum and the Plano Conservancy for Historic Preservation have partnered to start a team in Plano. The Plano Cats will make their 2016 debut at the Farmers Branch Historical Park’s Base Ball Festival on April 2nd.\nThe Plano Cats are currently looking for ballists to join their team for the April 2nd festival and for other games throughout the year. The team is open to males and females, 18 and over. No previous experience is necessary. It’s all about having a good ol’ time.","Softball and baseball are typically identical in many aspects but there are also major aspects that the two sports differ in. Ideally, softball borrows a lot from baseball especially in terms of how the sports are played. Most observers watching the two sports simultaneously may actually find it hard to point out the differences in these sports. Overall, the difference between softball and baseball isn’t that great as the key/fundamental essentials of either of the sport are similar to those of the other sport. Softball is majorly played by females and children while baseball is commonly played by males.\nRead my article “What Are The Differences Between Softball And Baseball?” below for more information.\nIn baseball, particularly at higher playing levels like in college leagues, there is a pitching mound where the pitcher throws the ball from. In softball, both at the lower and advanced levels there is no pitching mound. Pitchers in the softball throw the ball on the same level (ground) with the batter. Additionally, in baseball, the pitcher delivers the ball in an overhand or sidearm motion depending on their preference while in softball; the pitcher delivers the ball in only an underhand motion.\nThe pitching distance in baseball is different from that in softball. In baseball, this distance is roughly 18.44M (60ft6”) while the pitching distance in softball varies by level. For women’s amateur level, the distance is 12.19M (40 feet), 13.11M (43 feet) at high school level, and 14.02M (46 feet) at college & international leagues. The sloping mound in the pitching area in baseball area has a radius of 2.7M (9 feet) and has a maximum height of 25cm (10”). In softball, the flat circle in the pitching area has a 2.4M/8 feet radius.\nIn softball, the base paths are shorter than the paths in baseball by a few feet. When pitchers throw balls from a distance of 35 feet, the bases are at approximately 55 feet apart and while at 40 feet, the bases are at 60 feet apart. Since the base paths in softball are smaller, the infield area is also smaller than that in a baseball pitch. This affects the infielders’ defense.\nThere is a great variance between the outfield measurements in baseball and those in softball. The distance between the home plate and the outfield fence is 150 feet in softball for lower leagues and 225-250 feet for the upper leagues. The distance between the outfield fence and home plate in baseball is usually 300+ feet particularly for major leagues. However, despite these differences in distance, it is worth noting that both the fields for softball and baseball are laid out in the same way.\nBats used in baseball and softball differ in terms of length and barrel size. The bats used in baseball measure a maximum of 42 inches in length, although most bats except those used in international leagues measure 34 inches. These bats have a large sweet spot with a diameter of 2.75” and a 2 5/8 barrel size. The maximum drop for these bats is -3.\nOn the other hand, bats used in softball measure a maximum of 34 inches in length with lower leagues using bats of a shorter length. These bats have a maximum drop of 12 inches and are slender than baseball bats. The maximum diameter in these bats is 2.25”.\nSize of the Ball\nBalls used in baseball are smaller in size than those used in softball. Balls used for playing baseball have a circumference of 9 inches (229mm) while those used for softball have an 11-12 inches circumference and are less dense than baseball balls. A softball weighs approximately 6.25-7.0 ounces while a baseball weighs about 5.0 ounces.\nLength of game\nA full baseball game has 9 innings (6 in little league and 7 in high school leagues). On the other hand, a full softball game has 7 innings with the number of innings in college leagues being 5.\nThe two sports differ in how ties are broken. In baseball, a tie only comes about if both teams have the same score at the end of the 9th inning. When such is the case, the game proceeds to additional rounds until the tie is broken.\nIn softball, the concept of breaking the tie is the same only that in this sport, there is an extra aspect that is non-existent in baseball. This is whereby if the tie is not broken by the end of the 8th inning, the offensive team starts its turn at the bat when the player scheduled to bat at the ninth attempt placed at the second base. This player (often a runner) can be substituted through the provided substituting rules and each additional inning beginning with the runner being at the second base until the tie is broken.\nThere are great differences in this area like just in other areas of the sports. In baseball, a player (runner) can lead off/ attempt to steal at any time provided that the ball is in motion/live. However, in softball, a runner can only lead off after the ball has been released by the pitcher. Running at other times amounts to a fault and the opposing team scores a point.\nBaseball is taken more professionally as a career option as compared to softball. Typically, playing baseball professionally is by far well paying than playing softball. Career baseball players playing in a major league earn an average of $3.3-$4 million per season. Softball players playing the sport professionally are paid about 2,000-5,000 dollars every season. This disparity in the salaries of these sports is mainly accounted for by the fact that baseball has a lot more fans than softball. Coaches of softball earn a considerable amount of money at an average of 100,000 dollars every year depending on the teams they are coaching.\nUltimately, baseball and softball are quite similar even though there exists obvious differences between the two sports in addition to gender differences. The popularity of softball has been growing steadily over the past few years and the sport is now being played in several places all over the world. Despite these differences, both sports are fun and thrilling to play."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:8da18f05-aed0-4b6e-a931-6adaf5bfdded>","<urn:uuid:9c92f927-0805-4b4b-8ab9-5ac568762e64>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How does Day of the Dead combine ancient traditions with Catholic influences, and when exactly is it celebrated?","answer":"Day of the Dead represents a fusion of pre-Hispanic traditions and Catholic religious elements. It originated thousands of years ago with the Aztec, Toltec, and Nahua peoples, who viewed death as a natural part of life's continuum rather than something to mourn. Originally, these indigenous celebrations were held in early August and lasted nearly a month during the Aztec Empire. After the Spanish conquest, the celebration was moved to align with Catholic holidays - specifically November 1 (All Saints' Day) and November 2 (All Souls' Day). According to traditional beliefs, the gates of heaven open at midnight on October 31st, allowing departed children's spirits ('los angelitos') to reunite with their families for 24 hours, followed by adult spirits on November 2nd. The timing also coincides with the fall maize harvest.","context":["First time attending a Day of the Dead Celebration? Confused about the difference between Day of the Dead and Halloween? Esta bien. Check out these top 5 things to help you understand this festive Mexican holiday. ¡Disfrutar!\n1. A SHORT HISTORY OF DAY OF THE DEAD\nThe Día de los Muertos originated several thousand years ago with the Aztec, Toltec, and other Nahua people, who considered mourning the dead disrespectful. For these pre-Hispanic cultures, death was a natural phase in life’s long continuum. The dead were still members of the community, kept alive in memory and spirit—and during Día de los Muertos, they temporarily returned to Earth.\nToday’s Día de los Muertos celebration is a mash-up of pre-Hispanic religious rites and Christian feasts. It takes place on November 1 and 2—All Saints’ Day and All Souls’ Day on the Catholic calendar—around the time of the fall maize harvest. Traditions include building private altars honoring the deceased, using sugar skulls, marigolds, and the favorite foods and beverages of the departed, and visiting graves with these as gifts. Observance of the holiday in Mexican-American communities in the United States has become more important and widespread as the community grows numerically and economically.\nMany people believe that during the Day of the Dead, it is easier for the souls of the departed to visit the living. People will go to cemeteries to communicate with the souls of the departed, and will build private altars, containing the favorite foods and beverages, and photos and memorabilia, of the departed. The intent is to encourage visits by the souls, so that the souls will hear the prayers and the comments of the living directed to them. Celebrations can take a humorous tone, as celebrants remember funny events and anecdotes about the departed.\n3. WHAT'S UP WITH ALL THE SKELETONS?\nDuring Day of the Dead, life-size papier-mâché skeletons and miniature plastic or clay skeletons are everywhere. Why? Mexicans honor their ancestors on Day of the Dead, but they're also reminding themselves that death is just a part of life. Hanging out with skeletons reminds people that one day they will be skeletons. The skeletons are often posed doing all sorts of everyday things, such as playing guitar, taking a bath, or making tortillas.\n4. WHO IS LA CATRINA?\nThe La Catrina/El Catrin has also become one of the most recognized characters associated with Día de los Muertos . At Dia de los Muertos festivities throughout the Americas, we see more and more women, young and old, wearing fancy gowns and hats, and painting their faces to look like calaveras de azúcar, or sugar skulls. La Catrina has become the preeminent symbol of the afterlife and is la grand dame of all Dia de los Muertos festivities. But who is La Catrina?\nIn the early 20th century, Mexican political cartoonist and lithographer José Guadalupe Posada created an etching to accompany a literary calavera. Posada dressed his personification of death in fancy French garb and called it Calavera Garbancera, intending it as social commentary on Mexican society’s emulation of European sophistication. “Todos somos calaveras,” a quote commonly attributed to Posada, means “we are all skeletons.” Underneath all our manmade trappings, we are all the same. Today, La Catrina has grown to be much more than just a caricature of Mexican women denying their indigenous ancestry. Instead, she, and her male counterpart El Catrin, are now considered the faces of death in Mexico and in other parts of the world where Día de los Muertos is celebrated.\n5. IT'S NOT A MEXICAN \"HALLOWEEN\"\nWhile Halloween and Day of the Dead do share some common roots, they are totally different holidays. Rather than treating death as something dark and frightening, t he Day of the Dead is largely about laughing in the face of death, as represented by the ubiquitous calaveras and Catrinas, which are often depicted dancing or playing music. And though it is about remembering lost loved ones, the holiday is more a time to celebrate their memories than to mourn their loss.\nWe invite you to learn more about this festive Mexican tradition at the Utah Cultural Celebration Center 's Día de los Muertos Celebration on Saturday, October 27th from 11am-6pm.

This uniquely Mexican holiday has its roots in the indigenous culture of the central and southern parts of the country and was virtually unknown in the north until the latter part of the 20th century. However, in the 1960s, the Mexican government decided to use the Day of the Dead tradition as a means of unifying the country. It declared November 2nd a public holiday and the annual celebration is now observed throughout the country.\nThe Day of the Dead is an important tradition in Mexico. The origins of the celebration are based on the belief that the gates of heaven open at midnight each October 31 allowing the spirits of departed children, known as “los angelitos”, to reunite with their families for the next 24 hours. Then on November 2, deceased adults are honored and remembered.\nThis Mexican tradition dates back at least three thousand years. Back in the days of the Aztec Empire, the rites honoring the departed would begin in early August and would last nearly a month. But after the Spanish conquest, this indigenous holiday was moved to November 1 and 2 such that it would coincide with the Roman Catholic holidays of All Saints and All Souls Day.\nCelebrating the Day of the Dead\nIn many families, the tradition is for an area of the house is cleaned and set aside to make room for the altar that is the focal point of the ceremony. An altar is built and decorated with candles, buckets of wild marigolds known as cempasuchil, photographs of the deceased and religious symbols such as crosses and statues of the Virgin of Guadaloupe.\nTraditionally, a wash basin, razors and soap are left on the altar so the spirit can get cleaned up after their long journey. Sugar skulls representing the departed are placed on the shrine. Ofrendas (offerings) such the favorite foods, beverages and personal items belonging to the deceased are left for them as well. Families spend time around the altar, praying and telling stories about the departed.\nOn November 2nd, families go to the cemetery to visit the tombs of their relatives. They tidy up and decorate the graves of departed family members with marigolds and candles. And, they spread out blankets near the grave and have a picnic where the favorite foods of lost loved ones are on the menu.\nWhy Sugar Skulls?\nThe art of using sugar for artistic expression was brought to the New World by Italian missionaries in the 17th century. Mexico had plenty of sugar, but little hard currency to buy pricey church decorations imported from the European continent. Local artists began using sugar to create original artistic designs, including the skulls used to honor the deceased in the Day of the Dead celebrations.\nOriginally, these decorative skulls were meant to represent a particular individual whose name would be written on the skull’s forehead. These sugar skulls are placed on the altar or the gravestone to honor the spirit’s return.\nPan de Muerto\nAnother traditional food featured at Day of the Dead celebrations is Pan de Muerto, a round loaf of sweet egg bread. The top of the loaf is decorated with rolled strips of dough made to resemble bones. The bread is enjoyed at parties, festivals and at the cemetery where the living gather to celebrate the lives of the dead.\nAlthough making this dish at home can be time-consuming, here’s a Pan de Muerto recipe for those intrepid types who’d like to try making it themselves. Others can just pick up a loaf at the local bakery or “mini-super”.\nUntil next time …"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:f3030067-6069-4f05-bb6c-c300158deed1>","<urn:uuid:fdb280ca-7584-4fd6-8a80-57e14335981a>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Looking at bacterial adaptation mechanisms in microgravity vs. terrestrial environments, do E. coli and S. marcescens share any resistance pathways that work similarly in both conditions?","answer":"Both bacteria demonstrate adaptive antibiotic resistance mechanisms, though through different pathways. In microgravity, E. coli shows enhanced survival against normally lethal drug concentrations, with researchers investigating whether this is due to cellular adaptation/drug resistance acquisition or indirect effects of the biophysical environment. S. marcescens, on Earth, has specific resistance mechanisms through chromosomal AmpC genes that can be expressed to produce antibiotic-destroying beta-lactamase enzymes. Both can acquire resistance mechanisms, with S. marcescens able to obtain them from other bacteria, while E. coli in space shows adaptive responses that are still being studied through investigations like AES-1 to understand the exact mechanisms involved.","context":["By sheer strength of numbers, bacteria are by far the most successful life form on Earth. As we've learned over the past several decades of human spaceflight, they don't do too badly in microgravity either. For evidence, just look back on the astronauts and cosmonauts who were stricken with infections during their flights. At home, we have long-established and usually effective antibiotic treatments against most harmful bacteria. But previous studies have shown that in space, bacteria can survive and thrive in what would be fatal drug concentrations for them back on Earth. How is that possible?\nThat's a question of vital concern not just today, with International Space Station crews living together in confined spaces for months at a time, but for the future astronauts who will embark on long-duration missions to Mars and beyond. For those journeys, a quick emergency return to Earth won't be possible. Searching for the answer also helps researchers to understand the inner workings of bacteria as they seek to develop improved treatments for patients on the ground and in space.\nThe Antibiotic Effectiveness in Space (AES-1) investigation, scheduled to launch in January aboard the first contracted Orbital resupply flight to the space station, is a systematic attempt to probe the reasons for antibiotic resistance in space. \"Is the mechanism that's allowing this to occur some form of adaptation or drug resistance acquisition within the cell, or is it more of an indirect function of the biophysical environment, the changes due to microgravity and mass transport?\" asked AES-1 principal investigator David Klaus, Ph.D., of BioServe Space Technologies at the University of Colorado in Boulder.\nThe AES-1 investigation consists of 32 separate combinations of E. coli bacteria and various concentrations of a common antibiotic drug, either Gentamicin and Colistin. That experimental set is duplicated four times to provide a total of 128 separate data points for analysis. Upon return, researchers will check the samples for bacterial population growth. The samples will also be subjected to gene expression examinations by BioServe's study partner, HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology in Huntsville, Ala.\n\"The idea with this first round is to determine whether the cells actually grow in what should be an inhibitory level of drug, and if so, are there any correlations with specific changes in the gene expression?\" Klaus explained. Part of the AES-1 package will return to Earth with the SpaceX-3 mission in February 2014, with the remainder coming back on SpaceX-4 in the summer.\nWhile AES-1 won't be too labor-intensive in flight, it does require a certain degree of participation by the station crew. \"A few days into the mission, they'll go in and activate the 16 different group activation packs, and then periodically per the timeline they'll do a termination step on them,\" said Klaus. \"We've flown various forms of our payload, sometimes essentially completely autonomous and sometimes with direct crew interaction.\"\nBioServe is familiar with this type of design flexibility, with experience on 43 prior missions since 1991, including sounding rockets, Mir, space shuttle and space station flights. \"You essentially begin to trade off experimental volume for automation. The more automation you have, the less [experiment volume] you can generally accommodate because of the need for the electronics and supporting systems,\" said Klaus.\nAlthough Klaus and the research team plan to fly other bacterial species on future AES investigations, they decided E. coli was the best choice for this first flight. \"We would ultimately like to fly things that are more clinically relevant, but for this first round, because they're so well characterized and we in BioServe have flown a lot of previous work using E. coli, it made sense to stick with this primary line we've been using for a number of years,\" Klaus noted. \"We're going to hopefully answer the question fairly definitively in this case of whether they really are able to grow in these normally lethal levels of drugs. That's first and foremost, to repeat what's been seen in the past, but do so in a more systematic way and with a larger dataset.\"\nPerhaps the most fascinating question to be addressed by AES-1 will be the role of the microgravity environment in potentially promoting antibiotic resistance, because bacteria are almost beyond gravity's grasp. \"They're right on the threshold of being theoretically influenced by gravity directly,\" Klaus explained. \"They're so small that Brownian motion [the random motion of tiny particles struck by atoms and molecules] is almost, but not quite dominant. If they were much bigger, gravity quickly becomes a dominant factor, and if they were much smaller, gravity becomes effectively lost in the noise. So these have made interesting models to work with. A virus is a little too small, but bacteria are right in a gray zone of neither being convective nor diffusive dominated.\"\nAlready a major problem on Earth, increasingly resistant bacterial strains can be an even greater threat for space travelers, because spaceflight can also compromise the astronaut's immune system. Couple that with bacteria's ability to grow better and resist antibiotics in space, and as Klaus noted, \"that's not the right direction you want to have all those variables stacking up on you.\"\nThe hope is that a better understanding of how bacteria fight off drugs can lead to better ways to counter that resistance not only in space but back on Earth. The goal, Klaus said, is to \"use the knowledge gained from observing and characterizing these interactions in the absence of gravity primarily for terrestrial benefit and secondarily for long-term astronaut crew health protection.\"\nWe will always be outnumbered by harmful species of bacteria, but we can still prevail by maintaining and improving our arsenal of antibiotic weapons. The AES-1 investigation promises to be an important step in that quest, whether we encounter our bacterial foes on Earth, in orbit, or on future distant space voyages.\nExplore further: CU-Boulder to fly antibiotic experiment, education project on ants to space station","Serratia marcescens is an important clinical pathogen in human medicine today. Here, an infectious diseases pharmacist identifies 5 interesting things about this Gram negative bacterium.\nAuthored By: Timothy Gauthier, Pharm.D., BCPS-AQ ID\n[Last updated 17 September 2017]\nSerratia marcescens is a rod-shaped Gram negative bacterium of the Enterobacteriaceae family that was first described in 1819. It is found widely throughout the environment, including in the soil and water. It is associated with plants, insects, and animals.\nIn clinical practice it is the most common species of the genus Serratia to cause human infection and it has been found to cause urinary tract infection, meningitis, pneumonia, infective endocarditis, catheter-associated bloodstream infection, wound infection, and more.\nMany people in the health professions have likely heard of S. marcescens, but it is unlikely that many are familiar with this organism beyond the context of a few clinical conditions that it can cause. In an effort to call more attention to this important human pathogen and for the sake of sharing some interesting facts, the following is provided.\nHere, are 5 interesting things about Serratia marcescens…\n1. Serratia marcescens was named by a pharmacist\nThe first description of S. marcescens is from a man named Bartolomeo Bizio who was a pharmacist that resided in the Padua Province of Italy in the early 1800s. At that time polenta was an important food of the people, but the cornmeal dish was found to be discolored red during a particularly warm and humid summer. Many strains of S. marcescens have a red pigment, as shown in the picture below. Through experimentation Bizio was able to cultivate the organism from fresh polenta. He first published his findings anonymously, but later was acknowledged as the author.\nBizio chose the name S. marcesens after an Italian physicist named Sarafino Serrati who had pioneered work with steamboats. Like several others after him, Bizio believed the organism was a fungi, but more advanced technology later revealed it was actually a bacteria.\nInterestingly, S. marcescens has one of the most confusing taxonomies of any bacteria and was given 17 other names before finally being officially named in 1980.\n2. Serratia marcescens is likely responsible for a number of “miracles” in ancient times\nDue to the ability of S. marcescens to contaminate food products and turn them a reddish color, it is believed that it may be responsible for events described as miraculous, which occurred prior to our understanding of microorganisms.\nOne example is from 332 B.C. when bloody bread was said to foretell the fall of a city called Tyre, which was then overtaken. The history books have a number of references to “bleeding” bread that is likely the result of this organism. While the precise role S. marcescens played in the past will likely never be fully understood, it certainly makes you wonder how it may have influenced the course of history.\n3. For over 150 years Serratia marcescens was widely considered non-pathogenic\nS. marcescens has been used in many human experiments throughout history and one reason for this is because it was not widely accepted as a clinical pathogen in humans until after the 1970s.\nToday we know that S. marcescens is an important cause of infections in humans. Many of the studies previously performed in humans (of which many people were not aware they were participants) would be considered unethical today.\n4. The United States military used Serratia marcescens as a tracer organism while secretly conducing experiments on the civilian population\nSince S. marcescens is relatively easy to identify and was thought to be non-pathogenic, it has been used as a tracer organism for studying the movement of particles through air and water. From the 1940s into the 1960s the United States military utilized S. marcescens to conduct experiments on military bases and the general population.\nOne of the most well known experiments of this kind was performed on the population of San Francisco and within the New York City subway in 1950. These activities aimed to determine vulnerability to biological warfare attacks. At least one person in San Francisco is believed to have died from this experiment.\nThe use of S. marcesens by the U.S. military is well documented and more information on this can be found here.\n5. Serratia marcescens is the “S” in the “SPACE” organisms\nThe “SPACE” organisms are a group of bacteria that harbor genes within their chromosomes (e.g., AmpC), which if expressed, can cause the production of antibiotic-destroying beta-lactamase enzymes. The SPACE bugs are: Serratia, Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, Citrobacter, and Enterobacter. Exposure to antibiotics can cause these organisms to express AmpC, which in turn makes the organism multidrug-resistant and a challenge for clinicians to combat.\nBeing a SPACE organism and potential expresser of the AmpC gene makes S. marcescens notable in the world of antibiotic resistance. Beyond chromosomal-mediated resistance, it also has the ability to acquire resistance mechanisms from other bacteria and is intrinsically resistant to penicillin G, clindamycin, macrolides, glycopeptides, linezolid, and rifampin. Most isolates of S. marcescens are also resistant to aminopenicillins, narrow-spectrum cephalosporins, cephamycins, nitrofurantoin, and last-line antibiotic colistin. There is no antibiotic that is widely considered the drug of choice for S. marcescens.\n- Mahlen SD. Serratia infections: from military experiments to current practice.

{"question":"How do hospitalization rates for COPD compare between remote areas of Australia and the Appalachian region of the United States?","answer":"In Australia, people living in remote areas experience higher rates of COPD hospitalizations, with this being identified as one of three overlapping groups with elevated hospitalization rates. In the United States, the Appalachian region shows excessive COPD hospitalization risk, being one of the distinct geographic areas of concentration for high hospitalization rates. Both regions demonstrate significant geographic disparities in COPD hospitalizations, though the specific rates cannot be directly compared due to different measurement methods used in the studies.","context":["Mapping variation is an invaluable tool for understanding how our healthcare system is providing care, but gathering the data is only the first step. Understanding the underlying reasons for marked differences in the use of some health services across Australia, and considering how we can improve, are key for translating this work into better outcomes for patients.\nSometimes variation is expected, and even a good thing – for instance, when it reflects a response to differences in patient needs or choice of treatment options. When a difference in the use of health services does not reflect these factors, it is unwarranted variation and represents an opportunity for the health system to improve. This improvement may involve increasing access to treatment options that produce better outcomes for patients, or reducing treatment with little or uncertain benefit.\nThis Second Australian Atlas of Healthcare Variation examines variation in 18 clinical items. It paints a picture of variation in the use of a number of interventions not covered in the first Atlas, such as hospitalisations for appendicectomy and caesarean section in younger women. Some interventions are investigated in this Atlas to build on the findings from the first Atlas – for example, examining hysterectomy and endometrial ablation separately, and examining rates of cataract surgery using a more comprehensive dataset.\nThe Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care (the Commission) has consulted widely to interpret the data in the second Atlas. Clinicians, policymakers, epidemiologists, researchers and consumers have helped us identify the likely drivers of variation for each type of hospitalisation examined and, most importantly, what needs to be done to improve care. The Atlas contains a number of clear recommendations based on the best available evidence.\nWe have aimed not simply to identify an issue, but to identify specific and achievable paths for improvement and further exploration.\nWhat are the reasons for variation?\nSystem factors that favour particular treatment options may explain variation in use of some procedures. For example, higher rates of hysterectomy in some areas of Australia and a higher rate in Australia than in other comparable countries could be due in part to lower uptake of less invasive alternatives, such as the levonorgestrel intrauterine system and endometrial ablation to manage heavy menstrual bleeding. Awareness and availability of less invasive treatments could see more women deciding to receive more conservative evidence-based treatments as an alternative to hysterectomy.\nVariation can also stem from ‘indication creep’, where the use of a procedure or treatment grows beyond the original patient group in which it was trialled and shown to be valuable. A lack of evidence in this new patient group can then lead to clinicians having widely different beliefs about which patients are most likely to benefit from the procedure. For example, lumbar spinal fusion was initially used to treat spinal deformities and fractures, but the use of this operation has extended; it is now also used in some instances when people have symptoms arising from degenerative disease. The variation in use now may reflect differences in clinician opinions on the efficacy of the procedure in this newer patient group.\nFor other items in the Atlas, the major contributors to variation are clear, although the specific factors may differ between areas. Higher rates of hospitalisation for conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and diabetes can be explained partly by higher rates of the conditions in some areas of Australia. Differences in the implementation of integrated care, which can help prevent people with chronic diseases deteriorating, are also likely to contribute to the variation in hospitalisations for these conditions. Some hospitalisations for chronic diseases are inevitable. However, the magnitude of the difference between areas of Australia and the sheer number of patients hospitalised highlight the need to do better – in both preventing the underlying conditions and enabling people with chronic diseases to stay as well as they can be.\nThe patterns in the Atlas also tell a story about inequity. Three often overlapping groups had higher rates of hospitalisations for the chronic diseases examined: people living in remote areas, people living in areas of socioeconomic disadvantage, and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. A whole-of-health‑sector approach, and indeed a whole-of-government approach, is needed to make changes that ensure that all Australians have an equal chance for good health.\nWhere to from here?\nMore effective models of care\nSuboptimal health care in the community can contribute to conditions worsening to the point where hospitalisation is necessary. For example, if diabetes is not well managed, patients risk developing diabetic foot disease. In the most severe cases, this can lead to hospitalisation and amputation of the affected toes, foot or lower leg.\nA fundamental component of system changes to reduce these potentially preventable hospitalisations must be a shift to a better integrated primary care system, with a stronger role in coordinating care.1 Critically, health systems also need to better support patients with chronic disease to reduce the progression of conditions such as COPD, diabetes and heart failure, to minimise disability and improve patients’ quality of life.\nThe implementation of a Health Care Home model, currently being trialled by the Australian Government Department of Health, could greatly improve appropriateness and coordination of care for patients with multiple chronic and complex conditions.1The Health Care Home model supports integrated and coordinated team care, and targets the most intensive health services to those with the greatest needs.2 The model allows better sharing of information between patients and members of the healthcare team using My Health Record. Evidence‑based planning tools created for Health Care Homes further support high-quality care. Trials of similar models in the United States have shown reductions in hospitalisations, as well as reduced costs.3\nIn the management of specific conditions, we can learn from examples of things going right –the Atlas contains many such positive stories, where clinical teams are leading the delivery of best achievable care. For example, an Australian multidisciplinary, integrated primary and secondary care diabetes service in Brisbane has approximately halved the rate of hospitalisations due to diabetes complications.4 The success of this model is particularly encouraging given that the patients had complex type 2 diabetes and were from socioeconomically disadvantaged areas.\nMaking health care truly accessible for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians\nMuch higher rates of the potentially preventable hospitalisations examined in the Atlas among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians compared with other Australians point to poor access to appropriate care in the community, as well as a higher burden of the factors causing chronic diseases, such as social disadvantage, smoking and obesity. Conversely, for some procedures, such as cataract surgery, the substantially lower rates of treatment despite a higher prevalence of poor sight due to cataract indicate inadequate service delivery, which is not tailored to the population’s needs.\nFor Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians, availability of health services in urban and regional centres does not necessarily equate to accessibility.5Services need to be not only affordable and physically accessible, but also culturally safe. For Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians living in remote areas, physical distances compound the challenges to accessing culturally safe health care.\nThe National Safety and Quality Health Service (NSQHS) Standards, developed by the Commission, provide a nationally consistent statement about the level of care consumers can expect from health service organisations. Accreditation to the NSQHS Standards is mandatory for all hospitals and day procedure facilities. The NSQHS Standards (second edition) include a number of actions that focus specifically on providing care for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. These include strategies to improve the cultural competency and cultural awareness of the health workforce to meet the needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander patients, and health services working in partnership with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians from local communities to meet their healthcare needs.\nAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander staff are key to engaging with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander patients, and a sufficient number of trained Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health workers is essential for service success. Several innovative models of care have reduced hospitalisations and improved health outcomes among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. For example, a model of out-of-hospital health care has produced encouraging reductions in hospitalisations among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in both urban and remote areas of Western Australia. The program is based on nurse‑led coordination of care, and partnerships with Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services, general practitioners, allied health professionals, specialist doctors and other community health workers.6 Significant decreases in hospitalisations and emergency department presentations, and improved attendance at out-of-hospital appointments were seen during the four-year evaluation of the program. Outreach services are also showing promise. For example, a home-based outreach case management program that provides holistic, multidisciplinary care for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians with diabetes has achieved significant improvements in blood pressure and diabetes control.7\nPreventing chronic conditions\nSmoking is a contributor to many of the chronic conditions examined in the Atlas. The smoking rate among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians was 41% in 2014–15, more than twice the rate among non-Indigenous Australians.8 Addressing smoking, particularly among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians, people at socioeconomic disadvantage and people living in remote areas, could help reduce the disparity in potentially preventable hospitalisations seen in these groups and the hospitalisation rate for smoking‑related conditions overall.9 Supporting healthy eating and physical activity through prevention programs and supportive environments also has great potential to prevent obesity and reduce rates of many conditions highlighted in the Atlas, particularly type 2 diabetes and coronary heart disease. Reducing rates of obesity would also have a substantial impact on the prevalence of osteoarthritis of the knee and the demand for knee replacement.\nGreater use of health technology\nTechnology is part of the solution for improving access to health care in remote areas. Telehealth is being used effectively in some parts of Australia.10 However, this technology has the potential for much wider use to improve access to health care in regional and remote areas. For example, a trial of telephone support for people with heart failure in rural and regional areas has shown a 30% reduction in rates of death or hospitalisation compared with usual care.11\nPatients as active partners in their care\nSo much in health is about self-care. The huge potential for lifelong good health depends on individual understanding of the importance of good food, a healthy weight and regular exercise. People also need to be able – and motivated – to eat well and exercise. When illness occurs, it is the patients themselves who need to take their diabetes medications every day, quit smoking or do the exercises to manage their back pain. Supporting patients to be active and effective partners in their health care has the potential to greatly improve health outcomes.12,13\nAddressing health literacy is vital to ensure that patients understand health information and have the confidence to act on it. Improving health literacy and the quality of health information will also help patients evaluate treatment options through understanding their risks and likely benefits. This is particularly important for procedures with uncertain benefits and risks of long-lasting consequences.\nBetter use of data\nCollecting data through clinical quality registries on symptoms before treatment and clinical outcomes, including patient-reported outcomes, will fill gaps in knowledge where the evidence on benefits is unclear. This is particularly important for new surgical techniques and devices, and use of established procedures in new patient groups that are likely to have a major impact on patient outcomes or health system use.\nOne of the issues with health data collection in Australia and elsewhere is that information about the health care that patients receive is split across multiple collections, such as hospital statistics, Medicare Benefits Schedule and Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme datasets. It is difficult to form an accurate picture of healthcare quality without tracking experiences across these data divides, but this has proved difficult. Linking data from different sources can let us drill down more deeply into the patterns of healthcare use, and gives a more detailed picture of the investigation and treatment of health problems. For example, linked data could show whether someone who has a heart attack in a regional area of Australia has the same chance of having the recommended investigations and treatment as someone in the city. The data could also show whether, following a heart attack, people have equal access to good secondary preventive care, regardless of where they live. Better access to linked data inthe future will allow this kind of detailed analysis on a national scale.\nData are also a tool for health services to examine their practice at a local level. The data in the Atlas allow comparison of rates of particular interventions in local areas, and should prompt reflection on the underlying reasons where large variation is found.\nThe patterns shown in the maps in this Atlas and the accompanying commentaries show that there are many opportunities for making meaningful changes in Australia’s delivery of health care. Our recommendations highlight that action is needed at all levels – from addressing the social determinants of health through to better data collection, system changes and providing the best supports for individual clinician–patient interactions.","Geographic disparities in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) hospitalization among Medicare beneficiaries in the United States\nJames B Holt, Xingyou Zhang, Letitia Presley-Cantrell, Janet B Croft\nNational Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA\nBackground: Hospitalizations for persons with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) result in significant health care resource use and excess expenditures. Despite well-documented sociodemographic disparities in COPD outcomes, no study has characterized geographic variations in COPD hospitalization across the US.\nMethods: Almost 3.8 million COPD hospitalization records were extracted from Medicare claims for 1995–2006, and the total population of eligible Medicare beneficiaries was extracted from the Medicare enrollment records to calculate COPD hospitalization rates by Health Service Area (HSA), (n = 949). Spatial cluster analysis and Bayesian hierarchical spatial modeling were used to characterize the geography of COPD hospitalizations.\nResults: The overall COPD hospitalization rate was 11.30 per 1,000 beneficiaries for the aggregated period 1995–2006. HSA-level COPD hospitalization rates had a median of 11.7 and a range of 3.0 (Cache, UT) to 76.3 (Pike, KY). Excessive hospitalization risk was concentrated in Appalachia, the southern Great Lakes, the Mississippi Delta, the Deep South, and west Texas. In the Bayesian spatial mixture model, 73% of variability of COPD hospitalization relative risk was attributed to unidentified regional social and physical environments shared by HSAs rather than to unique local HSA factors (27%).\nConclusion: We discovered distinct geographic patterns in COPD hospitalization rates and risks attributed to both regionally-shared environmental risk factors and HSA-unique environmental contexts. The correlates of these geographic patterns remain to be determined. Geographic comparisons of COPD hospitalization risk provide insights for better public health practice, policies, and programs for COPD prevention.\nKeywords: COPD prevention, environmental risk factors, public health, population\nThis work is published and licensed by Dove Medical Press Limited.

{"question":"What does the process of ethnic succession look like in both Bushwick, NY and Chicago's Little Village? When did these neighborhoods become predominantly Latino?","answer":"Little Village became predominantly Latino in the 1970s, with the 1980 census confirming its Latino majority. It developed as an extension of Pilsen and became known as the 'Mexican suburb' due to its proximity to Pilsen and its larger homes. Meanwhile, Bushwick's Latino community grew significantly earlier, with working-class Latino residents settling there through the 1970s and 1980s. By the 1990s, Bushwick was predominantly Latino, though the neighborhood faced challenges from the crack epidemic in the 1970s and 1980s. Both neighborhoods represent significant Latino population centers in their respective regions - Little Village is part of the largest Latino concentration in the Midwest, while Bushwick became an important Latino working-class community in New York City. However, both areas are now experiencing pressures from gentrification that threaten these established Latino communities.","context":["Displacement won’t be stopped unless new residents of gentrifying neighborhoods join the organizing efforts that already exist\nIN the past few decades, New York City’s Latino neighborhoods have witnessed the continued displacement of their working class communities by the influx of young artists and professionals from other neighborhoods. In Bushwick, this transformation has been gaining momentum, sharply increasing the property values and rental costs in this previously low-income community. Jose Lopez, an organizer at Make the Road New York, a community advocacy organization in the neighborhood, was interviewed as part of the oral history project “Cities for People, Not for Profit: Gentrification and Housing Activism in Bushwick”. Here he shares his experience of seeking justice for Latino working class tenants in Bushwick who are being displaced. He talks about the parallels between artists and long-term Latino residents and explores how these groups can join forces to fight for fair housing in the area, while providing some alternative frameworks for future action.\nYou’ve been living in Bushwick since 1988. What were the conditions like, and what changes have you seen?\nI’ve been rocking with this organization since ’99, so I’ve been here as a leader and as a staff person for 15 years. Obviously, in the ’70s, ’80s, there were the fires; crack hit the streets of New York City pretty hard. Bushwick was one of those areas devastated by the crack epidemic, leading up into the ’90s, where groups like El Puente and others were starting to put their boots on the ground with local churches to try and figure out ways residents can help to transform the neighborhood into a community that would better serve their needs. So we started to see some of that transition in the ’90s, lots of folks from Bushwick doing anything and everything they could to rebuild the community.\nThen, into the early 2000s, we saw some transition. The thing I remember being the indicator was a 2005 article in the New York Times titled, “Have You Heard About Bushwick?” It was really a marketing pitch to folks from across the city, across the state, outside the state, to come into this neighborhood—which was for years and years completely ignored—and marketing it to folks as the next up-and-coming hot spot. That was when I became really concerned about the direction that Bushwick was moving in.\nWhat were the kind of politics that your family was involved in? Was there any sort of activity growing up that you witnessed that influenced you?\nI was probably 14 when I got started with the organization. It was a team of us, about six young people, high school students. Our very first campaign, in’ 99, was called the Wise Up Campaign. It was to address the lack of youth services in Bushwick. So we were doing the usual: organizing, building a movement of students in New York City and meeting with our local elected officials, with the mayor—Giuliani at the time—and figuring out what city dollars could be funneled out of other areas that didn’t necessarily support the growth of a young person, so that we would be able to do something like build a community space, something for young people to be involved in but also a place young people could help shape.\nThe fight then was the same fight that we’ve seen year after year ever since. The city says there’s absolutely no funding in communities like Bushwick to be able to build these kinds of programs and services. So that was a fight for about a year and a half. While the Giuliani era was transitioning into the Bloomberg era, there was $64.6 million earmarked to expand two youth jails in East New York and Mott Haven, in the Bronx, that were at that time only at 60 to 70 percent capacity. At the same time the city was telling us there’s no funds, they wanted to build more jail beds for young people like me. So we engaged in that fight and eventually won and got $53 million taken out of that pot and reinvested in youth education.\nIt’s those kinds of battles folks in Bushwick have been fighting for a long, long time—things we know address the real needs of the African and Latino population of Bushwick and of low-income communities across New York.\nHow do we figure out who’s entitled to what with these trends toward displacement of long-term residents? How do organizations such as Make the Road New York provide positive working examples that don’t necessarily focus so much on displacement but reinvestment in the community?\nFor us organizationally, our stance is politics and policy. We live in a capitalist country, so the idea, not just in Bushwick but across the country, is that they’re going to put profit over people. That is the idea of most homeowners across New York. It’s definitely the idea of the real estate board of New York, the most powerful players in the housing game right now in regard to housing policy and politics. It’s important to understand this system where folks can capitalize and take advantage of others.\nSo for us in Bushwick, there was this tension in the early 2000s. Is it fight against folks who don’t look like us, white artists moving in who are taking over the apartments that we built with our own sweat to have access to a more affordable rent than in Williamsburg or the Lower East Side or other places that have also been gentrified? Or is that a losing fight to go after the new renters? Do we go after winning on substantive policy change to prevent displacement in the first place? So it took a little while for the neighborhood to have that conversation and figure out that that’s really where we need to transform our energy.\nI can argue with my neighbor who’s white all day long about why they decided to take the apartment, given its history, given the fact that maybe Juana and her three kids have been living there for 15 years and it was the only place in Bushwick they could afford, but that doesn’t change the situation in that moment. We can still have that conversation in a way that builds, so that we can figure out how to keep whatever’s left of the affordable Bushwick affordable. But I think ultimately the energy of New York City has to be geared into changing policies both at the city and state levels to prevent displacement in the first place.\nWhen you look at city code, when you look at state code, every single housing law across the country is designed to be pro landlord, pro building owner, not pro tenant. Until we transform that, families who are working class are going to get the shit end of the stick, not just in Bushwick, but in New York City. Costs are rising in every borough.\nWhen we talk about the issues facing local community residents, do you see any parallels with the younger artistic community that’s moving into the area? Is there room for collaboration with those populations?\nOrganizationally we have 14,500 members, all of whom are Latino immigrants, most of whom are monolingual Spanish speakers. So in terms of community coordination, it’s a hard field to navigate for a number of reasons. A, we’re still not past that point where folks aren’t still upset about the fact that new community members are moving in. B, there’s the language barrier. But I feel like we’ve done a pretty good job keeping our focus on policy. Dialogue is welcome. We want to have open dialogue.\nBut we also want to make sure that folks coming into the neighborhood respect the fact that some of us who have been living here all our lives know the game and have been doing this for a long time. So there are just some things that have been happening, trying to reinvent the wheel, or using language that is less inclusive of everyone. It’s those kinds of things that we want to stay away from. I’ve seen some mission statements from local artists in Bushwick who are talking about being the innovators of art in Bushwick, as if art never existed in this neighborhood before the existence of white people.\nBut again, the real problem is how fast the cost of living in New York City is rising. The reality is that it’s a problem for our members here, but it’s also a problem for the new folks moving into Bushwick. It’s not a problem that only goes after black and brown folk, although as the poorest New Yorkers, they feel the biggest burden right now. When you look at how we’re determining affordability—for example, in New York, a family of four, based on the area median income, it’s listed at $89,000. I don’t know many folks, artists or nonartists, black or white or brown, who are making $89,000 a year for their families. I think it’s a universal issue. We’ve just got to figure out how to get past some of those barriers to address it together.\nWhat would you think are the biggest challenges to bridging those divides? What’s already been attempted—reaching out to other populations who have similar concerns here in Bushwick?\nIn terms of recent fights, we saw some stuff go down in Queens and Bushwick about rezoning. We’re at about 8.5 million people in this city. We’ll get to 9 million by 2030. So there’s this question of how do you accommodate that number in a city that has such sparse land. Building up is the way to do that. Right now, there are already laws that exist in regard to air rights and how far up developers can build. What started under the Bloomberg administration, and what’s continuing to happen under the de Blasio administration is folks are creating housing plans to be able to build massive amounts of housing in New York, to be able to accommodate the growing population we have in this city.\nTo do that, they’ve had to—and they will continue to—rezone particular pockets of New York City. They will choose communities like Bushwick, for example, Flushing and Bushwick Avenue, and they will rezone pieces of land to give developers the right to build very high. Between 2005 and 2011, the Bloomberg housing plan was that we were going to build 150,000 or so units. So he built 100,000 of those units between ’05 and 2011 in a hundred different rezoning processes. There were a hundred different rezoning fights. What we saw is that local communities weren’t ready to engage in those fights, weren’t ready to negotiate community benefits agreements that entitled those communities to the jobs, to the apartments at affordable rates, etc. Out of 100,000 units built in those six years, only 1,900 were actually affordable; which is less than 2 percent.\nThat was a huge lesson learned for communities: to be able to say, Man, they’re building all this shit, but who are they building it for? They’re definitely not building it for folks who are earning $30,000, $40,000, or $50,000. Right now, the current mayor has a housing plan, again, to preserve and/or create 200,000 units. He is going to be rezoning, very similarly to the way that happened under Bloomberg, but because of the lesson learned, it’s a time for us to engage in that fight in a different way. We know that rezonings are happening. They’ve already started.\nSo the question is how do we make sure that local communities are equipped with the tools on the ground to stop big-time developers from developing shit in the neighborhoods that doesn’t reflect the needs of the people who are already there?\nAs an organization we’re part of the Real Affordability for All Coalition. What we believe is very simple: Developers who want tax breaks, incentives, and who want to build huge luxury housing, the motto up until this point has been 80 percent market, 20 percent affordable. We think that’s bullshit. We think that has gone out with the Bloomberg administration. We know that the current administration has been talking about 70/30 to do some more. We still think that’s bullshit.\nWe think that 50/50 is fair. The lowest income earners make up the largest body of residents in New York. Service jobs like the fast food industry, where folks are only making $8 an hour, are the fastest growing jobs in New York now. So if we’re growing our job market but only paying people the minimum wage, we’re also growing the housing stock, but making it not affordable to the same people, then we have a problem. So we think, Cool, you want to rent 50 percent or sell 50 percent of the stock as high as you can get? Fine, do that. But 50 percent should be truly affordable, starting at the lowest income earner, which are the minimum wage earners who, on an annual level, are making about $16,000 a year. Let’s start the conversation there.","Chicago is famous for its ethnic neighborhoods. And there’s a funny thing about them. A neighborhood’s identity can seem like it has been in place forever, even when big ethnic shifts took place just one or two generations ago. This is how many Chicagoans see Pilsen and Little Village, a corridor with the biggest concentration of Latinos in the Midwest. These neighborhoods have so much vitality — dense housing, bustling commercial strips, packed playgrounds — that it seems like Latinos must have been there for ages. A curious citizen named CM! Winters-Palacio was wondering how long, so she asked us:\nWhy are Latinos concentrated in the Pilsen and Little Village neighborhoods? When did it happen?We answered the when part of the question just by looking at census numbers: Pilsen did not become mostly Latino until the 1960s; Little Village didn’t until the 1970s. Answering why those changes happened took a little more work. We interviewed experts, searched newspaper archives, pounded Pilsen’s pavement and tracked down some of the neighborhood’s first Latino residents. In our audio story (above), Lucy Gutiérrez, 87, tells us about bringing her family to Pilsen when the place was still populated mainly by Central and Eastern European descendants — including the Bohemians whose forebears named it after Plzeň, a city in what is now the Czech Republic. Our research also led to some text snapshots from the history. The snapshots begin on Chicago’s Near West Side, which included the city’s largest Latino enclave just a few decades ago.\nIn old neighborhood, the beginning of the end\nFEBRUARY 15, 1949: A Chicago housing official complains about residents refusing to leave a 14-block stretch from Desplaines to Paulina streets to make way for a new superhighway along Chicago’s Congress Street. The official, Detlef E. Mackelmann, says some would not go “until the buildings next door were being torn down.” The highway’s first section, completed in 1955, will displace thousands of people. It will be among several massive construction projects that will raze much of the Near West Side, including a Mexican neighborhood that dates back to the 1920s. The projects will include three expressways, a university campus and public-housing developments. Some of those Mexicans will move to Pilsen, a neighborhood just south. They will form the nucleus of what will become a much bigger Latino community. The Congress highway, for its part, will eventually be named the Eisenhower Expressway. 1\nWhite exodus from Pilsen makes room for newcomers\nOCTOBER 18, 1953: St. Procopius, a 72-year-old Czech parish in Pilsen, rededicates its school with a Sunday dinner. The meal includes turkey, dumplings, sauerkraut, rye bread and kolacky. The music includes the Czech anthem “Kde domov můj?” and an Antonín Dvořák composition. Although the school has begun to enroll some of Pilsen’s first Latino children, today’s program includes no hint of their cultures. And Rev. Peter Mizera, the St. Procopius priest, has been complaining to the archdiocese about “the recent infiltration of the Mexicans.” But Pilsen’s white population is declining and growing older as young families head to suburbs. St. Procopius and other parishes will have to open their doors to Latinos. By 1955, six Pilsen parochial schools will be enrolling Mexican children. Over the next two decades, several Pilsen parishes will retool themselves, sending priests to learn Spanish in Mexico, building altars and shrines to the Virgin of Guadalupe, even bringing mariachi music into masses. Some other parishes, slow to adapt, will close. 2\nCampus construction pushes more Latinos into Pilsen\nMARCH 19, 1961: Led by a mariachi band, hundreds of Mexican protesters march from St. Francis of Assisi Church and tie up Near West Side traffic. The protesters slam a City Hall plan to replace their neighborhood with a University of Illinois campus. They blame Mayor Richard J. Daley and shout, “Down with Daley,” “Daley sold us out” and “Respeten nuestros hogares” (Respect our homes). The protest is part of a much larger effort to derail the university plan. Italians, the area’s biggest ethnic group, are leading the resistance but Mexicans are also visible. Roughly 4,800 of them live in the census tracts the city wants the university to take over. The resistance will fail. On May 10, the City Council will designate 106 acres for the campus. Some of the Mexicans will move a few blocks west, but campus expansions will displace them again. Many will end up in Pilsen. The University of Illinois Chicago Circle Campus, meanwhile, will open in 1965. 3\nChicano movement builds neighborhood’s new identity\nAPRIL 24, 1969: More than 100 residents of Chicago’s Pilsen neighborhood gather for a public meeting of the Latin American Alliance for Social Advancement, known by its Spanish acronym, ALAS. The meeting occurs at Howell House, a community center focused for decades on Czech immigrants. At the meeting, ALAS endorses Arthur Vázquez to lead Howell House; he will be its first Mexican-American director. The meeting also develops strategies to improve Pilsen schools, expose police brutality and publicize a national grape boycott. The organizing reflects two major changes in Pilsen. First, Mexicans have been pouring into the neighborhood for two decades. Along with the arrivals from the Near West Side, many have come from South Texas or various parts of Mexico. A smaller Latino group in Pilsen has roots in Puerto Rico. The 1970 census will record the neighborhood’s first Latino majority. The other big change is the rise of the Chicano civil-rights movement. Reflecting that change, Howell House will get a new name: Casa Aztlán. 4\nLatino community expands west to Little Village\nOCTOBER 30, 1979: At the urging of Latinos and veterans, the Chicago Park District board agrees to a proposed memorial plaza honoring Manuel Pérez Jr., a World War II hero killed by enemy fire at age 22 and posthumously awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor. Pérez grew up on the city’s Near West Side long before his neighborhood was razed and before many of its Mexican residents moved to Pilsen. The city will build the plaza in 1980 in Little Village, a Southwest Side neighborhood known as the “Mexican suburb” because of its proximity to Pilsen, its larger homes, and its fast-growing Latino population. Next year’s census will show that Latinos constitute the majority of Little Village residents. The Pilsen and Little Village corridor now has the largest concentration of Latinos in the Midwest. 5\nNeighborhoods help put a Latino politician in CongressMARCH 17, 1992: In a Democratic primary election for U.S. House, Chicago Ald. Luis V. Gutiérrez (26th Ward) easily defeats his strongest challenger, Juan Soliz. A 1990 court order required a Chicago district with a Latino majority. Shaped like an earmuff, the district covers the Pilsen-Little Village corridor and Puerto Rican neighborhoods on the Northwest Side. Gutiérrez, who was an ally of the late Mayor Harold Washington, has Mayor Richard M. Daley’s backing in the Congressional race. After the general election, Gutiérrez will become the first Midwest Latino in the House. Although his family is from Puerto Rico, whose residents are born with U.S. citizenship, Gutiérrez will champion immigrant political causes and maintain strong support in Pilsen and Little Village. 6\nPilsen remains Latino, but for how long?\nMAY 20, 1997: In the name of job creation, Ald. Danny Solis (25th) leads a rally for a plan that would extend the University of Illinois at Chicago southward to the edge of Pilsen. The Daley administration, meanwhile, is planning a tax-increment financing district to boost industry in Pilsen. Some residents are linking those efforts to gentrification on the neighborhood’s east end. Those residents say the changes are threatening Pilsen’s Mexican-American character and pushing rents and property taxes too high. This summer, artists led by Hector Duarte (7) will transform an outdoor wall at 1805 S. Bishop St. into a colorful mural called “Stop Gentrification in Pilsen.” The mural will depict United Farm Workers co-founder César Chávez and Mexican revolutionary leader Emiliano Zapata flanking a multigenerational Pilsen family, a pushcart vendor and anti-gentrification protesters. Such efforts will not stop affluent newcomers from moving into Pilsen but, for years to come, the neighborhood will remain the cultural heart of the Chicago area’s Mexican-American community. 8\nWinters-Palacio chairs Malcolm X College’s library department and tells us her interests include community development and racial segregation. So what does she think of our answer to her question? Pilsen’s Latino identity is “relatively new,” Winters-Palacio says. “It helps dispel one of the myths.” Namely, that a strong community must have long historical roots. Winters-Palacio says Pilsen and Little Village provide hope for her part of town.\n1.

{"question":"Compare the size of Villa Borghese Gardens (80 hectares) with the Gunung Leuser National Park in Sumatra - which is larger and by how much?","answer":"Gunung Leuser National Park is significantly larger than Villa Borghese Gardens. While Villa Borghese Gardens covers 80 hectares, Gunung Leuser National Park spans 862,975 hectares (8,629.75 km²), making it approximately 10,787 times larger than the Roman park.","context":["The Villa Borghese Gardens is an English inspired landscape garden in Rome, Italy. It is located North of the Spanish Steps and has two entrances. The park covers 80 hectares and is the third largest park in Rome, after Villa Doria Pamphili and Villa Ada. It is also known as Park of Museums since it is home to several museums in Rome. The park also has statues, fountains, temples and a human-made lake.\nThe park was originally a vineyard. Its transformation into a park was started in 1605 by Cardinal Scipione Borghese, nephew of Pope Paul V. He wanted to create a villa with the biggest gardens in Rome. The famous architect Flaminio Ponzio built the villa following sketches from the Cardinal. The gardens’ initial landscapes done by Domenico were formal with geometric shapes. Cardinal Scipione used the villa as a suburban villa, to host parties and house his art collection.\nThe park was later given a more natural touch. At the end of the 18th century, a human-made lake was created in the middle, with an island hosting a temple dedicated to the god of healing is built. In the 19th century, the park's landscape was remade with an English taste. The city of Rome bought the garden from the Borghese family and it became a public park in 1903.\nVillas in the Garden\nThere are three main villas in Borghese gardens. The main villa, Villa Borghese Pinciana houses the famous art gallery, Galleria Borghese. It also has another gallery, called Casino Borghese. It is made up of sculptures by Bernini and paintings by Caravaggio, Raphael and Titian.\nThe second villa is Villa Giulia which was built as a summer residence for Pope Julius III. It now houses the Etruscan Museum. Villa Medici, the third main villa in the gardens is housed the French Academy in Rome. It also has another gallery, Museo Pietro Canonica inside its gothic structure called Forteleza.\nOther smaller villas considered to be remains of a world exposition held in Rome in 1911 are scattered in the gardens. Among them is the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Moderna containing a collection of paintings by Italian artists in the 19th and 20th centuries. There is also the English Pavilion, which houses the British School in Rome.\nThe Villa Borghese gardens offer tourists a variety of unforgettable and exhilarating experiences. Entry into the park is free but museums’ visits are booked and paid for in advance. This is because the guided tour sessions inside the galleries only accommodate a limited number of people.\nThere is a zoological garden inside the park which does minimal caging called Bioparco di Roma. It has 1,114 animals of 222 different species. Tourists also rent boats at the park to take rowing trips around the lake alongside swimming ducks, swans and geese.\nApart from walking, one can rent a bike at the\npark to explore the gardens. The park also offers a puppet theater for\nchildren and literature lovers particularly fascinated by Shakespeare\nare entertained in the Silvano Toti Globe Theatre during summer.\nYour MLA Citation\nYour APA Citation\nYour Chicago Citation\nYour Harvard CitationRemember to italicize the title of this article in your Harvard citation.","- Tour Packages\n- Discover Indonesia\n- Tourist Attractions\n- Heritage Sites\nTropical Rainforest Heritage of Sumatra\nThe Tropical Rainforest Heritage of Sumatra site was recorded as an UNESCO World Heritage site in 2004. It involves three Indonesian national parks on island of Sumatra: Gunung Leuser National Park, Kerinci Seblat National Park and the Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park. The site is recorded under Criteria vii - remarkable grand excellence; ix-an extraordinary case speaking to critical on-going environmental and organic procedures; and x-contains the most imperative and noteworthy normal natural surroundings for in-situ preservation.\nLocation and size\nThe Tropical Rainforest Heritage of Sumatra comprises of three national parks: Gunung Leuser National Park (GLNP) (8629.75 km2), Kerinci Seblat National Park (KSNP) (13,753.5 km2) and Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park (BBSNP) (3568 km2). The aggregate range of the rainforest is 25,000 km2. The Tropical Rainforest Heritage of Sumatra was picked in light of the fact that, to begin with, it speaks to critical zone of woodlands on the island of Sumatra, in view of the biodiversity, of swamp and mountain backwoods. This once limitless island of tropical rainforest has been consolidated to disengaged ranges, in the space of 50 years.\nSecond, the national stops that make up the legacy are all situated on the surely understood key spine of the Bukit Barisan Mountains, known as the 'Andes of Sumatra', and that inside and out it there are radiant perspectives.

With the rise of the tiny house movement and expanding urbanization, designers and developers alike have turned their attention to tiny living. Balancing the bottom line with creative solutions for storage and versatility, these tiny spaces are made to utilize every inch of space. Depending on the city, tiny apartments are generally considered to be less than 550 square feet, with micro apartments classified between 200–400 square feet. These tiny spaces are formed for efficiency, coupling programs and functions together.\nUnlike a traditional studio flat, tiny apartment residents can benefit from the use of communal kitchens, bathrooms and roof gardens. While micro living has faced criticism for packing residents into tight spaces, the following apartments utilize clever solutions to maximize space while preserving comfortable living conditions for inhabitants. Combining durable materials, kinetic elements and precise detailing, these tiny apartments reveal how to live large in small spaces and create room for everyday life.\nThis is a renovation project of an old flat which measures 22 sqm and 3.3m in height. Due to the high housing prices in Taipei City, the living space that young people can afford has become smaller and smaller in the last decade. The living unit may not be spacious, but still has a chance to fulfill all basic living functions. The client agreed with the idea that space is as important as function when it comes to a place where people will live for a long time rather than a room for a short-term stay. This tiny apartment centers on long term living around clever storage solutions.\nThis small 35 square meter flat was designed for a young couple. The main task was to create a comfortable open space plan with enough area for storage with access to natural light. The apartment was designed with a furniture system that would make the most of the existing space. A range of appliances were provided by Electrolux, while many furniture elements were provided by IKEA. A curtain separates the sleeping unit , kitchen and living zone from entrance, which can be pushed back when it’s needed. Living and dining zones are quite flexible, by moving sofa and extending dining table, it easily become a comfortable space for 10 guests.\nThis tiny loft design aimed to convert a small former social housing apartment in the city center of Amsterdam into a modern urban loft. Bureau Fraai, a design firm from Amsterdam, got rid of all doors, walls and tiny rooms around the core of this small apartment. Their design focused on creating one solid wooden volume of birch plywood with extended wall cabinets alongside the whole length of the apartment. By incorporating program like bathroom, toilet, storage and a box-bed all inside the wooden volume, the surrounding space can be freely used for other program like living, dining and cooking.\nThe project is a flat refurbishment in Camogli, a charming village near Genova. This is a small holiday flat, an attic above the old fishermen’s harbor. The project was made to be two bedrooms, a studio, a living room, a kitchen and a bathroom, despite the roof form and the very small floor surface. That led to a tailored apartment, where each room is a piece of furniture: after you have used it, you can close it. The simple design features elegant details and a range of solutions for storage.\nCarmel Place is the winning proposal in the adAPT NYC an initiative launched as part of former Mayor Bloomberg’s administration’s New Housing Marketplace Plan to accommodate the city’s growing small household population. The building was granted several mayoral overrides to allow this prototype to be built, including a relaxation of the minimum unit size, and the maximum density, or number of units permitted in a building. The now completed Carmel Place provides 55 loft-like rental apartments, ranging in area from 260-360sf net, and complemented by generous shared amenities, setting a new standard for micro-living. The project has been watched closely as a new housing prototype in NYC, and for its groundbreaking use of modular construction.\nDesigned as a tiny apartment in a historical building in Wroclaw, Poland, 29sqm was made to maximize space and create an independent bedroom. The ceiling height didn’t allow the designer to create two equivalent levels, but it was possible to build a semi-mezzanine. Above the bathroom and the hallway there is a large bed area and wardrobe space. Moreover, to increase space, the living room, kitchen and dining area are combined into one room. In turn, 3XA designed the space to deceive the senses with a blind door within the apartment walls.\nThis micro live work studio is located in Budapest’s ninth district. The neat studio was reinvented as a micro live + work space featuring a set of pine and ash wood bespoke furniture elements that frame and anchor the main functionalities of the apartment. Built with an open floor plan, high ceilings and custom furniture, the plan allows the compact space to house a fully-functional kitchen, lofted bedroom, event promotion headquarters, and ample space for after parties. The apartment includes furniture from Innovation Living and Pedrali, with porcelain by Mirage.\nThis 27sqm studio apartment is located in Sydney. The project was an exercise in modest, low cost, good quality design that’s affordable. The micro apartment offers a proposal for future high-density urban living for one person families, the fastest growing demographic. With a budget of less than $40k and a four week window for construction, the client requested a flexible canvas for daily living. To conserve space, light and the city skyline outlook, a joinery pod was inserted to address issues of privacy, storage and a lack of living space inherent in apartments this size. The pod utilizes full height, wall-to-wall sliding doors and accommodates an entry foyer, storage, equipment, washing and sleeping zones.\nAt twenty square meters, this singular urban shelter is an enclosed space where a single person can live and work. The apartment, even with its small size, offer generous spatial arrangements and different functional uses. The pieces that make it up do not have a fixed or clearly defined use: the kitchen is a walk-through room to get to the living space, and there are stands rather than stairs to go down to the living area, which in turn is over a cellar-storage room. At the same time, you can take the ladder to the indoor terrace, a place to be used as a study or room to relax. The focus is on an unadorned way of life that’s both simple and bright.\nThis tiny penthouse duplex apartment renovation in a brownstone building on the Upper West Side held a number of challenges to make it a liveable space. The client wished to use it as a pied-a-terre in the city for himself and his family. With only 425 square feet divided among 3 levels, it was important to open up the space as much as possible to make it livable. Inside, the bathtub and shower were provided by Gaggenau, while cooktops were provided by Caesarstone and kitchen furniture by Vola. The upper level was extended via a built-in bed cantilevered over the floor edge, providing for the necessary head-room at the level transition below. Storage was built entirely into the spaces below the stairs with built-in drawers."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:9bf238e8-36a5-466a-ae83-b3c98be8a011>","<urn:uuid:53024d10-8273-4abf-b716-80964d3916b0>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Which has worse effects on health: chronic high cortisol or poor sleep?","answer":"Both conditions have serious negative health effects. Chronic elevated cortisol can be potentially harmful to physical health, though in the short term it's adaptive and helpful for survival. Poor sleep is associated with numerous health problems including impaired learning ability, faster brain aging, obesity, elevated cholesterol, increased risk of diabetes, hypertension, and death from all causes. Additionally, inadequate sleep can impair immune function and the body's ability to eliminate small tumors, while also affecting appearance and emotional state.","context":["EVANSTON, Ill. -- A new study that takes a rare look at the physiological, social and emotional dynamics of day-to-day experiences in real-life settings shows that when older adults go to bed lonely, sad or overwhelmed, they have elevated levels of cortisol shortly after waking the next morning.\nElevated levels of cortisol -- a stress hormone linked to depression, obesity and other health problems when chronic -- actually cue the body on a day-to-day basis that it is time to rev up to deal with loneliness and other negative experiences, according to Northwestern University's Emma K. Adam, the lead investigator of the study.\nThe study, \"Day-to-day experience-cortisol dynamics,\" will be published online the week of Oct. 30 by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).\n\"You've gone to bed with loneliness, sadness, feelings of being overwhelmed, then along comes a boost of hormones in the morning to give you the energy you need to meet the demands of the day,\" said Adam, assistant professor of education and social policy and faculty fellow at the Institute for Policy Research.\nThe morning cortisol boost could help adults who went to bed with troubled or overwhelming feelings go out in the world the next day and have the types of positive social experiences that help regulate hormone levels, she said.\nAdam also is a faculty fellow at C2S: The Center on Social Disparities and Health. C2S is a new center within the Institute for Policy Research that is reaching across Northwestern's two campuses and a number of social, life and biomedical disciplines to offer a 21st century look at how biological, social and cultural dynamics intersect and affect health throughout the life span.\nCortisol is often characterized as a negative hormone because of evidence, mostly in animal models, that long-term elevations could be potentially harmful to physical health. But in the short term the stress hormone is adaptive and helpful, according to Adam.\n\"Cortisol helps us respond to stressful experiences and do something about them,\" she said. \"It is necessary for survival -- fluctuations in this hormone assist us in meeting the changing demands we face in our daily lives.\"\nThe first of its type, the study shows that it is not just on average that people who have more negative emotions have higher levels of cortisol. Rather, with its detailed and intricate methodology, the study shows a sensitive day-to-day dance between experience and cortisol. Experience influences stress hormones, and stress hormones influence experience, the study shows.\n\"Cortisol responds to and interacts with our daily experiences in subtle and important ways,\" Adam concluded.\nCortisol levels are generally high immediately upon waking, increase in the first 30 minutes after waking and then decline to low values at bedtime.\nAdam, with her colleagues John T. Cacioppo and Louise C. Hawkley at the University of Chicago, and Brigitte M. Kudielka from the University of Trier, Germany, showed that changes in this pattern from one day to the next are closely interwoven with changes in our daily experiences.\nThe study, based on data from the Chicago Health, Aging, and Social Relations Study (CHASRS) at the University of Chicago includes 156 older adults living in Cook County who were born between 1935 and 1952 and represent a range of socioeconomic classes. Their cortisol levels were measured from small samples of saliva provided three times a day for three consecutive days. Study participants reported their feelings each night in a diary, and researchers looked at whether cortisol levels on a particular day were predicted by experiences the day before or were predictive of experiences that same day.\nIn addition to noting that loneliness the night before predicted higher cortisol the next morning, Adam and colleagues found that people who experience anger throughout the day have higher bedtime levels of cortisol and flatter overall levels of the stress hormone, typically considered a risk factor for disorder. \"High levels of cortisol in the evening are a kind of biological signature of a bad day,\" Adam noted.\nThe study also provided evidence that, in addition to simply being at the mercy of your daily experiences, cortisol also plays a role in influencing them. Individuals with lower levels of cortisol in the morning experienced greater fatigue during the day, a result with potential implications for understanding chronic fatigue.\nIn all of her work, Adam is interested in how people's changing social environments get under the skin to influence their biology and health. \"Stress systems are designed to translate social experience into biological action,\" she said. \"They are designed to be a conduit from the outside world to our internal worlds so that we can better respond to our social context. The overarching question of my studies of these systems in a variety of contexts is whether overuse of these systems plays a role in disease outcomes.\"","New Information to Sleep on\nNew Information to Sleep on\nWe often fail to recognize or acknowledge its importance, but sleep, like a high-nutrient diet and exercise, is a crucial component of excellent health. As our lives become increasingly busy, we are sacrificing sleep: in 1942, mean reported sleep time for adults was 7.6 hours, and by 2001, the average was down to 6.7 hours.1 According to a poll by the National Sleep Foundation, 63% of American adults report that their sleep needs are not being met, and 43% report that on weeknights they rarely or never get a good night’s sleep.2But we need adequate sleep to work optimally in our daily activities.3\nWhy do we need sleep? Our brains work best when we are well-rested: during sleep, our brains stabilize newly formed memories, and adequate sleep promotes learning and cognitive performance the next day.3,4 Sleep is also essential for proper immune function.5 Getting adequate sleep regularly may reduce the severity of cold symptoms and also may maintain sufficient numbers of natural killer cells.6 In fact, there is some evidence that poor sleep could impair the immune system’s ability to eliminate, small, newly established tumors before they become dangerous.7 In addition, melatonin, which is a hormone produced in response to darkness and during sleep, is an antioxidant and an inhibitor of cancer cell growth.8-10 Allowing the body to produce sufficient melatonin is essential. Inadequate sleep is associated with impaired learning ability, faster aging of the brain, impaired driving and work performance, overeating, obesity, elevated cholesterol, and increased risk of diabetes, hypertension and death from all causes. Plus, lack of sleep negatively affects our appearance and emotional state.4,11-21\nAre you getting enough, good quality sleep? The precise amount of sleep required for adults has been debated, and differs between individuals. But, if you wake up to an alarm clock you are most likely sleep-deprived.6Here are some strategies to consider if you’d like to improve the quality of your sleep:6,22\nMinimize electronic device use at night. Smartphones, computer screens, televisions and tablets emit blue light, which suppresses melatonin production. Using these devices close to bedtime can disrupt sleep.23 If you wake in the middle of the night, don’t turn on your TV, smartphone or computer; the light will turn off melatonin and cause you to feel more alert. Instead, relax, read under low light or meditate until you feel sleepy again.\nMake your sleep environment as dark as possible. Don’t keep clocks that emit light or night lights in the bedroom; light-blocking curtains or a sleep mask can reduce exposure to outside light and enhance your sleep quality. Light exposure regulates our internal clock: bright light makes us alert in the morning, and a dark room at night promotes melatonin production and good sleep. Exposure to light soon before bed or during sleep reduces the depth and quality of sleep. Even a low level of light exposure through closed eyelids (such as a night light) can reduce melatonin production, and this disruption of our natural rhythms has ill health effects. Light exposure at night is associated with an increased risk of cancer, most strongly with breast cancer.24,25\nSleep on a consistent schedule, going to bed at the same time every night, and waking up at the same time every morning.\nDon’t wake up to an alarm clock if possible; the alarm clock wakes you abruptly and use of the snooze button can rob you of valuable REM sleep. When you wake naturally, your body prepares you during the final sleep cycles by shifting hormone production—reducing melatonin and increasing cortisol, which helps you to become alert.6,26\nMinimize noise. How noise affects one’s sleep is somewhat individual, based on what is familiar and typical. Earplugs or “white noise” (for example from a fan) may help to prevent noises from disrupting sleep.27\nExercise. Exercising regularly (especially vigorous exercise) promotes healthy sleep, but exercise close to bedtime is usually not recommended.\nSleep at a comfortable, but cooler temperature. Body temperature naturally drops during sleep. Sleeping in a warm room (above 75°F) or trapping in excessive heat with extra blankets may disrupt sleep.\nFollow a high-nutrient diet. A low intake of vegetables is associated with poor sleep.31 Those following aNutritarian diet may get better quality sleep than people eating poorly, and therefore may require fewer hours of sleep.\nFor those who experience difficulty sleeping, morning light exposure (or light therapy) helps normalize melatonin cycling as a means of establishing better sleep patterns and resolving insomnia. In the mornings open the shades wide and get in a sun lit room, go outside or use a therapeutic light. Tart cherry juice, a natural dietary source of melatonin, may be an effective addition.32,33 Supplementing to achieve adequate omega-3 fatty acids and zinc may also benefit sleep.34-36 These natural methods are preferable to prescription sleep drugs, which are linked to a dramatic increase in risk of death. These findings demonstrated a three-fold increased risk of death associated with regular use and a 35 percent higher risk of cancer.37\n1. Moore DW: Gallup.

The spraying system and flow sensor ensure accurate operations. When used with the MG Intelligent Operation Planning System and the DJI Agriculture Management Platform, a user can plan operations, manage flights in real-time, and closely monitor aircraft operating status. The MG-1S is a high-performance aircraft capable of offering comprehensive solutions for agricultural care.\nA3 FLIGHT CONTROLLER\nEquipped with DJI's advanced A3 Flight Controller, the MG-1S is capable of high levels of reliability. Its algorithm has been optimized for agricultural utilization, ensuring stable flight even with sloshing liquids. In addition, the redundant design of the A3 includes dual compasses.If an error occurs in one sensor, the system will automatically switch to the other sensor to continue safe, reliable flight.\nThree high-precision, microwave radars are placed on the front slope, rear slope and the bottom of the spray tank. Radars on front and rear slopes detect the terrain, allowing the aircraft to adjust its height approximately. The downward radar then provides high-precision height. As the radar's scan, the MG-1S is able to perceive the change of terrain, adjust its altitude and maintain its altitude above the crops.\nA new spraying system enables more accurate spraying. With two compatible pumps controlling the front pair and rear pair of nozzles separately, there are now three spraying modes available: forward spraying, backward spraying and full spraying. The new pressure sensor and flow sensor monitor the spraying rate in real-time, realizing dynamic control over spray speed and amount during operation. Nozzles with extended spray booms have been used to make better use of downward airflows. This spraying system now responds more accurately to commands, adding accuracy and effectiveness to spraying operations.\nMG INTELLIGENT OPERATION PLANNING SYSTEM\nPlan and edit flight paths intelligently with the MG-1S.

{"question":"What are the key differences between the health risks of consuming moldy food versus mycotoxin-contaminated aquafeed in fish?","answer":"When consuming moldy food, the risks come from both visible mold growth with roots that extend deep within the food and potential invisible bacteria growing alongside the mold, making affected items unsafe to eat. In contrast, with mycotoxin-contaminated aquafeed, the effects are more subtle and harder to diagnose. In fish like rainbow trout, mycotoxin contamination can cause internal damage such as gut and liver tissue destruction, reduced growth performance, and hemorrhaging in the abdominal cavity, but these symptoms can be difficult to attribute specifically to mycotoxins since they could be caused by other factors in commercial settings.","context":["Concern about mycotoxins in aquaculture has been growing, partly due to the gradual replacement of animal-derived proteins, such as fishmeal, by plant sources. Plant-based ingredients already represent the major dietary protein source used within feeds for lower trophic level fish species and the second major source of dietary protein and lipids after fishmeal and fish oil for shrimp and high trophic level fish species. The tendency to use plant-based ingredients in aquafeeds is set to increase due to sustainability issues and the price of fishmeal. Plant ingredients used in aquaculture are of varying origin and quality and recent reports show the risk of mycotoxin contamination in aquafeeds.\nMycotoxin occurrence: more than just aflatoxins\nGenerally, in SE Asia, it has been shown that raw materials such as: soy bean meal, wheat, wheat bran (WB), corn, corn gluten meal (CGM), rapeseeds/canola meal and rice bran are mostly contaminated with Fusarium mycotoxins (zearalenone (ZEA), deoxynivalenol (DON) and fumonisins (FB). Only cotton seed meal was observed to be contaminated primarily by aflatoxins (AF) and Fusarium toxins (ZEA and DON) at lower concentrations (data from BIOMIN mycotoxin survey 2015/16). European aqua feedstuffs are mainly contaminated by Fusarium mycotoxins. Moreover, the majority of mycotoxin contamination found in finished feeds are Fusarium mycotoxins, i.e., they come mainly from the raw materials used to produce feeds (so, from crops) and not aflatoxin contamination as is commonly believed within the aquaculture industry. An important factor is also the co-occurrence of mycotoxins which is high for all commodities, raising the probability of co-occurrence in finished feeds. An accumulation of mycotoxins on processed plant-based ingredients, (e.g., CGM and WB) has been observed when compared to the respective whole grains (C and WH, respectively). Regarding finished feeds, contamination detected in recent years poses a risk for several important aquaculture species, assuming single mycotoxin contamination, i.e. excluding any possible additive and synergetic effects between mycotoxins.\nRelevance of mycotoxin occurrence to rainbow trout\nTo evaluate the consequences of DON contamination in European aquaculture finished feeds, two experiments were performed with rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). First, the effect of short term feeding of high levels of DON (50 days; 1,166 µg/kg DON and 2,745 µg/kg DON) was tested. Moreover, the influence of mycotoxins against Yersinia ruckeri susceptibility was also evaluated. A second experiment studied the long term feeding of low levels of DON to rainbow trout (168 days; 367 µg/kg DON).\nThe experimental design tried to replicate two possible scenarios commonly observed. First, a contamination higher than 1000 ppb due to an inclusion of a highly contaminated raw material in the diets, which normally affects only a few batches of feed (short term). Second, a lower contamination, around 300-500ppb, which is commonly found all year round according to the BIOMIN aquafeeds survey, and can be ingested by animals over long periods of time.\nImpact of short term exposure to DON on rainbow trout\nAs previously described by other authors, rainbow trout growth performance is affected by dietary contamination of DON. At the levels tested (1,166 µg/kg DON and 2,745 µg/kg DON), the thermal growth coefficient decreased 17% (p = 0.001) and the specific growth rate decreased by 13% (p < 0.001). Also, important numerical differences (p > 0.05) were found for protein efficiency rate and feed efficiency rate. Ingestion of DON did not influence the trout’s Yersinia ruckeri susceptibility, however the ingestion of DON resulted in gut and liver tissue destruction, confirmed by blood enzyme values and histology. Experiment results confirmed that the ingestion of DON at levels higher than 1,166 µg/kg, even if during short periods (50 days) can lead to an overall decline in performance which ultimately results in economic losses.\nLong term exposure to DON\nThe second experiment aimed to study the impact of low mycotoxin contamination (367 µg/kg DON) over a longer period. Despite no statistical differences being found for final body weight (FBW) and other performance parameters, after 92 days of DON exposure, a more accentuated difference between the control and DON fed animals was observable. Actually, at day 168, the differences between the two treatments were relatively high, with a p-value at this sampling point of 0.053 (Figure 1). Feed conversion rate (FCR) showed a similar pattern to FBW and after 168 days, animals fed DON presented a FCR 25% higher when compared to the control (Figure 2). Growth performance reductions observed, even if not statistically different in certain cases, can negatively affect the profit of farmers, especially if we think that feed costs account for 60% of total production costs for salmonids. FCR showed an important numerical increase, which results in economic but also environmental consequences for the salmonids industry, especially so because European countries have legal limits for N-compound emissions.\nAs well as the negative impact described above, mycotoxins caused size dispersion, probably due to the individual history (health/nutritional status) of the trout. This size dispersion is extremely negative for famers, who need to invest resources in size sorting.\nAuthors believe that the ingestion of low levels of mycotoxins is often a reality in the aquaculture industry, however due to the lack of clinical signs of mycotoxicoses and the lack of regular analyzes of mycotoxins in feeds, it is difficult to evaluate the possible impact of these mycotoxins in feed.\nLack of clinical signs makes diagnosis difficult\nIn aquatic organisms, it is difficult to prove that a disease is a mycotoxicosis. Even when mycotoxins are detected, it is not easy to show that they are the etiological agents in a given veterinary health problem. In the short-term period experiment, it was observed that animals fed the higher dosage of DON (2,745 µg/kg) presented haemorrhaging in the abdominal cavity and rectal hemorrhaging and irritation (Figure 2 and 3). Due to the controlled rearing conditions and the known ingested levels of DON, the authors associated the presented clinical signs to DON. However, in complex environmental conditions, such as those found on commercial sites, these clinical signs could easily be attributed to other etiological factors.\nIn the case of feeding DON chronically, it is even more difficult to detect any signs of mycotoxicoses. This experiment did not detect any evident clinical sign that could be associated to the ingestion of DON. However, interestingly, high levels of individual variability in sizes within the fish fed DON were observed, suggesting that the individual immune/nutritional status of each animal might influence the DON susceptibility.\nPossible synergism still to evaluate\nIn both experiments, we were only considering the effect of a single mycotoxin (effect of DON). It is important to note that there are many different mycotoxins, and in many cases they appear simultaneously in feed. This is known to amplify the negative effects in animals, referred to as a synergistic effect. This essentially means that the sensitivity levels found with the present experiments can decrease in practice. Farmers would do well to regularly test feed materials for mycotoxins and use a proven mycotoxin risk management solution in order to maintain health and profitability.","Mold is everywhere!

We will dive into this subject to answer these questions and more.\nMolds are a natural part of the environment. Mold is present anywhere that moisture and oxygen exist. Outdoor molds are necessary for breaking down matter, however indoor mold growth should not be present.\nMolds belong to the fungi kingdom. They are microscopic fungi that live on plant or animal matter. There are many different species of fungi that exist in the world. Most of these fungi’s produce spores. These spores can be transported by air, water, or insects.\nThere are many different types of mold. The most common types of mold are:\nMolds have branches and roots. Therefore, if you see mold on the surface of food their roots may extend deep within.\nFoods that are moldy may also have invisible bacteria growing along with the mold. Therefore, if you consume moldy food it can make you sick.\nHowever, there are some foods with mold that are safe to eat! Keep reading to find out.\nDue to the fact that molds develop “roots”, food with surface mold growth is contaminated all throughout.\nCommonly found “surface” molds include: gray fur on sandwich meat, fuzzy green dots on bread, white dust on cheese, velvety greenish black circles on fruits, white fuzz on vegetables etc.\nTherefore, if you just remove the growth on the surface you are only removing some of the mold growth. If you consume these mold affected items they may make you sick.\nYes! Molds are used to make certain cheeses. Some of these molds have visible blue veins including:\nThese cheeses are created by P. roqueforti or Penicillium roqueforti spores. The molds used to manufacture these cheeses are safe to eat.\nMycotoxins are poisonous substances produced by certain molds found in:\nThe Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations estimates that 25% of the world’s food crops are affected by mycotoxins, of which the most notorious are aflatoxins. (According to the USDA)\nAflatoxin is a cancer-causing poison produced by certain fungi in or on Foods and Feeds, Field Corn and Peanuts.\nThey have been associated with various diseases, such as aflatoxicosis in:\nMany countries try to limit exposure to aflatoxin by regulating and monitoring its presence on commodities intended for use as food and feed. The prevention of aflatoxin is one of the most challenging toxicology issues of present time.\nAflatoxins are considered unavoidable contaminants of food and feed, even where good manufacturing practices have been followed. (According to the USDA)\nCleaning the appliances and items in your kitchen can help minimize mold growth.\nWhen you go to the grocery store make sure you check the items before you purchase them. This will ensure that you are not buying aged food that has mold or will grow mold fast.\nTo avoid potential mold growth you can do the following:"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:ef4fd943-b7fb-45cd-93c1-1754ae5eb2c2>","<urn:uuid:5e876985-0de5-43ff-a1f7-85e151860e9d>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What role do electronic elements play in instrumental performances, and what software solutions exist for combining traditional instruments with digital components?","answer":"Electronic elements are frequently integrated with live instrumental performances, as seen in pieces like 'Trilling Wire' for clarinet with fixed sound part, and 'Trying to translate' which combines piano with digital sound and live electronics. Several works involve combining instrumental performance with live audio and text processing. For implementing these digital-acoustic combinations, Max software provides a comprehensive solution as a visual programming environment. It enables artists to create interactive sound and computer works, facilitating connections between traditional instruments and technology. This is exemplified in projects like Collettivo_21's approach, where electronics are treated as an equal partner to traditional instruments like flute and piano, creating what effectively becomes a trio rather than merely adding electronic ornaments to acoustic instruments.","context":["All these works involve live performance in some way, often also with electronic sound and digital media, but also quite a bit of instrumental music.

{"question":"Which sacred site is older - Ayutthaya's Elephant Kraal or Bangkok's Temple of Emerald Buddha?","answer":"The Elephant Kraal is older, dating back to the 16th century when King Maha Thammaracha (r. 1569-1590) moved it to its present site after the first fall of Ayutthaya in 1569. The Temple of the Emerald Buddha in Bangkok was completed much later, in around 1785 (three years after Bangkok became the capital in 1782).","context":["|THE ELEPHANT KRAAL\n|Text & photographs by Tricky Vandenberg - January 2010\n|Phaniat, the place were the elephants are kept and the kings are crowned...\n(Jeremias Van Vliet, 1692)\nThe Elephant Kraal is located off the City Island along the west bank of the new\nLopburi River in the northeastern area in Suan Phrik Sub-district. The elephant kraal of\nAyutthaya is the only one left in Thailand and is located 4 Km northeast of the City along\nRoad No 309. The area was called in earlier times Thamle Ya or the \"grass locality\", as\nthe whole area was as a large grass field. In its immediate vicinity are the War Elephants\nMonument, the Phaniat Palace and an Old Kiln situated.\nThe outlook from the Ko Jawet Maha Prasat pavilion, from where the kings watched the\nelephant trapping ceremony, is a big cage surrounded with logs having; from the front\ncentre, fencing lines of 45 degrees spread out to both sides far away into the former\njungle area. The kraal dates back to the 16th century, when King Maha Thammaracha (r.\n1569-1590) after the first fall of Ayutthaya in 1569, moved the old elephant kraal near\nWat Song to the present site; a time when elephants were not only caught and trained for\nwork and transport, but merely used for warfare.\nMany visitors in the late 19th and early 20th century had the occasion to visit the kraal in\nAyutthaya. George Bacon, visiting Siam in 1857 describes the site as follows:\n\"After visiting the ruins, therefore, we inspected the kraal or stockade, in which\nthe elephants are captured. This was a large quadrangular piece of ground,\nenclosed by a wall about six feet in thickness, having an entrance on one side,\nthe elephants are made to enter the enclosure. Inside the wall is a fence of strong\nteak stakes driven into the ground a few inches apart. In the centre is a small\nhouse erected on poles and strongly surrounded with stakes, wherein some men\nare stationed for the purpose of securing the animals. ...Once a year, a large\nnumber is collected together in the enclosure, and as many as are wanted of those\npossessing the points which the Siamese consider beautiful are captured. ...On this\noccasion the king and a large concourse of nobles assemble together to witness the\nproceedings; they occupy a large platform on one side of the enclosure.\" \nPeter Anthony Thompson somehow fifty years later in 1905, sketches the following\npicture of the kraal:\n\"Beyond the busy lines of floating houses, on a tongue of land between two of the\nnumerous branches of the river, stands the paniet or elephant stockade. This is a\nsquare enclosure of posts, ten feet high and about two feet apart. It is surrounded\nby a broad wall with a parapet, and at one end is a pavilion for the King and his\ncourt. On opposite sides of the stockade are two narrow openings, connected with\npassages which lead through the wall. These passages are closed by great beams\nwhich hang pivoted at one extremity from a frame-work overhead. They can easily\nbe drawn aside by ropes, and when the tension is relaxed they swing back again,\nand bar the entrance. Outside the wall more posts are planted, so as to enclose a\nlarge triangular space, whose apex is at the narrow gap in the wall. In the base of\nthe triangle a wide gate is left, and beyond this radiating lines of posts direct the\nadvance of the elephants. This is the scene of the great \"Elephant Hunt,\" which\ntakes place once in every three or four years.\" \nInternet sources mostly report that the last roundup of wild elephants in Thailand\nhappened back in 1903. Thompson, although gave a dramatic account of an elephant\nroundup in Ayutthaya two years later, in March 1905.\n\"At length the final drive began. Led by two tame elephants, and closely hemmed\nin behind, the herd pressed forward into the outer stockade, and the bars were\nslipped behind them. They had still to face the narrow passage through the wall,\nleading to the inner enclosure, and this they did not like at all. As before, a tame\nelephant led the way, but it was not until the tuskers had come up and pushed and\nprodded those behind that the herd swayed towards the opening, and still those in\nfront held back. At last one made a break and with a frightened squeal ran in, and\nhe was followed by many others. In this way fifty or sixty elephants were got\ninside, but then a strange thing happened. Perhaps it was the sight of the great\ncrowd pressing closely against the posts on every side that at length made the\nelephants realise that they were in a trap, but, whatever the cause, they were\ngrowing very restive, and remained huddled together in the centre of the stockade.\nNow and then they would crush against the posts, and one big fellow made a fierce\ncharge in the attempt to regain his freedom. Then the posts creaked ominously, for\nthough they look so stout they are hollow with age. When the elephants came near,\nthe crowd outside gave way and prepared to fly, should they break out, but\nbetween the posts were stationed men who thrust with long spears at the\nelephants, and kept them back. Matters were now at a deadlock, for no more\nelephants would go through the opening, and those behind were pushing forward\nand boring into the throng, the little tuskers charging fiercely in with the best of\nthem. As the crush grew worse some were trampled underneath and some were\nlifted off their feet, while in the very middle one great tuskless male was seen high\nabove his fellows, walking upon the backs of those who had sunk to the ground.\nThen, mingled with the grunts and squeals, was heard the deep roar of anger, and\non the outskirts of the scrum were some who slapped the ground with their trunks\nin rage. It was soon apparent that many of the smaller elephants were being\ncrushed to death, and so the tame tuskers came round and drove the whole herd\nback again towards the river, but a pile of fifteen was left lying on the ground.\nWater was brought in long joints of bamboo, and poured over the prostrate\nelephants. A few recovered, and with the help of the tuskers regained their feet\nand joined the herd, but the greater number of them were dead. In the evening,\nafter the crowd had gone, the rest of the herd was safely got inside the inner\nThe restoration of Ayutthaya's ancient kraal, the elephant-trapping pen, began in\nOctober 2007. All 980 ageing logs in the fence surrounding the enclosure were replaced.\nThe \"sao talung\" are the major component of the pen, or \"Phaniat Klong Chang\", which\nwild elephants were driven into for elephant-trapping ceremonies in the Ayutthaya\nperiod. All the old timber was replaced under a 16 million Baht restoration project,\nwhich was launched to mark King Rama IX's 80th birthday in December 2007. The\ngovernor presided over the ceremony, in which the first of the logs were uprooted from\nthe ground. There was a ritual to obtain permission from the deities before the ceremony\nbegan, as the kraal is traditionally a sacred place.\nThe Elephant Kraal was next to the elephant-trapping an important place for the\nlegitimation of the Ayutthayan Kings. We read in Jeremias Van Vliet's Short History of\nthe Kings of Siam 1640 that the place was used for the abhiseka ceremony of the king,\nin this case King Naresuan (r. 1590-1605). Van Vliet's account has a bit of a macabre\ntaste as King Naresuan got all the rowers of the Royal Barges executed at this spot, after\nthey landed his Royal Barge carelessly on the occasion of his coronation.\nHe ordered the royal boats to be made ready and the mandarins to go by boat with him\nto the Phaniat (the place where the elephants are kept and the kings are crowned) in\norder to proclaim him king and swear oaths of allegiance to him. On arrival at Phaniat,\nPhra Naret’s rowers made an error in the process of landing, which he left unpunished at\nthat time. He was crowned with the proper solemnities when he was thirty five years old\nand was called Phra Naret Rachathirat. After having been crowned, he had all rowers in\nhis boat, as well as those in the other royal boats (about 1600 men), burnt alive in that\nsame place. \nA more elaborated pdf file on the elephant kraal written by Ken May can de found here.\n Siam, the land of the white elephant - George B.

The namesake Buddha image is Thailand’s most sacred, carved from solid jade and featuring in enough legends to fill several books. Yet it’s the temple’s ornate details that leave most visitors spellbound.\nCompleted three years after King Rama I founded the still-existent Chakri dynasty and moved the Thai capital to Bangkok in 1782, Wat Phra Si Rattana Satsadaram, to use the temple’s official name, and the Phra Kaew (“Emerald Buddha”) image that it enshrines, continue to symbolise the unifying interplay between Buddhism and the monarchy in Thailand.\nPhra Kaew can also be seen as the ultimate level of Thai superstition—the grandmaster of the many Buddha images and other objects, like talismans and amulets, believed to be imbued with a range of mysterious powers. It would not be an understatement to say that the unity of the Thai kingdom depends on Phra Kaew, a belief that was cemented by its arrival in Bangkok around the same time as the current royal lineage’s founding.\nThe deeply revered Thai king draws much of his moral and spiritual authority from a perceived connection to Phra Kaew, itself thought to encapsulate the kingly virtues. The term Rattanakosin, coined by Rama I as the name for his new capital and now used broadly to label centuries of Thai art and architecture, was originally a reference to this single Buddha image, translating as “Repository of the Gem Image”.\nWhere and when Phra Kaew was created remains a mystery. Legends claim it was conjured by the Hindu god Indra over 2,000 years ago in India, where the sage Nagasena is said to have predicted that Buddhism would flourish wherever it was enshrined. Some say it reached Thailand via Sri Lanka, Cambodia or Burma.\nThe artistic style of the image seems to derive from what’s now Northern Thailand in the 13th or 14th centuries. No one but the Thai king or crown prince has been permitted to touch Phra Kaew over the past couple of centuries, meaning that art historians can only guesstimate from afar. One thing is for certain: Phra Kaew became incredibly highly revered at some point along its path.\nThe image first appeared in historical records around the 15th century, when it was supposedly covered in stucco and kept in a chedi in Chiang Rai. When lightning struck the chedi, as the story goes, the image’s outer shell was chipped to reveal its true nephrite composition. Still one of the world’s most valuable minerals, nephrite is a type of jade with a deep-emerald hue. (So, no, the Emerald Buddha is not actually made of emerald.)\nPhra Kaew then spent relatively short stints in Lampang, Chiang Mai and Luang Prabang before being enshrined in Vientiane’s own Wat Phra Kaew for over two centuries. While still a general, the man who would soon become King Rama I led a successful attack on the Lao capital and carted the image to Bangkok, where it was sometimes paraded during the early days of the Rattanakosin period. Many believed that a glimpse of it could cure sickness.\nNow for the spoiler: the Emerald Buddha is only 66 centimetres tall, depicted in seated meditation posture atop an ornate gilded pedestal. Photos are not allowed and visitors must stay several metres away, making it difficult to see the finer details. While Thai studies enthusiasts will appreciate its unrivalled importance, Phra Kaew does not make the jaw drop in the same way as Wat Pho’s massive reclining Buddha or Wat Traimit’s solid gold image.\nBut there’s a lot more to Wat Phra Kaew than Phra Kaew alone. Guarded by tall and angry-looking yakshas (“giants” or “demons”), the grounds include eight Khmer-style prangs, a large bell-shaped chedi supposedly containing a relic of the Buddha himself, and a mondop that glistens with finely detailed mother-of-pearl doors and mosaic-encrusted pillars. Everything is awash in gold leaf, ornate jewels and glazed ceramics in many different colours, all placed on solid marble pediments.\nRimming the temple on all sides, long cloisters are adorned with exquisite late-18th century murals depicting the Ramakien epic (the Thai version of the Indian Ramayana) from start to finish. Statues of one of the Ramakien’s star characters, the monkey-king Hanuman, can be seen repeatedly, “bearing the weight” of chedis or guarding entrances to some of the minor buildings.\nGolden naga serpents are topped with five angelic heads. Half-bird half-angel khinaree depictions seem to materialise from the sparkling gold-and-indigo walls. Many other oddly elegant beings from the mythological Himmaphan forest stand near a miniature replica of Angkor Wat. These are just a few of the countless details that overwhelm the eyes while attempting to transport visitors beyond the earthly realm.\nWhat you won’t find are monks’ living quarters, as Wat Phra Kaew is one of the only functioning temples in Thailand that doesn’t have a single monk in residence. This is due to its one-of-a-kind status as the royal palace’s own front-yard temple, following in the footsteps of Ayutthaya’s Wat Phra Si Sanphet. The temple is occasionally closed for ceremonies involving the royal family and high-ranking monks, the most well-known being the changing of the Emerald Buddha’s golden robes to mark the beginning of the cool, hot and rainy seasons.\nPart of the larger Grand Palace complex and included with a single 500-baht ticket, Wat Phra Kaew is an extremely popular tourist attraction—and for good reason. The selfie-stick wielding hordes can detract from the overall experience, and pickpockets are occasionally reported. Apart from (perhaps) first thing in the morning, there’s no time of day or year when the crowds can be avoided.\nIgnore any well-dressed men or tuk tuk drivers who approach you near the entrance and tell you that the complex is closed, as this is a scam. Personal guides can be arranged next to the ticket window, where you can also rent an audio guide for 200 baht. If you’re not dressed appropriately, with long pants/skirts and shirts covering the shoulders, you can rent a sarong to cover yourself near the front gate. Plan on at least two hours to take in both Wat Phra Kaew and the Grand Palace.\nIf you want to see some of the temple’s centuries-old statues and carvings that have since been replaced, don’t miss the Wat Phra Kaew museum in the western corner of the Grand Palace complex, near the exit. It also houses the bones of a royal white elephant, 5,000-year-old painted ceramics from Ban Chiang, and mini-models of the whole Grand Palace complex that allow you to compare its past to its present.\nVia the Chao Phraya River Express Boat, jump off at Tha Maharaj pier, walk out to the street and take a right, and the Grand Palace will appear in front of you. Buses servicing the area include 1, 3, 6, 25, 44, 47, 53, 82, 91, 508 and 512. Beware of touts telling you that the temple is closed.\nAddress: Na Phra Lan Rd, Bangkok\nCoordinates (for GPS): 100º29'33.03\" E, 13º45'5.62\" N\nSee position in Apple or Google Maps: Apple Maps | Google Maps\nAdmission: 500 baht\nDavid Luekens first came to Thailand in 2005 when Thai friends from his former home of Burlington, Vermont led him on a life-changing trip.

Similarly, during Dutch Carnaval, regular social order is suspended as people dress in costumes and masks, and participate in festivities that transform the normal social structure, with a temporary ruler (Prince Carnaval) taking control of the city.","context":["Sir James George Frazer (18541941). The Golden Bough. 1922.\nBut to clinch the argument, it is clearly desirable to prove that the custom of putting to death a human representative of a god was known and practised in ancient Italy elsewhere than in the Arician Grove. This proof I now propose to adduce.\n3. The Roman Saturnalia\nWE have seen that many peoples have been used to observe an annual period of license, when the customary restraints of law and morality are thrown aside, when the whole population give themselves up to extravagant mirth and jollity, and when the darker passions find a vent which would never be allowed them in the more staid and sober course of ordinary life. Such outbursts of the pent-up forces of human nature, too often degenerating into wild orgies of lust and crime, occur most commonly at the end of the year, and are frequently associated, as I have had occasion to point out, with one or other of the agricultural seasons, especially with the time of sowing or of harvest. Now, of all these periods of license the one which is best known and which in modern language has given its name to the rest, is the Saturnalia. This famous festival fell in December, the last month of the Roman year, and was popularly supposed to commemorate the merry reign of Saturn, the god of sowing and of husbandry, who lived on earth long ago as a righteous and beneficent king of Italy, drew the rude and scattered dwellers on the mountains together, taught them to till the ground, gave them laws, and ruled in peace. His reign was the fabled Golden Age: the earth brought forth abundantly: no sound of war or discord troubled the happy world: no baleful love of lucre worked like poison in the blood of the industrious and contented peasantry. Slavery and private property were alike unknown: all men had all things in common. At last the good god, the kindly king, vanished suddenly; but his memory was cherished to distant ages, shrines were reared in his honour, and many hills and high places in Italy bore his name. Yet the bright tradition of his reign was crossed by a dark shadow: his altars are said to have been stained with the blood of human victims, for whom a more merciful age afterwards substituted effigies. Of this gloomy side of the gods religion there is little or no trace in the descriptions which ancient writers have left us of the Saturnalia. Feasting and revelry and all the mad pursuit of pleasure are the features that seem to have especially marked this carnival of antiquity, as it went on for seven days in the streets and public squares and houses of ancient Rome from the seventeenth to the twenty-third of December.\nBut no feature of the festival is more remarkable, nothing in it seems to have struck the ancients themselves more than the license granted to slaves at this time. The distinction between the free and the servile classes was temporarily abolished. The slave might rail at his master, intoxicate himself like his betters, sit down at table with them, and not even a word of reproof would be administered to him for conduct which at any other season might have been punished with stripes, imprisonment, or death. Nay, more, masters actually","By Rita Hoefnagels, USAG Benelux Public AffairsFebruary 1, 2018\nSCHINNEN, The Netherlands -- One of the most important local events in the Dutch Southern Provinces is Carnaval. During the three-day event, people wear costumes and masks as they eat, drink and enjoy the festivities. This year, Carnaval is celebrated Feb. 11 to 13.\nCarnaval is a big celebration, which ends on Ash Wednesday when Lenten, or Lent, starts. Although it was originally believed that Carnaval is a religious festival, it is not. Before Christ was born, February was considered the last month of the year. People began the new year by celebrating the fact that the sun had cast away the dark winter.\nThe chronicles of Babylon speak of the sacrificial death of the king every year during their new year's celebrations. The king had to die for his people so they could start the new year without sins. To prevent kinghood from becoming a one-year affair, it was decided to have a temporary king during these days. The temporary king would be either a terminally-ill person or a criminal condemned to death. During the festivities, these men lived like kings.\nThe Christian Church learned that integrating these rituals into the church was a way of dealing with heathen beliefs. People celebrated but did penance afterwards. Ash Wednesday became the official beginning of a 40-day long Lent season before Easter. This was also believed to be an explanation for the event's name. During Lent, people did penance by fasting. The Latin term \"Carne Vale\" meant farewell to meat/flesh. During the Reformation, sobriety was preached so these excessive celebrations were considered sinful. As a result, Carnaval ceased to exist.\nCarnaval, as it is today, originated from the German Rhineland, with its cradle in Cologne. This city, occupied by Napoleon's Army and annexed later by Prussia, had many inhabitants who did not forget Cologne's glorious past when emperors visited. They were welcomed with great pomp and circumstance and entered the city in a parade while the citizens showered them with flowers. The emperors gave money to those cheering. In 1823, the very first Carnaval/Fashing parade was organized. The parade had to be equal to the wealthy and glorious entries of the Habsburg emperors in the old days.\nA lot of traditions are still the same. Prince Carnaval, for instance, still wears a Renaissance costume and is accompanied by Soldiers in 17th century uniforms. At the time of the first parade, these uniforms were really meant as a spoof on the Prussians. Little by little, all kinds of elements were added. Carnaval associations were established and medals were presented to special citizens and event participants. This also started as persiflage on the Prussians' behavior but grew out to be a tradition.\nCarnaval has spread all over the Rhineland and the South of the Netherlands. Nowadays, almost every village has its own Carnaval association while the larger cities have even more than one. The Carnaval association consists of a \"Raad van Elf\" (Council of Eleven) presided by the president or lord, who is responsible for the activities during the Carnaval season. They choose a prince, organize and escort the parade. They also visit senior living homes, schools and other associations to give out medals.\nThe Carnaval festivities typically begin with the mayor handing over the town keys to the prince, making him the ruler of the city or village for the duration of Carnaval.\nMany clubs, associations and schools have their own prince and Carnaval fest. The Schinnen Community is no exception. By tradition, these fests are ruled over by a prince and princess and visited by local authorities and Carnaval associations. The fest at Schinnen will be held Feb. 9 starting at 2:11 p.m. in the Pin Point Café and Bowling Center at U.S. Army Garrison Benelux in Schinnen. The fest will begin with the proclamation of Prince and Princess Carnaval for 2018. For newcomers to the area, this is a perfect opportunity to experience Carnaval.\nThe highlight of Carnaval is the parade. Participants often work year round to build floats and create costumes. Every group tries their best to have the most original designs. After the parade, the festivities start with dancing and singing in the streets and pubs. Many shops will be closed Feb. 12 and 13. Special events, such as Carnaval Band contests, will take place during those days. On Tuesday at midnight, Carnaval officially ends.\nSo dress up, put on your mask and celebrate the festivities!"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:a334a9ee-1ede-4994-a78b-06c390f7df3e>","<urn:uuid:4269d87c-4dca-4446-948a-961352671895>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What's the key difference between marsquakes and shallow-focus earthquakes in terms of their underlying causes?","answer":"Marsquakes and shallow-focus earthquakes have different causes. Shallow-focus earthquakes on Earth are primarily caused by crustal plates moving against each other. In contrast, marsquakes occur despite Mars lacking plate tectonics, and are instead caused by planetary cooling and contraction, magma movement below the surface due to nuclear decay, or meteor strikes. While shallow-focus earthquakes release 75% of all earthquake energy on Earth, marsquakes are expected to have rather low amplitude.","context":["One of the more interesting aspects of the latest NASA landing on Mars is that the rover has dug into the surface, inserted a seismometer, and is looking for marsquakes. On Earth, earthquakes are fairly common, especially where I live, and they are generated through the fact that our continents are gigantic lumps of rock moving around over the mantle. They can slide past each other or pull themselves down under another plate, to disappear deep into the mantle, while at other places, new rock emerges to take their place, such as at the mid-Atlantic ridge. Apparently the edges of these plates move about 5 – 10 cm each year. You probably do not notice this because the topsoil, by and large, does not move with the underlying crust. However, every now and again these plates lock and stop moving there. The problem is, the rest of the rock is moving, so considerable strain energy is built up, the lock gives way, very large amounts of energy are released, and the rock moves, sometimes be several meters. The energy is given out as waves, similar in many ways as sound waves, through the rock. If you see waves in the sea, you will note that while the water itself stays more or less in the same place on average, in detail something on the surface, like a surfer, goes up and down, and in fact describes what is essentially a circle if far enough out. Earthquake waves do the same thing. The rock moves, and the shaking can be quite violent. Of course, the rock moves where the actual event occurred, and sometimes the waves trigger a further shift somewhere else.\nSuch waves travel out in all directions through the rock. Now another feature of all waves is that when they strike a medium through which they will travel with a different velocity, they undergo partial reflection and refraction. There is an angle of incidence when only reflection occurs, and of course, on a curved surface, the reflected waves start spreading as the angles of incidence vary. A second point is that the bigger the difference in wave speed between the two media, the more reflection there is. On Earth, this has permitted us to gather information on what is going on inside the Earth. Of course Earth has some big advantages. We can record seismic events from a number of different places, and even then the results are difficult to interpret.\nThe problem for Mars is there will be one seismometer that will measure wave frequency, amplitude, and the timing. The timing will give a good picture of the route taken by various waves. Thus the wave that is reflected off the core will come back much sooner than the wave that travels light through and is reflected off the other side, but it will have the same frequency pattern on arrival, so from such patterns and timing you can sort out, at least in principle, what route they took and from the reflection/refraction intensities, what different materials they passed through. It is like a CT scan of the planet. There are further complications because wave interference can spoil patterns, but waves are interesting that they only create that effect at the site where they interfere. Otherwise, they pass right through other waves and are unchanged when they emerge, apart from intensity changes if energy was absorbed by the medium. There is an obvious problem in that with only one seismometer it is much harder to work out where the source was but the scientists believe over the lifetime of the rover they will detect at least a couple of dozen quakes.\nWhich gets to the question, why do we expect quakes? Mars does not have plate tectonics, possibly because its high level of iron oxide means eclogite cannot form, and it is thought that the unusually high density of eclogite leads to pull subduction. Accordingly the absence of plate tectonics means we expect marsquakes to be of rather low amplitude. However, minor amplitude quakes are expected. One reason is that as the planet cools, there is contraction in volume. Accordingly, the crust becomes less well supported and tends to slip. A second cause could be magma moving below the surface. We know that Mars has a hot interior, thanks to nuclear decay going on inside, and while Mars will be cooler than Earth, the centre is thought to be only about 200 Centigrade degrees cooler than Earth’s centre. While Earth generates more heat, it also loses more through geothermal emissions. Finally, when meteors strike, they also generate shockwaves. Of course the amplitude of these waves is tiny compared with that of even modest earthquakes.\nIt is hard to know what we shall learn. The reliance on only one seismometer means the loss of directional analysis, and the origin of the quake will be unknown, unless it is possible to time reflections from various places. Thus if you get one isolated event, every wave that comes must have originated from that source, so from the various delays, paths can be assigned. The problem with this is that low energy events might not generate enough reflections of sufficient amplitude to be detected. The ideal method, of course, is to set off some very large explosions at known sites, but it is rather difficult to do that from here.\nWhat do we expect? This is a bit of guesswork, but for me we believe the crust is fairly thick, so we would expect about 60 km of solid basalt. If we get significantly different amounts, this would mean we would have to adjust our thoughts on the Martian thermonuclear reactions. I expect a rather tiny (for a planet) iron core, the clue here being the overall density of Mars is 3.8, its surface is made of basalt, and basalt has a density of 3.1 – 3.8. There just is not room for a lot of iron in the form of the metal. It is what is in between that is of interest. Comments from some of the scientists say they think they will get clues on planetary formation, which could come from deep structures. Thus if planets really formed from the combination of planetesimals, which are objects of asteroid, size, then maybe we shall see the remains in the form of large objects of different sonic impedance. On the other hand, the major shocks to the system by events such as the Hellas impactor may mean that asymmetries were introduced by such shock waves melting parts. My guess is the observations will not be unambiguous in terms of their meaning, and it will be interesting to see how many different scenarios are considered.","Where is the earthquake focus? The focus of an earthquake is the point where the rocks start to fracture. It is the origin of the earthquake. The epicenter is the point on land directly above the focus.\nFocus of an Earthquake, USGS\nFocus of an earthquake\nThe focus is also called the hypocenter of an earthquake. The vibrating waves travel away from the focus of the earthquake in all directions. The waves can be so powerful they will reach all parts of the Earth and cause it to vibrate like a turning fork.\nEpicenter of an earthquake\nDirectly above the focus on the Earth's surface is the earthquake epicenter. Earthquake waves start at he focus and travel outward in all directions. Earthquake waves do not originate at the epicenter.\nNews stories about earthquakes\nMost news stories on earthquakes will list the epicenter of an earthquake and then tell how deep the earthquake was from the epicenter. Great earthquakes that occur in subduction zones may give an earthquake focus but they actually break along hundreds of kilometers. The 1960 Chilean earthquake broke along 800 kilometers of the fault line.\nRichter scale used for shallow-focus earthquakes\nShallow-focus earthquakes occur between 0 and 40 miles deep. Shallow-focus earthquakes are much more common than deep-focus earthquakes. Crustal plates moving against each other produce most of the shallow-focus earthquakes here on Earth. These earthquakes are generally smaller and scientists use the Richter scale when measuring these earthquakes.\nEnergy released by shallow focus earthquakes\nShallow-focus earthquakes are much more dangerous than deep-focus earthquakes. They release 75% of all the energy produced by earthquakes each year. They are crustal earthquakes that are smaller than deep-focus earthquakes.\nDeep-focus earthquakes use moment magnitude scale\nDeep-focus earthquakes occur 180 miles or more below the Earth's surface. These earthquakes occur in island arc or deep ocean trenches where one plate is slipping over another in subduction zones. Great earthquakes where one plate is slipping over another plate in a subduction zone trigger deep-focus earthquakes. They are the largest earthquakes and scientists use the moment magnitude scale to measure them.\nP waves Find out more about P Waves that are produced by large and small earthquakes.\nLove Waves Find out more about Love waves that can topple tall buildings during large earthquakes!\nThe Mercalli Scale Did you know there can be twelve different intensities of an earthquake but only one magnitude?

While no teen is immune, there are factors that can make some adolescents more vulnerable than others. Understand how to tell if your teen might be suicidal and where to turn for help and treatment.\nWhat makes teens vulnerable to suicide?\nMany teens who attempt or die by suicide have a mental health condition. As a result, they have trouble coping with the stress of being a teen, such as dealing with rejection, failure, breakups, school difficulties and family turmoil. They might also be unable to see that they can turn their lives around — and that suicide is a permanent response, not a solution, to a temporary problem.\nWhat are the risk factors for teen suicide?\nA teen might feel suicidal due to certain life circumstances such as:\n- Having a psychiatric disorder, such as depression, an anxiety disorder, bipolar disorder or oppositional defiant disorder\n- Family history of mood disorder, suicide or suicidal behavior\n- History of physical or sexual abuse or exposure to violence or bullying\n- A substance use disorder\n- Access to means, such as firearms or medications\n- Exposure to the suicide of a family member or friend\n- Loss of or conflict with close friends or family members\n- Physical or medical issues, such as changes related to puberty or a chronic illness\n- Being lesbian, gay, bisexual or any other sexual minority youth\n- Being adopted\nChildren who have attempted suicide in the past are also at greater risk.\nIn the U.S., suicide attempts are more common in adolescent girls than boys. But boys are more likely to die by suicide than are girls.\nWhat are the warning signs that a teen might be suicidal?\nWarning signs of teen suicide might include:\n- Talking or writing about suicide — for example, making statements such as \"I'm going to kill myself,\" or \"I won't be a problem for you much longer\"\n- Withdrawing from social contact\n- Having mood swings\n- Increasing use of alcohol or drugs\n- Feeling trapped, hopeless or helpless about a situation\n- Changing normal routine, including eating or sleeping patterns\n- Doing risky or self-destructive things\n- Giving away belongings when there is no other logical explanation for why this is being done\n- Developing personality changes or being severely anxious or agitated when experiencing some of the warning signs listed above\nWhat should I do if I suspect my teen is suicidal?\nIf you think your teen is in immediate danger, call 911, your local emergency number or a suicide hotline number — such as the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (1-800-273-8255) in the U.S.\nIf you suspect that your teen might be thinking about suicide, talk to him or her immediately. Don't be afraid to use the word \"suicide.\" Talking about suicide won't plant ideas in your teen's head.\nAsk your teen to talk about his or her feelings and listen. Don't dismiss his or her problems. Instead, reassure your teen of your love. Remind your teen that he or she can work through whatever is going on — and that you're willing to help.\nAlso, seek medical help for your teen. Ask your teen's doctor to guide you. Teens who are feeling suicidal usually need to see a psychiatrist or psychologist experienced in diagnosing and treating children with mental health problems.\nThe doctor will want to get an accurate picture of what's going on from a variety of sources, such as the teen, parents or guardians, other people close to the teen, school reports, and previous medical or psychiatric evaluations.\nWhat can I do to prevent teen suicide?\nYou can take steps to help protect your teen. For example:\n- Talk about mental health and suicide. Don't wait for your teen to come to you. If your teen is sad, anxious, depressed or appears to be struggling — ask what's wrong and offer your support.\n- Pay attention. If your teen is thinking about suicide, he or she is likely displaying warning signs. Listen to what your child is saying and watch how he or she is acting. Never shrug off threats of suicide as teen melodrama.\n- Discourage isolation. Encourage your teen to spend time with supportive friends and family.\n- Monitor and talk about social media use. Keep an eye on your teen's social media accounts. While social media can give teens valuable support, it can also expose them to bullying, rumor spreading, unrealistic views of other people's lives and peer pressure. If your teen is hurt or upset by social media posts or messages, encourage him or her to talk to you or a trusted teacher. Feeling connected and supported at school can have a strong protective effect.\n- Encourage a healthy lifestyle. Help your teen eat well, exercise and get regular sleep.\n- Support the treatment plan. If your teen is undergoing treatment for suicidal behavior, remind him or her that it might take time to feel better. Help your teen follow his or her doctor's recommendations. Also, encourage your teen to participate in activities that will help him or her rebuild confidence.\n- Monitor medications. Though it's uncommon, some teens might have an increase in suicidal thoughts or behavior when taking antidepressants, especially in the first few weeks after starting or when a dose is changed. But antidepressants are more likely to reduce suicide risk in the long run by improving mood. If your teen has suicidal thoughts while taking an antidepressant, immediately contact the doctor or get emergency help.\n- Safely store firearms, alcohol and medications. Access to means can play a role if a teen is already suicidal.\nIf you're worried about your teen, talk to him or her and seek help right away.\nTeen suicide prevention\nReach out — Preventing teen suicide\nMay 18, 2021\nGet the latest health information from Mayo Clinic’s experts.\nSign up for free, and stay up to date on research advancements, health tips and current health topics, like COVID-19, plus expertise on managing health.\nErrorEmail field is required\nErrorInclude a valid email address\nTo provide you with the most relevant and helpful information, and understand which\ninformation is beneficial, we may combine your email and website usage information with\nother information we have about you.

{"question":"How does the Geunja Ecolodge demonstrate sustainable tourism practices, and what level of eco-certification would it likely qualify for based on industry standards?","answer":"The Geunja Ecolodge demonstrates sustainable practices by limiting visitors to only twelve groups per year to preserve the surrounding nature, sourcing food locally from the natural environment, using traditional building materials, and operating without electricity. Based on industry standards, it would likely qualify for Advanced Ecotourism certification since it provides opportunities to learn about the environment through storytelling and cultural experiences, contributes to environmental conservation, helps local communities by preserving Sami traditions, and offers innovative nature-based experiences with minimal impact.","context":["In roadless land, at the foot of the mountain, is the Sami Ecolodge of Geunja. You will only find your way there in a boat, canoe or by foot, skiis and snows scooter transport. This is a place where the family Vinka has lived for centuries. At Geunja, you will be a part of indigenous lifestyle and experiencing an intimacy with nature and culture. For the surrounding nature and wildlife to remain as untouched as possible. Geunja only welcomes twelve groups of guests a year. As a guest at Geunja and in the home of the Vinka family, you will be a part of conservation of nature and culture.\nWhere the road ends, the adventure bigins\nOur journey begins by the end of the road. And “the end of the road” is to be taken literally; it’s not allegorical in a Dantean kind of way – the Route 363, going from the coast to the mountains, comes to a watery halt by the Tjulträsket Lake. But, to quote the villagers in Ammarnäs: where the road ends, the adventure begins.\nMikael Vinka picks us up by boat, and we race across the grand lake to reach the cove where Geunja stands. The stead looks like it’s been there for centuries: the silvery and withered timber walls of the buildings, the grass-clad roofs, the Sami goahti and outhouses standing on legs of graceful mountain birch. While it can’t be said that anything is spoken loudly in Geunja, it is a place where tradition and sustainability is allowed to speak the loudest, permeating everything from building construction and materials to the food served and the stories told.\nOur first evening at Geunja is spent in the goahti. We are sitting around the fire on aromatic birch branches, enjoying the atmosphere and having our dinner – a stew made from sautéed reindeer slices, served with potatoes, lingonberries, flatbread and cheese.\nMikael tells us about everything from the construction and function of the goahti to its traditions, such as how the family is placed, how you show your respect. We learn about Sarakka, the goddess of the hearth, and Mikael tells us how his grandfather entered this particular goahti flying through the smoke, in spirit form and the shape of a snow-white ptarmigan. Mikael is an excellent storyteller and everyone is spellbound listening to him. And this is where magic happens: everyone has a story of their own. No question is too stupid to ask. The conversations are low-key and capturing. We start conversing and listening that evening, and we keep conversing, and listening, our whole stay.\nAnd: the calmness, here too. Someone falls asleep on the hides. Another one rests her head in her husband’s lap.\nA full-on experience\nBeing there is a full-on experience. While the accommodation, the food and the storytelling is magical, it would be unfair to describe only those parts. For example: I get to see my first ever wild beaver that morning, swimming right next to me on our boat trip into the small river delta. In fact, the water is so clear I could count the pebbles on the bottom without a problem. It is an enjoyable excursion, and Mikael is an amazing guide, talking about the surrounding wildlife and vegetation.\nWe stay there for two nights. We were only meant to stay one night, and go home after lunch – a mouth-watering chanterelle soup; everything we eat at Geunja comes from the pantry of the surrounding nature – but the mere thought of it makes us both cringe. I really don’t want to leave that blissful bubble where nothing else matters but now. It is a very comforting bubble. We’re gracefully invited to stay another night, and Mikael helps us to connect with the outside world and our babysitter.\nWe can do whatever we want that afternoon. Some of the guests decide to take a walk in the mountain. Some of them want to go fishing. And we spend our afternoon resting in the sun, cuddling the dog and falling asleep together on the grass, before enjoying the sauna extraordinaire and a cold, but pleasant, swim in the lake. Mikael joins the group in the sauna, and shares stories about everything one could imagine – amongst stories about how Geunja was built and stories from the nature reserve, he talks fondly about how the Crown Princess of Sweden inaugurated Geunja sixteen years ago.\nOne thing to know about Mikael is that he collects stories. Being who he is, from a Sami descent, this means he has also been collecting lore and traditional knowledge. It’s apparent Mikael feels passionately about remembering, honoring and practicing old Sami knowledge, traditions and customs, as well as transferring those experiences to others. Meeting him means learning, in a very pleasant way.\n\"It’s like being a family, only a bit more harmonious\"\nWe go to bed late that night. In a way you could describe Geunja as a magical place, a Wonderland of the mountains, the grand escape where you lose track of time and space. The rest of the world could be destroyed in a holocaust, for all we know; all of us are present in the moment and that is all that matters. We eat when we get hungry; we sleep whenever we feel like it and we wake up as the day breaks and the pale morning sunshine shows.\nA couple of guests choose to sleep in the goahti that night. We – me and my husband – have beds in one of the lodges. There is no electricity at Geunja, but the beds are comfortable – even when we decide to use only one of the beds and fall asleep entangled – and there are candles, a kerosene lamp and a small iron stove to make the room even more pleasant and inviting.\nOne of the things about Geunja is that all the guests help out making food, doing dishes and tidying up – or with haymaking, when it’s time for that, Mikael tells me. I get to cook the porridge for breakfast, and the char that one of the guests catches that day ends up being on our dinner plates later. It’s like being a family, only a bit more harmonious, doing dishes outdoors, laughing together, with the sun warming us.\n\"I´m still in the mindset of Geunja\"\nAfter breakfast our last day at Geunja, we sit down to see Mikaels collection of Sami objects. They are old and new. They are worn, because they have been used by Mikael and his ancestors, and most of them are still in use. We get to learn about bear hunting, illustrated by, among other things, the bear spear. We are told about the magic of silver and objects used for protection. We see the driving rod, the leather pants for everyday use, the colorful woolen frock, the dried sinew and the sinew cordage and the shoe grass of bottle wedge. There are plenty of objects, and at least the double amount of stories connected to them. In a way it’s unfair to describe them as artefacts. These are things with life, with history, and they are loaded with narratives. And Mikael is a person where Sami culture and history is very present. It is very unlike what a common trip to a museum can be.\nWe go home, accompanied over the lake by Mikael and the family dog. It is a strange feeling landing on the shores of Tjulträsket, going back to another kind of civilization. But the following days, I’m still in the mindset of Geunja, forgetting about my smartphone and being in the moment.\nIt is a lovely memory. May it never go away.","What is Ecotourism?\nEcotourism is defined by Ecotourism Australia as “Ecologically sustainable tourism with a primary focus on experiencing natural areas that fosters environmental and cultural understanding, appreciation and conservation.”\nThe ECO certification program\nWant to help the environment while you are on holidays? The ECO Certification logo is a globally recognized brand which assists travellers to choose and experience a genuine and authentic tour, attraction, cruise or accommodation that is environmentally, socially and economically sustainable.\nThe ECO Certification program assures you that certified products are backed by a commitment to sustainable practices and provides high quality nature-based tourism experiences.\nThere are 3 levels of ECO certification:\n- Nature Tourism: Tourism in a natural area that leaves minimal impact on the environment.\n- Ecotourism: Tourism in a natural area that offers interesting ways to learn about the environment with an operator that uses resources wisely, contributes to the conservation of the environment and helps local communities.\n- Advanced Ecotourism: Australia’s leading and most innovative ecotourism products, providing an opportunity to learn about the environment with an operator who is committed to achieving best practice when using resources wisely, contributing to the conservation of the environment and helping local communities.\nJungle Surfing & Jungle Adventures Nightwalks are proud to have achieved Ecotourism certification at the highest level – Advanced Ecotourism.\nClimate Action Certification Program\nClimate Action Australia was established by Ecotourism Australia to provide the tourism industry with a timely response to the globally important issue of climate change. The Climate Action Certification Program is dedicated to assisting and ranking business’ efforts to reduce carbon emissions.\nThere are 3 levels of certification:\n- Climate Action Businesses: Businesses have undertaken a set of adaption and emissions reduction actions but are not necessarily measuring their carbon footprint.\n- Climate Action Innovators: Businesses have undertaken a set of adaption and emissions reduction and are auditing and measuring their carbon footprint.\n- Climate Action Leaders: Businesses have incorporated strategic climate change responses across all relevant levels of business planning and operations. They are measuring and auditing their carbon footprint via a creditable system and have undertaken an advanced level of adaptation, emissions reduction and offsetting and are working towards becoming carbon neutral.\nJungle Surfing & Jungle Adventures Nightwalks are proud to have achieved Climate Action certification at the highest level – Climate Action Leader.\nEcotourism & Jungle Surfing\nOur mission at Jungle Surfing is to be a benchmark for other tourism businesses operating in wilderness locations and inspire and assist other local businesses within our community, with the ultimate aim of becoming a carbon neutral tourism destination. Our goal is to protect and promote our pristine natural environment through the provision of unique, adventurous and educational activities with a minimal environmental footprint and sustainable operations. Our environmental initiatives include the following:\n- All operations run on renewable power from solar panels and micro-hydro turbines, with power stored in banks of batteries and supplied to buildings through an inverter. During times of year with limited sunshine hours, the water flow through the turbines in the creek supplies additional power input. And during dry season with minimal water flow, there is generally plenty of sunshine. We have a back-up generator on site in case of emergencies.\n- Our staff operate a small propagation and planting program, having previously operated a full native nursery at Cape Tribulation Resort which is now closed. We utilise native plants in revegetation projects on our own property and provide plants to local residents for revegetation on their own land.\n- The Jungle Surfing structure is designed to have a negligible effect on the trees to which the platforms and ziplines are attached. There are no bolts, nails or constrictive cables used in construction. All buildings were erected in previously cleared areas and there is minimal impact on the rainforest environment as we follow small unobtrusive walking tracks. In areas predisposed to erosion, we have built boardwalks and permanent pathways and stabilised banks with re-vegetation.\n- All construction materials were carried into the forest by hand and wherever possible recycled materials were sourced for the construction of buildings, boardwalks and platforms.\n- Our tours don’t generate noise as they are operated by manpower only.\n- We use mass transport in the form of courtesy buses to transfer our guests to and from the tour to minimise traffic and emissions on the local unsealed roads.\n- All our cleaning products are environmentally sound and bio-degradable.\n- Our effluent is treated in a Bio-cycle Tertiary Treatment Plant, the treated product is discharged to land as per statutory requirements.\n- We have a very functional recycling program in place. All our recycling and rubbish is taken to the Cow Bay transfer station. Organic waste is composted in Bokashi buckets."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_synthesis"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:14b2f438-5526-4e71-b8f7-af48606202fe>","<urn:uuid:fda17384-695e-4058-8719-8b9be6cdb381>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How is Tavarua Island Resort positioned for surfing, and what health challenges do Pacific islanders face with their modern lifestyle?","answer":"Tavarua Island faces south by southwest into the South Pacific, perfectly positioned to catch swells from the Southern Ocean. The resort offers access to multiple world-class surf breaks, including the famous Cloudbreak and Restaurants. However, Pacific islanders today face serious health challenges, with the region being the most obese globally. Nine out of the top ten most obese countries are Pacific islands, with obesity rates ranging from 35% to 50%. This is largely due to the shift from traditional diets of fresh fish and vegetables to imported processed foods, combined with decreased physical activity and a cultural acceptance of larger body types.","context":["Tavarua Island Resort\nThe mother of all world-class surf resorts. Located in the Mamanuca Island chain, about 15 miles southwest of Nadi, Tavarua is a 24 acre heart shaped island. Tavarua offers world class comfort and perfect conditions for surfing, kite-surfing, SUP, diving, fishing, or just getting a tan and reading.\nTavarua Island faces south by southwest into the South Pacific and is perfectly positioned to catch all swells coming up from the Southern Ocean.\nTavarua comfortably accommodates 36 adults in 16 private bures. They are beautifully made in a traditional island style that is still thoroughly modern in comfort. The bures are there to rest, relax, and rejuvenate, for the next surf, kite, sailboard, dive, snorkel or SUP session.\nThe food at Tavarua is legendary and tailored to meet the appetites of hungry guests who are playing hard in the ocean and the sun. The buffet is loaded with fresh, healthy foods in generous portions providing energy to restore and reload.\nTavarua began as a remote island camp offering the basics to those who love the ocean but today, Tavarua has become a family friendly resort and is finding more and more guests who come as much for the wonderful amenities as for the surf.\nThe resort at Tavarua began in 1983 with eight detached rooms. Over the last quarter of a century, the resort has evolved and the accommodations have been polished to a world-class luster.\nKelly Slater proclaimed Tavarua a “beautiful experience,” while Kevin Naughton called it a “Fiji wave garden… an idyllic experience.”\nThe accommodation is part of the beauty of that experience. Tavarua offers 14 private bures along with two Sunrise bures.\nThe 14 bures are all private and en-suite, made of hardwoods and thatch. Each is beautifully appointed with Fijian art, surf photos, air conditioning and has two VCQB (Very Comfortable Queen Beds), a day bed, louvered windows, ceiling fans, mini-bar, and a large beach side verandah for relaxing, watching the sunset or just taking in the lush island foliage and bird life.\nFor larger families or groups traveling together, Tavarua has two air-conditioned Sunrise Bures that have two bedrooms and can accommodate four adults. The Sunrise bures have two VCQB and two sleeper-couches, private verandahs and a mini-bar.\nFor those looking for the best, you may want to consider the Tavarua Villa complex offering couples, families or groups of friends the opportunity to experience Tavarua from a whole new level of Luxury.\nEach wing of this semi-detached two villa layout is appointed with all the amenities and design elements one would expect from a high end resort; large master bedroom, second back bedroom, spacious sunken living room, bathroom with spa tub and shower, air conditioning, tropical ceiling fans and more. The two villa units are connected by an additional split level deck. Villa guests can choose to lounge on their individual decks or share time with family, friends or other guests on the adjoining deck space offering spectacular panoramic ocean views.\nThe key word at Tavarua is “fresh,” as in fresh fish, fresh fruits and vegetables and fresh bread baked on the premises. Meals are served buffet style and the tables at Restaurants seat seven people, so meals are also mixers, bringing together water people and vacationers from around the world.\nThe kitchen serves three fresh meals a day, plus Happy Hour, which begins each day at four. Guests come to sample appetizer platters served poolside and on the deck. The Tavarua bar is fully stocked with an international array of wines, beers, liquors and mixed drinks that are unique to the island.\nSWIMMING POOL & SPA\nThe swimming pool on Tavarua is as clear and blue as the ocean water and located directly adjacent to the restaurant with a perfect view of Restaurants. Loved ones can swim while others get barreled, out on the reef. Next to the swimming pool is a heated spa where tired surfers can soak away the pains of the day and enjoy a happy hour drink…or two.\nOFFICE & BOUTIQUE\nTavarua provides an office for international phone calls, faxes and Internet access to stay in touch with the world.\nTavarua also offers a boutique for buying necessaries and gifts: sunscreen, hats, beach clothes and surf gear. Local art, jewelry and photography are also available to bring home as a consolation to those who couldn’t make it to Tavarua.\nSurf & Seasons\nGuests staying at Tavarua have access to a variety of breaks within a few miles of the island: Cloudbreak, Restaurants, Tavarua Rights, Kiddie Land, Swimming Pools, Namotu Left, Wilkes Pass, Desperations.\nCloudbreak is just about three miles straight south of Namotu. A world famous left reef pass that is regularly voted one of the 10 Best/Most Challenging waves in the world, Cloudbreak is a powerful open-ocean reef with three main sections. The Point, the Middle and Shish Kebabs that occasionally link up to offer a screaming, 200-yard-long ride, with a number of tube sections.\nLike many tropical reef-pass breaks, Cloudbreak tends to get faster, shallower and more critical as it goes. Waves here are regularly four to six feet, and it does not seem to close out no matter how big it gets.\nA left hander than breaks along a reef directly in front of the restaurant on Tavarua Resort. Restaurants is not as exposed to swell as Cloudbreak, but it breaks in extremely shallow water over sharp-edged coral heads with waves usually half the size of those at Cloudbreak.\nDuring a smaller swell and at higher tides, Restaurants can be any surfer’s fantasy having often been called a “skate park” in the water.\nWhen the wind and swell aren’t perfect for Namotu Left or Cloudbreak, they can be perfect for Tavarua Rights; a fun wave on the southeast side of Tavarua island.\nTavarua Rights has been described as “playful” and “user-friendly” but can become serious with size. It breaks during mid to high tides that diminish the challenges posed by sharp reef. Great for long and short boards alike, the wave is best from November to March, but can present itself during any season when the prevailing southeast wind lies down and conditions at Tavarua Right are either glassy or offshore.\nWhile Tavarua attracts experienced surfers that want to challenge some of the best waves in the world, Tavarua also offers Kiddie Land that is not really a surf break at all. Kiddie Land is actually the far inside of Restaurants and is a perfect place for beginning surfers, body boarders and even SUPers to ride their first waves.\nTavarua resort has a complete quiver of beginner equipment for all ages, and the staff is happy to assist eager students. Breaking directly in front of the Restaurant, every wave at Kiddie Land has party wave potential and it also presents a great opportunity for quality time with family and significant others.\nIf you’re thinking “playful” and “warm” and “fun” then you have the right impression of Swimming Pools, a reef-break right which has just enough of the power of a tropical wave coming up out of the deep ocean. Popular with both short boarders and longboarders, Swimming Pools has the speed, power and length to do draw any lines you choose.\nWhat Restaurants is to Tavarua, Namotu Left is to Namotu – a world-class reef break that’s more forgiving than its more famous neighbor Cloudbreak. From 6 to 15 feet, Namotu Left can be the thrill of a lifetime, but from two to six foot the wave is a shortboard, fish, longboard or SUP paradise.\nWhen the wind is going strong side shore, Namotu Left is as legendary in the sailboard and kitesurf world as Cloudbreak is in the surfing world.\nAbout a mile northwest of Namotu Island, across the channel, Wilkes Pass is a powerful right barrel that breaks on the southern tip of a long barrier reef. Wilkes is a serious wave that will test the skill of any surfer, especially as it approaches the 10-foot mark. Access to all the surf breaks is by boat, with a boatman and radio on board in case of a broken board or an up-close-and-personal inspection tour of the Fijian reefs.\nFarther northwest up the barrier reef from Wilkes Pass, Desperations is a right and left peak that breaks off a point. Desperations is the go-to spot when the ocean is having an off day, but it’s better than 90% of the waves most surfers leave behind at home.\nSeason and Weather:\nPeak: March – September\nGood: November – February\nAverage Shoulder high, up to Triple overhead\nOffshore 90% of the time\nAir: 75º to 90º (day) • 70º to 75º (night)\nWater: +68º to 90º (Tropical)\n12+ quality breaks (fun for most skill levels)\nThe cooler dry season is from April through October and the warm, wetter and more humid season is from November to March. Air temperatures range from the mid 70’s to mid 80’s year round, with water temperatures hovering in the same range, year around\nFiji does receive rain year round but the wet season also corresponds with the South Pacific cyclone Season. Although it is rare to have a cyclone impact Fiji directly in any given year, it can happen, and does typically every 5+ years for a short period (3-5 days) of very intense and very bad weather.\nThe Fiji islands also have dry and wet sides similar to Hawaii; drier on the west and south, much more rain on the east and north. The properties WaterWays has relationships with are all located on the southwest or southern end of the island chain.\nAs with most of the South Pacific, the seasonal “trade” winds blow from the southeast across the Fiji Islands June through September. These winds can blow relatively strong for 5-10 days at a time, and then often back down for a week before continuing the on and off cycle. These trade winds may not be favorable at many breaks, but each location with which we work has some “fall back” plan in the event of unfavorable conditions.\nDuring the wet season winds blow from the north, which is offshore for most breaks along the south coast. The shoulder months of March through May and October through early November receive light and variable winds producing many glassy days.\nThe south swell window is generally from March through November while North swells are biggest and most consistent from December through February.\nSouth Pacific does receive southern hemisphere swells year around and it is very rare for Fiji to receive a north ground swell out of season.\nTo sum it up: If you’re looking for the biggest surf, March through November is the go. Surfers looking for the cleanest conditions and the least crowded time of the year should visit during wet season from December through February.\nMany people prefer to travel during shoulder months of March, April, May and September, October, November, hoping to get glassy conditions with early or late south swells.\nFiji is as renowned in the world of wind sports as it is in the surf world.\nWhen conditions go bad for surfing, they usually are a green light for windsurfers and kiters, who go for speed runs inside of the reef and out in the channels, or put their wave-riding skills to the test in some of the most challenging conditions in the world.\nFiji is also a perfect place to develop kite skills, as beginners can stay within the reef and the lee of the island to control how much wind exposure they can handle.\nTavarua does have some equipment. Call or e-mail our office to see if we have the right gear for you.\nTavarua is the place to cruise over the crystal clear reefs, to learn to ride waves at Kiddie Land and Swimming Pools, or to try experienced SUP skills in more serious surf at Cloudbreak, Restaurants, Tavarua Rights and Namotu Lefts.\n- Snorkeling & Diving\n- Skate ramp\n- Massage & Spa\n- Swimming Pool\n- Fitness Bure\nNotes: Serious tennis players may want to bring their own equipment, but rackets and balls are available for your use on the island.\nDesigned by Tony Hawk himself, the Tavarua mini-ramp has two drop in heights for both novice and experienced skaters. Safety equipment and boards are available for your use.\n” You made our trip so much better! We would have been lost without ya’ll! Mmmm… good food. Good people. Good waves. Love this place! It will always be in my heart and soul.”\n- Seven nights air conditioned bure accommodations (Saturday/Saturday).\n- Surf transfers by boat to all breaks\n- Three meals per day\n- Use of island facilities and equipment (SUP, Kayak etc)\n- Roundtrip Airport Transfers\n- Not Included: Board bag fees imposed by airline, beverages.\nPlease contact WaterWays Travel for land & air inclusive package rates.\nAll Pricing Subject to Change.

A place many long to escape to for sun, sea and serenity. But the Pacific islands have another reality for the residents living there – a life based on imported food, little exercise and remote access to healthcare.\nThe result? The most obese nations in the world.\n‘A deadly epidemic’\n“One third of the world is either overweight or obese right now,” says Emmanuela Gakidou, professor of Global Health at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. Gakidou’s recent paper used data from countries across the world to identify the global burden of obesity and trends seen in different populations. “The Pacific islands have a lot of countries with very high levels of obesity,” she adds.\nAmong the top 10 most obese countries or territories globally, nine are Pacific islands, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), making this paradise the fattest region of the world.\n“Up to 95% of the adult population are overweight or obese in some countries,” says Temo Waqanivalu, program officer with the WHO’s Prevention of Non-communicable Diseases department. As a Fijian Native, Waqanivalu has worked on the issue for over a decade and seen the epidemic evolve first-hand, aided by the cultural acceptance of bigger bodies as beautiful. “In Polynesia the perception of ‘big is beautiful’ does exist,” he says. “[But] big is beautiful, fat is not. That needs to get through.”\nPercentages for obesity range from 35% to 50% throughout the islands, according to the WHO. The Cook Islands top the ranks with just over 50% of its population classified as obese.\n“It’s a deadly epidemic,” says Waqanivalu.\nObesity is measured through an individual’s body mass index (BMI) and a measurement above 30kg/m² is defined as clinically obese.\nPacific islanders tend to have a naturally big build, says Jonathan Shaw, associate director of Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute, Australia. “With Pacific islanders, their frame is typically bigger,” he explains, “but that still doesn’t account for the obesity we see.”\nPoor diets and reduced exercise have become a major public health concern for the region as they are not only a cause of obesity – associated diseases are also rife, such as heart disease, stroke and diabetes, the latter of which has a known genetic basis among locals.\n“This is a population with a genetic predisposition and when exposed to Western lifestyles results in high rates of diabetes,” says Shaw. “[This is] undoubtedly caused by high rates of obesity.”\nThe epidemic began through the tropical region turning its back on traditional diets of fresh fish and vegetables and replacing them with highly processed and energy-dense food such as white rice, flour, canned foods, processed meats and soft drinks imported from other countries. One of the root causes of the change is the price tag.\n“All over the world, poor quality and highly energy-dense food is the cheapest,” says Shaw. As demand for healthier alternatives remain low, their market is small.\nThis is exemplified by fishermen often selling the fish they catch to in turn purchase canned tuna. “[You] can buy a few meals with what you get selling fish,” says Waqanivalu.\nThe new food environment locals find themselves living in has accelerated the trend towards consuming processed food. “It’s significantly cheaper,” adds Waqanivalu. “It’s cheaper to buy a bottle of coke than a bottle of water.”\nAs with other regions of the world, increased urbanization and sedentary office cultures have further aided the rise in obesity among Pacific islanders.\n“A lot of physical activity was in the domain of work,” says Waqanivalu, referring to fisherman heading out to sea and others working their land on plantations. “The concept of leisure-time activity is new,” he says.\nThe tropical climate desired by sun seekers is less attractive to those needing to keep fit. “In tropical countries there is a desire to avoid physical work and even walk,” says Shaw. “We’re all driven to conserve energy.”\nAll in the genes?\nSome scientists believe that Pacific island populations have evolved to maintain their larger build – a concept known as the “Thrifty Gene” hypothesis. For this region of the world, the concept is based on the fact Pacific islanders once endured long journeys at sea and those who fared best stored enough energy in the form of fat to survive their journey.\n“We have the remnants of those people … and their metabolism as well,” says Waqanivalu. The increased risk of obesity among native Pacific islanders is shown on the islands of Fiji, where the population has a more mixed ethnicity. The country stands at the lower end of the region’s spectrum with 36.4% of the adult population classed as obese. Just more than half of the Fijian population are native iTaukei, with the remainder mostly of Indian origin, according to the CIA World Factbook. “That explains the lower rates,” says Waqanivalu.\nThe naturally higher BMI of the people in the region has, however, prompted calls to increase the cut-off for the level of BMI denoting obesity in the Pacific region from 30 to 32 kg/m². A lower cut-off has been suggested for Asian populations based on the same premise, as Asian countries – including Korea, Myanmar and Cambodia – make up the majority of the lowest 10 countries globally in terms of obesity..\nAfter the global trends in obesity seen in her study, Gakidou’s real concern is the rates her team saw in children in the Pacific. “The rate for children is high … about one in five children [are obese],” she says. “This has repercussions in the long term.”\nRepercussions include diabetes, which is already a burden on health services in the region. “The concern in children would be early onset of diabetes,” says Gakidou.\nThe WHO has made a series of recommendations to improve the situation and is implementing them through policy changes in the countries. “Type II diabetes is emerging in young children 10-11 years old,” says Waqanivalu, who has also heard reports of a child as young as seven years old being affected. “[It’s the] tip of the iceberg in children.”\nBut Waqanilu is confident his department is making some progress through recommendations such as increased taxation on soft drinks, improving trade in the region, controlled marketing of products targeting children through schools, and policies to promote healthier diets and exercise.\n“The whole food environment needs to be changed,” he says. This has been the ambition of the Healthy Islands Vision – initiated by the ministers of health for the Pacific island countries in 1995 – which aims to combat obesity and diabetes among its health priorities.\nHealth systems also need strengthening to better handle the consequences of obesity. “We have definitely made steps but need to make strides for this to be sorted in our time,” says Waqanivalu."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:82c453aa-1dbd-48ae-ad30-702d21b0230b>","<urn:uuid:f2dd344a-e5d5-4a5a-b5bb-ebd628af24b3>"],"error":null}

Mike Dreznes explains how sand barrels may be the answer for many countries\nApproximately 30% of all fatalities on the world’s roads are single vehicle, non-pedestrian crashes where an errant vehicle leaves the road, goes down a slope, flips over or impacts a rigid object at the roadside. Ideally all rigid roadside objects should be removed to create a clear zone to allow errant vehicles first to recover and then safely return to the roadway.\nHowever, when it is not possible to remove these, it is possible to reduce the consequences of the crashes by installing a crash cushion. Also known as impact attenuators, these can be placed in front of rigid objects to protect motorists. Using a crash cushion helps to create a “forgiving road” that forgives an Vehicle when someone behind the wheel makes a mistake that will inevitably be made by most, if not all drivers.\nIn the US in the 1970s, and in Europe until the early 1990s, the concept of a crash cushion was very new and few people understood what they were. That situation has changed and crash cushion systems have been installed across the road networks of the US and Europe, as well as in Canada, Japan or Australia, for example. Unfortunately, today in many low and middle income countries around the world, the concept is still new and not widely understood by drivers or road authorities alike.\nCrash cushions are now standard safety products in the US, Australia, Canada and many of the European countries with excellent safety records. They are mandated and included in every road design, and they have been credited with saving tens of thousands - if not hundreds of thousands - of lives over the past 40 years. These are placed in front of rigid roadside objects and blunt ends located close to the road, so as to prevent vehicles from experiencing catastrophic impacts with potential loss of life to occupants.\nPlacing the barrels in front of an obstruction can boost safety significantly\nBut why are these energy absorbing lifesavers not being used in every country in the world? The answer may be two-fold: road authorities in some countries may be unaware of these safety products or road authorities in some lower income countries cannot justify the initial cost as well as the cost to maintain these safety features. However, there are old and proven, yet simple and low cost solutions that should be taken under serious consideration by all road authorities in every country in the world. They can help to make roads more forgiving for the occupants of those vehicles that leave the roadway and strike a roadside object, with a corresponding reduction in road deaths as a result.\nThe definition of the word “attenuate” is, “to reduce the severity, virulence, or vitality,” so an impact attenuator reduces the severity of a crash. As well as crash cushions, other examples could be seat belts, airbags, or longitudinal barriers, transitions and guardrail terminals. These are passive safety devices because they do not prevent the impact but instead reduce the severity of the collision.\nSome of the first crash cushions introduced in the US were empty steel drums that had the tops and the bottoms removed and placed in an array in front of the barrier end or roadside object. The idea was to soften the initial impact and these units were especially suitable for use with lighter weight vehicles. The drums in the back had small holes in their tops and empty beer cans were sometimes stuffed inside to give them additional stiffness. This allowed the drums to absorb the energy from larger vehicles before they impacted the rigid object behind.\nIn the 1970s, these steel drum arrays were replaced by arrays of sand barrels and the empty beer cans were replaced by sand. The number of barrels in an array, and the quantity of sand in each barrel, are determined based on the design speed and the width of the hazard. It is extremely important to use the appropriate number of barrels in a properly designed array. Single row arrays should never be used, and putting only one or two barrels in front of a rigid object is a waste of money that generates a false sense of security. These inertial sand barrel impact attenuators continue to be used today and while the concept may look simple, it is rather more complex than it seems.\nUsing sand barrels\nSand barrels used in inertial sand barrel impact attenuators are designed to be strong enough to be lifted with nearly 1000kg of sand inside of them. This performance often is required, and especially when these inertial sand barrel impact attenuators are used as temporary protection in a work zone. They are designed to break upon impact to allow the errant vehicle to “bulldoze” through the sand contained in the barrels, so as to absorb the vehicle’s energy. This is known as the conservation of momentum principle or momentum transfer.\nSince the 1970s, highways in the US have benefited from the use of sand barrel type attenuators\nThe sand barrels placed in the front of an inertial sand barrel impact attenuator array will feature about 90kg of sand inside so as to reduce the consequences of an impact by a lightweight vehicle. The next rows may have about 180kg of sand. The next rows may have about 320kg of sand while the next to the last rows may have about 450kg of sand inside. Very often the last rows will contain about 960kg of sand to ensure the energy from larger weight vehicles (up to 2000kg) is absorbed and prevent an impact with the rigid object. If these differing quantities of sand were simply placed in the bottom of each barrel, the sand would act as a ramp when impacted by an errant vehicle. For this reason, inserts are placed in the barrels to lift the sand off the ground and thus maintain the same centre of gravity, regardless of the quantity of sand contained inside. Using an insert ensures that the vehicle will remain stable as it is brought to a controlled stop. It is also important that the sand does not freeze in cold weather. To tackle this issue, salt is sometimes mixed with the sand in areas where moisture can get into the barrels and freezing temperatures are common.\nInertial sand barrel impact attenuators can be very effective if they are impacted head-on, and properly designed arrays of inertial sand barrel impact attenuators have been tested at 100km/h (Test Level 3) to the US NCHRP 350 standard and at 110km/h in Europe to the EN1317-4 standard. Both the US and European crash testing methodologies are accepted in a wide range of developing nations, so these test results do provide guidance for road authorities. The inertial sand barrel impact attenuators are considered as non-re-directive crash cushions, since they are not able to redirect an errant vehicle that impacts the sand barrels on an angle on the side of the array. A vehicle impacting the very rear of the array on an angle collides with what is considered the “coffin corner” because the vehicle may be able to reach the rigid object. For this reason the barrels near the corner of the hazard need to be placed at a minimum 760mm offset, as recommended by the manufacturers.\nThey are considered “disposable” or “sacrificial” crash cushions because they must be replaced after a design impact – and they also do require maintenance to clean up the sand after an impact.\nThere are at least four different models of inertial sand barrel impact attenuators available, each with a slightly different design. However it is worth noting that the US Federal Highway Administration has issued a technical advisory stating that these can be used interchangeably in an inertial sand barrel impact attenuator array, provided the sand barrel weights are correct. This helps to ensure that the cost of these inertial sand barrel impact attenuators remains competitive.\nThe non-re-directive performance classification and the need to replace the arrays after a design impact are the negative aspects regarding inertial sand barrel impact attenuators. The real positive aspects of the inertial sand barrel impact attenuators are the wide variety of hazard shapes/sizes that can be shielded as well as the low initial price. The cost for an inertial sand barrel impact attenuator array can be as little as one third to one tenth of a high performance re-directive crash cushion. This means that as many as 10 rigid objects could be shielded with inertial sand barrel impact attenuators for the same price as one higher performance reusable crash cushion. Ideally, inertial sand barrel impact attenuators should be used at sites that are not frequently impacted. If the impacts are frequent, an economic justification or a benefit-cost analysis should be made to install higher performing, lower maintenance partially reusable or reusable crash cushions.\nSpecial lifting devices can be used to set up attenuator arrays\nThese inertial sand barrel impact attenuators were used in the US to introduce the concept of crash cushions in the 1970s, and they continue to be used in the US even today. They should be used in every country in the world to encourage the use of crash cushions to protect errant motorists from rigid roadside hazards. The performance of these inertial sand barrel impact attenuators is acceptable when they are impacted head-on and during many angled impacts. This outcome of an impact by an errant vehicle into an inertial sand barrel impact attenuator is significantly better than if this vehicle impacted an unshielded rigid roadside hazard regardless of the angle of impact.\nThe goal of road authorities must continue to be to reduce “needless deaths” to help them meet the United Nations Road Safety Collaboration Decade of Action challenge to reduce fatalities on their roads by 50% by 2020. Not making the effort to make their roads more “forgiving” when drivers make their inevitable mistakes through the use of inertial sand barrel impact attenuators to shield rigid objects on their roads is irresponsible and inexcusable. It is the road authority’s responsibility to be aware of state-of-the-art safety devices and to mandate their use. It is not a design consultants’ job to teach a road authority about road safety. If a road authority is already aware of crash cushions or impact attenuators and the excuse for not using them is due to their perceived high initial cost, inertial sand barrel impact attenuators provide the solution.\nIf something is important to someone, that person will “Find a Way” to make it happen. If it is not important, that person will find an excuse. But excuses are the tools of the incompetent and nothing in life is more important than saving someone’s life, especially when it is part of a job’s responsibility. Road authorities need to “Find a Way” to make their roads safer. The time for excuses for not making roads safer around the world is over.\n“If not you, then who, and if not now, then when?”\n- Mike Dreznes is executive vice president IRF Washington and is recognised internationally as a world leading authority on road safety technology"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:6cabd765-ecc1-4386-9f72-d52e7838405b>","<urn:uuid:b37f1bfb-dd71-4bcc-b6da-be7d6513f247>"],"error":null}

For example, Tealium uses this approach to create a vendor-neutral data foundation, enabling businesses to create a data taxonomy accessible anywhere the client operates. This approach maximizes the benefits of balanced client-server data management through an intuitive management interface.","context":["Data management is at the heart of any successful business, impacting everything from decision-making to customer engagement. As data volume continues to grow exponentially, understanding how to effectively manage and leverage it becomes increasingly essential. A key aspect of this involves understanding the difference between client-side and server-side data management, each having its own strengths and drawbacks. In this comprehensive guide, we’ll provide a simplified overview of these concepts to help you choose what’s best for your business needs, data strategy, and budget.\nThe Significance of Data Management\nBefore delving into client-side and server-side data management, it’s crucial to understand the concept of data management and its importance. In the simplest terms, data management refers to the practices, architectural techniques, and tools for managing, organizing, retrieving, maintaining, and preserving data. The ultimate goal of data management is to produce high-quality, reliable, and accessible data to support informed decision-making.\nEffective data management is the backbone of successful businesses in today’s data-driven world. It enables organizations to control their data, ensure data quality, enhance productivity, and meet regulatory requirements. Moreover, it allows organizations to draw meaningful insights from their data, leading to more informed decision-making, improved customer engagement, better marketing strategies, and ultimately, a competitive edge in the market.\nGiven the crucial role of data management, it’s not surprising that companies invest heavily in tools and technologies to streamline their data management process. Among these tools are platforms like Google Tag Manager, which offer both client-side and server-side data management options. These platforms provide organizations the flexibility to choose the method that best suits their unique needs and budget.\nMaking the Choice: Client-Side and Server-Side Data Management\nChoosing the right approach to data management is crucial for your organization’s success. The decision to use client-side or server-side data management will largely depend on your business needs, budget, technical capabilities, and the nature of the data you’re handling. In some cases, you may find that a combination of both methods is the best way forward.\nTo make an informed decision, it’s important to understand what these two methods entail, how they work, and their pros and cons. So, let’s take a closer look at each one.\nExploring Client-Side Tracking\nClient-side tracking, often carried out using tags, is a prevalent method for sending data from web pages. This process involves the user’s browser, also known as the client, sending data directly to a server.\nTypically, client-side tracking is utilized to collect and share data from your website with your marketing technology providers. This process is commonly referred to as tag management. Tag management systems enable marketers to manage and unify their customer data and digital marketing applications.\nA prominent advantage of client-side tracking is its lower cost. Unlike server-side tracking, which relies on third-party cloud resources, client-side tracking leverages the target user’s device for data transfer. As a result, it generally incurs lower costs, making it an attractive option for smaller businesses or those with budget constraints.\nClient-Side Tracking: Benefits and Drawbacks\nAs with any technology, client-side tracking comes with its own set of benefits and drawbacks. Understanding these can help businesses make an informed decision about whether it’s the right choice for them.\nBenefits of Client-Side Tracking\n- User Experience: Since client-side tracking occurs directly in the user’s browser, it allows for real-time data collection and analysis. This can significantly enhance user experience, as businesses can provide immediate feedback or personalized content based on the user’s behavior.\n- Accessibility and Ease of Use: Client-side tracking is typically easier to implement than server-side tracking. Many vendors provide a snippet of code that can be easily copied and pasted to start tracking data. The prevalence of client-side tracking has led to a wealth of online resources and expertise, making it a readily accessible option for many businesses.\n- Cost-Effective: As mentioned earlier, client-side tracking generally incurs lower costs compared to server-side tracking. This is because the data transfer process leverages the user’s device rather than third-party cloud resources.\nDrawbacks of Client-Side Tracking\n- Dependence on the User’s Device: Client-side tracking relies heavily on the user’s device and browser to function effectively. If the user’s device is old or the browser is outdated, it could impact the effectiveness of data tracking. Similarly, issues such as a slow internet connection or browser crashes could lead to data loss.\n- Potential Privacy Issues: With increased concerns about user privacy and data protection, using client-side tracking could potentially lead to compliance issues. Since the data is collected directly from the user’s browser, businesses must ensure they comply with all relevant data protection regulations.\nUnderstanding Server-Side Tracking\nIn contrast to client-side tracking, server-side tracking, also known as cloud delivery, is a method where data is sent to your web server or a different type of server by a pixel or tag. Your web server then passes that data to the destination system or server. This data could be used by various platforms such as a marketing automation platform, an analytics provider, a personalization tool, or another type of execution system.\nServer-side tracking provides greater control, accuracy, and reliability over data management. As the scope of data management is more concentrated, organizations can exert more control over the transmission process, leading to more accurate and reliable data.\nFurthermore, server-side tracking shifts the processing load from the user’s device to the cloud, which can significantly enhance application and device performance. A faster application that uses less power can improve the customer experience and potentially boost conversion rates.\nServer-Side Tracking: Advantages and Challenges\nJust like client-side tracking, server-side tracking also has its set of advantages and challenges that businesses should consider before making a choice.\nAdvantages of Server-Side Tracking\n- Improved Control and Accuracy: With server-side tracking, businesses have greater control over the data collection process. This can result in more accurate data and better insights for decision-making.\n- Enhanced Reliability: Server-side tracking isn’t as susceptible to data challenges due to client-side issues, such as an interrupted connection or an over-active ad blocker. This makes server-side tracking generally more reliable than its client-side counterpart.\n- Better Performance: By transferring the processing burden to the cloud, server-side tracking can significantly improve application and device performance. This can lead to an enhanced user experience and potentially higher conversion rates.\nChallenges of Server-Side Tracking\n- Higher Costs: Compared to client-side tracking, server-side tracking can be more expensive. This is because it involves using third-party cloud resources for data transfer.\n- Complex Implementation: Implementing server-side tracking can be more complex than client-side tracking. It requires more technical expertise and resources, which could be a challenge for smaller businesses or those with limited technical capabilities.\n- Data Latency: In some cases, server-side tracking may introduce a slight delay in data availability. This is because the data needs to be processed by the server before it can be used, which could take some time depending on the volume and complexity of the data.\nEmbracing the Data Layer Approach for Effective Data Management\nWhether you’re managing data on the server-side or client-side, one thing is certain: effective data management requires a robust data foundation. This is where the data layer approach comes in.\nThe data layer approach is a strategic method for managing data that involves creating a central repository or “layer” where all your data is stored. This data layer serves as a single source of truth, simplifying the process of defining and accessing data.\nTealium employs this data layer approach to create a vendor-neutral data foundation. This not only simplifies data management but also maximizes the benefits of balanced client-server data management. With an intuitive management interface, Tealium enables businesses to create a data taxonomy that can be accessed anywhere the client operates.\nBy standardizing your data and centralizing it in one place, the data layer approach significantly simplifies the process of using data, whether it’s client-side or server-side. This ensures that all your data is accurately tracked, securely stored, and easily accessible, regardless of where or how it’s collected.\nChoosing the Right Data Management Solution\nChoosing the right data management solution isn’t a one-size-fits-all approach. Depending on your specific needs, you might opt for cloud deployment (server-side) for data collection and delivery. Alternatively, traditional client-side tags may prove to be the optimal solution. In some cases, a combination of both methods might be the most effective way forward.\nWhen choosing between client-side and server-side data management, it’s crucial to consider a variety of factors. These include your business needs, budget, technical capabilities, the nature of the data you’re handling, and the regulatory environment you’re operating in.\nUltimately, the best data management solution is one that provides flexible capabilities that support both traditional and new data management practices. This enables you to adapt to changing business needs and technological advancements, ensuring that your data management process remains effective, efficient, and relevant.\nRemember, the key to successful data management lies not only in choosing the right method but also in understanding how to use it effectively. This requires a deep understanding of your data, your tools, and your overall business strategy. By keeping these considerations in mind, you can make an informed decision about your data management process and leverage your data to drive business success."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:e06c79ca-b2f8-4423-bc62-624f2f04861e>"],"error":null}

If your pet consumes any part of a tomato plant, you should seek veterinary care immediately.","context":["With spring comes the opportunity many of us have been waiting for all winter: getting our hands dirty while beautifying our outdoor spaces. With every seed or bulb we plant – and every lawn or pest product we choose – comes the opportunity to not only perk up our yards but also keep our pets safe. Unbeknownst to many pet owners, many of the most common plants and products on the market can be toxic to our curious cats and dogs. Fortunately, a little knowledge goes a long way, and a myriad of safe options exist, allowing both your yard and your pets to flourish.\nAvoid these Potentially Toxic Flowers\n- Lilies: These are popular garden flowers simply because they look pretty. However, those pretty flowers are extremely dangerous, especially to cats when ingested. There are also certain types of lilies that can be harmful to dogs.\n- Daffodils: These brilliant flowers can be highly toxic both to dogs and cats. Any part of this plant can be poisonous to your pet, but the bulbs are the most dangerous part.\n- Tulip: When your pet eats a tulip, or worse the bulb of a tulip, the symptoms show up within just a few hours. The bulb is the worst part of the plant, as it has concentrated levels of glycosides Tulipanin A and B. However, even the leaves and flowers contain small amounts of the toxin.\n- Begonias: A popular and easy-to-grow flower, the begonia’s appealing petals belie the deadly toxins hiding in its underground stem. These can irritate your pet’s mouth, lips, and esophagus, and cause swelling of the tongue.\n- Crocuses: Both the spring and autumn varieties of the crocus are potentially dangerous to cats and dogs. Side effects from ingesting autumn crocuses tend to be more severe, including damage to the livers, kidney, and bone marrow. Pets who eat springtime crocuses may experience comparatively mild symptoms like gastrointestinal distress.\n- Azaleas: A few azalea leaves alone can leave dogs and cats suffering from excessive drooling, as well as intestinal symptoms. Without intervention from a veterinarian, pets can quickly fall into comas and die.\n- Hyacinths: The toxic alkaloids in hyacinths cause symptoms like diarrhea, vomiting, and tremors in both dogs and cats. In more extreme cases, your pet’s heart rate may rise exponentially, and breathing may become labored.\n- Buttercups: Just a small taste of a buttercup can cause lethargy, loss of appetite, vomiting, diarrhea, and an unsteady gait in pets.\n- Dieffenbachia: Chewing or biting into the dieffenbachia (or dumbcane) plant can release insoluble crystals of calcium oxalate called raphides. These crystals can penetrate the tissue which can result in your pet getting injured.\n- Foxglove: Don’t let this innocent-looking plant fool you. Despite its trumpet-like flowers, foxglove is very poisonous to dogs, cats, and even humans! All parts of this plant are toxic, including any water in a vase that cut foxglove has been in.\n- Chrysanthemum: While the beautiful chrysanthemum is generally not fatal to most pets, it causes a host of unpleasant symptoms. Chrysanthemums have lactones which cause irritation of the stomach. It also is a source of pyrethrin, which is used as an organic insecticide. Pyrethrin will not generally impact your pets in low doses, but larger doses can be another irritant factor.\n- Ivy: English Ivy‘s foliage is more dangerous than its berries to dogs and cats, and can cause a host of different symptoms. Boston ivy isn’t much better. In fact, there are multiple varieties of climbing ivy that have irritating triterpenoid saponins. These saponins probably won’t kill your pets, but they’re going to make them wish for relief in short order.\nFence These Vegetable Plants\nFor some people, one of the greatest enjoyments of the summertime is working in the garden and enjoying the rewards of their hard work when harvest arrives. However, there are plants and human foods t\nhat can be toxic to dogs and cats. If any of the following are ingested, it is important to seek veterinary care right away:\n- Tomato plants (not the ripe fruit), which cause gastrointestinal irritation, ataxia and weakness\n- Rhubarb leaves, which cause kidney failure in large doses\n- Onions and garlic, which result in red blood cell destruction and anemia\n- Grapes or raisins, which cause acute kidney failure\nComposting is great when done appropriately! Be sure it does not contain any dairy or meat products, and that it is fenced off to keep pets and wildlife safe. These piles of decomposing and decaying organic matter have the potential to grow the mold Penicillium crustosum which produces a tremor causing toxin called Penitrem A. Such toxins are referred to as “tremorgenic mycotoxins” and are toxic to both dogs and cats, as well as people and wildlife.\nBeware of Mulch\nMany mulch products pose a foreign body and obstruction risk if ingested. Cocoa bean mulch, however, poses an even larger problem due to the methylxanthine (theobromine and caffeine) content. Methylxanthines, in high enough doses, can cause vomiting, diarrhea, agitation, ataxia, tremors, elevated heart rate, elevated blood pressure and seizures. Early and aggressive veterinary care is important to minimize the severity of toxicity.\nBanish Blue-green algae\nBlue-green algae, also called cyanobacteria, is found in fresh and brackish water of ponds and lakes, but this microscopic bacterium can also grow in backyard fountains, garden pots, birdbaths, and anywhere water is stagnant. Simply licking the water off the coat could be fatal. Regardless of where it’s found, blue-green algae is dangerous. Fence off contaminated ponds and lakes to prevent pets from drinking affected water and provide fresh water sources for all animals. Remove standing water from plant containers, birdbaths, fish ponds, and fountains. Not all types of algae are deadly, but it is difficult to tell which are poisonous without specific analysis. It is safest to consider all algae blooms to be dangerous and avoid them altogether.\nMany people use fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides throughout the summer months, all of which can pose a health risk to dogs and cats. For instance, gastrointestinal upset is very common with ingesting traditional fertilizers which contain iron, causing additional issues and potentially resulting in significant health concerns. While pesticides are much safer than they were 30 years ago, there are still some ingredients that may be more problematic than others. The majority will cause vomiting and diarrhea; however, in large doses, certain ingredients can result in more serious problems.\nFor the safest yard and garden, utilize natural and organic products. Diatomaceous earth is harmless to your pets but will cause small insects to dehydrate. Likewise, beneficial nematodes can eliminate fleas before they hatch, greatly reducing the population. Pest problems can be real but there are plenty of pet-safe, organic solutions on the market."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:db0e0953-ea2a-4411-8037-a104ca8d46c3>"],"error":null}

Some of the very famous countries like the USA, UK, Canada, Columbia, Philippines, Australia, Pakistan, India, New Zealand, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Pakistan, and Malaysia which use Military Time Format for military and emergency services. However, this time format only for military and navy persons. Other people in these countries use 12 hours time format.\nHowever, all the above mention countries are nearby from each other, but surprisingly the military time format varies from each other for both local civilians and military personnel. The main purpose of this time chart is to aware of the soldiers and generals about the secret mission. So, in 1941 the USA started using Joint Army or Navy Radiotelephony Alphabet to standardize the systems to consider the standard for all military time.\nJust because of this reason, the army time chart concept came in the world and necessary to exist at the time of set up.

You know very well that military time is greater than 12:00. So, just subtract 12 hours to get the Military Time if it is greater than 12. For example, if you have 15.30 hours, then to get standard time to subtract 15.30 hours from 12 and you will get 3.30 PM.\nBut what if military time is less than or equal 12. In this situation, you just add AM. For example, if 8.45 hours then simple add 8.45 AM.\nConvert Standard Time to Military Time\nIf the 12-hour time is in AM then just simply, remove AM. If your time portion is in single-digit say for example 2.45 AM then simply add 0 before 2 i.e. 02. This is because of the 24-hour time.\nBut if your time is in PM then you will add 12 hours and remove PM. For example, 2.30 PM then add 2+12= 14 then your military time is 14.30 hours or 1430 hours.\nMilitary Time Clock – 24 Hour Clock Converter\nBy using the above easy methods of Military Time Conversion, you can easily convert standard time (12-hour time) into Military (24-hour) Time.
