These state resource properties contain more than 42,000 acres of rugged, forested land in Clark, Scott and Washington counties in southern Indiana. The trail extends from Deam Lake, just north of S.R. 60 in Clark County, to Delaney Park, just east of S.R. 135 in Washington County. The initial 32-mile segment of the trail was opened in 1980.\nThe Indiana Department of Natural Resources has developed the Knobstone Trail as a cooperative effort between the Divisions of Fish and Wildlife, Forestry and Outdoor Recreation. The Division of Outdoor Recreation's Streams and Trails Section coordinates development and maintenance of the trail. The Nature Conservancy has helped acquire land necessary to complete the trail corridor. Construction and maintenance of the trail has been aided by many hours of volunteer work donated by various hiking clubs and other groups. Much of the initial trail construction was accomplished through the Young Adult Conservation Corps program.\nThe Knobstone Trail passes primarily through state forests, which are managed for \"multiple use\" to obtain maximum benefits from recreation, timber and wildlife production, and watershed protection. They are open to the public for hunting during season, and are managed actively to increase the fish and wildlife population. The harvesting of timber provides valuable income for the state of Indiana. Timber management and harvesting also provide diverse cover and food necessary for the perpetuation of many game and non-game animal species, and helps ensure that our forest resources will be available for future generations.\nThe trail traverses land with extreme relief distinguished by narrow, relatively flat-topped ridges typical of the Knobstone Escarpment - a knobby slope between the Norman Upland and Scottsburg Lowland, two of southern Indiana's natural land regions. The Knobstone Escarpment is one of Indiana's most scenic areas, rising more than 300 feet above low-lying farmland in some areas as it snakes northward from near the Ohio River to just south of Martinsville. A central upland, mixed hardwood forest (oak-hickory and beech-maple association) dominates much of the escarpment. \"Knobstone\" shale, which is actually a combination of weathered brown shale, sandstone and siltstone, is common in the area and gives the escarpment its name.\nThe Knobstone Trail is developed and managed for foot traffic only. Because of erosion, damage to structures, and the safety of hikers, horses, bicycles, and motorized vehicles are not allowed on the trail.\nBecause the trail follows the Knobstone Escarpment, there are many steep climbs and descents. It can be regarded as a rugged, difficult trail to hike. It is managed and maintained at backcountry standards, and structures are limited to primitive steps and waterbars. Maintenance responsibilities fall to a two-person field crew, occasionally assisted by volunteers.\nThe trail crosses several roads, varying from state highways to gravel country lanes. Use caution when crossing these roads.\nEight trailheads have been developed along the trail, providing parking areas and direct access to the Knobstone Trail. The Delaney Park Trailhead is located within Delaney Park, a Washington County Park that includes facilities for camping, cabins, showers, and a gated entrance. The Elk Creek Trailhead is located at a public access site on Elk Creek Lake. The parking area for the lake and trail is paved. All of the other trailheads include a small gravel parking area.\nFollowing the Trail\nThe Knobstone Trail map shows the general route of the trail and the topography of the area. Minor reroutes have been constructed over the past few years to avoid some problem areas, and they are not indicated on the map. On the ground, the trail is marked by 2-inch by 6-inch white blazes painted near eye level on trees. Two blazes on a tree indicate the trail changes direction at an intersection with another trail or forest road. Attempts are made to mark the trail so that it is easy to follow. Trees which fall on the trail because of natural events can make it more challenging. Therefore, it is important to utilize both the map and the blazes while hiking the trail.\nWhile using the trail, stay on public property. In some areas, the trail follows a very narrow corridor of public property. The KT map shows the public property boundaries. Hikers are responsible for helping maintain good relations between hikers and private property owners.\nThe trail map is available from DNR Map Sales (317-232-4200). They are usually available at Clark State Forest's office (812-294-4306) in Henryville, the Deam Lake State Recreation Area's (812-246-5421) office near Borden. The maps are available for $4.00 from the properties only during office hours.\nThe Knobstone Trail passes primarily through state forests, which are managed for \"multiple use\" to obtain maximum benefits from recreation, timber, and wildlife production and watershed protection. They are open to the public for hunting during season, and are actively managed to increase the fish and wildlife population. Trails are developed, along with other recreational projects, to be compatible with the growth and harvest of timber and to retain the watershed protection that forests naturally provide. The harvesting of timber provides valuable income for the state of Indiana. Timber management and harvesting also provide diverse cover and food necessary for the perpetuation of many game and non-game animal species and helps insure that our forest resources will be available for future generations.\nFor more information on the Knobstone Trail, contact:","Hyde Park Circle Trail\n|A trail with excellent views of the Sangre de Cristo, Jemez, Sandia, San Pedro, and Ortiz mountains (i.e., views in most all directions).

Park in the visitor center parking lot and pay the park day use fee. The trailhead (shown here) is across the road from the visitor center.\nAbout the hike:\nYou start by crossing a bridge over the Little Tesuque Creek. You can barely see it in the trailhead photo above. While this trail's elevation is not large compared to many hikes we have done, the elevation gain happens in a much shorter distance. You get to start climbing as soon as you cross the creek, and you will be climbing almost non-stop for the first third of the hike. The initial part of the hike is in and out of shade, and as a result, the sun can be hot. Make sure that you take enough water on this hike. Here is an early view south, with some of the trail in it. As you are climbing, the trail at times has some level parts. Enjoy these---they are a welcome respite.\nAs you climb, you can see Black Canyon, where the campground is, however, you cannot see the campground itself. As you continue to climb, take regular stops to view the scenery; the views on this hike are great, and at one time or another, you get views off in all directions.\nThis view is to the SSE.\nWhen you have been hiking around 40 minutes or so, you reach a ridge line where you may get more breeze. I certainly appreciated the cooling air.\nThe trail is on granite and decomposed granite. Granite is made of feldspar, quartz, and mica. Sometimes you will see a bunch of only one of these minerals, or rocks which a preponderance of one. For example the rock in the picture has a lot of mica in it.\nAnother reason to look for the micaceous rocks is that they indicate that you are nearing the top.\nWhen we first hiked this trail, New Mexico had been in a serious drought for a while. As a result, there were few wildflowers. However, this Scarlet Gilia (also known as a Scarlet Skyrocket) was making a go at it.\nWhen you start getting views off to the southwest (Santa Fe, the San Pedro Mountains, the Sandia Mountains) and west (Jemez mountains), you can be happy for many reasons. One is for the views. Another is because you are nearly at the top of the hike.\nThis view is to the WNW, and you can see the Jemez in the distance.\nWhen you start to see trees down all around you from winter damage, you have reached the end of the big climb. Take a break, smell the forest, and drink some water.\nI shared the trail with this granite-colored horned lizard. He or she was gracious enough to allow me to take this photo.\nEnjoy the views of the Sangre de Cristo mountains.\nWhen the trail heads down, this is not really the beginning of the trek down.\nRight after a short climb, you reach a pair of picnic tables. These always strike me as odd, because normally I expect tables to be near a road. I wonder how they got up here. They make a nice rest before heading downhill.\nFrom the picnic tables, the trail used to have two branches. You could go past the picnic tables, or start down here. If you have older guidebooks, they will mention this. I took this older branch the first time.\nThe park has changed the trail; you should take the trail that goes down. They indicate it with tree trunks on either side of the trail.\nWhen I took this photo, I was standing near the second picnic table.\nThe forest is different on the way down. You are walking through more shade.\nThe second time we hiked this trail, the Oregon Grape were getting ripe. The turning leaves and ripening berries indicated that autumn was on its way.\nThe trail heads down, steeply at times (hiking poles may be useful). You also go around several switchbacks (such as this one). Please do not cut across the area between the switchbacks; doing so is even steeper, and it can cause erosion problems on the trail.\nWhen you get near the bottom of the hill, you will reach a junction. This is the Girl Scout Joe M. Clark memorial nature trail. The two paths will both take you to the trailhead for the nature trail. I took the lower branch. You will know you are on this trail when the trail is rock-edged.\nWhen you reach the trailhead for the nature trail, you have several options. You could walk along the highway back to the trailhead. However, a better choice is to cross the highway, and go uphill just past the ice skating pond. You will find this bridge. Cross it, and on the other side, go up and to the left.\nWhen the trail gets to the gravel road, you should see this trailhead across the road (GPS: HPLP2. This trail is one of several that runs behind the campgrounds. All should eventually take you to the visitor center.\nA ranger warned me that this trail goes through a couple of campsites. If you continue in the direction you were heading, you will find the trail picks up again. This was good advice, as I would have been quite confused had he not mentioned it. You go right through campsites 17 and 15. The trail takes up again on the other side of the road, on the right side of site 15.\nAlso, one time I obviously made a wrong turn and the trail I was on died out.

{"question":"I am a music theory student researching the concept of 'rotary perception' in jazz. What is the difference between this concept and traditional 'swing' timing?","answer":"According to Charles Mingus, traditional 'swing' was linear and restrictive, requiring notes to fall on center beats like a metronome. In contrast, 'rotary perception' envisions beats within circles, allowing musicians more freedom to improvise. In this approach, each performer can place notes anywhere within the circular space around each beat while maintaining the original feeling. This creates more flexibility than the traditional approach where rhythm section members had to accent the same pulse.","context":["\"There was once a word used---swing. Swing went in one direction, it was linear, and everything had to be played with an obvious pulse and that's very restrictive. But I use the term 'rotary perception.' If you get a mental picture of the beat existing within a circle, you're more free to improvise. People used to think the notes had to fall on the center of the beats in the bar at intervals like a metronome, with three or four men in the rhythm section accenting the same pulse. That's like parade music or dance music. But imagine a circle surrounding each beat-each guy can play his notes anywhere in that circle, and it gives him a feeling he has more space. The notes fall anywhere inside the circle, but the original feeling for the beat isn't changed. If one in the group loses confidence, somebody hits the beat again. The pulse is inside you. When you're playing with musicians who think this way you can do anything. Anybody can stop and let the others go on. It's called strolling….\"\n---Charles Mingus, Beneath the Underdog\nJoni Mitchell's new album, Mingus, is about a lot of different kinds of circles, from the closing of this cycle of Charles Mingus's incarnation (as his Vedantists would put it) to the ah-wooooos of the wolves in the Canadian forests. Since most of the record's production was overseen by Mingus, and he wrote most of the tunes, the musical circles he mentions above abound. But Mitchell has been playing with circles of her own on her last couple albums, playing with the circular placement of notes, improvising both rhythmically (along the horizontal line implied by Mingus's quote) and harmonically (along a vertical line).\nThis is nothing new within the jazz tradition, of course, but Joni Mitchell is only nominally part of that tradition, even after the release of this album. Which is not to put her down. Her tradition is a guitar-oriented, country-music-based one, while his is a piano-and-horn-oriented, blues-based one. Attempts to make a unified artistic statement out of the tension between these two traditions have been cropping up with increasing frequency in recent years, but it's usually been in the form of jazz going to rock. When a prerock style (\"folk\") approaches jazz in a thoughtful way, the results (John Martyn, Tim Buckley's later work) are usually so iconoclastic that popular success is unlikely, unless, as with Dan Hicks or David Grisman, the jazz era invoked is a bygone one.\nAnd that is why Mingus is sure to be controversial. It works, but it works as a Joni Mitchell album largely composed by Charles Mingus, not as either the final specific bit of the Mingus legacy or as a generalized memorial or tribute album. It is a tribute, but in the very personal vocabulary of an idiosyncratic artist. It's even got one song, \"The Wolf That Lives in Lindsey,\" which doesn't seem to have anything to do with Mingus and sounds left over from one of her recent albums. Actually, it fits, but I'll get to that.\nThat we've got here is Joni Mitchell gently easing further into a territory she's been exploring for some time, and doing a much better job of it than on Don Juan's Reckless Daughter, because the guiding hand of Mingus is more assured than her own. She's not so much trying to become a jazz singer as trying to adapt her narrative/confessional style to the conventions of improvised jazz-vocal lyrics, where the placement of vowels and syllables and the creation of irregular internal rhyme-schemes are as important as, or more important than, the lyrical content itself. In other words, her model here is more Eddie Jefferson than Billie Holiday. Her framework is some tunes which were worked up by some more traditionally oriented jazz musicians (Eddie Gomez, Phil Woods, Gerry Mulligan, Dannie Richmond) under Mingus's direction, then handed over to a stone fusion band (Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin, Jan Hammer) whose efforts were discarded, and finally interpreted by musicians who straddle the fence (Jaco Pastorius, Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock). The real acid test is where she takes a Mingus chestnut, \"Goodbye Pork Pie Hat,\" and adds her lyrics. The band passes with straight A's, she sings nicely, and the lyric, a brave try, nearly succeeds even though it's just a bit over literal.\nThe only miss is \"The Dry Cleaner from Des Moines,\" a fairly ordinary Mingus stroll blues that illustrates his point about circles better than anything else on the album, but which is sporadically marred by a clangorous, overwrought Pastorius brass arrangement that threatens to explode the whole piece. The other two new Mingus numbers are triumphs, especially \"Chair in the Sky,\" a piece of lyricism that approaches Mingus's best. I envy those who heard its orchestral rendition in New York some weeks back. It makes use of the famed Mingus thorough-composition (or \"extended form\"), and Mitchell rides the swells of the vocal part expertly, displaying vocal technique and range I never knew she had. The tune of \"Sweet Sucker Dance\" is very close to that of \"Chair,\" if a bit more amorphous, and this makes the performance perhaps a bit less satisfying, if that's not splitting hairs.\nWisely, the band on these tracks doesn't try to imitate Mingus, although it continues the Mingus tradition of making a small ensemble sound much larger than it is. Especially notable are Wayne Shorter's tiny, breathy punctuations, which come when they are least anticipated, really playing with those circles. Pastorius, surely the focus of much attention because he's the bass player, is, like Mingus in a large ensemble, most noticeable playing high-register bits that imply low-register pedal points, and manages to evoke his previous work with Mitchell while fulfilling Mingus's compositional requirements.\nBut like I said, when all is said and done, this is Joni Mitchell's album. The words are hers, her interpretation of Mingus's music and his world. Nowhere is this fact more evident than on \"God Must Be a Boogie Man,\" which is nothing more than a rewrite of the first chapter of Mingus's autobiography set to music that sounds like an impression of the actual Mingus tunes on the album. And then there's \"The Wolf that Lives in Lindsey\", where it all comes together-the circular sense of tonality and pitch-placement she's been experimenting with, Mingus's circular sense of time rendered on her de-tuned guitar and Don Alias's congas, and the sort of gossipy lyric-writing she's been doing for the last couple of years. As for whether it has anything to do with a tribute to Mingus, listen to the chords those wolves are making and tell me that any musician with an interest in root tones wouldn't like to play behind that. (I find it interesting that Mitchell decided to use the wolves in the song because they were \"in the right key\"!)\nConsidering how many things could have gone wrong with this record, I'm very happy to see it succeed as well as it does. I could surely have done without the little snips of conversation sprinkled throughout, which get very annoying very fast, and I wish the air of sanctity that hovers over the album as a result was thinned out a little. Nevertheless, though Mingus fans may sniff and Mitchell fans likewise, people who don't let labels trap them can have a very good time exploring what's here to hear."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:22da6145-4852-442d-b272-85856914a758>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I want make PCB at home - what is toner transfer method and what environmental concerns exist with PCB making?","answer":"The toner transfer method involves printing a positive circuit image using a laser printer and transferring it to the board using heat. You can use an iron or laminator to fuse the toner particles onto the PCB. While quick and cheap, it may need touch-ups with a marker. For the transfer paper, you can use glossy magazine pages or parchment paper. Regarding environmental concerns, PCB manufacturing generates hazardous waste including chemical cleaning solutions and contaminated rinse water. The process is also energy-intensive, especially during reflow soldering. To minimize environmental impact, proper disposal regulations must be followed, and manufacturers are increasingly adopting energy-efficient equipment and implementing waste reduction strategies through recycling programs and eco-friendly materials.","context":["If you start tinkering with electronics, eventually you will want to make your own printed circuit board, or PCB as it is generally called. In the olden days, this subject was pretty straightforward. You went down to your local RadioShack, and bought an etching kit. You drew your single sided design using a marking pen and some supplied stickers. The board was fairly big, and it had only a few simple through-hole components.\nThose days are now pretty much gone. Now most electronic projects are much more complex, the boards are much smaller, and you need to deal with 2 layers, surface mount components and vias. In this overview, I will tackle the different problems you may encounter and the methods available. I won’t cover PCB layout software or commercially made boards. I’ll deal with those topics in separate articles.\nMaking a PCB involves several steps. Today’s PCBs require a lot more steps than they used to, but for your own use, these later amenities can be omitted. The steps involved are:\n- Imaging your design onto a blank PCB\n- Amenities – solder mask, silk screen, tin plating\nAs I mentioned before, simple circuits can be drawn with a sharpie marker, but these days, you will need to print out something called a mask using CAD software. There are several ways to transferring this mask to your blank PCB. Commercially, this process is done using a photo transfer process, which is also one of the ways available to you at home. The point of this process is to add a coating to your PCB in the shape of your circuit. This coating will permit the copper to be etched away from the blank board everywhere except where you want it. The coating that prevents parts of the board from being etched is called a mask. Because of the fine pitch features often required, this step is not as easy as it would seem.\nPhoto transfer is the most accurate way to image your design and is used commercially. It will easily provide the fine pitches needed for modern designs. It is also the most expensive method for home use. You must buy specially photo-sensitive coated boards and print your image onto clear plastic sheets. After printing the negative of your design, you lay it on your PCB and expose it to ultra-violet light to develop the coating which now becomes your mask.\nBecause of the extra expense and special boards required, I have never used this method. If you need fine features, using a commercial PCB service is really the way to go. If you would like to know more here are a few articles that describe the process:\nThe toner transfer method involves printing out a positive image of your circuit using a laser printer, and then using heat to transfer that image to your board. The pros including being quick, cheap and produces fairly good results. It is the method I prefer to use. The downside is that it is a little tricky to get good results and you often have some areas that need touching up with a sharpie. It can handle fairly fine features, but is definitely limited as compared to the photo transfer method.\nToner transfer uses the same basic process as the laser printer does. When a laser printer prints, it deposits the toner particles onto your paper and uses heat to fuse them to the paper. When you want to transfer this image to your PCB, you again use heat to lift the toner particles and fuse them to your board.\nThere are two ways to make the transfer – using an iron (like you iron clothes with) or a laminate machine. I have found the iron works well enough for occasional use. If you start making a lot of PCBs, then you should invest in a laminate machine. This company sells a laminator specifically for PCBs. You can also buy a cheap laminator from amazon for $35 and modify it as specified in this article.\nThe main problem encountered with this process is getting all the toner off the paper and onto the PCB. The type of paper you print on is the most critical part of the process. There are several resources available for buying (here or here)or making this paper. It seems to me that buying or making special transfer paper would be just as involved as photo imaging. If I were to need to make that many PCBs, I would go with the latter route instead.\nFor the quick, occasional home PCB, there is a surprisingly simple and cheap alternative to special papers – glossy, magazine pages. To use them, just tear out a page that is light on the printing and print your PCB onto it. The existing printing doesn’t transfer, so it is not a problem (the lightly printed pages are needed for YOU to see your design). The toner tends to not stick very well to the glossy pages which makes it ideal for toner transfer.\nFor more details, I have not found a better article on the subject than this one.\nOne last detail on this method involves registering double-sided boards. The problem is that the mask on both sides of the board much align with each other. The easiest way to do this is to hold the two masks up to the light (using thin magazine paper here helps) and aligning them together. Once aligned, tape them together. Then slip the board in between them and transfer using an iron or laminator. This article describes the technique in perfect detail.\nWhile I was writing this article, a new how-to article appeared that uses parchment paper from the grocery store for the toner transfer paper. It sounds like a winner to me – I will be trying it on my next board.\nA third way to get your design onto a board is to print directly onto the board. This method sounds like the ideal one for home use, but it is not quite mainstream yet. The basic method uses a modified ink-jet printer. This website gives a lot of useful information on how to do it. There is also an instructable on doing it.\nAn alternative to etching PCBs also exists with ink jet printing – skip the copper clad board altogether, and print conductive traces directly onto a substrate. A new conductive ink that is a true solution as opposed to particles in suspension has now been developed making it ideal for this method. If you want to experiment yourself with either of this techniques, you should head over and join the yahoo group dedicated to making PCBs with inkjets.\nThe last way to transfer your design to a board actually eliminates the next step as well – direct milling of the copper using a CNC machine. While formerly the only available to wealthy corporations, with the advent of cheap 3D printers and DIY CNC machines, this method is now cheap enough to be available to everyone.\nYou can check out some of these popular designs and kits (here and here) if you want to explore more. I don’t have a desktop CNC machine myself yet, but I plan to get one eventually. When I do, direct milling PCBs will be my preferred method.\nEtching MethodsEtching is fairly simple in its most basic form – you immerse the copper clad board into an etchant solution, agitate some and when you see the exposed copper dissolved, you remove the board and rinse. As with most things worth doing, there are many techniques to try to obtain a faster, better etch. The basic principles involved are temperature and agitation. The etchant needs to be warm and flowing across the copper. If it isn’t, the etching takes a long time and is more uneven.\nThere are two great tank construction articles I have found for making a really good etching tank. The first describes a thin vertical tank using an airstone for agitation. It looks simple and inexpensive. The second describes a spray technique that is really effective. While the build is more involved, it seems like a really great way to do it.\nFor the quick and dirty method that saves etching solution, I use the sponge technique. While wearing rubber gloves, rub the etchant solution onto the board with a sponge. It takes a bit of labor, but works quickly and well.\nAfter you have successfully etched your board, you must remove your mask. The best way to do this is to use fingernail polish remover. The toner or photo resist comes off easily with a little bit of rubbing.\nThe traditional etching solution is Ferric Chloride. It is available from most electronics suppliers. For many people, they do not like working with this chemical. Apart from its ability to stain, I don’t have much problem with it. While I wouldn’t want to touch it, it doesn’t burn or emit noxious fumes.\nThere are some who favor using Cupric Chloride which begins as a mixture of hydrogen peroxide and hydrochloric acid. The raw ingredients are cheap and readily available. Hydrochloric acid is available where pool supplies are sold under the name muriatic acid. I don’t know if this solution is any safer than the traditional one, but I like the fact that the ingredients can often be found either at home or in a nearby store. Here is a great article on the subject if you want to learn more.\nYou are now armed with the knowledge necessary to successfully image and etch your PCBs. In part two of this article, we will explore the other steps to making a working PCB as well as some extra features common on commercial boards.","Increasingly, PCB manufacturers are focused on minimizing their environmental impact. They achieve this by adopting energy-efficient equipment and implementing waste reduction strategies.\nUsing additive processes instead of the subtractive approach to manufacture circuit boards reduces the need for chemical etching, which is very energy-intensive. Also, applying design for manufacturing (DFM) principles at the prototype stage decreases material usage.\nThe production of PCBs generates a lot of waste. This waste includes chemical cleaning solutions, offcuts, and other materials that can be hazardous to the environment. To minimize the amount of waste produced, PCB manufacturers are looking at alternative, eco-friendly products that can replace harmful substances.\nAdditionally, waste generated during manufacturing includes contaminated rinse water and various chemicals used in manufacturing. As such, PCBs must be disposed of using regulated processes. It ensures that the environmental risks of these substances are minimized.\nResponsible e-waste disposal practices include proper landfill management, recycling, and incineration. Responsible PCB recycling programs reduce the need for new natural resources by repurposing old electronics and help lower the global footprint. Recycling also aids in reducing secondary persistent organic pollutants, including dioxins and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which are air pollutants. Strict guidelines that regulate ash disposal and leachate quality factors during processing are used to achieve this. Go to this website to find out more about PCB recycling initiatives.\nThe manufacturing process for PCBs consumes a significant amount of energy, especially in high-temperature reflow soldering ovens. Using more energy-efficient machinery and equipment minimizes this consumption, reducing the environmental impact of the manufacturing process.\nTransporting the materials used in the production of PCBs requires a significant amount of energy. This energy is primarily obtained from fossil fuels such as petroleum, natural gas, propane, biofuel, and electricity.\nManufacturers need to adhere to a wide range of environmental regulations and standards when manufacturing PCBs. Some of the most essential requirements include adhering to the Restriction on Hazardous Substances (RoHS) regulations, which limit using certain toxic materials like lead, mercury, cadmium, and flame retardants in electronic products. Manufacturers can meet these regulations by implementing sustainable practices like optimizing material usage, minimizing waste, and designing for disassembly. They can also reduce the need for product replacement by encouraging e-waste management programs. Moreover, they can achieve cost savings through more efficient production processes.\nEnvironmentally Friendly Materials\nThe core of electronic gadgets, from computers to medical equipment and automotive systems, is printed circuit boards (PCBs). Unfortunately, conventional methods for making PCBs often involve dangerous substances and produce a lot of waste. Green initiatives in the PCB business aim to minimize these problems through environmentally friendly materials, production procedures, and responsible waste management.\nSustainable sourcing of raw materials is another critical aspect of PCB sustainability. Manufacturers are exploring options for recyclable substrates like bamboo and bio-resins. These renewable materials reduce long-term environmental waste and align with the principles of the circular economy.\nOther eco-friendly material changes in PCB manufacturing include lead-free solder and low-VOC laminates to reduce toxic chemicals and VOC emissions. Also, local sourcing of materials results in reduced transportation costs and emissions. Finally, the design of a circuit board must be optimized for manufacturing to limit material usage. It minimizes waste and energy usage while ensuring the circuit board has everything.\nSeveral hazardous wastes are produced throughout the process of PCB manufacture. If improperly disposed of, they may end up in landfills or cause environmental contamination. To prevent this, recycling is an integral part of the PCB industry. Non-metallic PCB components and other materials, such as copper and tin, can be salvaged for other purposes. In addition, metals like nickel and silver can also be recycled to avoid the use of new resources.\nOther environmental considerations in PCB manufacturing include energy-efficient production processes and responsible e-waste management programs. Many manufacturers have begun using closed-loop systems to minimize the volume of discarded materials, significantly reducing the industry’s overall carbon footprint.\nManufacturers also focus on design for manufacturing (DFM) principles to ensure that each board includes all the necessary elements. It helps to reduce excess waste caused by reworking and redesigns. Furthermore, technologies like 3D printing enable the production of complex circuits without the need for multistep subtractive procedures. It is another significant step toward sustainability for the electronics industry."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:e0ea2efe-eae1-476c-b8c1-3b2bb148b7fa>","<urn:uuid:17ba214d-027a-4839-a338-6c08ea31c141>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the key differences between the reduction mechanisms of alcohols and ozonolysis with reductive workup?","answer":"The reduction of alcohols and ozonolysis with reductive workup have distinct mechanisms. In alcohol reduction, the process involves converting carbonyls like aldehydes, ketones, esters, and carboxylic acids into alcohols. For ozonolysis with reductive workup, reducing agents like zinc metal or dimethyl sulfide are used to decompose the ozonide intermediate, preserving all C-H bonds while cleaving both the π and σ bonds of the alkene to form carbonyl compounds. The reducing agent in ozonolysis becomes oxidized (forming zinc oxide or dimethyl sulfoxide), while in alcohol reduction, the carbonyl compounds are reduced to form alcohols.","context":["Alkene Reactions: Ozonolysis\nLast updated: February 27th, 2020 |\nOzonolysis of Alkenes\nToday’s post represents not so much a pattern in alkene reactions, so much as it does a very common reaction that bears mentioning along with the rest. What makes this reaction special is that it does not simply break the carbon-carbon π bond, as we have been accustomed to seeing, but additionally breaks the C-C σ bond as well.\nThis type of reaction is known as oxidative cleavage [i.e. cleavage of bonds, occuring with oxidation] and the most prominent example of an oxidative cleavage reaction is ozonolysis.\nTable Of Contents\n- Ozone (O3) Is A Powerful Oxidant For Cleaving Alkenes To Carbonyl Compounds\n- Ozonolysis With “Reductive Workup” : All C–H Bonds Are Preserved\n- Ozonolysis Of A Ring Results In A Chain With Two Carbonyls\n- Ozonolysis Of A Compound With Multiple Bonds Results In Several Fragments\n- Ozonolysis With Oxidative Workup Converts Aldehydes To Carboxylic Acids\n- Summary: Ozonolysis of Alkenes\n- Quiz Yourself!\n- (Advanced) References and Further Reading\nAs mentioned on one Reagent Friday back in the day, ozone does more than absorb UV radiation in the upper atmosphere and cause breathing problems in traffic-clogged cities. It’s a powerful oxidant, and since its discovery in the mid 1800’s by (Schönbein) has found use in the cleavage of carbon-carbon multiple bonds.\nHere’s the pattern for the reaction of alkenes with ozone:\nNote that the carbon-carbon double bond is broken and we are forming a carbon-oxygen double bond on each of the two carbons that originally composed the alkene. The second step in ozonolysis is called the “workup”. There are two different types of “workup”, and the most common is referred to as “reductive workup”. In this step, we add a reducing agent (commonly zinc metal or dimethyl sulfide) that decomposes the intermediate formed at the end of the ozonolysis reaction (called an “ozonide” by the way). If you’re wondering where the third oxygen of ozone went – it’s now attached to what used to be our reducing agent (making either zinc oxide (ZnO) or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). [For more details / mechanism everything is written out in this post.]\nUsing “reductive workup” preserves all other aspects of the molecule save the double bond. So if we start with, say, a trisubstituted alkene, as in the example below, we will end up with a ketone and an aldehyde. [What happens if the alkene carbon is attached to two hydrogens? It becomes formaldehyde, which is then further converted to carbon dioxide]\nNote that although I’ve written (CH3)2S as the reductant here, it’s essentially interchangeable with Zn for our purposes.\nAn interesting consequence of ozonolysis is that if the alkene is within a ring, you end up with a chain containing two carbonyls:\nIf your molecule has multiple alkenes, then you will end up with more than two fragments. For many years ozonolysis was used as a method for the structure determination of unknown molecules. By analyzing the fragments it is then possible to deduce what the original structure was, through “stitching” together the fragments. [This was particularly important in the case of unsaturated molecules known as terpenes]. Here’s one example:\nThis isn’t the end of the story with ozonolysis. There’s a second type of workup that can be used, referred to as oxidative workup. Instead of using Zn or S(CH3)2, if we use the oxidant hydrogen peroxide [H2O2], any aldehydes that form will be oxidized to give carboxylic acids. Like in the example below – notice that the green C-H bond is oxidized to C-OH [but all the other hydrogens remain intact ].\nAn alternative to using ozone for oxidative workup is to use the reagent KMnO4 , especially in the presence of hot acid; this will lead to the same result.\nThis is the last category of important alkene reactions we’ll cover for now in this series; in the next post we’ll wrap up the reactions of alkenes with a summary post.\nNEXT POST: Summary of Alkene Addition Reactions\n- Ueber die Einwirkung des Ozons auf organische Verbindungen\nJust.

Alcohols are represented by the general formula -OH. Alcohols are important in organic chemistry because they can be converted to and from many other types of compounds. Reactions with alcohols fall into two different categories. Reactions can cleave the R-O bond or they can cleave the O-H bond.\nEthanol (ethyl alcohol, or grain alcohol) is found in alcoholic beverages, CH3CH2OH.\n- 1 Preparation\n- 1.1 Grignard Addition Reactions\n- 1.2 Reduction\n- 2 Properties\n- 3 Reactions\nIn the Alkenes section, we already covered a few methods for synthesizing alcohols. One is the hydroboration-oxidation of alkenes and the other is the oxymercuration-reduction of alkenes. But there are a great many other ways of creating alcohols as well.\nA common source for producing alcohols is from carbonyl compounds. The choice of carbonyl type (ketone, aldehyde, ester, etc.) and the type of reaction (Grignard addition or Reduction), will determine the product(s) you will get. Fortunately, there are a number of variations of carbonyls, leading to a number of choices in product.\nThere are primarily two types of reactions used to create alcohols from carbonyls: Grignard Addition reactions and Reduction reactions. We'll look at each type of reaction for each type of carbonyl.\nGrignard Addition Reactions\nAs we learned previously, Grignard reagents are created by reacting magnesium metal with an alkyl halide (aka haloalkanes). The magnesium atom then gets between the alkyl group and the halogen atom with the general reaction:\nR-X + Mg → R-Mg-X\nIn our examples, we'll be using bromine in our Grignard reagents because it's a common Grignard halogen and it will keep our examples a little clearer without the need for X.\nThe general mechanism of a Grignard reagent reacting with a carbonyl (except esters) involves the creation of a 6-membered ring transition state. The pi bond of the oxygen attacks a neighboring magnesium bromide which in turn, releases from its R group leaving a carbocation. At the same time, the magnesium bromide ion from another Grignard molecule is attacked by the carbocation and has its magnesium bromide ion stolen (restoring it to its original state as a Grignard reagent). The second molecule's carbocation is then free to attack the carbanion resulting from the vacating pi bond, attaching the R group to the carbonyl.\nAt this point, there is a magnesium bromide on the oxygen of what was a carbonyl. The proton from the acidic solvent easily displaces this magnesium bromide ion and protonates the oxygen, creating a primary alcohol with formaldehyde, a secondary alcohol with an aldehyde and a tertiary alcohol with a ketone.\nWith esters, the mechanism is slightly different. Two moles of Grignard are required for each mole of the ester. Initially, the pi bond on the carbonyl oxygen attacks the magnesium bromide ion. This opens up the carbon for attack from the R group of the Grignard. This part of the reaction is slow because of the dual oxygens off of the carbon providing some resonance stabilization. The oxygen's pi bond then re-forms, expelling the O-R group of the ester which then joins with the magnesium bromide, leaving R-O-MgBr and a ketone. The R-O-MgBr is quickly protonated from the acidic solution and the ketone is then attacked by Grignard reagent via the mechanism described earlier.\nSynthesis from Formaldehyde\nThe image above shows the synthesis of an alcohol from formaldehyde reacted with a Grignard reagent. When a formaldehyde is the target of the Grignard's attack, the result is a primary alcohol.\nSynthesis from an Aldehyde\nThe image above shows the synthesis of an alcohol from an aldehyde reacted with a Grignard reagent. When an aldehyde is the target of the Grignard's attack, the result is a secondary alcohol.\nSynthesis from a Ketone\nThe image above shows the synthesis of an alcohol from a ketone reacted with a Grignard reagent. When a ketone is the target of the Grignard's attack, the result is a tertiary alcohol.\nSynthesis from an Ester\nThe image above shows the synthesis of an alcohol from an ester reacted with a Grignard reagent. When an ester is the target of the Grignard's attack, the result is a tertiary alcohol and a primary alcohol. The primary alcohol is always from the -O-R portion of the ester and the tertiary alcohol is the other R groups of the ester combined with the R group from the Grignard reagent.\nSynthesis from an Epoxide\nWe will discuss reactions with Epoxides later when we cover epoxides, but for now, we'll briefly discuss the synthesis of an alcohol from an epoxide. The nature of the reaction is different than with the carbonyls, as might be expected. The reaction of Grignard reagents with epoxides is regioselective. The Grignard reagent attacks at the least substituted side of the carbon-oxygen bonds, if there is one. In this case, one carbon has 2 hydrogens and the other has 1, so the R group attacks the carbon with 2 hydrogens, breaking the bond with oxygen which is then protonated by the acidic solution. leaving a secondary alcohol and a concatenated carbon chain. The R group can be alkyl or aryl.\nAs an alternative to Grignard reagents, organolithium reagents can be used as well. Organolithium reagents are slightly more reactive, but produce the same general results as Grignard reagents, including the synthesis from epoxides. IT IS KNOWN AS Organolithium Altenative.\nSynthesis from an Aldehyde\nThe image above shows the synthesis of an alcohol from an aldehyde by reduction.\nSynthesis from a Ketone\nThe image above shows the synthesis of an alcohol from a ketone by reduction.\nSynthesis from an Ester\nThe image above shows the synthesis of an alcohol from an ester by reduction. Esters can be hydrolysed to form an alcohol and a carboxylic acid.\nSynthesis from a Carboxylic Acid\nThe image above shows the synthesis of an alcohol from a carboxylic acid reacted by reduction.\nFollow these rules to name alcohols the IUPAC way:\n- find the longest carbon chain containing at least one OH group, this is the parent\n- if there are multiple OH groups, look for the chain with the most of them, and the way to count as many carbons in that chain\n- name as an alcohol, alkane diol, triol, etc.\n- number the OH groups, giving each group the lowest number possible when different numbering possibilities exist\n- treat all other groups as lower priority substituents (alcohol / hydroxy groups are the highest priority group for naming)\n|IUPAC name||Common name|\n|(CH3)2CH-OH||2-Propanol||Isopropyl alcohol (Note: Isopropanol would be incorrect. Cannot mix\nand match between systems.)\n|Multiple OH functional groups|\n|(form that body fat is stored as)||1,2,3-Propanetriol||Glycerol|\n|-OH can be named as a substituent hydroxyl group (hydroxyalkanes)|\n|Find the longest chain of carbons containing the maximum number of\nIn an O-H bond, the O steals the H's electron due to its electronegativity, and O can carry a negative charge (R-O-). This leads to deprotonation in which the nucleus of the H, a proton, leaves completely. This makes the -OH group (and alcohols) Bronsted acids. Alcohols are weak acids, even weaker than water. Ethanol has a pKa of 15.9 compared to water's pKa of 15.7. The larger the alcohol molecule, the weaker an acid it is.\nOn the other hand, alcohols are also weakly basic. This may seem to be contradictory--how can a substance be both an acid and a base? However, substances exist that can be an acid or a base depending on the circumstances. Such a compound is said to be amphoteric or amphiprotic. As a Bronsted base, the oxygen atom in the -OH group can accept a proton (hydrogen ion.) This results in a positively-charged species known as an oxonium ion. Oxonium ions have the general formula ROH2+, where R is any alkyl group.\nWhen O becomes deprotonated, the result is an alkoxide. Alkoxides are anions. The names of alkoxides are based on the original molecule. (Ethanol=ethoxide, butanol=butoxide, etc.) Alkoxides are good nucleophiles due to the negative charge on the oxygen atom.\nProducing an alkoxide\nR-OH -> H+ + R-O-\nIn this equation, R-O- is the alkoxide produced and is the conjugate base of R-OH\nAlcohols can be converted into alkoxides by reaction with a strong base (must be stronger than OH-) or reaction with metallic sodium or potassium. Alkoxides themselves are basic. The larger an alkoxide molecule is, the more basic it is.\nConversion of alcohols to haloalkanes\nRecall that haloalkanes can be converted to alcohols through nucleophilic substitution.\nConversion of a haloalkane to an alcohol\nR-X + OH- → R-OH + X-\nThis reaction proceeds because X (a halogen) is a good leaving group and OH- is a good nucleophile. OH, however, is a poor leaving group. To make the reverse reaction proceed, OH must become a good leaving group. This is done by protonating the OH, turning it into H2O+, which is a good leaving group. H+ must be present to do this. Therefore, the compounds that can react with alcohols to form haloalkanes are HBr, HCl, and HI. Just like the reverse reaction, this process can occur through SN2 (backside attack) or SN1 (carbocation intermediate) mechanisms.\nSN2 conversion of an alcohol to a haloalkane\nR-O-H + H+ + X- → R-O+-H2 + X- → R-X + H2O\nSN1 conversion of an alcohol to a haloalkane\nR-O-H + H+ + X- → R-O+-H2 + X- → R+ + H2O + X- → R-X + H2O\nAs stated in the haloalkane chapter, the two mechanisms look similar but the mechanism affects the rate of reaction and the stereochemistry of the product.\nOxidation of alcohols\nOxidation in organic chemistry always involves either the addition of oxygen atoms (or other highly electronegative elements like sulfur or nitrogen) or the removal of hydrogen atoms. Whenever a molecule is oxidized, another molecule must be reduced. Therefore, these reactions require a compound that can be reduced. These compounds are usually inorganic. They are referred to as oxidizing reagents.\nWith regards to alcohol, oxidizing reagents can be strong or weak. Weak reagants are able to oxidize a primary alcohol group into a aldehyde group and a secondary alcohol into a ketone. Thus, the R-OH (alcohol) functional group becomes R=O (carbonyl) after a hydrogen atom is removed. Strong reagents will further oxidize the aldehyde into a carboxylic acid (COOH). Tertiary alcohols cannot be oxidized.\nAn example of a strong oxidizing reagent is chromic acid (H2CrO4). An example of a weak oxidizing reagent is pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC) (C5H6NCrO3Cl)."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"opinion_recommendation"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:4fce2b2e-1239-4485-8a94-3a19524d3c0a>","<urn:uuid:6a35dd7d-939c-4f94-86ed-9ce567d690d4>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are porcelain tiles' characteristics and installation requirements?","answer":"Porcelain tiles are highly durable, water-resistant materials with very low water absorption that discourages bathroom fungi. They are scratch-resistant and suitable for various areas including bathrooms, kitchens, outdoors, and high-traffic spaces. However, when installing porcelain tiles, special considerations are required. They need a slurry primer or bond bridge painted on their underside before laying, as they don't readily adhere to mortar alone. Without this primer, porcelain slabs can become loose, resulting in rocking, loosened grout, and eventual cracking. The installation process requires specific tools including a tape measure, rubber mallet, ceramic cutter, and notched trowel, along with materials like adhesive and floor leveler. The installation must be done systematically, with floor tiles installed first, followed by wall tiles, using proper adhesive application techniques with a notched trowel.","context":["Changing tastes, renewed interest in the garden and, possibly, climate change, has meant the paved area of a garden has evolved into a popular feature. Thanks to lifestyle magazines and television programmes, domestic clients aspire to use their garden as an extension of the home.\nAt the same time, global trade has opened endless possibilities to the landscape professional; materials from around the world can be used to striking visual effect in a variety of contexts.\nIn most cases, paved areas feature an area of natural or man-made material expertly laid in accordance with good design principles and building regulations, with the potential to last for as long as the customer needs.\nUnfortunately, BALI has recently identified isolated cases where modern landscape materials are being laid according to outdated construction methods. This is resulting in areas of hard landscaping which, at best, fail to meet the clients’ expectations, and at worse are unusable.\nThe cause of the issue is the porous nature of most modern paving materials. Untreated stone, limestone, sandstone, granite and concrete contain tiny pores which allow water, salts and minerals to pass. This means that once laid on a bed of mortar, water, salts and minerals may pass through natural stone either from above or below the surface.\nCorrect laying procedure is essential. Mortar acts as a barrier to moisture, meaning water cannot pass as freely through natural paving where the underside of the material is in contact with mortar, as it can when there is no mortar in contact with the underside. A common cause of this is when paving is not laid on a full bed of mortar as specified in BS 7533-4:2006.\nMortar is, however, a potential source of salts and minerals, which means minerals and salts from mortar in contact with natural paving may be drawn into the material and deposited either on or close to the surface. The movement of minerals and salts into natural stone paving can manifest as different coloured patterns on the top surface of the paving. This may occur within a few days of the paving being laid or over a longer period. This pattern is a stain; it is unsightly and permanent, and in some cases, the only solution is to replace the paving.\nManufactured materials such as porcelain or ceramics are becoming increasingly popular due to their thin profile, uniform colour and texture, but also their resistance to stains. These materials are not porous, which means mortar does not readily adhere to the underside. As a result, porcelain slabs laid on mortar alone are likely to become loose within a relatively short period, resulting in rocking, loosening of the grout and eventual cracking of paving units. Instances of slate not adhering are also common.\nThe solution to both problems is the use of a specialist coating called a slurry primer or bond bridge. Whilst the use of slurry primers is not new, consideration for their need for paving projects of all types is now good practice.\nSlurry primers or bond bridges are painted on the underside of both natural and manufactured paving materials immediately prior to laying on mortar. They form a strong, impermeable, glue-like layer which performs two functions:\n- Forms a barrier between paving, the mortar and laying course, which helps prevent moisture and cementitious materials leaching into the paving.\n- Improves adhesion between the mortar and underside of manufactured paving slabs\nA range of ready-made primers are available from paving suppliers, needing only water adding to a pre-mixed material. It is also possible to mix cement with SBR to create a similarly effective product. Either way, the product should be painted to the underside of each paving unit immediately before laying.\nThe quality of natural paving products has a significant impact on its porosity and long-term durability. Always source materials from a reputable supplier and take their advice when laying materials with which you are unfamiliar.\nThank you to BALI Registered Affiliate London Stone for supporting this article.","Because your bathrooms are exposed to a lot of humidity, high traffic, and special cleaning products, they must be covered by a material that can deal with these extreme factors. Installing porcelain tile is one of the best choices you can make when designing a new bathroom.\nPorcelain tiles are highly recommended for the bathroom and kitchen because they are not covered by enamel, and the finish is usually polished, of great durability and water-resistant. Their very low water absorption discourages any type of bathroom fungi from blooming. Not to mention that porcelain is harder and more resistant than normal ceramic.\nPorcelain is not only suitable for bathrooms and kitchens, but it can also be used outdoors or in high-traffic areas such as living rooms, hallways or even shopping centers. Porcelain tile lasts longer, is scratch-resistant, has great resistance to temperatures, and is very hard and durable.\nTools needed for installing porcelain tile\n- Tape for measurement\n- Rubber mallet\n- Ceramic cutter\n- Angular grinder\n- Bucket to mix concrete\n- Notched trowel\n- Diamond cutting disc\n- Laser level\n- Safety rubber gloves\n- Safety glasses\nMaterials needed for installing porcelain tile:\n- Adhesive EF for stone and porcelain, 44 pounds\n- Floor leveler, 55-pound bag\n- Porcelain tile slabs (quantity will vary with size of surface to cover)\nDirections for installing porcelain tile\n1. Do the basic math\nFirst, you need to calculate the area to be tiled for the project. If you are installing porcelain tile on the wall, you need to multiply the length of the wall by the height of the room, remembering to subtract the areas (width x height) of any windows and doors. If you are installing porcelain tile on the floor, then simply multiply the width of the area to be tiled by the length of the area to be tiled.\nPRO TIP: It is always advisable to order an extra box of material for future contingencies. For a very big space, you might consider getting 10% more of any material used.\n2. Preparing the surface of the floor\nIf you opt to level out the floor before installing porcelain tile, it is advisable to use a floor leveler with a maximum thickness of 0.8 inches. If you prefer to install the new tile on top of existing tile, you will need to make sure there is an appropriate adhesive layer, as described below.\n3. Preparing the surface of the walls\nIf your wall is concrete or plaster, you just need to wash the surface with gentle soap and water. It doesn’t matter if the surface stays wet— the professionals call this a “saturated surface” — because it will prevent the mixture from drying up.\nIn the case of partition walls, it is recommended to first cover them with textured fiber cement, since the resulting rough surface will give the adhesive and tile slabs a better grip.\n4. Preparing the adhesive\nPowdered adhesives are pre-dosed, which means they come with all the necessary additives to achieve a perfect adhesive paste — all you have to do is add the water.\nPour the adhesive powder into a bucket and add water little by little; stir with a spatula until you get a thick, even paste.\n5. Installing slabs on the floor\nThe slabs for the floor always go on first, since tiles for the walls must remain on top to allow water to run down without problems.\nGluing the slabs is done with a notched trowel — its teeth leave the strips necessary for the adhesive to have better grip. The areas without adhesive are left with air pockets that will cause suction once the slabs settle; this also helps the adhesive to dry better.\nOnce the porcelain has been placed on top of the adhesive, the slabs must be tapped gently with a rubber mallet.\nLeave overlapping joints between each run of slabs.\n6. Installing slabs on the walls\nAs in the directions above for installing porcelain tile on the floor, gluing slabs for the wall is done with a notched trowel. Wall slabs also need to be tapped gently with a rubber mallet.\nGetting straight cuts on slabs\nUse a ceramic cutter that cuts, scores and snaps wall and floor tiles. There is a handle in the cutter that allows you to apply pressure on the tile and also allows to guide the cutter along the rails of the cutter. The tungsten-carbide wheel in the cutter is what actually scores the surface of the tile and allows you to make the cut.\nGetting curved cuts on slabs\nTo install porcelain on the floor and walls of a bathroom, some pieces will need curved or circular cuts to coincide with the drains and water outlets. These cuts are made with an angular grinder and a diamond cutting disc. The cut on the slab should be about 0.1-inch larger than the diameter of the drain or water outlet."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"sensitive"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:df1f4036-8bf9-43ac-ad27-ed521d60e3ca>","<urn:uuid:9abd9a68-f6c1-424d-9bba-f6f1c8127124>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do CO2-based sustainable plastics compare to plant-based bioplastics in terms of their environmental benefits?","answer":"CO2-based sustainable plastics and plant-based bioplastics offer different environmental benefits. CO2-based plastics help reduce greenhouse gas emissions by capturing and reusing industrial CO2 emissions that would otherwise be released into the atmosphere, promoting a circular economy and reducing dependence on virgin fossil fuels. Plant-based bioplastics, while renewable, face challenges as they can still release greenhouse gases when degrading - the same CO2 that was absorbed during plant growth is released back into the atmosphere. Additionally, plant-based bioplastics compete with food production for agricultural land, while CO2-based plastics actually utilize waste emissions as a resource, turning a pollution problem into a valuable raw material.","context":["New Technique for Capturing and Reusing CO2 for Sustainable Plastics\nNew Technique for Capturing and Reusing CO2 for Sustainable Plastics\nPlastic pollution has become a significant environmental concern in recent years. The production and disposal of traditional plastics contribute to the emission of greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2), which is a major contributor to climate change. However, a new technique has emerged that offers a promising solution to this problem - capturing and reusing CO2 as a chemical source for the production of sustainable plastics.\nThe Need for Sustainable Plastics\nPlastics are widely used in various industries due to their versatility and durability. However, the majority of plastics are derived from fossil fuels, which are non-renewable resources. Additionally, the disposal of these plastics often leads to pollution and environmental degradation. To address these issues, the development of sustainable plastics has gained significant attention.\nThe New Technique\nThe new technique involves capturing CO2 emissions from industrial processes, such as power plants or factories, and converting them into valuable chemical compounds that can be used as building blocks for sustainable plastics. This process not only reduces the release of CO2 into the atmosphere but also provides an alternative source of raw materials for plastic production.\nBenefits of the New Technique\nThere are several benefits associated with this new technique:\nReduced CO2 Emissions: By capturing and reusing CO2, the technique helps to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere, mitigating climate change.\nUtilization of Waste: The process allows for the utilization of CO2, which is otherwise considered a waste product, as a valuable resource for plastic production.\nRenewable and Sustainable: By using CO2 as a chemical source, the production of sustainable plastics becomes more environmentally friendly and less reliant on fossil fuels.\nImproved Circular Economy: The technique promotes the concept of a circular economy by closing the loop on CO2 emissions and reducing the need for virgin fossil fuel-based materials.\nThe development and implementation of this new technique have the potential to revolutionize the plastic industry. It offers a sustainable solution to the plastic pollution problem by reducing CO2 emissions and providing an alternative source of raw materials. Furthermore, it aligns with the global efforts to combat climate change and transition towards a more circular and sustainable economy.\nAs research and development in this field continue, it is expected that the efficiency and scalability of the technique will improve, making it more economically viable and widely adopted. With the adoption of this new technique, we can move closer to a future where plastics are no longer a threat to our environment but instead contribute to a more sustainable and circular economy.\n© Article Copyright 1999-2023\nIf you would like to republish the content of this or any other article from Life Technology™ for non commercial\nCopyright And Royalty Free RSS Feeds For Commercial And Non Commercial Use\n.

Following this announcement, along with many other eco-friendly moves by the government, public awareness of environmentalism has erupted. One aspect of reaching the UK’s new target of being zero-waste by 2050 is the shift from oil-based, non-biodegradable plastics to bioplastics.\nBioplastic is the name for a range of plastic products made from renewable, natural materials such as starch from corn or wheat. These products have a number of environmental benefits but are not commonly used in many products as their production is still expensive compared to traditional plastic.\nPlastic production impacts\nPlastic is a highly versatile substance used almost everywhere worldwide but its history is only a short one. The first plastic to be made from fossil fuels was invented in 1907 and since then, the world has been producing millions of tonnes without consideration for how long it will take to break down and little attempt, until recently, to recycle it.\nOver 2 million tonnes of plastic packaging is used in the UK alone each year and a World Wildlife Foundation report estimates that 48% of plastic waste in the UK is sent to landfill. That’s roughly 1 million tonnes of single-use plastic packaging being left to pollute the earth for hundreds or thousands of years.\nAll waste sent to recycling, even the batches rejected for contamination, have been included in the government figures. This makes them seem much better than they are and makes the data misleading.\nNot only is the crude oil used to make plastic a finite resource which will soon be completely used up, but if plastic usage continues at the same rate of growth, greenhouse gases from the global plastic sector will also account for 15% of the global annual carbon budget by 2050. It is in the UK’s best interest to look elsewhere for natural plastic alternatives which can be created renewably and can reduce emissions drastically.\nExamples of bioplastic types\nThough many recognise the need to stop using non-renewable oils to produce plastic, there are those who have also voiced their concerns for just how environmentally friendly bioplastics are. As a company dedicated to reducing our environmental impact and tackling the damage of single-use plastic, we’ve decided to take a look at the different kinds of bioplastic and how they are used.\nOne of the most promising bioplastic options and the one we use in our cups, lids and straws, PLA is a bioplastic produced from the fermentation of corn, wheat or sugarcane. This type of plastic has lots of applications as it resembles petrochemical plastic. It can also be processed in the same facilities manufacturing oil-based plastics, meaning no new investment is needed.\nThe production of PLA produces around 70% fewer greenhouse gases when it degrades and saves 2.3 times the energy to make, showing massive savings for the environment. However, it still doesn’t have the universal applications of oil-based plastics, as it has a melting point of around 60 degrees Celsius unless combined with other polymers.\nThermoplastic starch currently makes up 50% of the global bioplastics market. This type of bioplastic is waterproof so has uses in food packaging, cutlery, coated cardboard and nappies.\nUsually derived from potatoes or corn, this is another material which can be shaped into many different forms with multiple applications to reduce the number of petrochemical plastics used in packaging.\nPHB is a bioplastic which is both bio-derived and biodegradable and can be broken down into water and carbon dioxide by microbes found in soil. It’s produced by bacteria which break down glucose or starch before having their nutrients restricted. When the nutrients are restricted, the bacteria form long chains of carbon which imitate the same chains that form regular plastics.\nThere have also been tests using PHB for surgical applications as some forms are bio-absorbable. This means that the plastic can be shaped into stitches, pins or sheets to heal the body which are then reabsorbed without the need for removal.\nPA 11 is a bioplastic made from castor beans, meaning it’s a renewable product which produces fewer greenhouse gases. However, the plastic created is not biodegradable. Products made from PA 11 will break down at the same rate as regular plastic, potentially polluting the land and sea.\nThis type of bioplastic has been in use for decades, forming car fuel lines and brake tubing as well as being used in trainers and some surgical equipment.\nPolyethylene is the most common type of petrochemical plastic produced for packaging. However, scientists have been able to produce this same polymer using natural products like sugarcane and corn.\nMaking plastic from natural products has the benefit of not wasting finite resources but doesn’t help solve the waste and pollution issues with long-life plastics like polyethylene. The plastic produced can be recycled, however, so by improving recycling rates, this process would help to cut emissions and the harmful damage plastic has on the environment.\nIs bioplastic better than plastic?\nGlobally, the issue of single-use plastic is causing untold damage to our earth and seas. The threat of the oil used to make them finally running out means that, even beyond their environmental impact, plastic companies will need to invest in alternatives to survive.\nAt first, bioplastics may seem like an easy, green alternative to regular plastic, but current production methods are filled with complications which have caused some campaigners to question just how eco-friendly they really are.\nBiodegradable plastics (made from traditional petrochemicals) typically don’t break down as easy as they should. All plastics are technically degradable but regular plastic takes hundreds or thousands of years to fully break down, which is why it’s causing such a problem.\nMany plastic products sold as biodegradable are actually only able to be properly broken down in specific settings, for example using industrial machines or at a certain temperature. Some other plastics are broken down over time by light or water. Understanding exactly how each plastic needs to be disposed of to correctly be broken down can be hard to remember and could make it more difficult for consumers to support eco-conscious treatment of plastic packaging if it were to be used in mainstream production.\nSome bioplastics are also combined with other polymers to give them stronger properties. When broken down, these products can leave behind harmful residue or microplastics which can then reach the ocean or human drinking water. This can then be dangerous to animal and human health, meaning that any environmental successes which come from producing cleaner plastics are negated by their end of life treatment.\nSome bioplastics and most regular plastic can be recycled into new products, allowing them to have much longer lives and reducing the amount of single-use waste being disposed of. However, this process can sometimes use more energy than producing new products in the first place, inadvertently emitting more greenhouse gases.\nTo ensure plastic recycling results in environmental savings, the entire system will need to be improved to find ways of producing recycled materials using less energy and generating more renewable energy in the first place.\nOther environmental contributions\nWhile bioplastics help to reduce our need for oil, leaving valuable resources in the ground and keeping their negative environmental impact locked up, they can also cause problems of their own. It is imperative that the global plastics market reduces its contribution to carbon emissions and the pressure on finite oil resources but companies will need to carefully consider the alternative contributions from other products.\nSome common issues with bioplastics include:\nBioplastics made from plant products, such as PHB, are easily broken down domestically into carbon dioxide and water. Though this is beneficial as the products are easily removed from the ecosystem, carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas absorbed by the plant products as they were growing. This means that, though growing more plants for plastic will initially help to reduce carbon dioxide in the air, its breakdown will still release the same amount.\nOther starch-based bioplastics can produce methane if left to break down naturally and not processed properly. Methane is a greenhouse gas 23 times more potent than carbon dioxide.\nMany bioplastics are created by processing food products like corn, maize and potatoes. Though these are easily accessible, cheap and renewable, they are a staple food source on every continent. By increasing the demand for bioplastics, more land dedicated to the production of essential carbohydrates will be focused on plastic production. This will likely affect the poorest societies around the world who are also expected to feel the worst effects of climate change.\nWith so many different kinds of bioplastics already on the market all needing to be disposed of in different ways, this puts a lot of pressure on consumers to remember the rules for every type of plastic and ensure everything is done right. As petrochemical plastic recycling is becoming more common and standardised, the introduction of a range of plastics could jeopardise the progress being made.\nThough bioplastics at the minute are still not a perfect solution to plastic waste, there are innovative researchers around the world finding new, more eco-friendly ways to produce bioplastics and reduce dependence on fossil fuels.\nStudents at Columbia University, led by Kartik Chandran was successful in using wastewater to convert organic carbon into fatty acids which could then be used to produce PHA. Chandran also believes that this process could be used on food waste or human waste to make the process more concentrated, saving money and maximising production.\nThis plastic-producing process would also be effective at reusing as much organic material as possible and tackling food waste issues globally.\nFood packaging innovation\nScientists at Michigan State University have genetically modified cyanobacteria, or blue-green algae, to constantly naturally produce sugars which can then be consumed by plastic-producing bacteria. This would allow plastics to be created without consuming so much food product, helping to cut costs and land use.\nThe future of bioplastics\nScientists around the world are looking for creative alternatives to plastic, often also focusing on how waste can be used to help promote a cyclical process and reduce waste contributions in general. While none of these products is completely ready to enter the mainstream yet, it’s only a matter of time before bioplastic production is ramped up.\nWhen considering the whole process of farming, production, processing and disposal, bioplastics have a long way to go before they are fully cost-effective and eco-friendly versus their non-bio counterparts. However, the innovation in the industry is promising and shows that, with a green-focused overhaul, plastic won’t always be a harmful drain on our planet’s resources."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:c6cd8bfb-f27b-4b4b-9954-eb0a5bcff9be>","<urn:uuid:e8c2a51b-adec-4782-a240-5f9221f922b6>"],"error":null}

A reasonable accommodation is a change in rules, policies, practices or services which allows the tenant to have an equal opportunity to use and enjoy the residential dwelling.\nReasonable Accommodations The request for an accommodation: –Tenants can request an accommodation orally or in writing –“When making the request, the tenant should explain what type of accommodations he/she is requesting and the relationship between the requested accommodation and the disability.” What is the accommodation? How does the accommodation help the disability?\nReasonable Accommodations The request: –Do not ask the tenant: “What is the disability?” –“A landlord may request only information that is necessary to evaluate the disability-related need for the accommodation.” –Do ask the tenant: “What are the effects of the disability, and how does the [requested accommodation] help it?”\nReasonable Accommodations The request: –If the disability is not obvious, a landlord may ask for further information about the disability that is: Necessary to verify the person meets the definition of a person with a disability; Describes the needed accommodation; and, Shows the relationship between the accommodation and the person’s disability.\nReasonable Accommodations A doctor’s note containing the information is generally adequate, though not necessary Tenant is not required to show detailed medical records concerning the disability For emotional support animals: documentation from a physician, psychiatrist, social worker, or other mental health professional that the animal provides support that alleviates at least one of the identified effects of the disability is adequate.\nReasonable Accommodations When can a landlord refuse a reasonable accommodation? –A landlord can refuse a requested accommodation if it will Be an undue financial or administrative burden on the landlord Fundamentally alter the nature of the provider’s operations Result in substantial physical damage to the property of others unless the threat can be eliminated or significantly reduced by alternative means Pose a direct threat to the health or safety of others\nWhat can’t a landlord do? A landlord cannot flat out refuse an accommodation request. A landlord can’t ask a tenant to pay a deposit, fee or surcharge in exchange for having a service or support animal even if they require such fees from pet owners. A landlord can’t require the service or support animal to have any specific training or certification. A landlord can’t require the service or emotional support animal to wear or carry any special collar, harness, vest, emblem or other means of identifying it as such.\nWhat should a landlord do? A landlord should engage in an interactive process to determine the needs of the tenant and whether the accommodation can be made. A landlord should respond as promptly as possible to the request; an extended amount of time can be seen as a refusal to accommodate.\nWhat can a landlord do? Landlords can request proof of current vaccination and/or license for the service and/ or emotional support animal. Landlords can expect the tenant to conform to the rules of the complex, i.e. picking up animal waste, maintaining the unit to the extent expected of every other tenant.

The task(s) performed by the dog must be directly related to the person’s disability.” – ADA\nA service dog can be any breed and any size of dog.\n2. ADA Service Dog Laws Definition of Work or Tasks\nPart of the ADA definition of a service animal includes that the dog does work or tasks for a person with a disability. But what does this mean, exactly?\nIt means that in order to be a service dog, a dog must be trained to take some kind of specific action when it is needed to help someone with their disability, or aspects of their disability.\nExamples include alerting someone with diabetes that their blood sugar is reaching a dangerously high or low level. Someone who lives with epilepsy or another similar disorder may have a dog that is trained to detect the onset of a seizure, and then help to keep the person safe during the event.\nService dogs can help people who are living with a mental disability to remind them to take their medication on time, or could help someone living with PTSD, by stopping unhelpful behavior, or waking up someone from a nightmare.\n3. Emotional Support Animals, Therapy Animals, Comfort & Companion Animals – ADA Service Dog Laws\nThese animals (emotional support dogs, therapy dogs, comfort animals, companion animals) provide comfort just by their presence. Since they have not been trained to perform a specific work or task for a specific person’s disability, they can not be considered service dogs under the ADA service dog laws definition.\nHowever, it’s important to note that some State and local governments have created service dog laws and some of these laws allow people to take an emotional support animal into public places. So be sure to check with the local and state laws for your area.\nThe Fair Housing Act also has a more broad definition of assistance animal, so it’s a different story there with emotional support animals being allowed into housing situations as an assistance animal for a disability.\n4. ADA Service Dog Laws – Dogs for Anxiety & Anxiety Attacks\nIf you’re wondering whether a dog that helps someone with their anxiety counts as a service dog, go back to the original definition. There is a clear distinction between psychiatric service animals and emotional support animals.\nIf a dog has been specifically trained for one person’s anxiety, and trained to sense that their anxiety attack is about to happen soon, and then takes a specific action which helps to avoid the attack or lessen the attack and related symptoms, that would qualify as a service animal.\nHowever, if the dog helps the person by providing comfort with it’s mere presence then it would not be considered a service animal under the ADA service dog laws. The dog hasn’t been specifically trained to do a certain job or task for a specific person.\n5. ADA Service Dog Laws – Professional Service Dog Training\nProfessional service dog training is not a requirement of the ADA. In other words, people who are living with disabilities have the right to train the dog themselves.\nThey and are not required to use a professional service dog training program, even though there are many of these programs that can and do train many amazing service dogs for people.\n6. ADA Service Dog Laws – Dogs In Training\nService dogs in training are not considered official service dogs under the ADA. In other words, a service dog in training must completely finish its training before it can be allowed access into public places.\nHaving said that, some State or local laws do cover dogs that are still in training, so check with your local area to find out for sure.\n7. ADA Service Dog Laws Information For Businesses (Covered Entities)\nSometimes it’s obvious that someone with a disability is using a service dog and that the dog is clearly a service dog. For example, when a dog is guiding someone who is blind or has low vision. Or when a dog is pulling a wheelchair.\nOther times, it’s not so obvious, or not obvious at all. This is because many disabilities are invisible. In these types of cases, businesses may only ask two things to someone who is attempting to bring a service dog into a public place.\n1. “Is this dog a service animal required because of a disability?”\n2. “What work or task has the dog been trained to perform?”\nThe following are not permitted under the ADA service dog laws:\n- Asking the person with the service dog for any kind of documentation\n- Requiring that the dog perform or demonstrate its task or work\n- Inquiring about the details of someone’s disability. This is highly personal information.\n8. ADA Service Dog Laws – Service Dog Vests, Harnesses, Patches\nA lot of service dogs do wear a vest or harness. But it’s important to know that the ADA service dog laws do not require service animals to wear any of the following: vest, ID tag, or specific harness.\n9. ADA Service Dog Laws – Care & Supervision of Service Animals\nService dog handlers are responsible for caring for and supervising their service dog at all times, including when out in public places such as a restaurant or movie theater.\nThis includes the usual things when caring for an animal: going to the bathroom, feeding, grooming, and veterinary appointments and care.\nBusinesses and any covered entity aren’t responsible for caring for, or supervising a service animal at any time.\n10. ADA Service Dog Laws – Self Service Food Lines (Salad Bar)\nService dogs must be allowed to go to a self service food line or salad bar, as well as cafeterias and communal food preparation areas, dormitories and shelters.\nService dogs may go anywhere that the general public is allowed and/or invited to go, and this is no exception.\n11. ADA Service Dog Laws – Hotels\nPeople who live with disabilities and use a service dog have the same rights as others when it comes to hotels.\nThis means that the person with the service dog must be offered the same opportunities to reserve any room that is available, and not be restricted to “pet friendly” rooms.\nService dogs are not pets; they are living, breathing medical assistance devices that happen to have a tail and four legs.\nHotels are not allowed to charge someone with a service dog for cleaning the dog’s hair or dander that may have been shed.\nHaving said that, a hotel can charge the same fee for damages as it charges to other people, if a service dog for some reason ends up damaging a guest room in the hotel.\nService dogs are not to be left in a hotel room alone, without the handler. The handler must have complete control over the dog at all times.\n12. ADA Service Dog Laws On More Than One Service Animal\nGenerally speaking, if someone needs more than one service animal, then they are permitted to take more than one with them to a public place.\nSometimes people will use two animals if they have two different disabilities. For example, one service dog could be used for helping the person find their way if they have a visual disability, and another may warn of a seizure about to happen.\nOther times, someone may need two dogs for the same task, like to help someone with stability when walking.\nStaff can ask the two questions that businesses are allowed to ask, and if both dogs can be accommodated, then they should. However, if it’s not possible to accommodate both dogs because of space constraints, one of the dogs can be asked to be left outside.\n13. ADA Service Dog Laws – Hospitals\nGenerally speaking, service animals must be permitted in hospital patient rooms and all other places inside a hospital that the general public as well as patients are allowed to go.\nThey cannot be excluded or denied simply on the basis that the hospital staff can provide the same services for the person.\nIf a person with a disability is unable to care for their service animal due to a hospitalization, they have a few options. They could make arrangements for family or a friend to come to the hospital to help care for the dog.\nThis would be the best option, since it’s never a good idea to separate a person and their service dog unless absolutely necessary.\nAlternatively, the friend or family member could take the dog and care for them during the hospitalization.\nIf a patient is unable to care for their dog, and is also unable to find someone else to help, then the hospital may place the dog in a boarding facility until the patient is released. Or, other arrangements can be made.\nThe hospital needs to offer the patient a reasonable chance to make their own arrangements for the dog before they put the dog into a boarding facility, or make other arrangements.\n14. ADA Service Dog Laws Ambulances\nGenerally, service dogs must be permitted to ride in an ambulance with their handler. Having said that, however, if the space in the ambulance is limited, or crowded, the dog may need to be excluded.\nThis is especially true if the dog’s presence would interfere with the emergency staff’s ability to treat the person.\nIf this happens, staff need to make other arrangements to have the service dog transported to the hospital to be with the patient. Service dogs and their handlers should not be separated unless it’s absolutely necessary.\n15. ADA Service Dog Laws Certification & Registration\nADA Service Dog Laws indicate that service dogs do not need to be certified. People who use service dogs have the right to train the dog themselves, so many service dogs do not go through professional training.\nBusinesses are not permitted to require documentation, that a service dog has been certified, licensed as a service dog, or trained as a condition for entry.\nYou may have noticed that online there are some individuals and organizations that sell service dog items, such as certification products and/or registration documents. These documents and certifications do not convey any rights under the ADA. The Department of Justice does not recognize them as proof that the dog is a service animal.\n16. City/Local Dog Licenses & Vaccinations\nIf the city or town where you live requires that all dogs be vaccinated, service dogs are not exempt from this rule, and must comply.\nThe same applies for local dog licenses. New York City is a good example of a city that requires all dogs be registered and licensed.\nMandatory registration of service animals – just because they are service animals – is not allowed under the ADA service dog laws.\n17. Voluntary Registration\nSometimes, places like cities, local governments, and colleges and universities may offer a voluntary registration for service dogs.\nA voluntary registry like this serves a public purpose. In the event of an emergency, such as an evacuation, emergency staff will know to look for service animals that have been registered.\nSome offer additional benefits, like reduced dog licensing fees.\nRegistries like this are allowed under the ADA service dog laws.\nJust note that requiring a service dog to be registered as a service animal as a condition of being permitted entrance to a public place is a violation of the ADA service dog laws.\n18. Banning or Excluding Service Animals\nService dogs can be any size, and any breed. A business may not exclude a service dog based on assumptions or stereotypes about the breed. Or, how they think the animal might behave.\nIf a service dog is showing bad behavior, such as going to the bathroom inappropriately, barking, or posing a direct threat to the health and safety of others, or if it has a history of this behavior, then it may be excluded.\nIt may also be excluded if it is not in control of the handler. The handler must have control over the dog at all times, whether that be with a leash, harness, or voice control.\nIf a service dog is excluded for any of those reasons, then the business or entity must still offer their product or services to the person who was using the dog, without the dog being present.\nIf a city or town prohibits a certain breed of dog, exceptions must be made for service dogs, unless the service dog is posing a threat to the health and safety of other people or animal.\nBusinesses and entities may not exclude a service dog based solely on the breed or generalizations about how a certain breed might behave. Each individual case needs to be examined to determine if that particular animal’s history or current behavior is inappropriate enough to be excluded.\n19. ADA Service Dog Laws – Swimming Pools\nThe ADA service dog laws do not override public health rules. One example being a rule that prohibit dogs in swimming pools.\nIn other words, if dogs are not allowed in swimming pools as per public health orders, then service dogs are similarly not allowed in the swimming pool.\nHowever, service dogs must be allowed in other areas where the public is allowed to go, including change rooms and the pool deck.\n20. Church & Other Places of Worship\nChurches, temples, synagogues, mosques, and other religious institutions and organizations are specifically exempt from the ADA service dog laws.\nHowever, some individual State laws may apply to religious organizations, so check with your state to find out.\n21. ADA Service Dog Laws in Residential Situations\nThe ADA service dog laws do apply to housing programs that are administered by state and local governments. Some examples of these include public housing authorities, and any places of public accommodation, like public and private universities.\nAdditionally, the Fair Housing Act applies to virtually all and any types of housing. This includes housing situations that are both public and privately-owned, including the housing that is covered by the ADA service dog laws.\nThe Fair Housing Act uses a slightly different definition to determine which kinds of animals can be considered as a reasonable accommodation.\nHousing providers are required to permit the use of animals that work, provide assistance, or perform tasks that help people who are living with disabilities. Or, it can be an animal that provides emotional support to alleviate a symptom or effect of a disability.\n22. ADA Service Dog Laws – Commercial Airlines\nCommercial airlines do not need to comply with the ADA service dog laws, because the Air Carrier Access Act protects the rights of people with disabilities in air travel. It is a federal law."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"opinion_recommendation"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:74c3e4db-9679-49c3-95d5-77ac38a2d1d4>","<urn:uuid:98d4db8c-d3c5-4dd5-a72e-56c3a29306d1>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I'm fascinated by quantum computing progress! What makes Fibonacci anyons special for topological quantum computing, and how has graphene research brought us closer to finding them?","answer":"Fibonacci anyons are special because they are the simplest anyons capable of performing universal quantum computation, with a quantum dimension equal to the golden ratio (1.617...). Their braiding statistics - the way these quasiparticles move around each other creating braids and knots of tracks - make them particularly suitable for implementing quantum gates. Recently, graphene-based devices have emerged as promising platforms for detecting these anyons. By using atomically thin materials like graphene sandwiched between hexagonal boron nitride crystals and graphite gates, researchers have created extremely low-disorder, highly tunable systems where non-Abelian anyons should be more accessible. This approach has made the required temperatures nearly ten times higher than in other materials, bringing non-Abelian statistics into a more convenient temperature range for both fundamental physics investigations and potential quantum computing applications.","context":["Topological quantum computing (TQC) is a newer type of quantum computing that uses “braids” of particle tracks, rather than actual particles such as ions and electrons, as the qubits to implement computations. Using braids has one important advantage: it makes TQCs practically immune to the small perturbations in the environment that cause decoherence in particle-based qubits and often lead to high error rates.\nEver since TQC was first proposed in 1997, experimentally realizing the appropriate braids has been extremely difficult. For one thing, the braids are formed not by the trajectories of ordinary particles, but by the trajectories of exotic quasiparticles (particle-like excitations) called anyons. Also, movements of the anyons must be non-Abelian, a property similar to the commutative property in which changing the order of their movements must not change their final tracks. In most proposals of TQC so far, the non-Abelian statistics of the anyons has not been powerful enough, even in theory, for universal TQC.\nNow in a new study published in Physical Review Letters [http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.3383], physicists Abolhassan Vaezi at Cornell University and Maissam Barkeshli at Microsoft’s research lab Station Q have theoretically shown that anyons tunneling in a double-layer system can transition to an exotic non-Abelian state that contains “Fibonacci” anyons that are powerful enough for universal TQC….\n“Our work suggests that some existing experimental setups are rich enough to yield a phase capable of performing ‘universal’ TQC, i.e., all of the required logical gates for the performance of a quantum computer can be made through the braiding of anyons only,” Vaezi told Phys.org. “Since braiding is a topological operation and does not perturb the low-energy physics, the resulting quantum computer is fault-tolerant.”\nThe physicists’ work builds on previous research that has shown that anyons can arise due to the fractional quantum Hall effect. To realize this effect, a 2-D electron gas is sandwiched between two flat semiconductor plates. When cooled to temperatures near absolute zero and exposed to strong magnetic fields, excitations form in the 2-D electron gas and give rise to anyons. So far, only Abelian anyons have been detected in fractional quantum Hall systems, but studies suggest that non-Abelian anyons might also be realized.\nIn the new study, the scientists considered a double-layer fractional quantum Hall system in which anyons can tunnel between the two layers. When modeling this system on a torus, the scientists showed that sufficiently large tunneling drives the evolution of six ground states that correspond to six topologically distinct types of quasiparticles, one of which is the Fibonacci anyon.\nVaezi explains that the Fibonacci anyon is related to the famous Fibonacci sequence (where a number in the sequence is the sum of the previous two numbers) as well as the golden ratio, 1.617… (which is approximately the ratio of any number in the Fibonacci sequence to the previous number). These mathematical patterns arise in the Fibonacci anyon because of its quantum properties, particularly those related to the so-called fusion rules that govern particle spins.\n“The Fibonacci anyon is a non-Abelian anyon whose quantum dimension is the golden ratio (1.617…), and is the simplest anyon capable of performing universal quantum computation,” Vaezi explained. “Using the fusion rule of Fibonacci anyons, it can be shown that the degeneracy of the ground state in the presence of n well-separated Fibonacci anyons on a sphere is the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence.”\nSo what makes the Fibonacci anyon so attractive for TQC? The answer lies in its braiding statistics, or the way that these quasiparticles move around each other, creating braids and knots of tracks. Three or four Fibonacci anyons may correspond to a single qubit, and their braiding statistics corresponds to single-qubit gates. Building multiple-qubit gates requires braiding multiple qubits, often in intricate ways.\nHere the physicists explain that another way to view this process is by looking at quasiparticles as domain walls that separate different ground state patterns of electrons. Different quasiparticles have different electric charges, so they separate different electron patterns. From this perspective, the Fibonacci anyon is appealing due to the particular ground state patterns it separates.\nThe physicists show that their finding that interlayer tunneling can result in Fibonacci anyons is well-supported by a variety of distinct methods. Further, the researchers raise the possibility that these Fibonacci anyons may have already been realized in past experiments on double-layer quantum Hall systems, although these experiments were not specifically looking for them. This is one area that they hope to investigate in the future.\n“To test our prediction, we are numerically studying bilayer quantum Hall states with a number of interlayer interactions and searching for non-Abelian phases and, in particular, Fibonacci anyons in the case of the 2/3 state,” Vaezi said. “We are also working on various experimental aspects of our proposal and potential signatures of the Fibonacci anyons.”\nRead more at phys.org","Capacitance measurement of bilayer graphene at a high magnetic field. The vertical dark blue to orange lines are signatures of fractional quantum Hall states that are shared between the two layers of the bilayer graphene sheet. The vertical line going through the center is believed to host an intriguing type of particles: non-Abelian anyons. Credit: University of California - Santa Barbara\nWhat kinds of 'particles' are allowed by nature? The answer lies in the theory of quantum mechanics, which describes the microscopic world.\nIn a bid to stretch the boundaries of our understanding of the quantum world, UC Santa Barbara researchers have developed a device that could prove the existence of non-Abelian anyons, a quantum particle that has been mathematically predicted to exist in two-dimensional space, but so far not conclusively shown. The existence of these particles would pave the way toward major advances in topological quantum computing.\nIn a study that appears in the journal Nature, physicist Andrea Young, his graduate student Sasha Zibrov and their colleagues have taken a leap toward finding conclusive evidence for non-Abelian anyons. Using graphene, an atomically thin material derived from graphite (a form of carbon), they developed an extremely low-defect, highly tunable device in which non-Abelian anyons should be much more accessible. First, a little background: In our three-dimensional universe, elementary particles can be either fermions or bosons: think electrons (fermions) or the Higgs (a boson).\n\"The difference between these two types of 'quantum statistics' is fundamental to how matter behaves,\" Young said. For example, fermions cannot occupy the same quantum state, allowing us to push electrons around in semiconductors and preventing neutron stars from collapsing. Bosons can occupy the same state, leading to spectacular phenomena such as Bose-Einstein condensation and superconductivity, he explained. Combine a few fermions, such as the protons, neutrons, and electrons that make up atoms and you can get either type, but never evade the dichotomy.\nIn a two-dimensional universe, however, the laws of physics allow for a third possibility. Known as \"anyons,\" this type of quantum particle is neither a boson nor a fermion, but rather something completely different—and some kinds of anyons, known as non-Abelian anyons, retain a memory of their past states, encoding quantum information across long distances and forming the theoretical building blocks for topological quantum computers.\nAlthough we don't live in a two dimensional universe, when confined to a very thin sheet or slab of material, electrons do. In this case, anyons can emerge as \"quasiparticles\" from correlated states of many electrons. Perturbing such a system, say with an electrical potential, leads to the entire system rearranging just as if an nayon had moved.\nThe hunt for non-Abelian anyons begins by identifying the collective states that host them. \"In fractional quantum Hall states—a type of collective electron state observed only in two dimensional samples at very high magnetic fields—the quasiparticles are known to have precisely a rational fraction of the electron charge, implying that they are anyons,\" Young said.\n\"Mathematically, sure, non-Abelian statistics are allowed and even predicted for some fractional quantum Hall states.\" he continued. However, scientists in this field have been limited by the fragility of the host states in the semiconductor material where they are typically studied. In these structures, the collective states themselves appear only at exceptionally low temperatures, rendering it doubly difficult to explore the unique quantum properties of individual anyons.\nGraphene proves to be an ideal material to build devices to search for the elusive anyons. But, while scientists had been building graphene-based devices, other materials surrounding the graphene sheet—such as glass substrates and metallic gates—introduced enough disorder to destroy any signatures of non-Abelian states, Zibrov explained. The graphene is fine, it's the environment that is the problem, he said.\nThe solution? More atomically thin material.\n\"We've finally reached a point where everything in the device is made out of two-dimensional single crystals,\" said Young. \"So not only the graphene itself, but the dielectrics are single crystals of hexagonal boron nitride that are flat and perfect and the gates are single crystals of graphite which are flat and perfect.\" By aligning and stacking these flat and perfect crystals of material on top of each other, the team achieved not only a very low-disorder system, but one that is also extremely tunable.\n\"Besides realizing these states, we can tune microscopic parameters in a very well controlled way and understand what makes these states stable and what destabilizes them,\" Young said. The fine degree of experimental control—and elimination of many unknowns— allowed the team to theoretically model the system with high accuracy, building confidence in their conclusions.\nThe materials advance gives these fragile excitations a certain amount of robustness, with the required temperatures nearly ten times higher than needed in other material systems. Bringing non-Abelian statistics into a more convenient temperature range proves an opportunity for not only for investigations of fundamental physics, but reignites hope for developing a topological quantum bit, which could form the basis for a new kind of quantum computer. Non-Abelian anyons are special in that they are thought to be able to process and store quantum information independent of many environmental effects, a major challenge in realizing quantum computers with traditional means.\nBut, say the physicists, first things first. Directly measuring the quantum properties of the emergent quasiparticles is very challenging, Zibrov explained. While some properties—such as fractional charge—have been definitively demonstrated, definitive proof of non-Abelian statistics—much less harnessing nonabelian anyons for quantum computation—has remained far out of the reach of experiments. \"We don't really know yet experimentally if non-Abelian anyons exist,\" Zibrov said.\n\"Our experiments so far are consistent with theory, which tells us that some of the states we observed should be non-Abelian, but we still don't have an experimental smoking gun.\"\n\"We'd like an experiment that actually demonstrates a phenomenon unique to non-Abelian statistics,\" said Young, who has won numerous awards for his work, including the National Science Foundation's CAREER Award. \"Now that we have a material that we understand really well, there are many ways to do this—we'll see if nature cooperates!\""],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"opinion_recommendation"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:92426ff4-3846-41f5-a6f9-a1fa6d02e46a>","<urn:uuid:384319f6-8eb2-48fe-850d-45a897ff6d94>"],"error":null}

{"question":"Smart city 比較: How do Adelaide 和 Masdar approach citizen engagement differently?","answer":"Adelaide focuses on customer-centric service delivery, creating open data toolkits and infrastructure that allow citizens to make informed decisions and interact with city services as they choose. Masdar, while also working to create a sustainable environment, currently has a more limited focus on citizen engagement, with its population primarily consisting of research students and cleantech industry professionals. Its social infrastructure is still developing, with only a few public parks and restaurants planned.","context":["Futuristic 'Low Carbon' City is Rooted in Centuries-Old Sustainable Design\nMasdar snags the most headlines for striving to be a pioneering low-carbon city and cleantech hub. A multibillion-dollar undertaking spearheaded by Abu Dhabi's clean energy company, the project is met with both enthusiasm and skepticism in the green world—and utterances of 'oh, cool' just about everywhere else.\nI toured the city last year, and was indeed struck with the project—which is, thus far, essentially a single, surreal city block jutting out of the desert. Yet it is nonetheless home to\n- a research institute that attracts world class talent,\n- all kinds of experimental cleantech projects,\n- a snazzy automated personal rapid transit system, and\n- sprawling solar arrays that, for now, power the whole community.\nBrian Merchant/CC BY 2.0\nI visited Masdar again this year, and construction had begun on a Siemens compound; the German company plans on installing its Middle East headquarters here. Remember, the goal of Masdar is to create a city that practically bleeds clean energy; in the idealized vision, students will travel from around the world to research here, multinational companies will set up commercial cleantech centers, and Abu Dhabi will benefit from growing a highly relevant knowledge economy in its backyard when its oil supplies inevitably sputter out.\nAs of now, Masdar is a mere skeleton of that vision; it takes time to build a clean city from scratch. Construction is moving along, but the city's population is still smaller than a summer camp's—a couple hundred students make up the bulk of the year-round residents. As such, besides the new phase of construction, not a whole lot had changed since I travelled to Masdar last. But I did pay more attention to some of the more subtle design elements that routinely get swept away in all the futuristic bombast—primarily, that the city was planned using some of the oldest-standing Arabic design principles.\nAlan Frost, the Director of Masdar City, explains:\nBuildings are 'overshadowed' to generate shade, and wind towers are employed to draw the desert breeze down into the city streets, keeping the city cool.\nHere's Frost explaining the wind tower:\nSmart, right? Sometimes the smartest 'sustainable' design elements are centuries old. Effort has clearly been made to ensure that Masdar is more than a collection of research facilities, and the neo-Arabic architecture attests to that as well. Elements like these may help make the city more livable, more appealing to folks desiring of a home that is culturally multidimensional. And considering these factors gets one thinking: What kind of folks will want to live here?\nCleantech industry folks, of course. Research scientists, indeed. But will it be a stimulating place to live for their families? Or for other residents, like service industry workers who will inevitably head to the city if it takes off? There are a few public parks planned, and there's a restaurant or two. But the emphasis is certainly on building up as much sustainability cred as possible—yet a humming social culture will be as important as anything in attracting more diverse talent to the city.\nTime will tell whether Masdar becomes the behemoth it is intended to be—the Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the ruler of Abu Dhabi, has said that the project continues to receive his support. And it certainly appears to be under perennial construction. The presence of Siemens will bolster its credibility, while the Masdar Institute is actively looking for more students to expand its research arm.\nThe city is still, undeniably, an intriguing cleantech project. Now, whether it will indeed one day be a thriving community, or can attract the vibrant social culture necessary to sustain a city, are the next major questions that Masdar must confront.","As technology evolves, government decision-makers are looking for new ways to encourage innovation while simultaneously managing risks.\nTo learn more about the city of the future, we asked city leaders --Peter Auhl, Head of IT for the City of Adelaide; Seok Tae Kim, Chief Marketing Officer at Gale International Korea; and Stephen Beatty, KPMG's Head of Infrastructure for North America and India -- to share their insights and expectations.\nPeter Auhl: I would argue that the City of the Future will be overwhelmingly focused on delivering customer outcomes. In Adelaide, our focus is very much on adding value to our customer interactions and giving our customers a choice. We think that the best thing government can do is to get out of the way so that citizens can make their own informed decisions. So our approach has been to curate our services and information in a way that allows customers to interact with city services and infrastructure in the way they choose.\nSeok Tae Kim: We have a similar opinion. When developing our smart city in Songdo, we believe that it's the people that live within the city that make it `smart', not the technology. The focus must be on helping citizens participate as partners with the city, sharing their ideas, data and feedback so that we can improve convenience and choice. In Songdo, we are striving for three key characteristics: the use of technology to improve citizen convenience, the right facilities and infrastructure to improve quality of life, and increased sustainability. I believe that the City of the Future will represent a combination of those three characteristics.\nStephen Beatty: Absolutely right. And I would argue that the most successful cities in the future will be those that are able to find innovative ways to minimize the man-made and institutional friction between people, systems and infrastructure. As cities evolve, I expect to see governments focus on helping citizens become much better-informed decision makers. And that should lead to much greater alignment between the `micro' decisions that people make on a day-to-day basis and the `macro' decisions that we make as city leaders.\nStephen Beatty: I believe that we will start to see cities evolve into nodes of social good. Rather than travelling distances to access social services like healthcare and senior services, I suspect we will see a shift towards more small-scale systems housed within complex nodes of development. Today, we're very focused on creating very simple development environments but, as we densify existing land uses, we're going to see much more complex - and much more responsive - social environments.\nPeter Auhl: One of the perverse impacts of technology is that it has actually pushed people away from each other, social media has been the driving force behind this change. I think that - in the future - technology will instead start to bring communities closer together. In the future, I hope that we are going to see technology start to encourage people to interact more within their communities. I believe that, as people get more information about what’s happening in their communities, we’ll see the current scenario flip itself to once again reinforce our social interactions rather than separate less meaningful interactions.\nSeok Tae Kim: Right. And this comes back to people being at the heart of the smart city. I believe that technology will enable city leaders to focus on the wellbeing of their citizens, allowing them to provide a better experience through improved access to culture, education, the arts and other facilities that ultimately improve the quality of life for those living in the city.\nPeter Auhl: There’s a lot about the future that we don’t know. But what we do know is that connectivity is going to play a very important role. So we’ve been focused on creating a new type of infrastructure that we refer to as “10 Gigabit Adelaide”, basically creating a private network across the entire city that allows businesses to connect with businesses across the city, and then connect the entire city directly to cloud infrastructure via interconnection (non-internet dedicated cloud connections). This will allow businesses to improve connectivity and to scale their services quickly, reliably and securely and connect their businesses to the world economy. The 10 Gigabit Adelaide network will all also provide base infrastructure to enable a number of Smart City projects.\nSeok Tae Kim: Infrastructure is certainly important. But so, too, is enabling regulation. When we started to develop Songdo, we worked closely with the government to create regulation that actually encourages development in key areas such as healthcare, social services and education. Now we have the honor of hosting five universities and a number of international health centers which serve as a great incubator for innovation and creativity in our city. The government has also provided significant financial support by, for example, investing more than US$1 billion into developing the right environment to support international campuses.\nStephen Beatty: I would agree with both Peter and Seok Tae - the City of the Future needs better connectivity and it needs supportive regulation to become reality. I think governments also need to start thinking about how they program and deliver their services in a much more integrated way. They need to start thinking about how their services interact with each other, how they can become more agile and responsive to the changing needs of the population and how they are going to use their capabilities and assets to respond to the social needs of their future citizens.\nSeok Tae Kim: Data will be very important. In Songdo, we are partnering with local service providers, government organization and multinational technology companies to maximize our use of data. But, at the same time, we are also starting to collect much more data than ever before. For example, as part of our city management and security system, we have added hundreds of modern surveillance cameras that collect data and help us improve our decision making for traffic management, security and public safety. And that is helping us create an even smarter and more responsive city.\nPeter Auhl: Data has been a key focus for us in Adelaide. We recognize that data is central to not only government decision-making, but also business and personal decision-making. So we've created a very comprehensive open data tool kit that allows businesses and government decision-makers to visualize a wide range of key information though a single pane of glass. And that is helping government and businesses to make better decisions about their investments.\nStephen Beatty: One of the reasons I'm so optimistic about the City of the Future is that I believe that cities are starting to gain access to and curate increasing amounts of data that will eventually allow them to do more and better things in a more efficient and effective manner. I see data as the first step on the journey towards creating the City of the Future, not only as a way to deliver services but also as a way to compare their effectiveness against other cities and, by doing so, identify ways to improve service delivery and customer experiences.\nSeok Tae Kim: Every country is witnessing a rise in cyber terrorism and cyber attack. And, as our infrastructure and data become more integrated and start to flow through operations centers, I worry about the disruption that might occur if there is a data breach or interruption of services due to hacking. So we are working hard to ensure that our technologies are continuously updated and to maintain and enhance the security of our data. But there is no perfect solution to these challenges.\nPeter Auhl: I would agree with Seok Tae. Any time you connect things together, you increase your risk of having those things compromised. One of the benefits of our 10 Gigabit Adelaide concept is that we are building security into the design of our city as a core element rather than retrofitting security on top of something that is already insecure (the Internet). We also think a lot about asset obsolescence which means we really have to keep focused on two horizons - what we are doing today and what we need to be doing tomorrow.\nStephen Beatty: I'm not sure it's a risk, per se, but I do think that we're going to need to come to terms with the fact that we are going to see a general decline in personal privacy. And that means that we are going to start to see much more electronic surveillance and a much greater focus on security. The unfortunate reality is that the world is not going to get any safer over the coming years - if anything, the risk of people acting out and harming others will increase rather than decrease and that will require citizens, businesses and governments to think very differently about security and privacy.\nPeter Auhl: My advice is simple: focus on the customers. Governments have an ability to encourage massive changes that can have a very positive - or negative - impact on millions of people. The only way you are going to get it right is if you start focusing on customer outcomes and thinking about how governments serve our people and communities.\nStephen Beatty: I absolutely agree. And I think that city leaders have a great opportunity to study the experiences of other cities that are going through the same journey and find ways to share best practices, ideas and innovations. In part, that means better benchmarking and more rigorous measurement of efficiency and effectiveness. But it also means more dialogue, more collaboration and more cooperation between cities.\nSeok Tae Kim: Right. But I would also add that cities need to adapt their approach to the needs and characteristics of their region, culture and population. You can benchmark and compare yourself against other cities but, at the end of the day, you really need to serve your local population and that means understanding the particular characteristics of the city and population you intend to serve."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:1521548c-77c1-4633-8ce0-ebc07a152225>","<urn:uuid:edb5a62c-4946-4468-bf4b-648c490cd762>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the key differences between regular scuba diving entry methods and freediving techniques in terms of equipment and approach?","answer":"Scuba diving and freediving differ significantly in their equipment and approach. Scuba diving requires heavy equipment including tanks, BCD, and regulators, with specific entry methods like the back roll designed to manage this gear safely when entering water. In contrast, freediving relies on minimal equipment, typically just a wetsuit, fins, mask, snorkel, and weight belt, allowing for more streamlined movement. While scuba divers need to carefully manage their equipment during entry to prevent gear displacement or damage, freedivers focus more on breathing techniques and mental preparation for breath-hold diving. Additionally, scuba diving entries like the back roll are designed for boats and platforms, while freediving techniques emphasize efficiency in movement and breath control regardless of entry point.","context":["Ever wonder why sometimes scuba divers roll backward off of the side of a boat? Different entry methods can keep you safe when you enter the water in different conditions. While it might look strange to see a diver enter the water backward, sometimes it’s the best option.\nScuba divers enter the water backward to keep their body protected when hitting the water. Their equipment hits the surface first. It also keeps the tank and BCD from being pulled away from the diver’s body when hitting the water. Backwards entry is often used when stepping off the rear isn’t possible.\nEvery diving scenario is different, and some dives are better than others in certain circumstances. Read on for more on why divers enter the water backward and for more information on water entry methods.\nWhy Enter the Water Backward When Scuba Diving?\nThe oldest joke in diving goes like this:\nWhy do scuba divers dive backward in the water?\nBecause if they fell forwards, they would still be in the boat!\nThe real reasons why a diver enters the water backward:\n- It’s easier on the body than entering facing forward.\n- Also, while there are many different ways to enter the water, this dive, called the back roll, backward roll, or back entry, is recommended when you’re diving from a small boat as it keeps the boat more stable (KooXDiving).\n- The backward dive is particularly safe when you don’t have a steady platform to jump from because it doesn’t require balance.\n- Entering the water, even from close to the surface, can put a lot of strain on a diver when they’re geared up in heavy scuba equipment. The backward roll keeps your body from absorbing the shock of hitting the water.\n- The backward roll also allows divers to keep control of their equipment as they enter the water.\nAdvantages of the Back Roll\nThe back roll has its perks, besides it being safe, that make learning this move worth it. Here are some big advantages:\n- Staying seated lowers the platform or boat’s center of gravity, keeping it from rocking unnecessarily as you dive.\n- The back roll prevents a belly-flop situation as you enter the water, which can misplace your gear and fill your mask with water. A belly-flop might also painfully slap your mask against your face.\n- The back roll requires less movement, which isn’t the easiest thing when you’re wearing 30 pounds of scuba equipment.\n- Walking and entering the water in scuba gear is far harder than performing a backward roll.\n- The backward roll is easier than other techniques to learn.\nHow to Dive into the Water When Scuba Diving\nIn short, the diver performs the backward dive after being fully outfitted in her equipment. This move requires the diver to face the boat/platform with their back against the water, their chin tucked, and their legs together. The diver leans back and gently rolls into the water.\nDiving into the water when you’re scuba diving can be nerve-wracking, especially for beginners. The back roll technique, in particular, looks intimidating. It doesn’t help that it’s not very intuitive to let yourself fall backward. However, once you get used to the experience, it’ll be your preferred method of entry. Here’s a step-by-step explanation of this move:\n1. Safety First: Safety Before, During, and After the Back Roll\nSafety doesn’t just happen before a dive. Stay safe before, during, and after performing the backward roll by taking the proper measures. Here are a few things to remember:\nBefore the Back Roll\nMake sure you are certified to dive. All divers need to be certified or need to dive with a certified diver. If you don’t do this, you won’t be covered by travel insurance. So if you do happen to hurt yourself on the way down, it won’t be covered by your plan.\nMake sure you’re healthy enough to dive. Don’t dive if you’re not feeling great on that day or if you’ve come down with a cold or hangover.\nKnow who you’re diving with. Are you diving with trustworthy people? If you’re diving with a school, are they certified? If you’re feeling nervous about doing the back roll, having trustworthy, trained divers around you can put you at ease.\nCommunication is vital (read our guide) when diving. You should know how other divers plan on communicating with you above and under the surface. For instance, will a diver on the boat be waiting for a signal from you once you’re in the water? Do divers expect you to follow them below the surface? Know this before the dive.\nDouble-check that all your gear is ready for the dive. If you’re new to diving, make sure you ask any questions about your equipment before the dive.\nImmediately Following the Back Roll\nKnow your limits. If you feel disoriented immediately following the jump, or you do happen to make a mistake and hurt yourself, speak up. Take a few moments to collect yourself and proceed as you feel comfortable.\nIf you descend quickly from a negative dive, remember that you cannot ascend at the same rate. Ascending too quickly can cause decompression sickness (eMed), also known as “the bends.”\nRemember not to hold your breath once you’re submerged. Holding your breath during a dive can cause an embolism (DAN), which can be life-threatening. Breath throughout the dive.\nHours to Days After the Dive\nAfter the dive is fully completed, you still should be on the lookout for some things. Debrief with your fellow divers on how things went and what you could have done differently to make your experience better.\nRemember to properly put away your gear. Properly taking care of your gear can extend its lifespan. Also, remember that you’re dealing with pressurized tanks. Although they’re usually safe, you should still exercise precautions by properly handling them. Don’t leave it out for others to trip on.\nIf you aren’t feeling okay after a dive, let someone know. While it’s normal to feel “off” after a dive, if you have a headache, chest pain, belly pain, or tingling, don’t ignore it. Seek medical attention.\n“Don’t fly until at least 24 hours after a dive” (World Nomads). Because of the extra nitrogen in your system, you can develop decompression sickness from the plane depressurizing during a flight.\n2. Know Where to Back Roll\nThe back roll is best performed on a small boat or, more commonly, a rigid hull inflatable boat (normally called a RIB). A RIB is a high performance, durable, unsinkable, but a lightweight inflatable boat that divers often use. The back roll is the best way to enter on this device because of its size, weight, and soft walls (Scuba Diver Mag).\nWhen divers intend to back roll off a small boat or RIB, they should discuss a plan of how they want to enter the water before leaving shore to limit unnecessary movement or confusion once everyone is ready to dive.\nDivers should always communicate with people in their environment and be aware of their surroundings to stay safe and avoid mistakes. Know who is already in the water before you yourself dive.\n3. Performing the Back Roll Entry\nThis dive comes in handy when you don’t have a stable platform to dive from, and when you are close to the water surface. Say your jumping from a small boat or inflatable boat. To perform this entry:\n- Put on all scuba equipment on the boat itself.\n- Sit on the top edge of the boat with your tank behind you facing the water.\n- Turn around and check behind you to make sure your diving area is clear of people or objects.\n- Tuck your chin, hold on to your regulator and mask with one hand. Hold on to the back of your mask strap with the other.\n- Bring your legs together while they’re bent at the knees.\n- Lean back and fall into the water. Be gentle and let gravity do the work.\nBack Roll Diving Tips\nWhile the back roll is an easier dive to perform, it still might take you a couple tries to nail it. Below are some things to consider if you’re trying to master this entry method.\nQuestions to Ask Yourself Before the Back Roll\nAre you doing a positive or negative entry? A positive entry is when your BCD is filled while diving, so it brings you back to the surface while a negative entry is when your BCD is empty, allowing you to immediately descend (Dive Buddies).\nYou should go for the negative entry if you want to take advantage of a strong current and descend immediately after entering the water. If you’re diving in a group, keep at their pace throughout the dive, so you don’t lose them.\nAre you diving with others at the same time, or are you diving individually? If a group of divers finds a good current for diving, they might only have a few moments to enter using this current. If this is the case, rolling in a group all at once might be your best bet. Make sure everyone knows to wait for the proper signal before jumping so no one lands on each other.\nTips and Tricks to Nail the Backroll\nThere are a few tricks of the trade to mastering the backroll. Here are a few things to keep in mind about this technique if you want to become a master:\n- Know when it’s best to do a backroll. The backroll can be unsafe in certain conditions, like if you’re entering the water from a surface too far above the water.\n- Make sure your equipment is secure before diving.\n- Avoid hitting your head on the tank valve by tucking your chin in as you roll back.\n- Always swim away from the boat when doing a positive entry to make room for other divers.\n- When rolling, extend your legs, so they are straight to avoid hitting them on the side of the boat.\nBack Roll Mishaps\nSometimes mistakes happen. The most common reason for diving-related injuries is human error (Private Scuba). Protect yourself from common mistakes you can make doing the back roll by referring to these pointers:\n- Check that your air is on. You won’t be able to breathe or inflate your BCD once you’re submerged if you forget to do this. If this happens, grab your buddy quickly and have them open the valve. It happens to the best of us. 10 feet down in Cozumel and my newly certified 16 yr old had to open my valve. I was focused too much on him on the boat.\n- Let yourself fall back. Don’t push or throw yourself back; this can put your feet over your head and disorient you as you enter.\n- Once submerged, swim away from the boat to give other divers space.\n- Don’t forget to signal the captain that you’ve safely entered.\n- Take care not to hit your head on your tank as you fall.\n- Wear a dive float or flag to stay visible as you dive.\nWhen the Back Roll Isn’t an Option\nThere are many factors that determine what dive is going to be the best for your circumstances, like what surface you’re diving from and how much space you have to perform your entry.\nThe backward roll isn’t your only option, and it isn’t always the safest either. Picking the right dive for your situation protects you and your equipment from damage. You’re going to need to answer the following questions about your surroundings before you can figure out what dive is right for you:\n- How deep is the water? The backward roll should only be done in deeper water; otherwise, you can make contact with the bottom or reef.\n- How high are you from the surface of the water? The backward roll should only be done when you are closer to the surface of the water. Performing the backward roll from higher above the water increases the risk of hitting the side of your platform on the way down or over-rotating.\n- Are you on a stable platform? If you’re on a stable platform, other jumps might be easier for you to perform (Padi).\nDivers have other options for entering the water beside the backward roll. Below we will go over a few other methods of water entry, as well as when they should be performed, in more depth.\n1. Seated Entry\nThis dive is best when the water is too shallow to perform the giant stride entry or the back roll. It’s also good if you don’t have a steady platform, or your boat is too close to the surface of the water. This method is the best option for old or disabled divers (OK Divers Bali). To perform this entry:\n- Put on all scuba equipment on the boat itself.\n- Sit on the edge of the platform with your feet hanging over the edge.\n- Gently push yourself up and away from the platform using your hands and slowly lower yourself into the water.\nNote: Make sure not to hit yourself or your tank against the side of the boat when entering.\n2. Giant Stride Entry\nThis entry is best when you have a stable platform and are too high to perform a back roll. To perform this entry:\n- Put on all scuba gear on the boat itself.\n- To avoid making a negative descent, inflate your buoyancy compensator (also known as a BCD).\n- Stand on the edge of the diving platform so that only the balls of your feet are on it.\n- Look forward, hold your mask and regulator in hand and take a big step forward.\n- Once submerged, push yourself back to the surface by quickly bringing your legs back together. Signal to the boat that your entry was successful.\n3. Shore Entry\nShore entry is the trickiest dive. It’s usually performed as a last resort. While shore entry is essentially walking into the ocean, it actually takes a bit of skill to master with your heavy scuba gear. To perform this entry:\n- Walk backward slowly to enter the water. To avoid falling forward, make sure your tank is facing the water.\n- Inflate your BCD.\n- Once you are deep enough, submerge yourself fully into the water.\n*Note: This entry is different depending on the shore. For a beach/surf shore, enter the water with your fins and regulator mask on.\nFor a rocky shore, enter the water without your fins on. Have a friend help you put your fins on after you inflate your BCD; this is because your fins can become damaged from hitting the rocks.\nWith a rocky shore entry, you’ll need to keep your hands free to steady yourself, so for this scenario, avoid carrying extra scuba equipment or accessories like cameras or lights/torches (Leisure Pro).\nSee the Dives in Action\nWant to see the back roll entry perfected by a real person? Here is a video showing how to do the back roll step by step.\nWhile the backward dive seems scary and complex, you’re actually choosing one of the safest and easiest dive methods when you make this move. If you go for the backward dive, be prepared, be safe, relax, and have fun!\nArticles contain affiliate links to Amazon. As an Amazon Associate we earn from qualifying purchases.

{"question":"How do the Greek and Hebrew alphabets compare in terms of their historical development and influence on modern writing systems?","answer":"The Greek and Hebrew alphabets had different but significant evolutionary paths. The Early Hebrew alphabet acquired its distinctive character by the 11th century BCE and was used officially until the 6th century BCE. The modern Hebrew alphabet is considered a continuation of the original alphabet created over 3,500 years ago. The Greek alphabet, emerging around 800 BCE, marked a revolutionary development by being the first to include vowels as individual letters. While the Hebrew alphabet mainly influenced Semitic branches, the Greek alphabet had broader influence, becoming the progenitor of Western alphabets, including the Cyrillic and Latin alphabets. The Greek alphabet's importance in shaping modern writing systems was immense, though its current use is primarily limited to Modern Greek and mathematical symbols.","context":["Cendrillon Bodin November 29, 2019 Alphabet\nIt can, however, be ascertained that the period from 1730 to 1580 bce in Syria, Palestine, and Egypt, during which there was an uprooting of established cultural and ethnic patterns in the Fertile Crescent, provided conditions favorable to the conception of an alphabetic script, a kind of writing that would be more accessible to larger groups of people, in contrast to the scripts of the old states of Mesopotamia and Egypt, which were confined largely to the priestly class.\nset of graphs, or characters, used to represent the phonemic structure of a language. In most alphabets the characters are arranged in a definite order, or sequence (e.g., A, B, C, etc.).\nThe term Early Hebrew is used to distinguish this branch from the later so-called Square Hebrew. The Early Hebrew alphabet had already begun to acquire its distinctive character by the 11th century bce. It was used officially until the 6th century bce and lingered on for several centuries more. In a stylized form it was used on Jewish coins from 135 bce to 132–135 ce.\nWhen an alphabet is adopted or developed to represent a given language, an orthography generally comes into being, providing rules for the spelling of words in that language. In accordance with the principle on which alphabets are based, these rules will generally map letters of the alphabet to the phonemes (significant sounds) of the spoken language. In a perfectly phonemic orthography there would be a consistent one-to-one correspondence between the letters and the phonemes, so that a writer could predict the spelling of a word given its pronunciation, and a speaker would always know the pronunciation of a word given its spelling, and vice versa. However this ideal is not usually achieved in practice; some languages (such as Spanish and Finnish) come close to it, while others (such as English) deviate from it to a much larger degree.\nIf the signs’ external form (which, it must be emphasized, had no particular significance) is ignored and only their phonetic value, number, and order are considered, the modern Hebrew alphabet may be regarded as a continuation of the original alphabet created more than 3,500 years ago. The Hebrew order of the letters seems to be the oldest. The earliest evidence that the Hebrew alphabet was learned systematically was left in the form of a schoolboy’s scribbling on the vertical face of the upper step of a staircase leading up to the palace at Tel Lakhish, in southern Israel.\nTo the west, seeds were sown among the peoples who later constituted the nation of Hellas—the Greeks. As a result, an alphabet developed with four main branches: the so-called Canaanite, or main branch, subdivided into Early Hebrew and Phoenician varieties;the Aramaic branch the South Semitic, or Sabaean, branch; and the Greek alphabet, which became the progenitor of the Western alphabets, including the Etruscan and the Latin. The Canaanite and Aramaic branches constitute the North Semitic main branch.\nTag Cloudskeleton coloring pages color by number coloring pages lol doll colouring pages lol coloring sheets anime coloring disney halloween coloring pages duck coloring pages buzz lightyear coloring page powerpuff girls coloring pages octonauts coloring pages elf coloring pages my hero academia coloring pages coco coloring pages sofia the first coloring pages pumpkin coloring sheet unicorn coloring pages for kids rainbow dash coloring pages miraculous ladybug coloring pages aesthetic coloring pages scary halloween coloring pages octopus coloring page autumn coloring pages free printable christmas coloring pages sesame street coloring pages peacock coloring pages camping coloring pages sailor moon coloring pages cactus coloring page motorcycle coloring pages school coloring pages family coloring pages beanie boo coloring pages candy coloring pages wedding coloring pages sports coloring pages santa claus coloring pages halloween color by number sloth coloring page bubble guppies coloring pages flower coloring sheets pokemon coloring book flamingo coloring pages cute coloring pictures farm animal coloring pages","Top 10 Most Influential Writing Systems\nIn scholastic philosophy, writing is known as a sign – it is a sign of another sign (the spoken tongue) and it was created because man lived in communities and needed a means to provide knowledge to people far away (in distance and in time). Plotting the evolution of writing is fascinating and curiously virtually all lead back to one all-encompassing alphabet – as you will find out by reading this list!\nBraille stands out as being the only tactile writing system on this list. It was invented in 1821 by a blind Frenchman, Louis Braille, who was inspired by the “night writing” code of embossed dots used by the French military. Up to that point he had been able to read books with raised letters, but this was largely impractical, especially when it came to writing. Clearly a better system was needed, but as he found night writing to be too complicated (it could take as many as 12 dots to represent one letter) Braille invented his own system using a mere six dots. It never gained much popularity during his lifetime, but since his death Braille’s system has transformed written communication for the blind and visually impaired. Today it has been adapted to a vast number of languages around the world.\nIn the 9th century AD the Greek brothers Saint Methodius and Saint Cyril invented two alphabets, Glagolitic and Cyrillic, as a writing system for the Old Church Slavonic language. Cyrillic, based on the Glagolitic and Greek alphabets, ultimately became the preferred system for writing the Slavic languages. It is today used to write many of the Slavic languages (most notably Russian, Bulgarian, Belarusian, Ukrainian, and Serbian) as well as a number of non-Slavic languages who fell under the influence of the Soviet Union. Throughout its history, Cyrillic has been adapted to write over 50 languages.\nCuneiform’s significance comes from the fact that it’s the earliest known writing system in the world. It first appeared in the 34th century BC amongst the Sumerians, located in what is today southern Iraq. It was adapted to write a number of languages (including Akkadian, Hittite, and Hurrian), and further served as an inspiration for the Ugaritic and Old Persian alphabets. For over 3,000 years these scripts had a massive influence in the Near East, but cuneiform was gradually replaced by the Aramaic alphabet until it was extinct by 100 AD.\nEgyptian hieroglyphs are generally believed to have come into existence shortly after Sumerian cuneiform, around 3200 BC. Alongside the well-known hieroglyphs, there existed two other Ancient Egyptian scripts: Hieratic (used mainly for religious purposes) and Demotic (for most other purposes). Outside of their significance as the writing systems for a massively important civilization for thousands of years, Ancient Egyptian’s most lasting influence was that it served as the inspiration for the first alphabet.\nChinese script, aside from its immense number of users, is noteworthy for being one of the world’s oldest continuously used writing systems, having been in use from the 2nd millennium BC up to the present day. The characters were originally pictographs (each one bore a resemblance to its meaning) and represented one monosyllabic word. Chinese characters were adapted to write other languages due to the enormous influence China had in East Asia, such as Korean and Japanese (based on the characters’ meanings) as well as Vietnamese (based on either sound or meaning). Korean and Vietnamese have since replaced Chinese with other writing systems, but the characters still exist as a component of written Japanese, kanji. In the 20th century Chinese branched into two basic forms, traditional and simplified, after the Chinese government simplified many of the characters to promote literacy.\nThe numerous writing systems used in South Asia today can be traced back to the Brahmi script. This abiguda (a writing system in which the letters are all consonants and vowels are written as obligatory diacritics) emerged in the 5th century BC and was used to write Prakrit and Sanskrit. Over the next thousand years or so, Brahmi developed into dozens of regional scripts, which came to be associated with the languages of their respective region. These descendants could broadly be classified as Northern and Southern, and with the expansion of Hinduism and Buddhism, the Southern group spread to Southeast Asia while the Northern scripts spread to Tibet. Today, the Brahmic scripts are used throughout much of Asia (most notably India), and are also used for religious purposes in areas with large Buddhist populations.\nDue to the large number of Arabic speakers and the extensive influence of Islam, the Arabic alphabet is the second-most widely used alphabet in the world, found mostly in Northern Africa and Western and Central Asia. More technically, it is an abjad, a writing system in which the letters are all consonants (Arabic script does, however, have optional vowel diacritics). The alphabet arose around 400 AD (about 200 years before Islam), but the rise of Islam and the writing of the Qur’an brought about significant changes for the writing system, such as the vowel diacritics. The strong association with religion is further evident in the widespread adoption of the Arabic alphabet by non-Arabic speaking Islamic populations, including Farsi, Urdu, Punjabi, Pashto, and Kurdish speakers, along with dozens more in the past and present.\nThe Greek alphabet marked a huge leap in the development of alphabets, especially since it was the first to include vowels as individual letters. It has existed from 800 BC through to the present day, and over its long history has been used to write Hebrew, Arabic, Turkish, Gaulish, and Albanian, among other languages. Written Greek had previously been attempted in Mycenaean Greece, but the alphabet as we know it was the first successful attempt, which was created right before the rise of Ancient Greece. Besides its obvious significance concerning the literature and records of Ancient Greece, its influence on other writing systems has been immense, most notably because it is the origin of the Cyrillic and Latin alphabets. The alphabet’s importance has since diminished—its primary functions are now the writing system for Modern Greek and mathematical symbols—but if it were not for the Greek alphabet, much of the world’s writing would bear little resemblance to what it is today.\nThe Latin alphabet is on this list for obvious reasons. Besides being the alphabet of the global lingua franca, English, it is also the most widely used alphabet in existence. Derived from a variant of the Greek alphabet around 700 BC, it rapidly spread first throughout Europe, and then throughout the world. It followed with the expansion of the Roman Empire to Western Europe, and then to Central and Northern Europe with the spread of Christianity in the Middle Ages. Some Slavic languages also began to use the alphabet as the speakers converted to Catholicism. European colonization then brought the Latin alphabet to the Americas, Africa, Oceania, and Asia along with the languages of the colonizers. It became widely adopted and adapted, both among languages using other writing systems and languages that had previously had none.\nProto-Sinaitic script was the first alphabet, and therefore the parent of nearly all the alphabetic writing systems to have existed since its emergence. It arose in Egypt and Sinai around 1900 BC and, as previously mentioned, was inspired by Egyptian hieroglyphs. The influence it’s had is incredible: everything from Hebrew, to runes, the Latin alphabet, Cherokee syllabary, and Ethiopic can trace their origins to this alphabet. Phoenician script is a direct descendant of Proto-Sinaitic and differs little from it, but, spread by Phoenician merchants throughout the Mediterranean, it became a very widely used alphabet for a number of languages. Because of this, Phoenician branches off into many of the major families of writing systems."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:768b1b85-5ac3-49e8-afa9-f4c65d56ac52>","<urn:uuid:9ce6ae33-8448-4abf-b170-baa9edc96593>"],"error":null}
{"question":"For my endangered species research, how do conservation approaches differ between the orange-bellied parrot and the scimitar-horned oryx?","answer":"The orange-bellied parrot and scimitar-horned oryx represent contrasting conservation outcomes. The orange-bellied parrot, with fewer than 50 remaining, has required millions in funding over 30 years, with most 2011 offspring taken into captivity as insurance against wild population loss. Despite the expenses and intensive efforts, the population has not increased significantly, though maintaining the species is considered an achievement. The scimitar-horned oryx, on the other hand, shows a more successful captive breeding program. After being listed as endangered in the 1960s-70s, oryx were transported to zoos worldwide, where careful breeding maintained genetic diversity through artificial insemination. When released to a large reserve in Tunisia in 1985, the population grew from 10 to over 120 by 2000, demonstrating a more positive conservation outcome.","context":["Given we live in a rich, comfortable country, the only reason we cannot hand over the extraordinary array of life we have inherited to future generations is a lack of commitment, writes Stephen Garnett.\nFor more than 30 years Australian taxpayer funds have been spent trying to prevent the extinction of a small green parrot with orange on its belly that nests only in remote southwest Tasmania.\nFewer than 50 now remain. So dire was their situation that most offspring bred in 2011 were deliberately taken into captivity as insurance against complete loss of the wild population.\nSuch conservation is expensive, especially when it involves captive populations. Over the years millions of dollars have been spent on the orange-bellied parrot. Not only that, but fears for the parrot's welfare have delayed or prevented development worth tens of millions of dollars.\nCan such expense be justified? Some people have suggested that we should give up on the parrot and spend the money on less expensive species with a better chance of long-term success.\nThey are two quite separate issues. The first concerns whether we should conserve species at all, and is essentially political. Through the Earth's history many species have become extinct just as others have evolved. Thus species have no intrinsic value - their value has been created by humans - so biodiversity conservation is as much subject to democratic processes as conservation of, say, great art.\nWhile one can mount utilitarian arguments for keeping species - biodiverse landscapes do provide more services than depleted ones - I believe most people don't want species extinction because of an emotional response to losing something irreplaceable.\nPersonally I think the extent to which we conserve species says a great deal about who we are as a civilised society.\nMany societies over the millennia have, usually without knowing it, caused extinction. Also many people around the world today are too impoverished to think beyond their personal needs, though the depth of commitment to retaining special species shown by some of the poorest people is astonishing.\nHere in Australia we have stable government, well-enforced laws and the highest median income in the world. The only reason that we cannot hand over the extraordinary array of life we have inherited to future generations is a lack of commitment.\nThus the first question should be turned on its head. Instead of asking whether the expense can be justified, we should be asking whether extinction can be contemplated at all. So much of what we create in our society is ephemeral. Through the amazing process of reproduction, which we tend to take for granted, species have the potential to be with us indefinitely. If we allow them.\nThe second question about spending limited funds elsewhere is far harder. There can be no argument that we should try to spend conservation money as efficiently as possible. And this can best be achieved through systematic conservation planning rather than the ad hoc system we have adopted traditionally, and which has meant much money has been spent on species that are not really threatened at all.\nAt its simplest, systematic conservation planning involves estimating the cost of retaining each threatened species and spreading the available money across as many species as possible. At the end of the list will be species that are too expensive to retain.\nHowever, society does not value all species equally. To allow for this, priorities can be weighted to give preference to species that are more distinctive, more threatened, more readily conserved or more charismatic. In addition, species to which society has shown a sustained commitment over many years can be insulated from the prioritisation process and funded from a separate allocation.\nOf course adopting such a system has many uncertainties. If you take funds from existing programs, there is no guarantee they will be spent on other threatened species - look how readily the biodiversity fund was cut last year.\nAlso it assumes that only government will pay. Many threatened species programs around the world are funded by private organisations. There is great potential for public-private partnerships in threatened species management that could extend the public allocation.\nVolunteers also play a major role - certainly the many thousands of hours volunteers have spent surveying orange-bellied parrots over the years in wintery saltmarsh is testament to the value some people place on the bird.\nAnd it is this level of commitment that I think help justify the orange-bellied parrot as a special case. Some think a failure to increase the population over 30 years as a failure. I think retaining the species at all is a major achievement. And it is a species that retains the potential to increase if only we can identify and alleviate the greatest constraints - with the adverse effects of fire and food availability during the breeding season now seen as having far more significance than previously realised.\nIf we consciously decide to abandon this most critically endangered of Australian parrots, we are deliberately deciding to pass on a diminished world to our children.\nThis article was originally published by ABC Environment.

However, it is resistance to a large number of strains of bacterial blight. It has successfully been interbred with cultivated rice to give varieties of rice that are resistant to the disease\n17 Do Now 2.251.) List the main differences between a prokaryotic cell and a eukaryotic cell. Which kingdoms are prokaryotic? Eukaryotic?2.) Which kingdoms contain heterotrophic organisms?\n18 Endangered speciesThe International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) annually publishes a Red List of threatened species2011 list contained 16,119 speciesSpecies in the Red List are all under threat of extinction- disappearing forever from the Earth.\n19 Endangered speciesMass extinction events in which millions of species become extinct at once have occurred several time throughout Earth’s history, but all have been due to natural events caused by sudden and huge changes in the environmentEx: asteroid colliding with planet\n20 Endangered speciesCurrently facing likelihood of another mass extinction event due to habitat lossEx: draining wetlands, deforestation, slash and burn agriculture, and pollution of air and waterAlso, some species are becoming extinct due to over harvesting (hunting, fishing, etc…)\n21 Endangered speciesHigh profile animals on the Red List: pandas, tigers rhinosEx: World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) based 2011 Holiday advertisement around its Adopt-A-Tiger campaignLess inclusion of invertebrates, protists\n22 Endangered species2011 estimates suggest that the global population of all tiger species is about 5000.In India, the pressure on the remaining tiger population is intense due to a rapidly expanding populationIn China, tiger products are valued as a cure to a variety of illness, so organized poaching is common\n23 SAQ 21.5Suggest why the Red List contains more vertebrates than invertebrates.\n24 SAQ 21.5Suggest why the Red List contains more vertebrates than invertebrates.One possibility is that people are much more aware of vertebrates than invertebrates, so we know more about them. They are larger and more visible than invertebrates. Many people find them more interesting than invertebrates.\n25 Endangered species2011: western black rhino of Africa declared extinct by IUCNNorthern white rhino declared “probably extinct in the wild”It is thought that the last Javan rhino in Vietnam was killed by poachers in 2010Only the African southern white rhino is flourishing, up from only 100 individuals in start of 20th century\n26 Endangered speciesRhino extinctions, despite years of conservation efforts, continue because of:A lack of political support for conservationAn increasingly high demand for rhino hornInternationally organized criminal groups targeting rhinos\n27 Endangered speciesIn order to compile its Red List, IUCN must complete a new census of each speciesPopulation numbers are estimated using visual sightings, paw marks, bite marks, droppings, and DNA analysis of droppings\n28 Rescuing endangered species Scimitar-horned oryx lives in semi-deserts in northern AfricaHas always been hunted for its meat and skin, but hunting grew exponentially starting in 1950sListed as endangered in 1960s and 70sA few oryx were caught and transported to zoos throughout the world\n29 Rescuing endangered species Captive breeding program began with captured oryxCare was taken to maintain as much genetic diversity in captive population as possible, so oryx from several different zoos were mated using artificial insemination\n30 Rescuing endangered species While captive breeding was taking place, attempts were being made to provide safe habitats for the oryx, so they could be returned to the wildLarge reserved set up in Tunisia1985: 10 oryx released to reserve2000: population has grown to over 120\n31 Rescuing endangered species While the oryx program has been a success, some animals simple refuse to breed in captivityOften, it is not possible to create suitable habitats for them, so they cannot be returned to the wildEx: captive breeding program for Pandas. Since 1963, 300 pandas have been returned to the wild but no panda has been successfully returned to the wild\n32 SAQ 21.6Suggest why some animals cannot be bred in captivity\n33 SAQ 21.6 Suggest why some animals cannot be bred in captivity They may need particular factors in their environment before their reproductive systems become able to produce sperm or eggs – for example, to have plenty of space, or to have many others of their species around them. These factors affect their physiology and their behaviour. Courtship may be difficult in the conditions in which they live. They may need particular changes in day length or in food supply to trigger hormonal changes associated with reproduction.\n34 Rescuing endangered species When animals in captivity refuse to breed, various techniques as well as artificial insemination can be used:Eggs can be collected from fertile females and fertilized by in-vitro fertilizationIn some species, another female of a closely related species can act as a surrogateIt is sometime possible to split early embryos, essentially cloning them\n35 Rescuing endangered species In many species, sperm, eggs, and embryos can be stored frozen for later useSuch banks of frozen gametes and embryos from endangered species are called “frozen zoos”\n36 Protection of endangered species Zoos and botanic garden help lead to public awareness and support for endangered animals and plantsMillennium Seed Bank: bank’s ambition is to collected and store seeds from at least 25% of the world’s plants so that if they become extinct in the wild, they can still be grown from seeds\n37 Protection of endangered species 2007: beginning of Svalbard Global Seed Vault.Storage conditions ideal for long term preservation of seedsOpened only during winter monthsBy Jan 2008 vault held over 500,000 different crop varietiesTo maintain viability of seeds, every 5 years seeds are germinated and new seeds are harvested from resulting plants\n38 Protection of endangered species To maintain genetic diversity, multiple seeds of the same species are storedEvery time a stored seed is germinated, it is cross pollinated to maintain genetic diversity\n39 Protection of endangered species In order to safely store seeds, they must be dehydrated to contain only about 5% waterSome seeds, like rubber, coconut palm, and coffee cannot be dried and frozenThese seeds are referred to as recalcitrant seedsOnly ways to keep the genetic diversity of these species are to collect seeds and grow successive generations or to keep them as tissue culture\n40 Protection of endangered species Coconut palm are particularly difficult seeds to bankThe seed (coconut) is very large and embryo is too large to freeze successfullyCollectors remove the embryos from the seeds, culture them in sterile tubes, and eventually plant them\n41 SAQ 21.7It has been suggested that seed banks put selection pressure on the seeds that are different from those that plants would experience in the wild.How might these selection pressures differ?How might this affect the chances of success in returning the plants to the wild?\n42 SAQ 21.7a Selection pressures in the natural habitat might include the ability of the adult plants to survive grazing, wide variations in rainfall or competition with other species. In the seed bank, none of these selection pressures would apply. In the seed bank, the greatest selection pressure will become the ability of the seeds to survive the conditions in which they are stored for a long period of time.b It is possible that the plants that grow from the seeds that have been saved will not have characteristics that will allow them to survive the selection pressures they will encounter in their natural habitat. This could reduce the chances of success in returning them to the wild.\n43 Protection of endangered species Most countries now set aside areas where wildlife and the environment can live protected in the wild where human activities are limitedEx: conservation areas may be set up where there are strict limits on building, grazing farm animals, hunting, or other activities that would adversely affect native species\n44 Protection of endangered species National parks are areas of land that are controlled by the government and are often protected by legislationThere are heavy restrictions on human activities in these parks, and tourism brings in money to pay for their maintenance\n45 Protection of endangered species World’s first national park: Yellowstone National Park, set up in 1872Last remaining nearly intact ecosystem of the northern temperate climatic zoneServes as both a recreation and a conservation zone"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"sensitive"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:6adb8862-79c4-4106-83f5-7341ce8ecbe6>","<urn:uuid:e9666797-ba15-4e87-9be3-d1517c682dd1>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do risk registers and business continuity plans compare in terms of their core purposes for helping companies deal with threats?","answer":"Risk registers and business continuity plans serve complementary but distinct purposes in managing company threats. A risk register's core purpose is to maintain a record of all identified risks, including their descriptions and impact on the company, along with specific treatment plans and controls. It focuses on comprehensive documentation of various risk types (strategic, operational, reputation, etc.) and their ongoing management. In contrast, business continuity planning (BCP) focuses specifically on creating a system of prevention and recovery from potential threats, ensuring that personnel and assets can function quickly during disasters. BCP is more action-oriented, involving steps like establishing desired results, forming taskforces, and creating specific response plans for crisis situations.","context":["The Risk Register\nWhat is a Risk Register?\nEvery company must manage its risks and the best place to record those risks is the risk register. The Risk Identification represents an integral part of the overall risk management process. After all the risks have been identified, they must be assessed and then properly treated. All the risks in the company must be properly registered. The purpose of maintaining a risk register is keeping a record of all the identified risks, including their descriptions and impact on the company. The risk register is an important tool of risk management.\nWhat does the Risk Register Include?\nThere are various templates and types of risk registers, but all of them must cover as much information about the risks involved as possible. The minimum information the risk register must include is as follows:\n- list of assets subject to the risk,\n- the type of risk and a risk owner,\n- the level of all identified risks,\n- risk treatment decision – reduce, accept, avoid, share\n- the risk treatment plan,\n- controls used for risk treatment and their link to the identified risks\n- Status of the risk treatment.\nThe input for the list of assets subject to the risk is the inventory of assets, including the information assets. The list of assets is filled during the asset identification during a risk assessment process. It could be that not all assets would be considered during the risk assessment process.\nThe typical types of risks are strategic, operational, reputation, security, credit, market, liquidity, etc, depending on the type and mission of the organization.\nThe risk treatment process contains the following options:\n- Reducing the risk\n- Accepting the risk\n- Avoiding the risk\n- Sharing the risk\nThe decisions on risk treatment are made at different levels of management, depending on the level of risk and as per company risk management policy. In making a decision on risk treatment the management must develop a plan of appropriate actions and implementation of controls. Implemented controls must be registered in the risk register and their effectiveness must be evaluated at planned intervals. One could use maturity scales or effectiveness scales to assess the implemented controls. The status of the risk treatment shows the level of residual risk after implementation of necessary controls.\nAdditional Risk Register Items\nOf course the companies’ risk registers are not limited to the above mentioned information. It can additionally include:\n- The date of identification – date when the risk was identified\n- Risk description – description of vulnerabilities, the threats that can occur\n- Overall risk score – Overall degree of the risk\n- Target risk level – the level of risk which is considered as acceptable\n- Target risk level date – the date when the target risk level will be achieved\n- Mitigating actions – a description of actions that will be taken to reduce the likelihood or impact of a risk should it occur\n- Action owner – the individual responsible for carrying out a mitigating action\n- Action cost – the cost of actions and the comparison with the costs incurred as a result of risk occurrence\n- Action status – complete, in progress, ongoing, not yet due, overdue\n- Action target complition date – the date by which mitigating actions will be completed\nThe risk register must be monitored at planned intervals and always be under the control of company’s top management. Companies can have one risk register for all processes or departments or separate registers for every process or department to pay greater attention to the risks while monitoring their status.","Business continuity planning is what companies reach for during hard times like the coronavirus crisis that is now troubling the world.\nA company who needs to transfer its workforce to the home environment, for example, must implement such a plan. As the name suggests, this is when a business determines how it will continue in times of crisis, and formulates a plan to do so.\nBusiness continuity planning definition\nAccording to Investopedia, business continuity planning (BCP) is the process involved in “creating a system of prevention and recovery from potential threats to a company. The plan ensures that personnel and assets are protected and are able to function quickly in the event of a disaster.”\nWe will explore this concept further in this article.\nBusiness continuity planning during COVID-19\nDuring the current coronavirus affair, companies are laying off personnel and sending the remaining workforce to work remotely from home. As a result, business continuity planning has taken on new significance.\nSmall companies and organisations that believed BCP to be something unlikely ever to be needed have been proven wrong, as business operations all around the world are affected.\nCompanies need a plan that will protect their resources and workforce in order to compete. Such a plan will help the company to function coherently and keep the workforce on track with the vision.\nAny company that is caught off guard without a contingency plan during these hard times will go out of business in no time.\nThe process of business continuity planning allows the company to anticipate unforeseen negative circumstances before they happen. This allows them to determine what they must do during such times to keep on operating.\nHow to conduct business continuity planning in 6 steps\n1. Establish the desired end results\nStep one is to determine what the main objectives and goals of the plan need to be in order to keep the company running. There may be different levels of crisis the plan can cover. Which departments are critical in these imagined circumstances?\nYou’ll need to set the goals and then measure the milestones along the way to achieving those goals.\nYou will also need to decide how much to invest in the plan. Be sure to include research hours and training sessions for the implementation of the plan.\n2. Form a business continuity taskforce\nThe company must pick team members to be responsible for implementing the plan. The team can be divided into Command and Control Teams vs Task-Oriented Teams to ensure leadership and production are both taken care of.\n3. Perform a Business Impact Analysis\nThis looks at the impact that the plan could potentially have on each aspect of the business.\nIt’s a good idea to create a business analysis template that considers all the effects of the plan. The company must then run the template through an actual impact process and determine if there are any loopholes in the process.\nTake these learning experiences and polish the plan so all the kinks are worked out before you need to execute it in reality.\n4. Identify weak points and dependencies\nThe company needs to identify all the areas of the business where any period of downtime will most harm operations. Rate which parts of the company are weakest, then set aside resources to support the losses in these departments.\n5. Create skeleton plan of action\nThis will include three parts: prevention, response and recovery. There must be a list of actions to take in the event of an emergency.\nPrevention is what your organization needs to do now, before the crisis occurs. Response is what you do when the disaster takes place. Recovery outlines the actions the business must take in order to move forward from the initial event.\n6. Testing and training\nThe company must establish a training plan for the team to ensure that, in an emergency, everyone knows exactly how to respond according to the BCP.\nIt would be wise for the company to stage a mock event scenario to see how well the business continuity planning is implemented. Any stress in the process can be repaired and the system fixed, so it flows properly when a real event occurs.\nBusiness continuity planning and technology\nCompanies today have had to make adjustments to their entire operating processes. The majority have had to send workers home and establish work-at-home workforces.\nIn times such as these, the Chief Information Officer must select digital tools and software to enable the at-home remote workforce. Processes for internal meetings, evaluations, plus customer and client interactions must all be reconsidered.\nA key consideration is that the workforce may not be tech-savvy. Yet, now they are required to work from home. The quicker organizations can upskill employees and get them tuned into new digital processes, the more likely they are to survive.\nCompanies have had to switch almost overnight from a traditional workforce to a remote workforce and at a worldwide level because of the coronavirus event.

{"question":"How do the data analysis approaches differ between genomic sequencing of Sporobolus nealleyi and the genome-wide visualization features in ZBrowse?","answer":"The genomic analysis of Sporobolus nealleyi relies on basic DNA sequencing using Illumina platforms to generate an initial draft genome, followed by comparative analysis against other Poaceae crops to identify unique genes. In contrast, ZBrowse offers more sophisticated visualization capabilities, including interactive Manhattan plots that allow users to analyze up to 5,000 significant SNPs, zoom between different genomic scales, and directly compare multiple traits and experiments simultaneously. While S. nealleyi analysis focuses on gene presence/absence comparisons, ZBrowse provides dynamic tools for exploring GWAS results through features like interactive tooltips, annotation tracks, and the ability to examine specific chromosomal regions in detail.","context":["About This Project\nDrought threatens sustainability of agriculture throughout the world. A US native gypsum-endemic grass, Sporobolus nealleyi may harbor the unique ability to extract water during drought from gypsum rock. Though genetically similar to crops such as rice, wheat and corn, the mechanisms responsible for this behavior in S. neallyi is unknown. A genome sequence can enable initial research to identify these mechanisms to leverage in development of improved drought-tolerance in such grain crops.\nAsk the ScientistsJoin The Discussion\nWhat is the context of this research?\nDrought severity and frequency are increasing throughout the world. This threatens our food supply. For example, up to 99% of some US-consumed crops may be grown in 1 of 2 drought-stricken valleys in California. As drought has persisted, the priorities of crop improvement have evolved. New tools are needed to enable crops' long-term drought tolerance while preserving scarce water resources.\nFortunately, scientists can turn to nature for examples of the biology we seek to impart in crops. The US-native Sporobolus nealleyi is a unique grass endemic to gypsum-soils. Another gypsum-edemic plant was found to extract tightly bound water from gypsum rock in Spain. Could this grass share that ability? Can we utilize the genes that control this in cereal crops? These questions need to be answered.\nWhat is the significance of this project?\nToday's agricultural practices in drought-stricken areas are untenable. As part of a new Green Revolution, future crops must retain their yields using less water and fertilizer. Sporobolus study allow for new tools to be adopted in these crops. These grasses thrive in some of America's harshest habitats. They provide opportunity for improvement of the world's dominant grain crops not only in drought-stricken regions of production in America, but throughout the world. Current crops require farmers to utilize water resources that are no longer available during a drought. We can utilize the genes from grasses that thrive in the dry habitats to re-engineer today's crops to survive during periods of drought. Results of this work can be utilized by future researchers to enable this goal.\nWhat are the goals of the project?\nThe request funds will be used to purchase 2-3 lanes of genome sequencing using the Illumina HiSeq-X or Hi-Seq2500 platforms.\nSpecifically, I will submit high molecular weight DNA from sampled leaf tissues of S. nealleyi collected from a gypsum-laden site in the deserts of New Mexico. This will enable generation of sufficient sequence data to assemble an draft genome in S. nealleyi, the first of its kind.l Once this is in place, I aim to identify genetic differences between S. nealleyi, and common Poaceae crops such as wheat and corn. I will host all generated data (the raw reads and the genome assembly) via the web for collaboration with other researchers and public in general. Finally, I aim to publish this data to establish this foundational knowledge for the scientific community.\nAlong with existing collaboration from Dr. Vince Buonaccorsi and Amit Dhingra, I can utilize the $2000 targeted for this project to acquire enough sequencing data for generation of an initial genome sequence. This small investment can enable significant gains through computational analysis.\nGene analysis: The presence and absence of genes and larger gene families will be identified in this initial genome and compared against publicly available genomes in wheat, corn and other Poaceae genomes. From this, researchers can begin to hone in on uniquely present or absent genes in the S. nealleyi genome. These can serve as candidate genes whose function may be responsible for the unique behavior in S. nealleyi. Breeders can also use identified differences as markers which may correlate to gypsum-endemism or drought tolerance.\nI will utilize the requested funds to acquire as much sequencing data as possible, shouldering other costs through existing funds.\nMeet the Team\nI am a Biology professor at National University in California. I received my Ph.D. in Horticulture from the genomics and biotechnology program of Dr. Amit Dhingra at Washington State University. I aim to apply this training toward crop improvement and addressing food security in the face of climate change. Plant extremophiles provide opportunities to leverage genomics in addressing these objectives. I aim to utilize extremophilic plants to improve major grain crops of the world.\nTake a moment to consider the remarkable diversity of habitats the Earth contains. Baking heat. Extreme cold. Swamps. Deserts. Places awash, and seemingly devoid of water. Places right next to geothermal vents, spewing noxious gases and superheated water. Places humanity has struggled to colonize. And yet, plants have evolved the mechanisms needed to colonize and thrive in each and every such habitat all around the globe.\nMy research aims to identify and leverage these mechanisms in plants adapted to these extreme environments toward improvement of crops. Instead of spending countless years developing crops capable of squeezing another 2% of yield under optimal soil fertility and irrigation, I advocate development of crops which can instead enable reclamation of 2% more arable land. Any yield from such plants could enable more production, with less consumption of valuable natural resources.\nLong-term sustainability of global agriculture is threatened by climate change. Drought, heat and salt stresses will inevitably reduce yields. Fortunately, we need only look to species which have already evolved the tools to cope with the stresses of climate change. Such desert-dwelling species harbor powerful mechanisms which can provide the foundational knowledge needed for crop improvement, and enable long-term sustainability of global agriculture.\n- $1,224Total Donations\n- $68.00Average Donation","The recent development of high-throughput phenotyping techniques coupled with the ability to genotype large populations of diverse individuals has revolutionized the way that forward genetics research is performed. Tools have rapidly become available to perform genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in a variety of species (Kang et al., 2010; Segura et al., 2012; Lipka et al., 2012) that can map traits to the genome with high enough resolution to quickly provide a tractable list of potential causal genes.\nOne of the first steps an analyst will take is determining what gene or genes fall under the SNP peaks that can be seen on the Manhattan plot. Unfortunately, these plots are generally not interactive. Identifying the peaks of interest usually involves sifting through the results table for the range of coordinates under the peak of interest and then using those coordinates to filter a large gene annotation file. The extra steps involved in exploring the data in this way makes it more likely that interesting associations may be missed either due to (1) mistakes made in attempting to mine the large results files or (2) the dataset not being mined deeply enough due to the difficulty of looking for genes under less significant peaks. Additionally, this method quickly becomes tedious when analyzing multiple phenotypes or relatively complex traits.\nSome web applications provide tools for viewing Manhattan plots (Table 1), but they are all either specific to a single species or don’t allow interactive results browsing. These resources also do not allow for easy viewing and comparison of GWAS results across phenotypes and studies, a situation that frequently arises with structured populations.\n|Browser||Language programmed in||Is it run on local, server or web||Is the plot interactive||Display SNPs and intervals||Organisms supported||Displays multiple GWAS experiments|\n|LocusZoom||R, Python wrapper, SQLite table||Local or web||No||No||Human||No|\n|LocusTrack||R||Local or web||No||No||Human||No|\n|ZBrowse||R||Local, server with some modification||Yes||Yes||Any||Yes|\nWe approached the construction of a new GWAS browser with the goal of giving the users the following tools, all of which were focused on versatility and adaptability:\nAbility to plot multiple traits in the same panel. We wanted to enable users to find genotype-environment (GxE) interactions (e.g., those instances where an environmental condition causes a phenotypic effect, but only for individuals with a given allele) and loci with pleiotropic effects (the same loci affecting multiple phenotypes).\nAbility to rapidly move between scales (thousands of bps to billions).\nAbility to find overlaps or commonalities among datasets.\nAbility to interact directly with the plots. We wanted the ability to look at the annotations of genes inline easily and link to additional information.\nAbility to plot both SNPs and genetic intervals. We wanted users to be able to combine the results of quantitative trait locus mapping techniques with GWAS results.\nAbility to download plots and gene lists.\nFinally, we wanted all of this information and functionality to be available in one browser window using tools that are common and freely available on most personal computers.\nHere, we present an interactive GWAS results viewer that is an extension of the classic GWAS Manhattan plot. It allows for the rapid comparison of GWAS results from multiple phenotyping experiments and the rapid viewing and analysis of genes under peak SNPs. Arabidopsis thaliana, maize, soybean, and sorghum are bundled with the software but we provide instructions and tools to easily add support for other organisms, including those with sex chromosomes. As a practical application of the browser’s usage, we will demonstrate it using results from a recently completed sorghum GWAS experiment in which elemental profiling phenotypes were measured in accessions grown across three separate locations (Shakoor et al., 2015).\nThe ZBrowse GWAS results viewer is an interactive application that runs on a local machine using R and is rendered in any modern web browser. Because the browser runs on the user’s local machine, the data can remain private. Though the focus of the first version is a local installation, the browser display allows for easy sharing of the application. The browser is designed to be a streamlined environment that provides fast access to visualization tools for GWAS results. ZBrowse utilizes a tab-based navigation format to make accessing different aspects of the browser fast, efficient, and intuitive. There is also a sidebar panel on the left of the page that updates with a set of options specific to the tab being displayed.\nThe first tab in the list, and the landing page when the application is first loaded, is the Manage tab (Fig. 1). This tab allows a new GWAS dataset to be uploaded into the application or a pre-loaded dataset from a dropdown menu can be selected. Data can be uploaded in a flat file delimited with either commas or tabs or an RData object. These flexible file formats allow any type of data to be loaded into the browser.\nIn Fig. 1, we have loaded the results from the sorghum ionomics experiment and selected the appropriate columns to be used for plotting the results. The results file was generated by taking the most significant SNP hits from each of the 80 GWAS experiments performed (20 phenotypes measured in 3 locations and an experiment combining the location data). We added a column describing which experiment (e.g., the three locations) and which phenotype each SNP was found in.\nOnce uploaded, a preview of the first ten rows of the dataset will appear in the main panel. Below this table is a series of selection boxes that allow the user to specify which columns in the file to use for plotting. This selection method removes the complexity of requiring the input file to either have columns with specific names or columns in a specific order.\nThe user needs to select a chromosome and base pair for determining the location of each SNP in the genome. To plot base pair intervals, there is a separate checkmark box. Checking this box opens a second set of selection boxes allowing the user to select columns defining a start base pair and a stop base pair for each interval, as well as a separate y-axis column (allowing the traits to be plotted on different scales). Chromosomes expected for each organism are defined in a separate file (See Adding Organisms section). The browser supports both numeric and alphabetical chromosome names, so scaffold names (i.e., scaffold_1, scaffold_2), sex chromosomes (i.e., X, Y), or chromosome arm designations (i.e., 1S, 1L) are acceptable.\nIf the uploaded dataset is data from only one GWAS trait, there is a checkbox to include all data as one trait. Otherwise, the user can select one or more columns to group the data by when plotting. For example, a researcher might be interested in comparing GWAS results from multiple experiments, or in comparing results from multiple traits measured in the same experiment, or both. The user can designate as many columns as desired to subset the data that will be used to create tracks designated by different colors on the plots. Color coding in the plots for each track will match between the intervals and the single points. In our sorghum dataset, we are interested in exploring relationships between both the phenotypes measured and the effect environment may have had on our GWAS results. Therefore, we have selected the two columns that we added describing what location and phenotype from which each SNP result is derived.\nFinally, the user needs to select the y-axis column with the significance value against which to plot each SNP. Usually, this is the negative logarithm of the P-value, but can also be the number of bootstrap models that include this SNP (RMIP, Valdar et al., 2009) or any other measure of trait significance, such as effect size. If a user hasn’t already created a column with the negative logarithm of the P-value, the P-value column can be selected and there is a checkbox to have the software automatically perform the calculation. The final parameter allows for user selectable values for the Y-axis scale. By default, the software will automatically scale the y-axis based on the range of the selected data. The browser will only display 5,000 points total (see “Limitations” section). If there are more than 5,000 points in the subset of tracks being plotted, the browser will use the y-axis column to rank the SNPs and take only the top 5,000.\nAfter the user has selected the appropriate parameters, clicking the submit button will trigger a tab change to the Whole Genome View visualization tab (Fig. 2). Conveniently, once submitted, the software will remember the selected settings for this dataset on future visits and automatically populate the fields with the previously selected parameters. The plot on this tab is formatted as a standard genome-wide Manhattan plot. The x-axis is ordered by chromosome and base pair within each chromosome. The background of the plot has alternating blue/white shading for the even and odd chromosomes to highlight chromosome breaks. The panel on the left contains a box for each trait column selected in the Manage tab. In the case of our Sorghum ionomics dataset, there is a box where we can select which combination of the 20 phenotypes we would like to plot and which experimental location we would like to plot. In Fig. 2, we have selected all four locations and we are plotting the significant associations found for cadmium, cobalt, and zinc. There is also an option for showing only overlapping SNPs with the ability to adjust both the overlap size around each point and the minimum number of overlaps.\nWhen the user scrolls over points in the plot, a tooltip will display that shows information about the trait that SNP is associated with, the Y-axis value, and the exact chromosome and base pair for the SNP (Fig. 2). If the tooltip gets in the way of the viewing or selecting of points, clicking the plot will temporarily hide the tooltip box. Clicking any point in the Whole Genome View will change tabs to the Chromosome View tab with a focus on the clicked point (Fig. 3). In our example, we clicked on the peak SNP for cadmium in the Mexico experiment. This tab contains two plots: one is a chromosome-wide view displaying the data from the chromosome clicked in the genome-wide view, the other plot is an annotation plot of the region around the clicked base pair. A blue band in the chromosome-wide plot highlights the region being displayed in the annotation plot. In one click, we have gone from viewing the entire 700 million base pair genome, to a plot displaying the region 250 thousand base pairs around our point of interest. The plot contains a variety of interactive features. In addition to selecting traits to view in the sidebar panel, traits can be quickly hidden by clicking their entry in the legend. When many points are plotted on the same graph, overplotting can make it difficult to discern points clustered around the same peak. To alleviate this, the plot can be easily zoomed by clicking and dragging a zoom box anywhere in the plot. This makes it much easier to see the relationship between tightly grouped points. The displayed chromosome can be changed without returning to the Whole Genome View tab using the drop-down menu in the sidebar panel. Points can be clicked to redraw the annotation plot around new points of interest.\nThe annotation plot is a variable width plot that defaults to showing the region 250,000 base pairs on either side of the point of interest. The width of this region can be adjusted between 1,000 and 500,000 base pairs using the slider on the sidebar panel. The bottom of this plot has a track that shows the position of coding sequences around the SNP of interest. The tooltip for genes in this track displays information about the gene location, strand, and function, if known. For maize, arabidopsis and soybean, clicking on the gene will open a new browser tab that links to the gene description page specific to the organism being viewed. Arabidopsis links to The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR) (Lamesch et al., 2011), soybean links to Soybase (Grant et al., 2010), and maize links to the Maize Genetics and Genomics Database (MaizeGDB) (Lawrence et al., 2004). In addition, clicking genes in organisms added from Phytozome (Goodstein et al., 2012) via the add organism application described below opens the Phytozome description page for that gene. ZBrowse can be easily modified to link out to other species-specific databases that can accept a query string in the URL.\nOur cadmium example in Fig. 3 shows how quickly we can find potential leads for candidate genes. Browsing the gene track, a gene almost directly under the peak cadmium SNP is annotated as being similar to a cadmium/zinc-transporting ATPase; clicking this gene opens a new browser tab displaying the phytozome gene description page.\nIn addition to the visual browser, annotation data can be explored in tabular form in the Annotation Table tab (Fig. 4). This table provides an interactive table of the genes found in the window around the selected point. The table is sortable and searchable and can also be exported as a comma-separated file. A similar table viewer is available in the Data Table tab for analysis of the selected GWAS dataset.\nCurrently, maize, soybean, arabidopsis and sorghum are downloaded with the browser source package. We have developed an application to quickly add organisms to the browser from annotations downloaded from the Plant Genomics Portal (Phytozome) to the local installation of ZBrowse. Additionally, we will be formatting requested and popular organisms and releasing the files on GitHub. These will be easy to download and incorporate into your existing browser installation.\nAdding a new organism manually requires two additional files to be created and placed into the ZBrowse installation directory. One is a flat text file with three lines. The first line tells the browser the display name for the organism. The second line tells the browser the names and size of each genome feature (i.e., chromosomes, scaffold, etc.) and the third line is the path to a csv file containing the annotation information. The annotation file needs to have the following columns: name, chromosome, transcript_start, transcript_end, strand, ID, defLine, bestArabhitDefline and bestRiceHitDefline.\nThe browser takes a fundamentally different approach from current state of the art browsers. It is focused on the ability to quickly plot a variety of GWAS experiments on a single Manhattan plot. A caveat to this ability, however, is that it cannot plot every SNP in a genotype dataset. Due to memory, time, and plotting constraints the current browser is limited to approximately 5,000 data points per trait, which is significantly less than most genotype datasets. Of course, only the most strongly associated SNPs are typically of interest, so this problem can be easily mitigated by trimming the input file to contain only significant associations (e.g., p < 0.05). Currently, the browser will automatically trim the number of points being plotted to only display the top 5,000 points based on the y-axis column. Future improvements to the browser could support the plotting of more information by binning points when zoomed out to a point where over plotting is an issue and only loading individual data points asynchronously when the zoom level is sufficient to see individual points.\nThe generality of the browser allows for it to be used with any SNP dataset. Only chromosome number and base pair information needs to be provided for each SNP. However, this means that specific information about the genotype dataset being used, such as minor allele frequency or linkage disequilibrium information, cannot be displayed on the plot. Of course, the flexibility of the browser would make it easy to build personalized solutions that could display additional information for specific SNP datasets, and additional tracks could be added to display linkage disequilibrium decay around the selected SNP.\nOne obvious extension of the browser that would address many of the limitations listed above would be to connect it to a database designed to quickly and efficiently handle all of the data that goes into a GWAS experiment. Database support would allow custom subsetting of entire GWAS datasets and if the GWAS genotype files are available, then summary data about each particular SNP could also be displayed. This would allow the browser to be incorporated into a much larger ecosystem that could take a GWAS experiment from phenotypic dataset, through running a GWAS experiment, to final analysis and visualization.\nWhile the limitations identified above may constrain the use of the browser for certain applications, there are a number of use cases that are enabled by its current functionality. Using open source tools and GitHub for the code distribution, the browser functionalities can be enhanced by the authors or by other members of the user community."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:a7d13727-bdea-4e2f-9e9e-fe9458c3e481>","<urn:uuid:882f4549-0704-40d3-86f3-84e4f78142d4>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What role does machine learning play in both language understanding and medical diagnosis, and what are the potential risks in both applications?","answer":"Machine learning plays a crucial role in language understanding by processing various linguistic phenomena and adapting to conversational conventions, as demonstrated in projects like CUBISM which can understand beliefs and sentiments of conversation participants. In medical diagnosis, machine learning helps improve diagnostics and supports physician decision-making through data analysis. However, both applications face significant risks. In language processing, there are challenges in accurately interpreting complex mechanisms and ensuring proper understanding of context. In medical applications, risks include potential bias in algorithms, the possibility of systems being designed to prioritize cost savings over patient care, and the challenge of maintaining appropriate physician-patient relationships when AI systems are introduced. There are also concerns about data privacy and the risk of healthcare providers becoming overly dependent on machine learning guidance.","context":["Human-Machine Communication & Language Processing\nIHMC researchers are working on natural language computer interfaces and digital companions for conversational understanding, with the aim of developing computerized assistants that accommodate a range of abilities, desires, and needs of users through adaptable natural language processing. Managing a variety of both spoken and written natural language phenomena and adaptation to conversational conventions are central foci of research led by James Allen, Bonnie Dorr, and Yorick Wilks, and a team of internationally recognized scientists: Archna Bhatia, Adam Dalton, Greg Dubbin, Lucian Galescu, Kristy Hollingshead, Ian Perera, Choh Man Teng, and Brent Venable. The systems they are creating must take a torrent of words, often in an informal dialogue, whether from a conversation in a meeting or from human-computer communications in an ambient intelligent environment.\nAn effort is under way with the Tampa V.A. hospital to build a companion agent—Calonis—that can hold meaningful conversations with wounded warriors, some of whom may have dementia. The aim is to engage those who may have lost all will to remember, think, or act: For example, the companion avatar can use family photos coupled with information gleaned from conversations and Internet searches to interact with the patient and try re-awaken access to his past life. Additional ways are being devised that allow these companions to think ahead and actually reason about preferences — which actions and responses are most important for different types of patients.\nIn a related effort with the Tampa V.A. hospital, DESIPHER, in which researchers are examining improved speech recognition for agents, focusing on speech divergences in the context of neurological disorders such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). This work involves the detection of speech signals to alert caregivers and medical professionals of underlying problems and the development of improved recognition and adaptation to impaired speech more generally. The speech recognition software now under development in the INSPiRE project, combines not only the sound of the speech, but visual data from the voice signature’s waveform and spectrogram, as well as pitch variability—features that will be used for understanding impaired speech and for adapting to changes in speech patterns over time.\nIHMC’s language research also focuses on the many ways that language (surprisingly) provides a sensitive measure of a person’s cognitive state and mental health status. Many mental and neurological health conditions present with changes in language and behavior, such as a switch in the types of topics discussed, a shift in word usage or syntax, or variations in speech acoustics. IHMC is researching the use of language as an assessment tool for a variety of conditions, including Alzheimer’s, ALS, Parkinson’s, and mild traumatic brain injuries.\nDeep language understanding and recognition of dialogue partners’ intentions and beliefs are also central foci for IHMC researchers, both in determining the beliefs and sentiment of participants in DARPA’s DEFT program and in deep reading in DARPA’s Big Mechanism program.\nDEFT researchers on IHMC’s CUBISM (Conversation Understanding through Belief Interpretation and Sociolinguistic Modeling) project are developing technologies that are equipped to judge the roles of event participants in persuading others of their beliefs or to take actions, or in being persuaded themselves. The ultimate goal is show that a computer can read, understand, and filter informal inputs (e.g., blogs) to identify those that would be of the greatest interest to human analysts.\nIn a related effort (Viewgen), beliefs of individuals participating in a dialogue are modeled. Beliefs and plans of dialogue agents may differ, especially in cases where agents are conspiring to influence or deceive other agents. Understanding the conversation and what is really going on between its members—which not all of them may realize—needs cognitive computational structures of this sort.\nBig Mechanism researchers on IHMC’s DRUM (Deep Reader for Understanding Mechanisms) project are developing a system that uses the TRIPS parser to read papers and combine research results of individual studies into a comprehensive explanatory model of a complex mechanism. Complex mechanisms consist of many highly interconnected components, yet they are often described in disconnected fragmentary ways. Examples include ecosystems, social dynamics, and signaling networks in biology.\nThe study of these complex systems is often focused on a small portion of a mechanism at a time. In addition, the huge volume of scientific literature makes it difficult to track the fast developments in the field to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the often distant and convoluted interactions in the system. The DRUM system will automatically read scientific papers, extract relevant new model fragments, and compose them into larger models that will expose the interactions and relationships between disparate elements in the mechanism.\nMulti-modal interaction is also a central focus of IHMC researchers. Much of human language revolves around physical experiences, particularly visual ones, in the world. For an AI system to interact with a person, it therefore needs to share in those experiences in some way, and use them to develop more sophisticated, abstract concepts while learning tasks through interaction with a human.\nTo address this challenge, IHMC has developed SALL-E (Situated Agent for Language Learning), a system that uses pragmatic inference and child language learning strategies to learn physical attributes and names of objects in real-time from a human describing objects in front of a video camera. Coupled with the dialogue management and semantic representations of the TRIPS system, IHMC is currently extending this system to learn and communicate with a human to complete joint tasks and build more complex semantic representations from primitive, grounded concepts.\nIHMC has been collaborating with the University of Albany on an additional architecture for multimodal event detection and interpretation based on a 4-dimensional space-time representation which also integrates information deriving from language sources such as associated texts (tweets, captions, dialogue, demonstration posters inside images etc.). This work is central to other applications as well, including work by IHMC researchers on situational understanding of events for detection and possibly prediction of cyber-related activities.\nEvent detection is also a central focus on the DISCERN project, where the goal is to enable automatic understanding of written language enough to identify emerging disaster events. This research problem requires machine processing of various pieces of information, such as parses, semantic role labels, event ontologies, coreference information, as well as various techniques to make use of all this information. For example, parses of utterances provide information about predicates and their arguments, semantic role information suggests what role each argument is playing, and a mapping between event ontology and semantic role labels provides additional information about events as they are emerging.\nA low-resource language effort is underway to adapt DISCERN technologies to a range of languages, including those for which an online presence is rare or non-existent. This effort leverages linguistic knowledge about typological similarities and differences across languages, as well as various machine learning techniques, including active learning.","The Ethical Implications of Using Artificial Intelligence in Medicine\nArtificial intelligence is hard at work crunching health data to improve diagnostics and help doctors make better decisions or their patients. But researchers at the Stanford University of Medicine say the furious pace of growth in the development of machine-learning tools calls for physicians and scientists to carefully examine the ethical risks of incorporating them into decision-making.\nIn a perspective piece published in The New England Journal of Medicine, the authors acknowledged the tremendous benefit that machine learning can have on patient health. But they cautioned that the full benefit of using this type of tool to make predictions and take alternative actions can’t be realised without careful consideration of the accompanying ethical pitfalls.\n“The pressure to turn to data for answers is especially intense in fields that are growing quickly, such as genetic testing and sequencing.”\n“Because of the many potential benefits, there’s a strong desire in society to have these tools piloted and implemented into healthcare,” said lead author, Danton Char, MD, assistant professor of anesthesiology, perioperative and pain medicine. “But we have begun to notice, from implementations in non-health care areas, that there can be ethical problems with algorithmic learning when it’s deployed at a large scale.”\n- Data used to create algorithms can contain bias that is reflected in the algorithms and in the clinical recommendations they generate. Also, algorithms might be designed to skew results, depending on who’s developing them and on the motives of the programmers, companies or healthcare systems deploying them.\n- Physicians must adequately understand how algorithms are created, critically assess the source of the data used to create the statistical models designed to predict outcomes, understand how the models function and guard against becoming overly dependent on them.\n- Data gathered about patient health, diagnostics and outcomes become part of the “collective knowledge” of published literature and information collected by healthcare systems and might be used without regard for clinical experience and the human aspect of patient care.\n- Machine-learning-based clinical guidance may introduce a third-party “actor” into the physician-patient relationship, challenging the dynamics of responsibility in the relationship and the expectation of confidentiality.\n“We need to be cautious about caring for people base don what algorithms are showing us,” Char said. “The one thing people can do that machines can’t do is step aside from our ideas and evaluate them critically.”\nSources of Bias\nIn discussing designer intent, which is one source of bias, the authors pointed to private-sector examples of algorithms meant to ensure specific outcomes, such as Volkswagen’s algorithm that allowed vehicles to pass emissions tests by reducing their nitrogen oxide emissions during the tests.\nDavid Magnus, PhD, senior author of the piece and director of the Stanford Center for Biomedical Ethics, said bias can play into health data in three ways: human bias; bias that is introduced by designs; and bias in the ways healthcare systems use the data.\n“You can easily imagine that the algorithms being built into the healthcare system might be reflective of different, conflicting interests”, said Magnus. “What if the algorithm is designed around the goal of saving money? What if different treatment decisions about patients are made depending on insurance status or their ability to pay?”\nThe authors called for a national conversation about the “perpetual tension between the goals of improving health and generating profit… since the builders and purchasers of machine-learning systems are unlikely to be the same people delivering bedside care.”\nThey also put the responsibility for finding solutions and setting the agenda on healthcare professionals.\n“Ethical guidelines can be created to catch up with the age of machine learning and artificial intelligence that is already upon us,” the authors wrote. “Physicians who use machine-learning system can become more educated about their construction, the datasets they are built on and their limitations. Remaining ignorant about the construction of machine-learning systems or allowing them to be constructed as black boxes could lead to ethically problematic outcomes.”\nThe authors acknowledged the social pressure to incorporate the latest tools in order to provide better health outcomes for patients.\n“Artificial intelligence will be pervasive in healthcare in a few years,” said co-author Nigam Shah, MBBS, PhD, associate professor of medicine. But healthcare systems need to be aware of the pitfalls that have happened in other industries, he added.\nShah noted that models are only as trustworthy as the data being gathered and shared. “Be careful about knowing the data from which you learn,” he said.\nCould Data Become the Doctor?\nThe authors wrote that what physicians learn from the data needs to be heavily weighed against what they know from their own clinical experience. Overreliance on machine guidance might lead to self-fulfilling prophecies.\nFor example, they said, if clinicians always withdraw care in patients with certain diagnoses, such as extreme prematurity or brain injury, machine-learning systems may learn that such diagnoses are always fatal. Conversely, machine-learning systems, properly deployed, may help resolve disparities in healthcare delivery by compensating for known biases or by identifying where more research is needed to balance the underlying data.\nMagnus said the example of a current pilot study of an algorithm developed at Stanford to predict the need for a palliative care consultation illustrates how collaborative, careful consideration in the design of an algorithm and use of the data can guard against the misinterpretation of data in making care decisions.\nShah is helping to lead the pilot study. In this case, Magnus said, physicians and designers work closely to ensure that the incorporation of the predictions into the care equation includes guarantees that the physician “has full understanding that the patient problems are answered and well-understood.”\nThe insertion of an algorithm’s predictions into the patient-physician relationship also introduces a third party, turning the relationship into one between the patient and the healthcare system.\nIt also means significant changes in terms of a patient’s expectations of confidentiality.\n“Once machine-learning-based decision support is integrated into clinical care, withholding information from electronic records will become increasingly difficult, since patients whose data aren’t recorded can’t benefit from machine-learning analyses,” the authors wrote.\nMagnus said the pressure to turn to data for answers is especially intense in fields that are growing quickly, such as genetic testing and sequencing.\n“In a situation where you’re looking for any evidence in informing your decision-making that you can get, and now you have all this genetics information and you don’t know how to deal with,” having data can be enormously helpful, he said.\n“I think society has become very breathless in looking for quick answers,” Char said. “I think we need to be more thoughtful in implementing machine learning.”\nMaterials provided by Stanford University.

{"question":"Do Sydney Opera House and Zuellig Building both have highest green building certification?","answer":"Yes, both buildings have achieved the highest green certifications in their respective rating systems. The Sydney Opera House received a 6 Star Green Star rating from the Green Building Council of Australia, representing 'World Leadership' in environmental sustainability operations. The Zuellig Building was awarded LEED Platinum certification, which is the highest level of certification in the LEED rating system administered by the US Green Building Council.","context":["Sydney Opera House receives 6 star sustainability rating\nHoneywell has announced its contributions to help the Sydney Opera House, a UNESCO World Heritage-listed building, achieve a 6 Star Green Star rating from the Green Building Council of Australia (GBCA). Since 2021, Honeywell has been a Sydney Opera House Global Goals partner and has installed its technology to help support more sustainable operations and reduce the building’s environmental impact.\nThe Sydney Opera House is one of the first UNESCO World Heritage-listed buildings to receive a 6 Star Green Star rating, representing ‘World Leadership’ in environmental and social sustainability operations. This achievement is the result of continuous improvements to the building’s performance, reducing its carbon emissions and maintaining its carbon neutral certification.\nHoneywell and the Sydney Opera House work 24/7 in close collaboration to identify and implement solutions tailored to the unique needs of the building, including:\n- Creating a technology system that monitors indoor air quality (IAQ) and relative humidity (rH).\n- Integrating more than 20 disparate subsystems in the building to help improve safety, energy and water usage.\n- Implementing several innovations including electricity spot-price monitoring, extraction fan control in non-air-conditioned (AC) areas and monitoring of coldroom doors that remain open for too long.\n- Automating outside air control through real-time air quality data from the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM).\n- Identifying potential energy saving opportunities in the building, including the installation of more than 60 water meters and more than 800 electrical meters.\nThese strategies help enable automated responses and alerts to changing conditions, supporting operational efficiency and providing a safer and more comfortable environment for staff, audiences and visitors.\nLouise Herron AM, Sydney Opera House CEO, said sustainability is in the DNA of the building, which is now working smarter and harder than before to embed sustainability into its operations.\nAccording to Billal Hammoud, President and CEO of Honeywell Building Technologies, the Sydney Opera House requires a “careful balance” as it takes a thoughtful and deliberate approach to minimise its impact on the environment.\nThe Sydney Opera House leverages new technology to further its sustainability initiatives, including piloting solutions like the Honeywell Buildings Sustainability Manger, a software platform that provides better visibility of energy use and Scope 1 and 2 emissions.\nThe 6 Star Green Star rating centres on innovation and a long-lasting commitment to sustainability. Honeywell, in collaboration with the Sydney Opera House’s engineering team, has tailored the system to the requirements of a performing arts building while leveraging existing systems such as the building’s seawater cooling system. Building operations at the Sydney Opera House are anchored by the Honeywell Enterprise Buildings Integrator (EBI), a comprehensive solution that monitors and controls the building management system (BMS), as well as hardware and equipment throughout the building’s ecosystem.\nUsing the system as a point of data analysis, the teams can effectively monitor and control systems to support peak performance. For example, information on ticket sales to enable efficient temperature scheduling in performance venues; switching heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) equipment on and off; and calculating baseline energy consumption. When there is high demand, the BMS alerts the building to respond by selectively shedding electricity loads. The air circulation system also automatically shuts down outside air intakes during bushfire smoke events.\nThe GBCA Green Star Building rating tool is similar to the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification system from the U.S. Green Buildings Council (USGBC).\nInside the highlight topics to be discussed at Energy Next\nEnergy Next, powered by All Energy Australia, will take place at ICC Sydney on 18–19 July...\nMaking vinegar from excess carbon dioxide could reduce emissions\nMonash University's chemical engineers have developed an industrial process to produce acetic...\nSA Water awarded for reservoir reserves\nSA Water has received the Organisational Excellence Award at the Australian Water...","Building puts PH in green world mapBy Tessa R. Salazar |Philippine Daily Inquirer\nA 33-story Makati office tower that uses the same sustainable technology being used in the Freedom Tower in New York puts the Philippines in the green world map.\nThe Zuellig Building, sheathed in 28,000 square meters of floor-to-ceiling low-emissivity glass, joins the ranks of the world’s most state-of-the-art, environment-friendly buildings like the Bank of America Tower-New York City, Asia Square in Singapore, and Taipei 101.\nAll in all, there are only about a hundred LEED Platinum-certified high-rise office buildings worldwide. The Zuellig Building now joins this elite group.\nThe US Green Building Council (USGBC) awarded the Zuellig Building the Platinum certification level under its LEED-CS (Leadership for Energy and Environmental Design-Core and Shell) program this month. Platinum, the highest level of LEED certification, is actually an upgrade for Zuellig Building, which was awarded at precertification the Gold level under LEED-CS in June 2009.\nThe Zuellig skyscraper that stands on a landscaped 8,285-square-meter site at the intersection of Makati Avenue and Paseo de Roxas is the first development in the Philippines in the LEED-CS program, and among the first in Asia, to earn the highest level in the LEED rating system for “green” architecture, sustainable construction methodologies and resource-efficient building operations. The property has a total leasable area of 55,000-sq-m prime-grade office space for multitenant use.\nBased on available data from the USGBC, there are only three Platinum-certified projects in the Philippines. The other two are Bridgebury Realty Corp. Office, developers of the Zuellig Building (LEED Platinum for Commercial Interiors), and the Sunlife Philippines head office in Taguig (LEED Platinum for Commercial Interiors).\nCBRE Philippines told Inquirer Property in a statement that “as the outsourcing and offshoring sector gains strength in the country, we see more occupiers and developers prioritizing flight to quality, with green buildings becoming more the norm than the exception.”\nIt added that the Zuellig Building “raises the bar for green building standards in the Philippine prime office market.”\nThe team of architects and design consultants behind the Zuellig project included W.V. Coscolluela & Associates and Skidmore Owings & Merrill (SOM, New York), the same company behind the Freedom Tower. Adherence to LEED requirements was monitored throughout the construction process by the project’s sustainability consultant, Langdon & Seah.\nExperts have stressed that the construction sector is one of the most significant contributors to the carbon footprint of the industrial sector. Also, studies have shown that buildings account for over half of the world’s carbon emissions, making their impact on the environment a key concern. This is specially evident in Asia with its rapid growth of highly urbanized populations.\nInitiated by the USGBC in 2000, LEED is recognized as a global standard for the assessment of the sustainability of buildings.\nThe LEED-CS rating system allocates points based on a building’s environmental impact and human benefits in five major credit categories: sustainable sites, water efficiency, energy and atmosphere, materials and resources, and indoor environmental quality.\nEach of the performance categories includes preconditional mandatory measures. Certification is granted solely by the USGBC in Washington, DC and requires third-party verification of compliance.\nThe green technologies employed in the Zuellig Building achieve significant energy savings (at least 15 percent compared with a base building built to conventional US standards), thereby reducing greenhouse emissions and energy costs.\nThe building has an on-grid photovoltaic solar power system to generate renewable energy. Recycling of gray water and the collection of rainwater and condensate water result in over 70-percent water savings (29-million liters annually).\nAccess to public transport\nWith transportation being another major contributor to worldwide carbon emissions, the location of the Zuellig Building allows tenants easy connectivity and access to public transportation. Bicycle stands and showers are provided for office users who choose to pedal to work instead of burning fuel.\nGreen buildings are designed to support the well-being and productivity of occupants. In the Zuellig Building, 90 percent of the office space gets natural light. The Indoor Air Quality plan controls the choice of construction materials to eliminate the health risks of volatile organic compounds, and carbon dioxide sensors control and modulate the airflow.\nZuellig also received a Platinum LEED-CI certification (Commercial Interiors) for the fit-out of its corporate offices on the 32nd floor. Tenants who desire a LEED-CI certification for their individual fit-outs automatically gain a certain number of points simply by being located in the building."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"language-ambiguous"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:a9460de9-fce2-40df-be0b-da1fc99de07f>","<urn:uuid:196a5e54-bc15-4f32-8036-49e3f1c68fe4>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do dietary patterns compare between captive parrots and wild Purple-throated Mountain-gems in terms of health and nutrition?","answer":"Captive parrots and wild Purple-throated Mountain-gems have very different dietary patterns affecting their health. Pet parrots often face obesity issues due to diets high in fatty seeds, particularly sunflower and safflower seeds found in commercial seed mixtures. A healthier diet for them should consist of 40% pellets, 50% fresh fruits and vegetables, and 10% nuts and seeds. In contrast, Purple-throated Mountain-gems maintain a natural diet primarily consisting of high-sugar nectar from flowers and insects for protein, especially during breeding season. They specifically seek out flowers with the highest sugar content and can drink nectar up to 13 times per second using their specialized tongues, while also catching insects for essential protein.","context":["You do not see many overweight birds in the wild. In fact, you might not see any. The need to constantly move around to forage and find food burns off lots of extra calories. The addition of even a few extra ounces may make the difference between being agile enough to escape from a predator and getting caught. Most birds that you see in their natural environment are an appropriate weight for their species otherwise they will not last for long.\nUnfortunately, this is not always the case for many pet birds. According to vetstreet.com, parrots are one of the most common pet species that are treated for obesity problems. This issue becomes more prevalent as birds age and is mostly seen in birds that are in their late teens or twenties. While obesity can affect any bird, the species that seem especially prone to it are Amazon parrots, African gray parrots, budgerigars, Quaker parrots, and rose-breasted cockatoos.\nWhat Causes Obesity in Pet Birds?\nThe answer to this question can be summed up in one word: Captivity. The associated lifestyle changes that separate a wild bird from one that is captive are the overriding factors behind one becoming obese and the other maintaining a healthy weight. Behavior that would be part of their everyday existence and burn off excess calories is often not an option for our pets.\nWeight is gained by taking on more calories than can be burned off by exercise. The two specific causes of obesity in our pet birds are:\n- Diet – The type of food that you provide for your pet bird has a direct bearing on the likelihood of it having weight problems as it ages. Seeds, in particular, sunflower and safflower seeds, are very high in fat. They are also predominant in many commercially available seed mixtures marketed for pet birds. A diet rich in these seeds can have a detrimental effect on your bird’s weight. To see a full list of what birds can eat click here.\n- Lack of exercise – The second primary reason for obesity in pet birds is the lack of exercise that they experience due to their captivity. This problem is exacerbated when we clip their wings to prevent them from flying. According to theveterinaryexpert.com, a flying parrot expends 20 times more energy that one simply standing on its perch. The failure to provide adequate exercise options for our pet birds can lead to them developing weight problems.\nWhat Are the Signs of Obesity in Birds?\nThere are a number signs to look for that may indicate your bird is overweight. They are:\n- Check the keel bone – This is in the middle of the breast, with the bird’s breasts on either side of the bone. Obese birds will have cleavage, as the keel bone will not be the most prominent feature of the bird’s breast.\n- Wider than usual stance – You may notice that your bird develops a wider than usual stance when it perches. This is to help maintain its balance and attempt to ease the strain of the excess weight on its feet and legs.\n- Shortness of breath – If you notice your bird is out of breath after a short period of activity, this may be a sign your pet is suffering from obesity.\nYou can obtain a scale and measure your bird’s weight in grams to have a baseline to watch in the future, as seen in the image below which if you click on is available.\nBelow is a video demonstrating how to weigh your parrot.\nCan Obesity Cause Other Health Problems?\nObese pet birds are at risk for many other health-related issues. Though obesity itself is now considered a problem on its own, according to vcahospitals.com, these are the other diseases and conditions an obese bird is liable to experience:\n- Heart disease\n- Hepatic lipidosis, also known as “Fatty Liver Disease”\n- Higher levels of stress\n- Fatty tumors\n- Increased anesthetic risk\nThe list of problems associated with an obese pet bird should alert you to the fact that it is very bad for your bird to become overweight. Since you are responsible for its well-being and have a huge impact on what it can and cannot do on an everyday basis, it is up to you to help your bird maintain a healthy weight.\nWhat Can be Done to Prevent Obesity in my Pet Birds?\nSince the two primary causes of obesity in pet birds are diet and lack of exercise, it make sense that those are the areas that need to be addressed for your bird to maintain a healthy weight. We will look at both and how in some ways the two factors are linked in the way that you arrange your bird’s cage.\n- Changing diet – If your bird’s current diet consists of a large percentage of fatty seeds, the first step you should take is to slowly introduce a pellet based diet to your pet. This needs to be done in stages to acclimate your bird to accept the new food. Over time you want your bird’s diet to consist of approximately 40% pellets, 50% fresh fruit and vegetables, and 10% nuts and seeds. If you can reach this goal you have tackled to the problem of obesity from the standpoint of your pet’s diet.\n- Provide more exercise opportunities – While changing your bird’s diet is simply a matter of providing more healthy food, offering additional exercise options can be more challenging. Working within the parameters of the space that you have available, you should be able to come up with something that will help your bird burn off those extra calories. Some ideas to consider are:\n- Stop clipping your bird’s wings and let it fly for a time each day. If you have space or a room where you can do this, your bird will love it and be healthier because of it.\n- Rearrange their food and water bowls so they need to move around the cage. A number of bowls with varying foods placed at different heights can somewhat encourage their natural foraging behavior. Foraging toys that demand work to obtain a treat can also be used to promote exercise. A larger cage should also be considered. Below is a video showing two cockatiels using a foraging toy and getting plenty of exercise.\n- Obtain a bird playground or play gym to promote exercise when out of the cage. This can be combined with training and bonding time with its human family members and lead to a more healthy and well-balanced bird in many respects.\nIt is up to us, the pet bird owners to help our avian friends to maintain good health. Keeping them from becoming obese is a big step in the right direction.","The Purple-throated Mountain-gem (Lampornis calolaema) is a Central American hummingbird. It is related to the White-throated and Gray-tailed Mountain-gems, with which it is sometimes considered conspecific (of, or belonging to, the same species).\nDistribution / Range\nIt occurs naturally in the mountains of southern Nicaragua, northern Costa Rica and western Panama.\nIt inhabits forested areas in hilly terrain, and is found at altitudes from 800 m to 2500 m.\nThe Purple-throated Mountain-gem measures about 10.5 cm in length. The slightly larger male weighs, on average, 6.0 g and the female 4.8 g.\nIt has a shortish black bill that is slightly curved.\nThe adult male has a mostly bronze-green plumage, except for the brilliant green crown, purple throat and dark grey tail.\nThe female lacks the bright crown and throat, and has rich cinnamon underparts.\nJuveniles resemble the female but have buff fringes to the upper plumage.\nNesting / Breeding\nHummingbirds are solitary in all aspects of life other than breeding; and the male's only involvement in the reproductive process is the actual mating with the female. They neither live nor migrate in flocks; and there is no pair bond for this species. Males court females by flying in a u-shaped pattern in front of them. He will separate from the female immediately after copulation. One male may mate with several females. In all likelihood, the female will also mate with several males. The males do not participate in choosing the nest location, building the nest or raising the chicks.\nThe female Purple-throated Mountaingem is responsible for building the cup-shaped nest out of plant fibers woven together and green moss on the outside for camouflage in a protected location, about 0.7-3.5 m high in a shrub, bush, tree or vine.\nThe nest is lined with soft plant fibers, animal hair and feather down, and the structure is strengthened with spider webbing and other sticky material, giving it an elastic quality to allow it to stretch to double its size as the nestlings grow and require more room. The nest is typically placed on a low, thin horizontal branch.\nA nest usually contains two white eggs, which are incubated by the female for about 15 - 19 days. The hatchlings are blind, immobile and without any down. The female protects and feeds the chicks with regurgitated food (mostly partially-digested insects since nectar is an insufficient source of protein for the growing chicks). She pushes the food down the chicks' throats with her long bill directly into their stomachs.\nAs is the case with other hummingbird species, the chicks are brooded only the first week or two, and left alone even on cooler nights after about 12 days - probably due to the small nest size. The chicks leave the nest when they are about 20 - 26 days old.\nDiet / Feeding\nThe Purple-throated Hummingbirds primarily feed on nectar taken from a variety of brightly colored, scented small flowers of trees, herbs, shrubs and epiphytes, including the epiphytic Ericaceae.\nThey favor flowers with the highest sugar content (often red-colored and tubular-shaped) and seek out, and aggressively protect, those areas containing flowers with high energy nectar. They use their long, extendible, straw-like tongues to retrieve the nectar while hovering with their tails cocked upward as they are licking at the nectar up to 13 times per second. Sometimes they may be seen hanging on the flower while feeding.\nMany native and cultivated plants on whose flowers these birds feed heavily rely on them for pollination. The mostly tubular-shaped flowers actually exclude most bees and butterflies from feeding on them and, subsequently, from pollinating the plants.\nThey may also visit local hummingbird feeders for some sugar water, or drink out of bird baths or water fountains where they will either hover and sip water as it runs over the edge; or they will perch on the edge and drink - like all the other birds; however, they only remain still for a short moment.\nThey also take some small spiders and insects - important sources of protein particularly needed during the breeding season to ensure the proper development of their young. Insects are often caught in flight (hawking); snatched off leaves or branches, or are taken from spider webs. A nesting female can capture up to 2,000 insects a day.\nMales establish feeding territories, where they aggressively chase away other males as well as large insects - such as bumblebees and hawk moths - that want to feed in their territory. They use aerial flights and intimidating displays to defend their territories.\nMetabolism and Survival and Flight Adaptions - Amazing Facts\nSpecies Research by Sibylle Johnson\nPlease Note: The articles or images on this page are the sole property of the authors or photographers.

{"question":"How does caffeine affect strength training performance?","answer":"Caffeine can significantly improve strength training performance. According to a study from the Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research, people who took caffeine before going to the gym were able to perform significantly better at intense strength exercises such as the squat, deadlift and bench press. Additionally, caffeine allows athletes to train for longer and at a higher intensity, and it helps reduce post-workout soreness (DOMS).","context":["How Caffeine Affects Exercise\nThe truth about caffeine and exercise\nDo you know how many people in the world are addicted to caffeine? An exact figure is actually unknown but it is estimated that 80-90% of adults and children in the US regularly consume caffeine- and it seems unlikely that the UK is far off .\nCoffee is everywhere and many of us depend on it so much that life without it would be almost unthinkable. What’s often forgotten, though, is that caffeine is an actual drug and affects the body in a variety of ways. You might now be wondering how your morning coffee can influence your training and fitness goals. Is it good or is it bad?\nFirst off, what is caffeine?\nCaffeine is basically a natural insecticide found in various plants. It’s potent stuff too and goes a long way to killing off various pests which would otherwise be up to mischief.\nCaffeine is not only found in coffee beans but also in tea leaves, cocoa beans, kola nuts, guarana berries, and various other energising plants.\nThe main trick behind caffeine’s energy-boosting powers is how it affects brain chemistry. Throughout the course of a strenuous workday a chemical called adenosine builds up in the brain and binds to certain receptors, causing fatigue and basically forcing your brain into “rest” mode.\nCaffeine prevents adenosine from binding to those receptors in your brain, keeping fatigue at bay. The absence of adenosine causes your neurons to fire faster, and adrenaline and dopamine (among other chemicals) are produced in large quantities.\nCaffeine Can Make You a Superhuman Athlete\nWhen used right, caffeine has the ability to turbocharge everything from your concentration to your metabolism, strength, and endurance.\nOne study from the Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research found that people who took a hit of caffeine before heading to the gym were able to perform significantly better at intense strength exercises such as the squat, deadlift and bench press.\nAnother study found that caffeine allowed athletes to train for longer and at a higher intensity. Similiarly, other studies have found that caffeine reduces post-workout soreness (also known as DOMS, or “I really might fall down the stairs after leg day”.)\nIf that wasn’t enough of an endorsement, it turns out that the overwhelming majority of Olympic athletes take caffeine before their big performances.\nIf you’ve just burst into a wild grin and poured yourself another cappuccino, hold on for a second. It’s not all sunshine and peak physical performance.\nCaffeine Can Make You a Frail, Jittery Junkie\nThe positive effects of caffeine listed above are all very real – but there’s more to the story.\nLike all drugs, caffeine comes with the risk of addiction, fatigue, and diminished hormonal function when overused.\nHaving a shot of espresso before your workout can get you ready to crush all obstacles in your path – but too much caffeine can lead to a dramatic spike in various stress hormones, including the notorious “anti-testosterone” hormone cortisol. This has a negative impact on strength and muscle gain, and will cause your overall stress and anxiety levels to skyrocket.\nThat’s not all, either. Prolonged heavy caffeine use can lead to a condition known as adrenal fatigue which can in turn result in constant exhaustion, depression, physical weakness, and poor overall health.\nAnd the cherry on top? The more you use caffeine, the more resistant you become to its effects and the more you need to consume. When you’ve become properly addicted (which isn’t as hard to do as you’d think), you’ll be needing coffee just to feel normal – never mind superhuman.\nUse It Wisely\nThe bottom line is that caffeine is a double-edged sword. It can push you to new heights, or it can be the rock around your neck which drags you down.\nStick to these simple principles to make caffeine work for you:\n- Less is more – don’t think that you need a huge dose to experience the fitness related benefits. A little goes a long way. Try a single shot of espresso rather than three doubles.\n- Pick your battles – you shouldn’t be relying on caffeine to get by every day. By using it only when you really need it – just before a tough workout or a hectic deadline – you’ll stay healthy and experience the full range of benefits.\n- Keep it simple – don’t underestimate how many empty calories a syrupy gourmet coffee can have.

{"question":"How do natural sugars found in fruits and milk compare to added sugars in terms of their health impacts?","answer":"Natural sugars found in fruits and milk are generally healthier than added sugars because they come complexed with other beneficial nutrients. In fruits, the sugars are bound with fiber and other substances that make the body process them in a more beneficial way. Similarly, in milk products, sugars (lactose) are combined with protein and calcium. In contrast, added sugars, such as those in industrial pastries and sugary soft drinks, are discouraged as they can lead to excess weight gain and increased risk of developing Type 2 Diabetes, certain types of cancer, and heart disease.","context":["The carbohydrates (also called carbohydrates, carbohydrates, or carbohydrates) swith nutrients found in food, along with the other two macronutrients: proteins and fats (lipids).\nThey represent a fundamental part of the human diet.\nTo get us started, some of the foods rich in carbohydrates are cereals and derivatives (bread, pasta, rice), tubers (potatoes), legumes, fruit and vegetables, milk and other sugars such as honey or white sugar.\nAre they necessary in our diet?\nThe main function of carbohydrates is energetic.

They function as a quick and easy fuel for the human body to obtain.\nCarbohydrates are a source of energy for the body. (Photo: Getty Images)\nOn the other hand, they perform other structural functions in the body and regulate the levels of blood sugar. They are also involved in reducing fatigue and muscle recovery after physical activity.\nThey also participate in the synthesis of genetic material (DNA, RNA), help in the metabolism of proteins and fat and promote the creation of muscle tissues, among other functions. In other words, carbohydrates are to our body what gasoline is to the car.\nAre all carbohydrates the same?\nDepending on the structure of carbohydrates, we find two types: carbohydrates complex or slowly absorbed (they are starches and fiber) and simple or fast absorbing, also called free or simple sugars (glucose, fructose and lactose).\nSurely you have ever read the label of a food product and have come across strange names such as dextrose, corn syrup, syrup, starch, maltose… Faced with so much information, you may have wondered: What is all that?\nThe sugar that comes in food is not the same as added sugar. (Photo: Getty Images)\nThe truth is that there are many different types of sugar and the chemical structure of each of them determines whether a specific type of sugar is healthy or not.\nThat is, sugar can be found in an intrinsic way in food (as it happens with fruit and cereals), it can be released in the processing (juice) or be added by the food industry or the consumer (industrial pastries, sugary yogurt) .\nMust prioritize those that are intrinsically found in the food because the rest of the nutrients that make up this product make the body use the nutrient in an optimal way for human health.\nHow much less sugar is better?\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) states that you should consume less than 10% of your daily energy intake (kilocalories) of simple sugars per day. Furthermore, according to the WHO, “a reduction below 5% in total caloric intake would produce additional health benefits.”\nIt is important to read the labels to know what the products we consume contain. (Photo: Getty Images)\nTaking into account that the diet of a standard adult is approximately 2,000 kilocalories, one should consume less than 25 grams a day of free sugars. But these are only part of carbohydrates, so we should stop to think about how to manage the intake of the other types.\nHowever, there are many diets that restrict or eliminate carbohydrates. Consumers know it as “Carbophobia.” Surely you have ever heard the expression: “Carbs at night make you fat.”\nThe truth is that you don’t have to be afraid of carbohydrates. Supermarket shelves are increasingly full of products that indicate “O% added sugars” or “No added sugar.”\nHow to identify healthy sugars\nDoes this mean they are healthier? In these cases, the food or product must be valued. If it is a food that has had the sugar removed to make a healthier version but, in exchange, other poor quality additives have been added, it is best to discard it from the shopping cart.\nSome examples are maltitol, xylitol, or erythritol. On the contrary, if it does not have added sugars or sweeteners on the label, we could consider it a healthy food product.\nNon-nutritive sweeteners can be potential food addiction triggers. (Photo: Getty Images)\nIt is also necessary to refer to sweeteners (also called polyalcohols), which are food additives, substances derived from the carbohydrates themselves, with a sweet taste and very low caloric intake.\nAlthough the benefits and risks of its consumption are still under study, research indicates that non-nutritive sweeteners can be possible triggers of food addiction because their intake is associated with a greater preference and craving for sweet foods, increased sweetness threshold to which we get used to the palate and, with it, we gain weight.\nSlow absorption carbohydrates\nThe two main characteristics of slow-absorbing carbohydrates are that they are complex (they are composed of sugar molecules that make up long chains together) and have low glycemic index (They raise blood sugar levels gradually, not exaggerated blood sugar spikes.)\nThe benefits of this type of carbohydrate are the following:\nBest glycemic control. Unlike fast-absorbing carbohydrates, these allow better glycemic control (there are no sudden spikes in blood glucose after eating). This is interesting in people with diabetes.\nSatiety. Being complex, they stay longer in the digestive system in contact with its walls and, therefore, send a signal of satiety to the brain. They improve the composition of the intestinal microbiota.\nRegulation. In the specific case of fiber, it can act by regulating plasma cholesterol levels, interesting in the management of cardiovascular diseases. Taking nutrition to the field of food, we can find them in whole grains (rice, bread, pasta), legumes (lentils, beans, chickpeas), fruit and vegetables, nuts (natural) and seeds, among others.\nTherefore, it is important to consume slow-absorbing carbohydrates on a day-to-day basis and limit your consumption of fast-absorbing carbohydrates.\nNot only to regulate glycemia in case of having diabetes or to control satiety in case of wanting to lose weight, but for the prevention of other metabolic diseases.\nIn long-term sports, it is necessary to include fast-absorbing carbohydrates. (Photo: Getty Images)\nPoor glycemic control can trigger insulin resistance by the body. That is, the body does not recognize sugars and does not know how to act in their presence.\nIt is also necessary to consider that, in certain situations, such as in long-term sports, it is necessary and interesting for good performance to include fast-absorbing carbohydrates.\nThe importance of blood glucose spikes\nThe correct functioning of blood glucose is the key in this type of carbohydrate. The maintenance of a high blood glucose maintained over time (due to the consumption of poor quality processed foods) sets in motion metabolic mechanisms of lipogenesis that cause the body to store fat.\nThis, together with the increase in appetite when blood glucose drops again and the large caloric intake of foods with added sugar, increases the risk of developing overweight (and its associated pathologies) derived from an excessive consumption of sugars or fats of poor nutritional quality.\nFor this reason, the consumption of simple added sugars is discouraged: white sugar, industrial pastries, sugary soft drinks, etc. In addition, it is necessary to emphasize that the version in which we consume a certain food influences the nutritional contribution.\nOur body processes the sugar that comes in food better. (Photo: Getty Images)\nWhen we consume sugars present in the food matrix (fruit and vegetables, for example), our body receives them and processes it in a much more beneficial way for health than when we consume those same sugars, but added externally in the food industry or by part of the consumer.\nWhen we talk about intrinsic simple sugar, we do not have to make great efforts to limit them, since the food as a whole (fiber, polyphenols and other substances) is of good nutritional quality.\nFor example, an industrial potato chip may provide less slowly absorbing sugars than a potato with cooked skin. Some puffed rice cakes produce a higher blood glucose peak than cooked brown rice and sautéed with vegetables.\nUltimately, we will need more carbohydrates the higher the degree of physical activity that we do. As with cars and gasoline.\nIt is important to include quality carbohydrates in our diet and take into account our physical activity to make a proportional and adequate contribution.\n* Luis J.

Subscribe!","Dietary carbohydrates include foods that are rich in starch or sugar (or both). The chemical name for starch is polysaccharide (“poly” meaning many and “saccharide” meaning sugars). The many sugars that make up starch are linked by chemical bonds that are broken down by the body during the process of digestion. Starches are classified as complex carbohydrates and these can be part of a heart healthy diet.\nOne major sub-category of carbohydrates is simple carbohydrates, otherwise known as simple sugars. Simple sugars are one- or two-unit sugars (mono- or disaccharides) that are more quickly and easily digested and absorbed by the body. While this may sound like a good thing at first, eating too many simple sugars can have serious negative consequences for our health. We need to limit the amount of sugar in our diets to improve our heart health and prevent heart disease.\nThe simplest and most common of the simple sugars is glucose, a single-unit sugar that our bodies can break down to make energy or convert into body energy stores, including fat. A close relative of this sugar is fructose, the kind of sugar found in fruits, as well as many other foods. When glucose and fructose are linked together, they form the disaccharide called sucrose (another simple sugar), which is also known as table sugar. There are generally far too many simple sugars in the Western diet - which is gradually becoming the Global diet, as processed food becomes increasingly available around the world.\nThe pitfalls of a high-sugar diet\nHigh-sugar diets have been linked to excess weight gain and an increased risk of developing Type 2 Diabetes, certain types of cancer and heart disease. Interestingly, when we reduce the sugar in our diets over a longer period of time, our taste buds become more sensitized to smaller amounts of sugar in our food. So, by eating less sugar, we actually end up needing less sugar to satisfy that sweet tooth! But beware: artificial sweeteners should also be avoided. Calorie-free artificial sweeteners, like those found in diet sodas, are so sweet that they tend to desensitize our taste buds, meaning that we may end up craving (and needing) more sugar to get the same sensation of sweet! But not all sugars are bad for us.\nNaturally occurring sugars\nNaturally occurring sugars (like those found in fruits and milk products) are generally much healthier for us because they’re complexed or bound together with other good nutrients, like fiber (in the case of fruit), protein and calcium (in the case of milk). Lactose is the disaccharide found in milk and dairy products. These foods can be an important part of a healthy diet when eaten in the right amounts…but remember: everything in moderation! Full fat dairy products are still rich in saturated fats, which can contribute to elevated cholesterol levels if eaten in excess. Take the middle road – if you like dairy, choose moderate amounts of low fat dairy products, like low fat milk, yoghurts, cottage cheese and other cheeses. Especially during periods of rapid growth like pregnancy or the teenage years, these nutrients can be an important part of a healthy diet.\nUnlike the one- or two-unit sugars (simple carbohydrates), complex carbohydrates are made up of many glucose molecules linked together by chemical bonds. Starchy foods, including potatoes, bread, pasta, and rice are high in complex carbohydrates, but the degree to which these are “heart healthy” depends - mostly on how much fiber they contain.\nHow can fiber help to reduce cholesterol levels and protect heart health?\nDietary fiber is also a form of complex carbohydrate. The major difference is that dietary fiber contains little or no calories because our bodies cannot break down the bonds between the single sugar units in this kind of complex carbohydrate. Additionally, there are two subtypes of dietary fiber: 1) soluble fiber and 2) insoluble fiber.\nWhat is soluble fiber and how can it support health?\nSoluble fiber dissolves in water and can play an important part in lowering cholesterol levels because it inhibits the absorption of cholesterol back into the bloodstream. Soluble fiber can be found in foods like unprocessed oatmeal, oat bran, apples, prunes and some legumes, like kidney beans.\nWhat is insoluble fiber and how can it support health?\nInsoluble fiber absorbs water (like a sponge) and acts as a stool softener, speeding up the passage of food through the intestinal tract. This prevents constipation, a common problem in those who eat a diet that is high in refined (low-fiber) carbohydrates. Insoluble fiber is found in foods like wheat bran, lentils and flex seeds. Both types of fiber are found in fruits and vegetables.\nWhat are the best carbohydrates for heart health?\nIn order to eat a heart healthy diet, the carbohydrates we choose should ideally be unrefined, to support intestinal health and maximize nutrient density. This means choosing whole-grain breads over white breads and brown rice over white rice whenever possible. Unrefined carbohydrates take longer to digest so they also sustain satiety, delaying the return of hunger and helping to stabilize blood sugar levels. All of these factors can lead to better general health - and a healthier heart.\nBy Maya Adam, MD, Adapted from Food, Love, Family, A Practical Guide to Child Nutrition"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:8f02102e-3b43-49d9-99fc-f12b4fb744d6>","<urn:uuid:a119a23d-8dc9-4018-8953-a96cffb680ab>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I'm interested in container gardening - how do growing requirements differ between seedlings in biodegradable containers versus storing harvested butternut squash?","answer":"Seedlings in biodegradable containers need a sunny location and consistent watering, with containers that allow water drainage to prevent overly wet soil. These containers can be planted directly into the ground when the plant gets bigger. In contrast, harvested butternut squash requires specific storage conditions: a cool environment of 50-55°F (10-13°C) with 60-80% relative humidity, such as an unheated garage or cool basement, and they don't need sunlight or water during storage.","context":["Plant a Seed with Courtney!\nWe’re going to plant seedlings today! Here is what we will need:\n- A container (A pot, egg carton, egg shell, paper cup, etc.)\n- Potting Soil\n- Seeds (You can use any garden variety seed. If you’re using seeds from a packet, make sure to read the back to see what conditions your plant grows best in. If you don’t have access to garden supplies, unroasted sunflower seeds and dried beans from the pantry work great.)\n- Sunny spot for your plant\nGather all your supplies together and make sure you’re in a work space that can get a little dirty.\n- If you’re using egg shells for your seedlings, make sure to wash the membrane out from the inside the shell and let it dry before using it.\n- Whatever container you’re using, make sure that water can filter out of the bottom when you water, so the soil doesn’t get too wet.\nFill your container 2/3rds of the way with potting soil.\nPlace your seed on top of the soil.\nPlace a thin layer of soil on top of the seed. How much soil you use will depend on the seed.\n- Each seed type has a different recommended depth that that plant likes to be buried in. If using seed from a packet, follow the recommendations for how deep down the seed should be.\n- If you’re using unroasted sunflower seeds or dried beans from the pantry, make sure to put an inch or two of soil on top of the seed.\nGive your newly planted seeds a good drink of water (enough that the soil feels wet to the touch) and set it in a sunny spot. Seeds need sun, water, and nutrients to grow healthy and strong. A sunny window sill or a sunny spot in the yard work great.\nMake sure to keep watering and checking on your seed every day or so. You can tell if it needs water by how the soil feels. If it feels dry, go ahead and water. Seeds like water in the beginning. As it grows bigger and stronger, you can water it less often.\nWhen your seed gets big and strong, you can either keep growing it in your container or you can transplant it into a bigger container or a spot outside.\n- Biodegradable seed containers, like paper and cardboard, can be put directly into the ground.\n- For sturdier materials, like glass, Terra Cotta, etc. you can gently remove the plant from the container and put into a large container of soil, making sure all the roots are covered.\nIt can take some patience while you wait for your seed to grow, but once you start seeing green leaves, it usually picks up the pace. Every once and a while, a seed just doesn’t grow. If you don’t see results in about 2 or 3 weeks, try again. You can also plant several plants at once, so if a seed doesn’t make it, you have a few back ups.","When (and How) to Harvest and Store Butternut SquashButternut squash are one of the most popular winter squash, and often the first one that gardeners try to grow. But since butternut squash takes a long time to ripen, it can be difficult to know exactly when they are ready to pick.\nHarvest butternut squash after they have completely changed to their final cream color and the stem attached turns brown, which could take at least 95 days from transplanting. Remove butternut squash while leaving at least an inch of stem attached to prolong shelf life. After harvesting, cure for 7 to 10 days at 80-85°F (27-29°C) and then store in a cool place around 50-55°F (10-13°C) with 60-80% relative humidity.\nFrom Seed to Harvest – How Long Will It Take?\nButternut squash, like most winter squash, takes a long time from sowing seeds to harvesting. Generally, you can expect to wait anywhere from 95 to 115 days from transplanting until harvest, and seeds take around 7 to 14 days to sprout, so you could be waiting for four months from planting until you pick your first butternut squash.\nGardeners who live in short growing seasons will have to plant butternut some time in spring or very early summer in order to guarantee a harvest before their first fall frost.\nIf you want butternuts sooner, you can try growing shorter season varieties. Many of the fastest growing winter squash are butternuts, such as Early Butternut (85-90 days) and Butterbush (75-85 days). You will still be waiting a long time, but an early variety could shave off a month from the typical days to maturity.\nHow to Tell When Your Butternut Squash Are Ready to Harvest\nThere are a few telltale signs that your butternut squash is ready to pick.\nAlways make sure your butternut squash has completely changed to its color when it’s ripe. It should change from pale green to the typical pale cream color. Check all around the squash to make sure there are no more green spots.\nAnother sign your butternut squash is fully ripe is to check the color of the stem sticking out of the squash. If the stem is still green, that means the plant is still sending energy and nutrients to the developing fruit (squash). Once the stem starts turning brown or dries up, that means the squash is fully developed and can be picked.\nThere is also the fingernail test. I haven’t tried it but many gardeners attest to it. Basically, you take your thumb and press your nail into the skin of the butternut squash. If it goes in easily, it’s not ready yet. If your nail is having a tough time getting through the skin, then it’s ready to pick.\nCan I Harvest Unripe Butternut Squash?\nI was curious about this, since I know other gourds and squash can be picked early, and it turns out yes, you can definitely harvest unripe butternut squash.\nThe caveat is that it won’t have the same taste or sweetness as ripe butternut squash and it won’t have a long shelf life. If you pick unripe, green butternuts, treat them more like a summer squash instead of a winter squash.\nHow to Harvest Butternut Squash\nOnce you know your butternuts are ready to pick, you simply need to cut them off at the stem, leaving an inch or so of stem attached to the squash. This will help your butternut squash keep longer in storage.\nIt’s really that simple to harvest butternut squash, but after harvesting, you should cure them to increase their shelf life and improve their flavor.\nCuring Your Harvested Butternut Squash\nAfter harvesting your butternut squash, it’s recommended to cure them before storing and eating them. Curing winter squash like butternuts is the process of drying out the surface of the skin, which will seal any cuts, toughen up the skin, and make your butternut squash last much longer in storage [PDF]. In this process, butternuts will lose some moisture, which will concentrate the flavors.\nYou do not have to cure butternut squash for very long; anywhere from 7 to 10 days should suffice. During this time, keep your butternut squash at a temperature of around 80-85°F (27-29°C). Some growers keep them outside for curing, but make sure they are safe from pests and stay dry.\nStoring Butternut Squash\nButternut squash can last months in storage, possibly up to 6 months, although most will last around 4 months.\nButternut squash should be stored in a cool environment, around 50-55°F (10-13°C) and a relative humidity between 60-80%. An unheated garage, root cellar, or cool basement make good storage locations.\nDuring this time, butternut squash will continue to improve in flavor. As they sit in storage, enzymes inside your butternuts will continue turning starches into sugars, and the slow, gradual water loss from the skin will concentrate those flavors even more.\nIn fact, if you are kind of disappointed eating your butternuts soon after harvesting, you will notice your butternuts taste significantly better after a few months in storage. Some say butternut squash tastes best starting after 2 months from harvesting.\nStoring Butternut Squash in Hot Climates\nIf you live in the south and don’t have any place cool enough to store butternut squash long-term, I would recommend storing them in the coolest part of your home or garage for a month or so to develop the flavor, and then chop them up and freeze them or can them."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:091004e6-9bd4-4c8d-a51d-3cd237cfe3d1>","<urn:uuid:8870028d-01a8-4c92-8541-4f9f1437c64b>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What switching options do the Fender Esquire and Stratocaster offer, and how do they compare?","answer":"The Fender Esquire features a 3-way switch that functions as a tone-shaper: position #1 bypasses the tone control for a hotter lead sound, position #2 routes through volume and tone controls for a warmer sound, and position #3 uses a fixed treble roll-off network for a dark tone. The Stratocaster originally had a 3-way pickup selector switch, but players discovered they could jam it between positions to get additional pickup combinations. In 1977, Fender officially introduced a 5-way selector switch, allowing players to select various pickup combinations including the popular 'quacky' tone from positions 2 and 4, which combine multiple pickups.","context":["I admit that the Fender Esquire is one of my favorite guitars ever, and I find its sound and simplicity very appealing.\nI admit that the Fender Esquire is one of my favorite guitars ever, and I find its sound and simplicity very appealing. Most people think of it as a poor man's Telecaster or a forerunner to the Tele, but this is simply wrong. Yes, the Esquire sports only a single bridge pickup, while the Telecaster has two pickups, but the Esquire is not a Telecaster with a missing neck pickup, but rather a distinct model with its own sound. This is because of its unique wiring and also because the lack of a neck pickup causes less magnetic pull on the strings. This reduced pull gives the Esquire a more percussive attack, more harmonic overtones, and makes it more responsive than a Telecaster.\nSome great players have chosen an Esquire for exactly these reasons. Steve Cropper played a '62 Esquire on all his early recordings, including the classic “Green Onions.\" Up until his untimely death in 1968, Luther Perkins used an Esquire to create his trademark “boomchicka- boom\" sound while backing Johnny Cash. Bruce Springsteen played a heavily modified '53/'54 Esquire that he bought in the early '70s and used on Born in the USA and many more of his famous recordings.\nThe Esquire (or to be precise, an Esquire prototype painted black) first appeared in the No. 2 Fender catalog in the spring of 1950, and was shown to the public at the Chicago NAMM show in July of that year. It had a list price of $139.95, plus $39.95 for the case. The original Esquire was built until late 1969, when CBS dropped it from the production line, very shortly after taking over Fender.\nThe Esquire was Leo Fender's first stroke of genius and an important step in his restless efforts to transport steel guitar tone to a standard electric guitar. The bridge pickup was very similar to the pickup he developed and built for his lap steel guitar, and the Esquire's electronics clearly show this influence, too. As you may know, like the Tele, the Esquire has a 3-way switch, plus a master volume and master tone configuration. But on a single-pickup guitar, how do you use a “pickup selector\" switch? Leo's idea was to use the 3-way switch as a kind of tone-shaper.\nHere are the specifics:\n- Position #1. This corresponds to the solo bridge-pickup position on a Tele. On the Esquire, however, the pickup is routed through the volume control only, with the tone control bypassed for a hotter and louder lead sound with even more high-end.\n- Position #2. In this middle setting, the Esquire's pickup is routed through the volume and tone control—identical to position #1 on a standard Telecaster. It sounds a bit warmer compared to the Esquire's #1 position.\n- Position #3. Here, the tone control is again bypassed and the Esquire's pickup is routed through the volume control and a fixed “treble roll-off \" capacitor/resistor network for a very dark tone that also has a slightly decreased output. Leo intended this as a “bass preset\" that would allow the '50s guitar player to enter bass territory by simply flipping the 3-way switch.\nFig. 1 Theschematic forthe original 1950Fender Esquire.\nWiring diagram courtesy of SeymourDuncan.\nUntil the production of the Esquire was halted by CBS in late 1969, switching positions #1 and #2 stayed the same, but the value of the pots were changed several times. Switching position #3 was modified several times with different values for the caps and resistors, and the Esquire even had a “capacitor only\" version for some time. This clearly indicates that #3 was not very popular among Esquire players, which is still the case today. Only a few players will find this option useful, but in the early '80s Mike Stern and several other jazz players discovered that old Esquires and Telecasters (which had the same preset in the '50s) were great workhorses and a good alternative to the well-known “jazz box.\" Suddenly the old Fender preset wiring was something desirable, as it worked perfectly for those dark tones a lot of jazz players were looking for and a new hype was born. So if you are a jazz cat, this preset option may be worth a try.\nIn closing, Fig. 1 shows the wiring of the original 1950 Esquire as a reference. Next month, we'll start modifying the Esquire circuit, so study up on this schematic and stay tuned. I think you'll be surprised how many different tones you can coax from a single bridge pickup.

The Fender Musical Instruments Corporation has continuously manufactured the Stratocaster from 1954 to the present. It is a double-cutaway guitar, with an extended top \"horn\" shape for balance. Along with the Gibson Les Paul, it is one of the most often emulated electric guitar shapes. \"Stratocaster\" and \"Strat\" are trademark terms belonging to Fender.\nThe Stratocaster is a versatile guitar, usable for most styles of music and has been used in many genres, including country, rock, pop, folk, soul, rhythm and blues, blues, jazz, punk, and heavy metal.\nThe Fender Stratocaster was the first guitar to feature three pickups and a spring tension tremolo system, as well as being the first Fender with a contoured body. The Stratocaster's sleek, contoured body shape (officially referred to by Fender as the \"Comfort Contour Body\") differed from the flat, slab-like design of the Telecaster. The Stratocaster's double cutaways allowed players easier access to higher positions on the neck.\nStarting in 1954, the Stratocaster was offered with a solid, deeply contoured ash body, a 21-fret one-piece maple neck with black dot inlays, and Kluson tuning heads. The color was originally a two color sunburst pattern, although custom color guitars were produced (most famously Eldon Shamblin's gold Stratocaster, dated 6/1954). In 1956, Fender began using alder for sunburst and most custom color Stratocaster bodies; ash was still used on translucent blonde instruments. In 1960, the available custom colors were standardized, many of which were automobile lacquer colors from DuPont available at an additional 5% cost. A unique single-ply, 8-screw hole white pickguard held all electronic components except the recessed jack plate—facilitating easy assembly.\nOriginal Stratocasters were shipped with five tremolo springs, with the bridge set up to 'float,' with the pull of the strings in one direction countering the pull of the springs in the opposite direction. In this floating position, players could move the bridge-mounted tremolo arm up or down to modulate the pitch of the notes being played. Hank Marvin, Jeff Beck and Ike Turner used the Strat's floating tremolo extensively in their playing. As string gauges have changed, players have experimented with the number of tremolo springs, and modern Stratocasters ship with three springs. While the floating bridge has some advantages, some musicians find that these are outweighed by the tendency of the guitar to temporarily go out of tune during double-stop string bends, and many Stratocaster players tighten the tremolo springs so that the bridge is firmly anchored against the guitar body: in this configuration, the tremolo arm can still be used to slacken the strings and therefore lower the pitch, but it cannot be used to raise the pitch. (As the pitch can be raised through string bending, this can be a good compromise, depending on a player's style.) Some players, such as Eric Clapton and Ronnie Wood, feel that floating bridge has an excessive propensity to detune guitars and so inhibit the bridge's movement with a chunk of wood wedged between the bridge block and the inside cutout of the tremolo cavity and by increasing the tension on the tremolo springs; these procedures lock the bridge in a fixed position. Some Strats have a fixed bridge in place of the tremolo assembly; these are colloquially called \"hard-tails\". There is considerable debate about the effects on tone and sustain of the material used in the tremolo system's 'inertia bar' and many aftermarket versions are available.\nThe Stratocaster features three single coil pickups, with the output originally selected by a 3-way switch. Guitarists soon discovered that by jamming the switch in between the 1st and 2nd position, both the bridge and middle pickups could be selected, and similarly, the middle and neck pickups could be selected between the 2nd and 3rd position. In 1977 Fender introduced a 5-way selector making such pickup combinations more stable.\nThe \"quacky\" tone of the middle and bridge pickups, popularized by players such as Stevie Ray Vaughan, David Gilmour, Rory Gallagher, Mark Knopfler, Bob Dylan, Scott Thurston, Ronnie Wood, John Mayer, Ed King, Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton and Robert Cray, can be obtained by using the pickup selector in positions 2 and 4. Since the pickups of 5-way switch-equipped guitars are wound with alternating polarities (N-S-N or S-N-S), some amount of phase cancellation occurs, effectively creating a spaced humbucking pair, resulting in a characteristic sound. The neck and middle pickups are each wired to a tone control that incorporates a single, shared tone capacitor, whereas the bridge pickup, which is slanted towards the high strings for a more trebly sound, has no tone control for maximum brightness. On many modern Stratocasters, the first tone affects the neck pickup; the second tone affects the middle and bridge pickups; on some Artist Series models (Eric Clapton and Buddy Guy signature guitars), the first tone is a presence circuit that cuts or boosts treble and bass frequencies, affecting all the pickups; the second tone is an active midrange booster that boosts the midrange frequencies up to 25 dB (12 dB on certain models) to produce a fatter humbucker-like sound.\nDick Dale is a prominent Stratocaster player who also collaborated with Leo Fender in developing the Fender Showman amplifier. In the early 1960s, the instrument was also championed by Hank Marvin, guitarist for the Shadows, a band that originally backed Cliff Richard and then produced instrumentals of its own. In 1965, George Harrison and John Lennon acquired Stratocasters and used them for Help!, Rubber Soul and later recording sessions; the double unison guitar solo on \"Nowhere Man\" is played by Harrison and Lennon on their new Stratocasters.\nAfter the introduction of the Fender Stratocaster Ultra series in 1989, ebony was officially selected as a fretboard material on some models (although several Elite Series Stratocasters manufactured in 1983/84 such as the Gold and Walnut were available with a stained ebony fretboard). In December 1965 the Stratocaster was given a broader headstock with altered decals to match the size of the Jazzmaster and the Jaguar.\nDuring the CBS era, particularly the 1970s, the perceived quality of Fender instruments fell. During this time, vintage instruments from the pre-CBS era became popular.\nWhen the Fender company was bought from CBS by a group of investors and employees headed by Bill Schultz in 1985, manufacturing resumed its former high quality and Fender was able to regain market share and brand reputation. Dan Smith, with the help of John Page, proceeded to work on a reissue of the most popular guitars of Leo Fender's era. They decided to manufacture two Vintage reissue Stratocaster models, the one-piece maple neck 1957 and a rosewood-fretboard 1962 along with the maple-neck 1952 Telecaster, the maple-neck 1957 and rosewood-fretboard 1962 Precision Basses, as well as the rosewood-fretboard \"stacked knob\" 1962 Jazz Bass. These first few years (1982–1984) of reissues, known as American Vintage Reissues, are now high-priced collector's items and considered as some of the finest to ever leave Fender's Fullerton plant, which closed its doors in late 1984.\nIn 1985, Fender's US production of the Vintage reissues resumed into a new 14,000 square-foot factory at Corona, California, located about 20 miles away from Fullerton. Some early reissues from 1986 were crafted with leftover parts from the Fullerton factory. These three guitars formed an important part of the American Vintage Series line since July 10, 1998.\nAs well as the vintage reissues, Fender launched an updated model in 1987: the American Standard Stratocaster. This was tailored to the demands of modern players, notably having a flatter fingerboard, a thinner neck profile and an improved tremolo system. This model line has been continuously improved and is remains in production as of 2017. The model line received upgrades in 2000, when it was renamed as the American Series Stratocaster, and again in 2008, when the American Standard name was restored.\nFender has also manufactured guitars in the Far East, notably Japan, and in Mexico, where the affordable 'Standard' series guitars are built.\nSquier models (1982–today)\nA standard Squier Stratocaster is mass-produced in factories located in Indonesia or China. For its construction, Squier usually uses woods readily available in those countries, such as agathis and basswood. They also use stamped metal hardware and multiple pieces of wood in construction to reduce waste and to lower costs. In some cases, the body is laminated, much like a plywood, rather than consisting of two or three solid pieces glued together.\nAfter Fender's decision in 1982 to switch Squier's production from strings to guitars, the Stratocaster was one of the first models put under the Squier production line in Japan. It was the most commercially successful guitar Fender had produced. Originally in 1982, the headstock had a \"Fender\" name written in large script, followed by \"Squier series\" in smaller script. In 1983, this was later changed to the current 1970s large headstock featuring \"Squier\" in larger script, followed by \"by Fender\" in smaller script. Since then, there have been several variations of headstock size and Squier logos, typically based on what series the guitar is.\nFrom 1996-1999, \"Made in China\" Squier Stratocasters carry the \"Affinity\" decal on the smaller ball end of the headstock and have serial numbers as NCXXXX with the first number the year of manufacture, e.g. NC6XXX (Made in China 1996). NCXXXX is also used for Squier Strat Bullets of the same vintage. The Affinities are practically the same as the Japanese-made Squier Bullets of the mid-1980s; the same alder bodies, same rosewood-type fretboard and maple necks. Tuners and electronics are also very similar. Common modifications are more stable tuners, larger potentiometers, better capacitors, and pickups. They had single-ply 8-hole pickguards like the 1950s Fender Strats giving them a classic look. Colors were typically black, white and red.\nIn 2000, for the anniversary of the Squier line of Stratocaster guitars, that year's model was offered in a limited-edition green finish. The \"Crafted in China\" Squier Affinity Strats are different from their immediate predecessors; most have alder bodies, larger headstock shapes, and somewhat inferior small parts. The pickguards generally now have 11 holes and screws, departing from the original 1950s style.\nIn 2008 Squier released its Classic Vibe series, a series of electric guitars and basses mirroring classic Fender designs of the 1950s and 1960s—each roughly reflecting the hardware, woods, color variations, finishes, body contours, and tonal characteristics of their respective era; Squier states that they did not intend the series as completely era correct, but wanted to impart the 'vibe' of a classic Fender design—the vintage-quality feel, look, and sound of their first series of guitars in 1982.\nNotable Stratocaster players\n- D'arcy, David (November 12, 2000). \"ART/ARCHITECTURE; Strummed by One Hand, Sculptured by Another\".

{"question":"How does BREEAM's certification rating system compare to the World Green Building Council's approach in terms of their impact on business value?","answer":"BREEAM uses a specific scoring system with rating levels based on percentage scores (Pass ≥30%, Good ≥45%, Very Good ≥55%, Excellent ≥70%, Outstanding ≥85%), while the World Green Building Council emphasizes that green buildings provide tangible business benefits through operational cost savings and increased workplace productivity. The WorldGBC report demonstrates that sustainable buildings can be delivered at prices comparable to conventional buildings, with investments recoverable through operational savings, while BREEAM's mandatory certification for UK government projects requires 'excellent' ratings for new projects and 'very good' for refurbishments.","context":["World Green Building Council showcases cost-effective Green Building benefits throughout the world\nNew report released recently highlights financial value of green buildings to business communities\nA new comprehensive report recently released from the World Green Building Council (WorldGBC), highlights that there are a large number of compelling benefits from green buildings received by different stakeholders throughout the life cycle of a building.\nThe report, “The Business Case for Green Building: A Review of the Costs and Benefits for Developers, Investors and Occupants,” examines whether or not it’s possible to attach a financial value to the cost and benefits of green buildings. Today, green buildings can be delivered at a price comparable to conventional buildings and investments can be recouped through operational cost savings and, with the right design features, create a more productive workplace.\n“This report synthesizes credible evidence from around the world on green buildings into one collective resource, and the evidence presented highlights that sustainable buildings provide tangible benefits and make clear business sense,” said Jane Henley, CEO of WorldGBC. “From risk mitigation across a building portfolio and city-wide economic benefits, to the improved health and well-being of individual building occupants, the business case for green building will continue to evolve as markets mature. Indeed we have already seen this momentum grow globally where in more and more places, green is now becoming the status quo.”\n“This latest global research further reinforces and supports the findings in our own publication, ‘The Rands and Sense of Green Buildings’ which sets out the economic case for green building in a clear, incontestable manner based on local evidence and tangible case studies. It dispels the myth that green building is more expensive, lists the benefits of green building and provides the local proof of these,” explains Green Building Council of South Africa (GBCSA) CEO, Brian Wilkinson.\nKey findings include:\nThe report concludes that by greening our built environment at the neighborhood and city scales, the green building industry can deliver on large-scale economic priorities such as climate change mitigation, energy security, resource conservation and job creation, long-term resilience and quality of life.\n“This report underscores that green buildings play a fundamental and cost-efficient role in tackling some of the immediate challenges of our times,” said Rick Fedrizzi, chair of the WorldGBC and president, CEO and founding chair of the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC). “The WorldGBC is proud to continue to play a leadership role in the explosive growth of global green building industry as we all continue to create a world that will give people better, brighter, healthier spaces to live, work and play.”\n“We are optimistic that reviews of this nature will continue to influence the strategies of many astute property investors, owners and developers and that the economic business case will be the key driver in ensuring that green building becomes the accepted standard for all property projects,” concludes Wilkinson.\nThis report was produced in partnership with PRP Environmental along with the following sponsors: Skanska, Grosvenor, and the Abu Dhabi Urban Planning Council/Estidama.\nAbout the World Green Building Council\nThe World Green Building Council (WorldGBC) is a network of national Green Building Councils (GBCs) from around the world, making it the largest international organisation influencing the green building marketplace. Green Building Councils are member-based organisations that partner with industry and government in the transformation of their building industries towards sustainability through the adoption of green building practices. On the ground in over 90 countries, GBCs create change in their local markets as a way to globalize environmentally and socially responsible building practices. Visit: www.worldgbc.org\nAbout the Green Building Council of South Africa\nThe GBCSA was the 13th Council to be established and is widely regarded as South Africa’s official independent green building authority. Established in 2007 by leaders from all sectors of the commercial property industry, the GBCSA has a national network of over 1000 corporate members, with over 3400 citizens having completed the accredited course and 539 practicing Accredited Professionals in the field.\nThe GBCSA chairs the African regional network of established and emerging councils.\nIssued by the Green Building Council of South Africa\nGreen Building Council of South Africa\n0861 0 GBCSA | 083 254 8728\ncomments powered by Disqus","Green building certification systems\nGreen building certification systems are a set of rating systems and tools that are used to assess a building or a construction project's performance from a sustainability and environmental perspective. Such ratings aim to improve the overall quality of buildings and infrastructures, integrate a life cycle approach in its design and construction, and promote the fulfillment of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals by the construction industry. Buildings that have been assessed and are deemed to meet a certain level of performance and quality, receive a certificate proving this achievement.\nAccording to the Global Status Report 2017 published by United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) in coordination with the International Energy Agency (IEA), buildings and construction activities together contribute to 36% of the global energy use and 39% of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Through certification, the associated environmental impacts during the lifecycle of buildings and other infrastructures (typically design, construction, operation and maintenance) could be better understood and mitigated. Currently, more than 100 building certifications systems exist around the world. The most popular building certification models today are BREEAM (UK), LEED (US), and DGNB (Germany).\nIn the mid-1980s, environmental issues were in the news and public attention due to different international disasters such as the Bhopal disaster (1984), Chernobyl nuclear explosion (1986) and the Exxon Valdez tanker spill (1989). Lifecycle assessments (LCAs) were starting to gain traction from its initial stages in the 1970s to the 1980s and it was in 1991 that the term was first coined. With increasing cognizance of environmental impacts due to human activities, a more comprehensive assessment of buildings utilizing the principles of LCA was much sought after. In 1990, the first Sustainability Assessment Method for buildings, BREEAM was released. In 1993, Rick Fedrizzi, David Gottfried and Mike Italiano formed the world's first Green Building Council (GBC) with the U.S. Green Building Council. Their mission was to promote sustainability-focused practices in the building and construction industry and advance sustainable building principles. USGBC was further responsible for the creation of the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) green building rating system in 1998. The integration of energy usage, materials performance and other building-related environmental issues, along with an aim towards standardizing the comparison of assessments led to more comprehensive building assessment methods.\nWith the principles of green building gaining momentum, several more GBCs were established across the world. In 2002, the World Green Building Council was officially formed to bring all the GBCs under one roof. GBCs from Australia, Brazil, Canada, India, Japan, Mexico, Spain, and USA were the founding members. As of 2018-19, there are 69 Green Building Councils under the World Green Building Council organization.\nGoals and benefits of Building CertificationEdit\nThe goal of all certification rating systems is to provide tools and methods to assess the environmental and resource-efficient performance of a building. The main objectives of such tools are:\n- optimize building performance and minimize environmental impacts\n- provide a way to quantify a building’s environmental effects\n- set standards and benchmarks to assess buildings objectively\nFurthermore, the end result of such an assessment is to provide a certificate verifying the achievement of the desired performance and quality of the building. Some benefits of certifying a building or a property include:\n- the negative impacts of a building on the environment can be better understood and this knowledge can be utilized to reduce such impacts.\n- holistic sustainability considerations will be made for the fulfillment of technical, economic, social and functional requirements of the building.\n- promotes sustainable design and construction principles throughout the building lifecycle.\n- increases the monetary value of a building or a property in the real estate market.\nBuilding Certification Systems used around the worldEdit\nThe German Sustainable Building Council (Deutsche Gesellschaft für nachhaltiges Bauen e.V., DGNB in German) introduced its own green building certification in 2009 together with the German Federal Ministry of Traffic, Construction and Urban Development (Bundesministerium für Verkehr, Bau und Stadtentwicklung in German). The DGNB certification is voluntary and is based on German codes and standards (DIN and VDI). It is generally regarded as more comprehensive than BREEAM and LEED. The DGNB System is based on the three main paradigms of:\n- Life-cycle assessment\n- Holistic sustainability (environment, economy and society)\n- Performance-based approach.\nIt also takes into consideration the economic aspects and as such, also assesses the associated Life Cycle Costs and Value Creation of the building. It has six assessment categories and further assigns different weights to each category indicator.\n|Category||Weightage in %|\n|Sociocultural and functional quality||22.5|\n|Site quality||(Separate assessment)|\nThe assessment is done by an auditor who is appointed by the project contractor. The auditor supports the contractor and supervises the construction process from the initial registration up to the certification and the project conclusion.\n|Rating level||Percentage score|\n|Bronze||≥35% (only for existing buildings)|\nThe Sweden Green Building Council introduced its own certification system in 2011 with Miljöbyggnad which is based on Swedish standards and legislations. It is currently in its 3rd iteration with Miljöbyggnad 3.1 released in April 2020. Miljöbyggnad has three levels of certification: Bronze, Silver and Gold. It is used to certify both new and existing constructions. It assesses 3 categories, namely:\n- Energy consumption\n- Indoor environment\n- Materials and chemicals.\nAmong these categories, there are 15 further sub-categories which have its own set of requirements for each certification levels. For example, for the \"Energy use\" sub-category, Bronze level requires energy use to be less than 65% of the requirements of the BBR, the Swedish Building Code. After 3 years, another follow-up inspection is conducted to see that everything is in the correct order and the standards are still being met.\nBesides Miljöbyggnad, the Sweden Green Building Council also administers the Swedish version of the British BREEAM adapted for the Swedish construction practices and standards, called BREEAM-SE. It was first introduced in Sweden in 2013 and is used to certify new constructions.\nThe Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM) is recognized as the first Sustainability Assessment Method for buildings. It was launched in 1990 by the UK-based organization Building Research Establishment (BRE).\nBREEAM certification is carried out on the basis of a scoring system where projects are assessed on the basis of 10 categories (with individual weightings differing by project type) as follows:\n- Health and well-being\n- Land use and ecology\n- Surface water run-off\nEach category is sub-divided into a range of assessment indicators, each having its own aim, target and benchmarks. When a target or benchmark is reached, the asset is given credits (or points) by a qualified BREEAM assessor. The category score is calculated according to the number of credits attained and the category weightings. Once the development has been fully assessed, the final performance rating is determined by the sum of the weighted category scores. The final performance rating is specified as:\n|Rating Level||Percentage score|\nA qualified assessor evaluates a building or project and ensures that it meets the quality and performance standards of the selected scheme. In some countries such as Netherlands, Germany and Sweden, there are national operators that officially certify for BREEAM adapted to that country's standards, processes and construction methods.\nBREEAM certification has also been made mandatory for governmental construction projects in the UK. According to the Common Minimum Standards for governmental construction, an environmental assessment is required on all public projects and further states that, \"where BREEAM is used, all new projects are to achieve an 'excellent' rating and all refurbishment projects are to achieve at least 'very good' rating.\"\nIn 1998, the US Green Building Council devised its own building certification system through the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification. It has its own set of criteria for assessment and utilizes the ASHRAE codes and standards. Due to its simplicity and ease-of-use, the LEED quickly gained international recognition within a short period. Over the years, LEED has undergone many changes and is now currently in its fourth iteration, which was launched in late 2013.\n- Building Design and Construction: For new construction or major renovations\n- Interior Design and Construction: For commercial interior fit-out projects\n- Building Operations and Maintenance: For existing buildings undergoing improvement but with little construction work\n- Neighborhood Development: For new land development projects or redevelopment projects\n- Homes: For single family, low-rise multi-family or mid-rise multi-family homes\n- Cities and Communities: For entire cities or sub-sections of a city. Assessment of a city's water consumption, energy use, waste, transportation etc.\n- LEED Recertification: For occupied and currently-in-use projects that have already received LEED certification but aiming to maintain and improve the building.\n- LEED Zero: For projects with net-zero goals in carbon emissions and resource use.\nLEED certification is voluntary and a qualified assessor evaluates the projects on the basis of various established categories. These categories are as follows:\n- Integrative process\n- Location and transportation\n- Sustainable sites\n- Water efficiency\n- Energy and atmosphere\n- Materials and resources\n- Indoor environmental quality\n- Innovation in design\n- Regional priority\nThe four levels of LEED certification are: Platinum, Gold, Silver and Certified.\n|Rating level||Points required|\n- Kosanović, Klein, Konstantinou, Radivojević, Hildebrand (2018).

{"question":"What are the similarities between how McCarthyism targeted dissent in the 1950s and how terrorism concerns affected civil liberties after 9/11?","answer":"During McCarthyism, basic constitutional rights were challenged as people feared losing their jobs due to their political affiliations, with McCarthy's actions turning the country into an anti-Communist nation moved by fear rather than laws. Similarly, concerns arose about American constitutional democracy in the years following 9/11, with Dr. Shalala suggesting that 'terrorism' had become the new 'communism' in terms of its impact on civil liberties. This parallel was exemplified by Senator Russell Feingold being the only senator to vote against the USA PATRIOT Act in 2001, much like how few stood against McCarthy's actions in the 1950s.","context":["The Right to Dissent is Crucial to American Democracy\nKey Concerns of Young Voters Highlighted\nWhat is the meaning of \"American democracy?\" What are the core values that underlie the American society and polity? These questions were addressed Tuesday during the first in a discussion series, underwritten by the Taube Philanthropies and organized by the Division of United States Studies, devoted to American democracy and values.\nDr. Donna Shalala, president of the University of Miami, suggested in her keynote address that the core values underlying American democracy reflect a philosophy of rights: the rights to religion, assembly, petition, press, and equality. Her emphasis, however, was on what she viewed as the key value: the importance of individual thought and the right to dissent.\nShalala traced dissent as it has been exercised throughout American history to the benefit of the American democracy and society. Citing George Mason, Alexis de Tocqueville, Langston Hughes, Margaret Chase Smith, and the eight senators profiled in John F. Kennedy's Profiles in Courage, Shalala commented that Kennedy's book was \"short and spare\" because legislators belong to \"an institution more apt to compromise\" than to value dissent.\nDissent, however, has served the United States well and has frequently evolved into orthodox wisdom in later years. Senator Chase Smith, for example, spoke out against McCarthyism in 1950 before almost any other public figure did so, warning that the rights to think independently and hold unpopular beliefs were in danger. She did so as Senator Joseph McCarthy began his campaign of attacking dissenters whom he accused of Communist sympathies. Shalala in effect updated Kennedy's volume by praising Senator Russell Feingold, the only senator to vote in 2001 against the USA PATRIOT Act. Perhaps, she hypothesized, \"terrorism\" has become the new \"communism.\"\nShalala, who also has served as U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services, expressed both concern about American constitutional democracy in the years since 9/11 and faith in the activism of young people today.\n\"As a university president I have reason to hope for our democracy recovering its vitality,\" she stated. She cited the sharp increase in the youth voter turnout in recent primaries and elections and young people's interest in accessing political information through the Internet and text messages. The economy, the Iraq War, education, health care and global warming are key issues for eligible voters between the ages of 18 to 29. Their involvement is important, Shalala said, because \"democracy, like a garden, needs fresh infusions to stay vibrant.\" While democracy requires \"great and courageous individuals, in the end it is a collective act.\" For this country, it is an act built on a solid foundation of rights.\nA history of activism\nDemocracy also requires constant work and sacrifice, said Moses Boyd, principal of Integrated Solutions Group of the Washington Group. Arguing against the assumption that the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution guarantee American liberty, Boyd, a former Wilson Center Public Policy Scholar, noted that today's freedom rests on a history of activism and social movements: by African Americans and other racial and ethnic minorities, women, labor unions, sexual minorities, people with disabilities, and so on. The questions today are how the country can retain the civic engagement of young people caught up in the current election campaign, protect freedom of the press, and reform the educational system so that it conveys basic American values.\nPeter Levine, Director of The Center for Information and Research on Civil Learning and Engagement (CIRCLE), listed the pedagogical mechanisms that have proved successful in conveying American values to young people: teaching American history and government, discussing current events, mandating community service that is connected to academic studies, encouraging extra-curricular activities such as student governments and school newspapers, giving students a voice in running their schools, and organizing simulations of such phenomena as trials. Unfortunately, he said, those options are provided differently both among and within schools, with their being made available disproportionately to students who are headed to selective colleges and universities. More students must in fact be prepared for college as a step toward becoming active citizens, he argued, as only one out of 14 people with no college experience voted in recent primaries – but the rate for those people with college experience was one out of four.\nThe panelists agreed that today's young people have fewer expectations than do their parents of government acting in ways that will benefit them. The unanswered question is what that will do to their participation in civic life and in their adherence to and perpetuation of basic American values.","McCarthyism and its Effects on America\nMcCarthyism not only destroyed the lives and careers of many Americans but also the innocent image of the country. Senator Joe McCarthy from Wisconsin was the same as any man. But when he cried Communism the world seemed to listen.\nFollowing the Cold War between Russia and the United States there came many hardships, such as unemployment and high inflation. These hardships produced a restless society. The society then looked for something or someone to blame (Fried, 39). They found someone to blame. Communists. Throughout the country there was a witch hunt known as the Red Scare. A basic idea was formed: Communism was evil. Anyone who participated in such evil was considered illegitimate and were to be excluded from such things as sharing ideas, and jobs (Reeves, 136). This fear of Communism or anti-Communism as it was called could be described as a type of “virus.” When all was calm in America the virus would fade, but the moment a crisis struck, the virus came back stronger than ever (Feuerlicht, 35). Communism was a threat not only for countries overseas but a threat for America and its people. It was a threat on the American way of life, a bruise on the phrase “the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.” (Feuerlicht, 45) And McCarthy helped spread this fear.\nMcCarthy and his ways challenged the Bill of Rights. “When free speech or due process are denied to any individual everyone’s rights are jeopardized. Today’s oppressors may become tomorrow’s accursed group.” (Feuerlicht, 154) And nothing is guaranteed more than the destruction of America when the freedoms promised by the Bill of Rights are denied (Feuerlicht, 154). McCarthy installed a fear in the people. But people feared tremendously the loss of their jobs. They feared that their political afflictions would reflect on their job status (Reeves, 99). By trying to keep America from becoming a Communist nation, McCarthy and his followers turned the country into an anti – Communist nation. A country that thrived on freedom and was kept in tact by laws would become a country that was moved by fear alone. Laws would hold no meaning and innocent people would be accused (Feuerlicht, 154).\nCommunists were everywhere. But they were hard to identify because Communism was a philosophy. There was no way a person could provide supporting evidence that someone believed in something (Feuerlicht, 154). According to McCarthy there were over 200 Communists in the State Department (Feuerlicht, 55). And some 57 cases of people who fall into the category of card – carrying Communists, loyalist of the Communist Party, or risks to the nation (Divine, 265). Despite the issue of Communists in America there was a bigger issue, Communist spies. Though the truth of the matter is that all countries spy and are spied on, even America. The shock felt by the nation was not lessened (Feuerlicht, 54). Communist spies were the worst kind because they were not the type that stole plans for new weapons they worked from within. They were the people helping us build our policy (Divine, 265). These Communist spies were also hard to find because very few made it easy and confessed to being a spy. One such a person was a German named Klaus Fuchs. He confessed to spying for the Russians while he worked on the development of the atom bomb (Fried, 120).\nMany Americans lives and careers were lost due to McCarthy and his accusations. Hollywood’s leaders resisted allowing politicians to regulate their hiring practices, but following the HUAC hearings the “blacklists” began in Hollywood. No one who was known to be a communist would be employed (Fried, 77-78). Producers started questioning their employees on many topics including politics and affiliations. In the case that the employee’s answers did not fit with the Waldorf Statement which was that no known Communist would be hired, the employee was fired, or let go (Fried, 78). With one exception anyone who confessed, and gave the names of other “Communists” were spared (Garraty, 531). After the blacklists, and the scare of Communism films started containing only anti-Communist themes. Somewhere around forty of these anti-Communism films were made. None of them being very popular or profitable (Fried, 78).\nThe blacklists continued in Hollywood while in the Government offices more than 2,000,000 men and women were subject to loyalty investigations no matter what their status was. The investigations were also required to be done on any person who applied for a federal job (Feuerlicht, 47). Lists of subversive organizations and groups were compiled. Its members weren’t even given a chance to defend themselves. If they belonged to one of the groups listed, they were guilty of “Sympathetic association” and were fired (Feuerlicht, 47). People even began to be punished for things they hadn’t even done. They were punished for what they might do (Feuerlicht, 47-48). Soon almost everyone found their loyalty being questioned. Anyone who liked Russian music, had ever read or owned a book on Communism, especially those who stood up for equal rights of African Americans, and those who stood for civil liberties for Communists (Feuerlicht, 48). Even having a political opinion that was not popular gained you the treatment of a criminal (Garraty, 531).\nNo Part of Society was left untouched. Companies like General Electric, General Motors, CBS, the New York Times, New York City Board of Education, and the United Auto Workers followed Hollywood’s example and fired employees for being Communists. In fact very few companies didn’t fire people (Reeves, 99). Even the schools went along with the dismissal procedures outlined by McCarthy, HUAC, and the FBI. Anyone who did not fit their standards was fired (Reeves, 99). Quite a few people ended up falling victim of these firings. And an estimated 20 percent of these fired people came from the educational system (Reeves, 99).\nMcCarthy was a fraud from the beginning. He never had anything to go on. In fact “the shakier his evidence got the bolder he became.” (Feuerlicht, 57). Although McCarthy didn’t have a shred of evidence it didn’t stop him from making reckless accusations (Sawtelle,1). McCarthy didn’t even know what he said half the time in fact even he didn’t know exactly what he said in the speech at Wheeling but because accusations were beginning to take off, McCarthy could think of no reason not to follow and take off with them (Feuerlicht, 56). And as the public attention grew McCarthy made more speeches condemning Communists ( Garraty, 531). McCarthy never showed any evidence of his accusations. This was in part because he never had any. There was no list of names and the numbers he came up with were the result of good math skills (Feuerlicht, 55). And if anyone ever tried to catch him in a lie he would accuse them of being a “Communist sympathizer.” (Sawtelle, 1) Many things contributed to the fall of McCarthyism but probably the most significant was the condemnation of McCarthy by the U.S. senate in 1954. This condemnation ultimately led to the end of McCarthy’s power over the people and destroyed McCarthyism (Sawtelle, 2).\nEven after the fall of McCarthy people and countries still spy on each other. Only now the spying has passed the level it was at during the McCarthy years (Feuerlicht, 152). The spying reached its peak when in 1967 it was ordered by president Lyndon Johnson’s administration officials for the Army to spy on civilians who were involved in the antiwar, anti poverty, and civil rights movements (Feuerlicht, 152). The government continued its “snooping” by putting wire taps on telephones with no court approval. They strongly opposed anyone who tried to put a stop to their “snooping” (Feuerlicht, 152).\nEven after McCarthy was gone, the fear lingered. People feared a comeback. They were afraid, afraid that behind each corner could be McCarthy (Feuerlicht, 139). Although McCarthy’s attack on freedom was defeated the possibility of future attacks could not be ignored (Sawtelle, 2). One of McCarthy’s victims was quoted saying that “to write freedom into a law is not enough. Unless freedom is practiced, it withers. It must be affirmed and reaffirmed in every generation.” But in McCarthy’s case it was not (Sawtelle,2). Even the consequences of his hate teachings were felt long after McCarthy’s time. They were still fresh in the mind of Lieutenant William Calley when he was found guilty of Murder he was quoted saying that the Army taught him only that the enemy was Communism. “They didn’t give it a race, they didn’t give it a sex, they didn’t give it an age,” sobbing. “They never let me believe it was just a philosophy in a man’s head.” (Feuerlicht, 153). ” But Communism was a philosophy, and like all philosophies it needs to be examined and understood. Instead of declaring a holy war against the concept of Communism, America might have defended freedom more successfully and more honorably if she had declared war on the oppression and injustice that make men Communists.”\nCommunism was indeed a philosophy but it was a philosophy that controlled the American people for years. It left its menacing mark on a society that was otherwise good. America may never fully recover from Senator Joe McCarthy and his McCarthyism\nMcCarthyism and its Effects on America"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:b37111ca-b326-4cf8-b513-427e3bd66105>","<urn:uuid:cd63e612-32e4-46e9-9c57-9964afbb402c>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What is the main difference between the Animal Reproductive Biology Group's research focus and the processes studied in oviparous animals?","answer":"The Animal Reproductive Biology Group studies reproductive biology in mammals, focusing on internal cellular and metabolic mechanisms, while oviparous animals (birds, most fish, amphibians, and reptiles) have external reproductive processes where eggs develop protective layers and pass through the oviduct to outside the body, being fertilized either internally or externally.","context":["Animal Reproductive Biology Group\nThe Animal Reproductive Biology Group is a multidisciplinary effort composed of scientists interested in mammalian reproductive biology. The group examines reproductive biology from the subcellular level to the whole animal in a variety of species, including farm animals, humans and model laboratory animals. The objective is to clarify critical cellular and metabolic mechanisms that regulate the reproductive process. This information will help solve costly reproductive problems and improve efficiency.

The term is used when the female gamete is not capable of movement (non-motile). If the male gamete (sperm) is capable of movement, the type of sexual reproduction is also classified as oogamous. A nonmotile female gamete formed in the oogonium of some algae, fungi, oomycetes, or bryophytes is an oosphere. When fertilized the oosphere becomes the oospore.[clarification needed]\nWhile the non-mammalian animal egg was obvious, the doctrine ex ovo omne vivum (\"every living [animal comes from] an egg\"), associated with William Harvey (1578–1657), was a rejection of spontaneous generation and preformationism as well as a bold assumption that mammals also reproduced via eggs. Karl Ernst von Baer discovered the mammalian ovum in 1827. The fusion of spermatozoa with ova (of a starfish) was observed by Oskar Hertwig in 1876.\nIn animals, egg cells are also known as ova (singular ovum, from the Latin word ovum meaning 'egg'). The term ovule in animals is used for the young ovum of an animal. In vertebrates, ova are produced by female gonads (sex glands) called ovaries. A number of ova are present at birth in mammals and mature via oogenesis. In 2012, White et al. disproved the longstanding dogma that all of the ova are produced before birth. The team from the Vincent Center for Reproductive Biology, Massachusetts, Boston showed that oocyte formation takes place in ovaries of reproductive-age women.[clarification needed] This report challenged a fundamental belief, held since the 1950s, that female mammals are born with a finite supply of eggs that is depleted throughout life and exhausted at menopause.\nThe human ova grow from primitive germ cells that are embedded in the substance of the ovaries. Each of them divides repeatedly to give secretions of the uterine glands, ultimately forming a blastocyst.\nThe ovum is one of the largest cells in the human body, typically visible to the naked eye without the aid of a microscope or other magnification device. The human ovum measures approximately 120 μm (0.0047 in) in diameter.\nThe ooplasm consists of the cytoplasm of the ordinary animal cell with its spongioplasm and hyaloplasm, often called the formative yolk; and the nutritive yolk or deutoplasm, made of rounded granules of fatty and albuminoid substances imbedded in the cytoplasm.\nMammalian ova contain only a tiny amount of the nutritive yolk, for nourishing the embryo in the early stages of its development only. In contrast, bird eggs contain enough to supply the chick with nutriment throughout the whole period of incubation.\nIn the oviparous animals (all birds, most fish, amphibians and reptiles) the ova develop protective layers and pass through the oviduct to the outside of the body. They are fertilized by male sperm either inside the female body (as in birds), or outside (as in many fish). After fertilization, an embryo develops, nourished by nutrients contained in the egg. It then hatches from the egg, outside the mother's body. See egg for a discussion of eggs of oviparous animals.\nThere is an intermediate form, the ovoviviparous animals: the embryo develops within and is nourished by an egg as in the oviparous case, but then it hatches inside the mother's body shortly before birth, or just after the egg leaves the mother's body. Some fish, reptiles and many invertebrates use this technique.\nNearly all land plants have alternating diploid and haploid generations. Gametes are produced by the gametophyte, which is the haploid generation. The female gametophyte produces structures called archegonia, and the egg cells form within them via mitosis. The typical bryophyte archegonium consists of a long neck with a wider base containing the egg cell. Upon maturation, the neck opens to allow sperm cells to swim into the archegonium and fertilize the egg. The resulting zygote then gives rise to an embryo, which will grow into a new diploid individual (sporophyte). In seed plants, a structure called the ovule contains the female gametophyte. The gametophyte produces an egg cell. After fertilization, the ovule develops into a seed containing the embryo.\nIn flowering plants, the female gametophyte (sometimes referred to as the embryo sac) has been reduced to just eight cells inside the ovule. The gametophyte cell closest to the micropyle opening of the ovule develops into the egg cell. Upon pollination, a pollen tube delivers sperm into the gametophyte and one sperm nucleus fuses with the egg nucleus. The resulting zygote develops into an embryo inside the ovule. The ovule, in turn, develops into a seed and in many cases, the plant ovary develops into a fruit to facilitate the dispersal of the seeds. Upon germination, the embryo grows into a seedling.\nIn the moss Physcomitrella patens, the Polycomb protein FIE is expressed in the unfertilised egg cell (Figure, right) as the blue colour after GUS staining reveals. Soon after fertilisation the FIE gene is inactivated (the blue colour is no longer visible, left) in the young embryo. \nIn algae, the egg cell is often called oosphere. Drosophila oocytes develop in individual egg chambers that are supported by nurse cells and surrounded by somatic follicle cells. The nurse cells are large polyploid cells that synthesize and transfer RNA, proteins, and organelles to the oocytes. This transfer is followed by the programmed cell death (apoptosis) of the nurse cells. During oogenesis, 15 nurse cells die for every oocyte that is produced. In addition to this developmentally regulated cell death, egg cells may also undergo apoptosis in response to starvation and other insults."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:b6e61eac-1690-47ea-98fa-6fa1825cd6be>","<urn:uuid:d2a7e597-c12f-4240-b722-1a901b8c2d86>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How did the practice of portaging evolve historically, and what specific examples demonstrate its military and strategic importance in ancient times?","answer":"Portaging evolved from primitive animal tracks into sophisticated transportation routes, including canals, railways, and paved trackways. In terms of military significance, historical records show several strategic uses. For instance, in 412 BC, the Peloponnesians transported 21 ships across the Corinthian Isthmus, while in 30 BC, Octavian dragged his fleet across to avoid winter weather. The Venetian Republic used portaging for military purposes in 1439, moving a fleet between the Adige river and Garda lake in Northern Italy. The final documented military use of the Corinthian portage occurred in 872 AD when Byzantine commander Niketas Ooryphas surprised Cretan pirates by dragging his fleet across the Isthmus.","context":["Portage or portaging is the practice of carrying water craft or cargo over land, either around an obstacle in a river, or between two bodies of water. A place where this carrying occurs is also called a portage.\nOver time, important portages were sometimes provided with canals with locks, and even portage railways. Primitive portaging generally involves carrying the vessel and its contents across the portage in multiple trips. Small canoes can be portaged by carrying them inverted over one's shoulders and the center strut may be designed in the style of a yoke to facilitate this. Historically, voyageurs often employed tump lines on their heads to carry loads on their backs.\nPortages can be many kilometers in length, such as the 19-kilometre (12 mi) Methye Portage and the 8.5-mile (13.7 km) Grand Portage (both in North America) often covering hilly or difficult terrain. Some portages involve very little elevation change, such as the very short Mavis Grind in Shetland, which crosses an isthmus.\nPortage trails usually began as animal tracks and were improved by tramping or blazing. In a few places iron-plated wooden rails were laid to take a handcart. Heavily used routes sometimes evolved into roads when sledges, rollers or oxen were used, as at Methye Portage. Sometimes railways (Champlain and St. Lawrence Railroad) or canals were built.\nWhen going downstream through rapids an experienced voyageur called the guide would inspect the rapids and choose between the heavy work of a portage and the life-threatening risk of running the rapids. If the second course were chosen, the boat would be controlled by the avant standing in front with a long paddle and the gouvernail standing in the back with a 2.7-metre (9 ft) steering paddle. The avant had a better view and was in charge but the gouvernail had more control over the boat. The other canoemen provided power under the instructions of the avant.\nGoing upstream was more difficult, as there were many places where the current was too swift to paddle. Where the river bottom was shallow and firm, voyageurs would stand in the canoe and push it upstream with 3-metre (10 ft) poles. If the shoreline was reasonably clear the canoe could be 'tracked' or 'lined', that is, the canoemen would pull the canoe on a rope while one man stayed on board to keep it away from the shore. (The most extreme case of tracking was in the Three Gorges in China where all boats had to be pulled upstream against the current of the Yangtze River.) In worse conditions, the 'demi-chargé' technique was used. Half the cargo was unloaded, the canoe forced upstream, unloaded and then returned downstream to pick up the remaining half of the cargo. In still worse currents, the entire cargo was unloaded ('décharge') and carried overland while the canoe was forced upstream. In the worst case a full portage was necessary. The canoe was carried overland by two or four men (the heavier York boats had to be dragged overland on rollers) The cargo was divided into standard 41-kilogram (90 lb) packs or pièces with each man responsible for about six. One pack would be carried by a tumpline and one on the back (strangulated hernia was a common cause of death). To allow regular rests the voyageur would drop his pack at a pose about every 1 kilometre (0.5 mi) and go back for the next load. The time for a portage was estimated at one hour per half mile.\nThe Diolkos was a paved trackway in Ancient Greece which enabled boats to be moved overland across the Isthmus of Corinth between the Gulf of Corinth and the Saronic Gulf. It was constructed to transport high ranking Despots to conduct business in the justice system. The 6 km (3.7 mi) to 8.5 km (5.3 mi) long roadway was a rudimentary form of railway, and operated from around 600 BC until the middle of the 1st century AD. The scale on which the Diolkos combined the two principles of the railway and the overland transport of ships was unique in antiquity.\nThere is scant literary evidence for two more ship trackways referred to as diolkoi in antiquity, both located in Roman Egypt: The physician Oribasius (c. AD 320–400) records two passages from his 1st century AD colleague Xenocrates, in which the latter casually refers to a diolkos close to the harbor of Alexandria, which may have been located at the southern tip of the island of Pharos. Another diolkos is mentioned by Ptolemy (AD 90–168) in his book on geography (IV, 5, 10) as connecting a false mouth of a partly silted up Nile branch with the Mediterranean Sea.\nThe land link between Adige river and Garda lake in Northern Italy, hardly used by the smallest watercraft, was at least once used by the Venetian Republic for the transport of a military fleet in 1439. The land link is now somewhat harder because of the disappearance of Loppio lake.\nIn the 8th, 9th and 10th centuries, Viking merchant-adventurers exploited a network of waterways in Eastern Europe, with portages connecting the four most important rivers of the region: Volga, Western Dvina, Dnieper, and Don. The portages of what is now Russia were vital for the Varangian commerce with the Orient and Byzantium.\nAt the most important portages (such as Gnezdovo) there were trade outposts inhabited by a mixture of Norse merchants and native population. The Khazars built the fortress of Sarkel to guard a key portage between the Volga and the Don. After Varangian and Khazar power in Eastern Europe waned, Slavic merchants continued to use the portages along the Volga trade route and the Dnieper trade route.\nThe names of the towns Volokolamsk and Vyshny Volochek may be translated as \"the portage on the Lama River\" and \"the little upper portage\", respectively (volok means \"portage\" in Russian, derived from the verb \"to drag\").\nScotland and IrelandEdit\nTarbert is a common place name in Scotland and Ireland indicating the site of a portage.\nPortages played an important role in the economy of some African societies. For instance, Bamako was chosen as the capital of Mali because it is located on the Niger River near the rapids that divide the Upper and Middle Niger Valleys.\nPlaces where portaging occurred often became temporary and then permanent settlements. The importance of free passage through portages found them included in laws and treaties. One historically-important fur trade portage is now Grand Portage National Monument. Recreational canoeing routes often include portages between lakes, for example, the Seven Carries route in Adirondack Park.\nNumerous portages were upgraded to carriageways and railways due to their economic importance. The Niagara Portage had a gravity railway in the 1760s. The passage between the Chicago and Des Plaines Rivers was through a short swamp portage which seasonally flooded and it is thought that a channel gradually developed unintentionally from the dragging of the boat bottoms. The 1835 Champlain and St. Lawrence Railroad connected the cities of New York and Montreal without needing to go through the Atlantic.\nMany settlements in North America were named for being on a portage.\nPortages existed in a number of locations where an isthmus existed that the local Māori could drag or carry their waka across from the Tasman Sea to the Pacific Ocean or vice versa. The most famous ones are located in Auckland, where there remain two 'Portage Road's in separate parts of the city. The small Marlborough Sounds settlement of Portage lies on the Kenepuru Sound which links Queen Charlotte Sound at Torea Bay.\n- Eric W.

Specific Episodes of Ship Dragging: Ancient and Byzantine Texts\nOur sources point to eight specific instances of portaging ships between 412 BC and 873 AD.\nPreparation of Road: 428 BC: The Peloponnesians prepare the roadway to transfer ships, but no portaging results. This is the first point in time that we hear of the idea of transferring ships over the Corinthian Isthmus, although Herodotus 7.22-24 had earlier suggested that King Xerxes could have dragged ships over the isthmus below Mt. Athos—instead of cutting a canal. Primary source: Thucydides 3.15-16.\nFirst Portage: 412 BC: The Pelonnesians cart 21 ships over the isthmus. This is the only known portage of ships during the Peloponnesian War. Primary Sources: Thucydides 8.7-10, and Aristophanes Thesm. 647-648. The Aristophanes’ reference has often been read as a random reference to frequent ship portaging in antiquity but it can be more easily read as a reference to the event of 412 BC, which occurred the year preceding the production of the play. A 10th century AD scholion on the Suda explains the meaning of the two lines in terms of the movement of ships.\nSecond Portage: 220 BC: Demetrius of Pharos transfers 50 ships over. Primary Source: Polybius 4.19.7-9. Later Sources: Suda διισθμήσαντα, repeated in Pseudo-Zonaras Lexic. And see also Suda, διισθμονίσαι, repeated in Pseudo-Zonaras Lexic.\nThird Portage: 217 BC: Philip V transfers 38 ships; his 12 decked ships were too large to be transferred over and have to sail around Cape Malea. Primary source: Polybius 5.101. Later sources: Pliny Natural Histories 4.9-10 alludes to this source when he notes ships too large to be transferred over the isthmus.\nFourth Portage: 264-146 BC (Exact Date Unknown): A fragment of Polybius (162) preserved in the 10th century Suda, explains the terms Ὑπερισθμίσας and Ἡμιολίαις through a reference to a portage ofkeletes and hemiolias over the isthmus. This event apparently refers to a portage over the Isthmus of Corinth but is different from those known from Polyb. 4.19 and 5.101 (see above).\nFifth Portage: 172 BC: A mostly dead King Eumenes is transferred over with his fleet. Source: Livy 42.16, is the only reference to this event.\nSixth Portage: 102-101 BC: Corinth Inscription published in Corinth VIII.2 no. 1, and CIL 12.2 no. 2662, among many (shown below). Marcus Antonius, grandfather of the famous Mark Antony, drags a fleet across. Number of ships unknown but the inscription describes the event in spectacular and heroic terms.\nSeventh Portage: 30 BC: Octavian drags ships over the Isthmus allegedly because of the winter weather. Number of ships unknown. Source: Cassius Dio 51.5. Later source: The 16th century metropolitan of Monemvasia refers to the event in his Chonikon Maius in a passage (396 G) comparing Mehmet II’s stratagem of ship carting in his siege of Constantinople in 1453 AD, with Octavian’s portage in 30 BC and Niketas Oorphyas’ portage in 886 AD.\nEighth and final Portage: 872 AD: The Byzantine commander Niketas Ooryphas drags his fleet over the Isthmus and catches his enemies, Cretan pirates, by surprise in the Corinthian gulf. The primary source for this event is a 10th century chronicle, Theophanes Continuatus Chronographia, p. 300 in the Bekker 1838 edition. Later Byzantine restatements and elaborations include Georgius Cedrenus Chronogr., Compendium historiarum, Volume 2, p. 228; Joannes Scylitzes, Synopsis historiarum, Life of Basil 1, Ch. 31; Joannes Zonaras, Epitome historiarum (lib. 13–18), p. 430 line 9; and Pseudo-Sphrantzes Chronicon Maius pp. 236, 242, and 396 in Bekker 1838.\nII. General References: Scholars have often referred to three non-specific references to ship portaging over the Corinthian Isthmus that seem to suggest it occurred regularly: Aristophanes, Strabo, and Pliny the Elder. The Aristophanes passage is in fact a reference to the specific portage event of 412 BC. The Pliny NH 4.9-10 passage is evidently based on the Polybius accounts for it refers to the larger vessels that cannot be moved over the isthmus. Only the geographer Strabo gives a truly general account of dragging ships over the isthmus. Strabo alone of ancient authors uses the term “diolkos” in the late first century BC to denote the narrowest part of the Corinthian Isthmus, and not a portage road: cf. Strabo 8.2.1; Strabo 8.6.4; Strabo 8.6.22. In Strabo 8.2.1, the geographer notes that the diolkos was the zone where ships were dragged overland. His particular wording, however, τὰ πορθμεῖα ὑπερνεωλκοῦσιν ἀπὸ τῆς ἑτέρας εἰς τὴν ἑτέραν θάλατταν, reflects Polybius 8.34.12.\nThere is one ancient reference to a road across the isthmus: the late Classical (late 4th-early 3rd century BC) writer Pseudo-Scylas refers to a trans-isthmus road that runs 40 stades in Periplus 40.4, but he does not call it a diolkos or mention portaging.\nThe late Roman grammarian Hesychius refers to the Corinthian diolkos as a “place” between Lechaion and Kenchreai, but he is reflecting Strabo.\nApostolos Papaphotiou, in his book, Ο διολκος στον Ιστημο της Κορινθο, refers on pp. 124-125 to two western sources of 12th century date but neither provide clear evidence for the contemporary movement of ships overland. The first source, a testimony by Enrico Tino about a boat from the west that ended up in Constantinople, does not state that the boat went over the isthmus. The second source, Edrisi’s Geographie, appears to be a restatement of Strabo 8.2.1."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:5f9b5be4-f05c-46c8-8136-2f3897ce984e>","<urn:uuid:d8a7f49e-6d73-4b50-96bc-6149107b9a7d>"],"error":null}

{"question":"What is the relationship between eternal life in religious teachings and antidepressant use in religious populations?","answer":"Religious teachings emphasize eternal life as a divine gift received through faith, particularly belief in Jesus Christ, as extensively discussed in biblical passages. When it comes to mental health and religious populations, research shows that religion generally has either beneficial or neutral effects - studies from 1985-1995 indicate that 59% of religious people experience positive mental health benefits, with another 26% showing neutral effects. This is further supported by evidence that religious people, including Latter-day Saints specifically, show greater well-being and less depression than non-religious individuals, with 70% of studies showing positive mental health effects among LDS members.","context":["'Eternal Life' in the Bible\nSo that he might have eternal life, and never see the underworld.\nas the dew of Hermon, that descends upon the mountains of Zion; for there the LORD commands blessing and eternal life.\nLife is in the way of righteousness (moral and spiritual rectitude in every area and relation), and in its pathway there is no death but immortality (perpetual, eternal life).\nAnd he who is left in Zion and remains in Jerusalem will be called holy, everyone who is recorded for life in Jerusalem and for eternal life,\nMany of those who sleep in the dust of the earth will awake, some to eternal life, and some to shame and eternal contempt.\nFor whoever is bent on saving his [temporal] life [his comfort and security here] shall lose it [eternal life]; and whoever loses his life [his comfort and security here] for My sake shall find it [life everlasting].\nAnd, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?\nAnd every one that hath left houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or children, or lands, for my name's sake, shall receive a hundredfold, and shall inherit eternal life.\nAnd these shall go away into eternal punishment: but the righteous into eternal life.\nAnd when he was gone forth into the way, there came one running, and kneeled to him, and asked him, Good Master, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?\nBut he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time, houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life.\nAnd, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted him, saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?\nAnd a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?\nwho shall not receive manifold more in this time, and in the world to come eternal life.\nbut they, who shall be accounted worthy to obtain the resurrection to an eternal life, shall have no concern in marriage, as being immortal:\nThat whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.\nFor God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth on him should not perish, but have eternal life.\nHe that believeth on the Son hath eternal life; but he that obeyeth not the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him.\nbut whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall become in him a well of water springing up unto eternal life.\nThe one who reaps receives wages and gathers fruit for eternal life, in order that the one who sows and the one who reaps can rejoice together.\nVerily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth him that sent me, hath eternal life, and cometh not into judgment, but hath passed out of death into life.\nSearch the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.\nWork not for the food which perisheth, but for the food which abideth unto eternal life, which the Son of man shall give unto you: for him the Father, even God, hath sealed.\nFor this is the will of my Father, that every one that beholdeth the Son, and believeth on him, should have eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.\nVerily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth hath eternal life.\nWhoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.\nThen Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life.\nThou hast the words of eternal life.

Credible research has shown that LDS women are actually more likely to identify themselves as \"happy\" than non-Mormon women. Religion generally (and the LDS religion specifically) has been repeatedly shown to be either beneficial or neutral for mental health and well-being.\nWithout further research, critics of the Church have no convincing evidence that higher anti-depressant use in Utah is caused by problems or difficulties associated with being a believing, practicing Latter-day Saint.\nPrescription drug use by state or region has been difficult to assess. In 2002 Express Scripts, one of the largest mail-order pharmaceutical providers in the United States, released their Prescription Drug Atlas, which shows prescription drug orders from their individual clients by state. A Los Angeles Times article on the study concluded that\n[A]ntidepressant drugs are prescribed in Utah more often than in any other state, at a rate nearly twice the national average.... Other states with high antidepressant use were Maine and Oregon. Utah's rate of antidepressant use was twice the rate of California and nearly three times the rates in New York and New Jersey, the study showed. \nAre Latter-day Saint women in Utah more depressed?\nWhat the study did not indicate is the reason antidepressant use was higher in Utah than in other states. Critics of the Church were quick to correlate this data with the high rate of LDS Church membership in Utah, thus blaming the Church and Mormon culture for the problem. Kent Ponder Ph.D, a Latter-day Saint, produced an article in which he correlates the use of antidepressants specifically with pressures placed on Mormon women. Ponder concludes:\nThis problem is clearly, closely and definitely linked to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. Approximately 70% of Utahans are Mormons. Jim Jorgenson, director of pharmacy services for the University of Utah, confirmed that Utah has the highest percentage of anti-depressant use, hypothesizing that large families, larger in Utah than in other states, produce greater stress. (Large Utah families are primarily Mormon families).\n- The same LDS Church that works so well for many works very badly for many others, who become chronically depressed, especially women. \nYet the study released by Express Scripts makes no claims as to why some states use more prescription drugs of one type or another. Far from being \"clearly, closely and definitely\" the fault of the LDS Church, Ponder has no evidence whatsoever; he is giving his belief and casting it as a proven fact.\nThe Express Scripts study includes a number of factors that Ponder overlooked in his paper that are helpful in assessing the situation:\n- Utah ranked seventh in total prescriptions overall. This indicates that Utahans are heavier than average users of all prescription medications.\n- Utah also ranked high in use of penicillin, insulin, thyroid hormones, antirheumatics, and anticonvulsants. Is Mormon culture also responsible for higher incidences of infection, diabetes, hypothyroidism, arthritis, and epilepsy?\n- Idaho and Arizona, the two other states in the \"Mormon Corridor\" with large LDS populations, did not rate high in antidepressant use. If LDS culture is responsible for high levels of stress leading to antidepressant use, why didn't those two states rank closer to Utah?\nThere are other possible factors outside the scope of the Express Scripts study that may also play a part here:\n- The results could indicate that Utahans are more enlightened about depression and mental illness and therefore don't stigmatize these conditions. In such a social climate more people are willing to seek help and are prescribed drugs.\n- The results could also indicate that Utah employers offer better mental health benefits than employers in other states, making access to mental health services and medications easier. \n- Utah has a low rate of recreational alcohol use, especially among practicing Mormons who completely abstain from alcoholic beverages. Alcohol is commonly used by adults as an aid to stress relief, a \"lubricant\" for social interactions, and to \"treat\" (unwittingly or not) symptoms of anxiety, depression, and the like. Since many Mormons will not consider alcohol an \"option,\" they could be more likely to seek help from a professional instead of turning to commercially available mood-altering substances.\nAre Mormons more depressed than non-Mormons?\nThe critics' attitude toward members of the Church is nothing new. The same approach was taken by 19th-century critics:\n- In 1858 a writer from Harper's Weekly traveled to Utah and made the observation that the Latter-day Saint lifestyle turned LDS women into \"haggard, weary, slatternly women, with lackluster eyes and wan, shapeless faces, hanging listlessly over their gates, or sitting idly in the sunlight, perhaps nursing their yelling babies—all such women looking alike depressed, degraded, miserable, hopeless, soulless\" (G. L. Bunker and D. Binton, as cited in Judd 1987, p. 150). In 1860, Dr. Robert Bartholomew, the assistant surgeon of the United States Army, visited Utah and described LDS men as having \"an expression of compounded sensuality, cunning suspicion, and a smirking self-conceit.\" While many anecdotal descriptions (such as the ones above), essays (see Burgoyne and Burgoyne 1978), and media specials have discussed the detrimental effects of the LDS lifestyle on mental health (especially that of LDS women), few have any grounding in research evidence. None of the studies included in this analysis that included depression as one of its variables indicated support for an unhealthy relationship between Mormonism and depression. \nShortly after Mr. Ponder released his paper, Brigham Young University sociologist Sherrie Mills Johnson used data from national surveys to show that Mormon women are less likely to be depressed than American women in general. Johnson's conclusions upheld findings of some earlier studies that Mormons have no more depression than the nation's population as a whole. \nA good review of the literature on religion, mental health, and the Latter-day Saints specifically is now available on-line: Daniel K. Judd, \"Religiosity, Mental Health, and the Latter-day Saints: A Preliminary Review of Literature (1923-95),\" in Latter-day Saint Social Life: Social Research on the LDS Church of its Members, edited by James T. Duke, (Religious Studies Center, Brigham Young University, 1998) off-site the abstract of which reads:\n- Analysis of the data indicates that Latter-day Saints who live their lives consistent with their religious beliefs experience greater general well-being and marital and family stability, and less delinquency, depression, anxiety, and substance abuse than those who do not. This review of research also concludes that there is very little support for the assertion made by some that religious belief, practice, or affiliation is antithetical to mental health.... \nIn religious people generally,\n- 59% of studies from 1985–1995 suggest a positive benefit on mental health; another 26% were neutral. \n- \"This most recent analysis of data (1985-95) indicates that high scores on measures of religiosity (activity, attitude, affiliation, and belief) are facilitative of marital and family stability, adjustment, and personal well-being. This most recent analysis also indicates that those who score high on measures of religiosity show the highest positive correlation with measures of mental health. Also, those who score higher on scales of \"intrinsic\" religiosity score better on measures of mental health than those with an \"extrinsic\" religious orientation. There also appears to be little difference in measures of mental pathology with respect to religious affiliation.\" \nThat is, an active inner spiritual life is more protective than merely outward forms of religious observance.\nFor studies involving members of the Church of Jesus Christ specifically:\n- 70% were positive; 24% had neutral effects on mental health (thus, only 6% showed a negative effect); \n- LDS women were less depressed than other women; LDS men were no different from non-LDS men. \nThus, the available research does not support the contention that religious people have more mental health problems than non-religious people, or that being a Latter-day Saint religious person is mentally unhealthy. If anything, being LDS is protective against mental health difficulties, which is in keeping with the general consensus that religion is psychologically beneficial.\nCorrelation or causation?\nIt is easy to find a correlation between two things:\n- Utah has many Mormons and uses more antidepressants than other states.\n- Roosters crow when the sun rises.\n- IV drug abuse has increased as digital computers have become more common.\nHowever, correlations do not necessarily imply causation:\n- The suggestion that religion in general, or the Church of Jesus Christ in particular, causes depression has been examined and found to be false: in the vast majority of studies, religion either has no effect on mental health, or improves it.\n- Roosters do not cause the sun to rise; if anything the reverse is true.\n- IV drug use and the presence of digital computers are not likely related at all--they are two different social phenomena.\nCorrelations are easy to come by. They may suggest causes for further study, but they mean little by themselves. They prove nothing.\nCritics like to point to a correlation between a high LDS population and a high anti-depressant use, and then assume that this is causative. But, they either do not know—or do not want us to know—that the causation which the correlation suggests has been tested, and has not supported the conclusion they wish to draw.\nCritics who use this approach are therefore often guilty of at least one logical fallacy:\nOther evidence about levels of happiness in Utah\nIf we are going to use Utah as a surrogate measure for Mormons (something which may not be proper), we should also consider evidence on the other side of the coin.\nA 2013 paper found that, based upon Twitter metrics, Utah is in the top five most happy states:\n- The happiest 5 states, in order, are: Hawaii, Maine, Nevada, Utah and Vermont. The saddest 5 states, in order, are: Louisiana, Mississippi, Maryland, Delaware and Georgia. \nIf we are to blame the Church for Utah's antidepressant use, then we must also credit the Church for Utah's over-all happiness.\n- Julie Cart, \"Study Finds Utah Leads Nation in Antidepressant Use,\" Los Angeles Times, 20 February 2002, A6.\n- Kent Ponder, Ph.D., \"Mormon Women, Prozac® and Therapy,\" unpublished, 2003.

{"question":"What documentation should be kept for home insurance claims?","answer":"For home insurance claims, you should maintain photographic, video, and print copies of all receipts for expensive items. Both digital and physical recordings of items at initial purchase should be kept. This documentation serves as proof of both ownership and initial value when making claims.","context":["Home InsurancePersonal Finance\nIn either case of living space selection, you will be in need of insurance. Renting and ownership have separate policies. Homeowner’s insurance provides funds if a home you own suffers disaster damages, liabilities, and theft. They can cover stolen, vandalized, or damaged property. It may also cover other problems that occur in your home, like injury liability settlements.\nYou will need to know specific points that accompany insurance. The first concern is the relationship between your monthly payments and the amount of coverage on the house. The face amount of your policy must be less than the value of the house. It is often 40% up to 80% of home value. Land value is not included. A lower face amount is accompanied with lower monthly payment. Buying your home insurance policy from the same provider of your other insurance policies may result in a bulk discount.\nHome Insurance policies may be required. Mortgage lenders often require that you have a home policy. If your home suffers damages without home insurance, repair cost could kill your finances. A policy absorbs your losses and helps ensure your mortgage lender gets repaid.\nYou should begin by asking specifically what options the insurer’s plan covers at each price point. You may get more than simply a lower deductible. The level of coverage per item and the maximum value of coverage can change with your premium. You will want your most valuable items protected at their maximum value in the circumstances most likely to affect you. Coverage specifically for fire, tornado, earthquake, hurricane, flood, and theft should be considered if applicable to you. You should also compare coverage exclusions. Some insurance policies don’t cover damage that happens when you are out of town.\nIn all cases, you also need to know if items are replaced by the current value, purchase value, or replacement. Current value policy will estimate the worth of the item now, and provide only that amount of compensation. You might not receive enough money to buy a replacement of the item lost. Purchase value will give you the amount of money paid, which may be less due to inflation. Replacement value will give you enough money to buy another equally functional item in the present day, which is far more preferable to an old price or low estimate of current worth.\nKeep an accurate record of your item’s initial value. Keep photographic, video, and print copies of all receipts on expensive items. Keep digital and physical recordings of items at initial purchase. This way you have proof of ownership as well as proof of initial value when tragedy strikes.\nYou should also check if your policy insures you against accidents which occur on the property. If someone suffers an injury in your home and you are sued, your insurance policy may handle the actual damages. Ask what amount of damages the insurance policy covers if lawsuits occur on your property. If any lawsuits are lost above this dollar amount, the difference comes from your pocketbook.\nDid we help you?

{"question":"What roles do elected officials play in disability policy decisions, and how do legal practitioners address privacy concerns when handling disability-related cases?","answer":"Elected officials, including Congress members, state legislators, county commissioners, city council members, and others, make crucial decisions about funding programs, determining eligibility, and implementing policy changes affecting persons with disabilities. They can also propose new programs in response to advocacy group requests. In legal settings, practitioners must carefully manage privacy concerns, particularly during intake processes where staff should avoid asking intrusive questions about disabilities. Lawyers must respect clients' privacy preferences, such as whether to have support persons or students present during meetings. For legal proceedings, especially in human rights cases, there are specific protocols for handling medical documentation, with tribunals using the 'arguable relevance' test to determine necessary disclosure while protecting sensitive information through measures like limited document production and potential anonymization.","context":["Over the years, The Arc has found that the best way to influence change with elected officials is by helping people with disabilities and their families tell their stories. People with disabilities and their family members telling their stories is the best way for elected officials to learn about how policy decisions affect people.\nSharing a personal story about successes and challenges a person faces can help elected officials understand the impact of their policy decisions and help in getting them to know you on a more personal level. The Arc home visits are an important tool to help build these relationships, educate elected officials and have a supportive network of persons with disabilities and their families there to share their stories too.\nWHO ARE ELECTED OFFICIALS?\nElected officials are the individuals that represent you in the Congress, state legislature, county commissioner board, city council, school board, and park board members. They also include members of the Metropolitan Council who are appointed by the Governor. The Metropolitan Council makes decisions about public transportation and affordable housing in the 7 county metropolitan area.\nWHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO CONNECT WITH ELECTED OFFICIALS?\nElected officials are important because they make funding decisions for programs and supports, make policy decisions concerning who is eligible for programs and can make changes to programs or policies that affect persons with disabilities. They can also propose new programs sometimes in response to requests from advocacy groups like The Arc.\nIt may seem scary and overwhelming to connect with your elected officials but it is important because your voice needs to be heard. They have busy schedules and it may seem like they do not have time to hear your concerns or ideas for change. Home visits provide a place and dedicated time for those discussions about how programs or policies are affecting you.\nA HOME VISIT IS:\n- An informal meeting between elected officials and individuals with disabilities, their family members and other interested members of the community.\n- An easy way to engage in building a personal relationship with officials, to make sure they understand your issues, hear your concerns, and see you as a valued constituent.\n- Specific to your community so only your representing officials are invited.

However, there are privacy concerns that are specific to clients with disabilities that may not arise in matters where the litigant/applicant/complainant is not a person with a disability. What are these privacy concerns and what can you do in your legal practice to proactively address these issues?\nWhy Privacy is a Concern to Clients with Disabilities\nWhen a client with a disability approaches a clinic or firm, it is often because they have been on the receiving end of unfair, unjust and/or discriminatory behaviour. Their experience may include facts that are hurtful and demonstrative of ableist behaviour that results in an injury to the prospective client’s dignity and self-respect. By this time, the client may be wary of divulging their information to more strangers.\nPrivacy may also be of heightened concern to clients with non-evident or highly stigmatized disabilities for example, persons living with HIV/AIDS, persons with mental health disabilities and persons with addictions disabilities. Prospective clients with non-visible disabilities may experience discrimination and attitudinal barriers upon disclosing their disability and may be concerned of further discrimination upon further disclosure to more persons.\nPrivacy Considerations during Intake\nA prospective client’s first point of contact at a legal clinic or a firm is often an intake worker, who may be an assistant, a community legal worker, an articling student or a junior lawyer. Since the intake worker will not be dispensing any legal advice during the call, it is important that the questions they ask the client to gauge whether or not the clinic or firm can be of any assistance are as least intrusive as possible.\nFor example, when a prospective client calls a clinic asking to schedule an appointment to speak with a lawyer and identifies themselves as a person with a disability, intake staff should not ask the person to disclose the nature of their disability.\nThere are also times when a friend, next-of-kin or support person may call a clinic or firm and request legal advice on behalf of a person with a disability. In these circumstances, it is imperative upon the intake worker to advise the caller that if the person with a disability wants to seek advice, they should call or email the clinic or firm themselves, and explore disability related accommodations if there are any barriers preventing direct communication. By doing this, the intake worker and by extension the firm at which they are employed is respecting the privacy and autonomy of the person with a disability.\nThere are also instances where a friend, next-of-kin or support person may call a clinic or firm and request that they provide the organization with the name and number of the person with a disability so that the clinic may reach out to them. While the caller may have very well-meaning intentions, this still raises a privacy concern and the intake worker should advise the caller that they cannot take down any information about a person who is not contacting the clinic themselves.\nPrivacy Considerations during an Appointment\nOnce a client has an appointment with a lawyer certain factors must be taken into consideration with respect to privacy concerns. These considerations may apply to appointments, regardless of whether the appointment is in person, by phone or by email.\nMany clinics and firms have students year round. One of the most rewarding experiences for students is to shadow a lawyer interacting with a client, or having the student conduct the interview themselves. While this may be of benefit to the student, it may be an uncomfortable or unwanted experience for the client. As such, it is advisable that upon informing the client that a student will be attending the appointment alongside the lawyer conducting the interview, that the client be given an opportunity to raise privacy concerns. Should the client express that they do not want anyone other than the lawyer present at the meeting, the lawyer must respect the client’s wishes.\nOn the other hand, the client may express that they want to bring a support person present at the appointment. The support person can be a parent, a sibling or other next-of-kin. The support person may also be a friend or a caseworker. If a support person is attending alongside the client, it is important to speak to the person with a disability on their own, apart from the support person and explain to them the privacy repercussions and the sensitive nature of the questions that will be put to them. If, upon being provided this information, the lawyer receives consent from the client with a disability for the support person to sit in on the appointment, then the lawyer can conduct the appointment with both persons present.\nFor example, if the client is a person who identifies as a person with a physical and a mental health disability, but only experienced discrimination related to their physical disability, then questions regarding the mental health disability should be limited, if asked at all. This allows the lawyer to obtain the information relevant to providing the advice sought by the client without invading the client’s privacy with respect to the other disabilities.\nPrivacy Considerations in the Litigation Process\nOnce the client has retained the lawyer for the purposes of litigation, a new set of challenges regarding privacy may arise.\na) Choice of Forum\nWith respect to human rights matters, one of the first decisions your client may have to make is regarding the choice of forum. Pursuant to section 46.1 of the Ontario Human Rights Code (Code), a litigant may seek a civil remedy for discrimination based on a Code ground. The human rights claim, of course, cannot be brought alone and must be brought before the court in conjunction with a civil cause of action.\nFor example, if the client was terminated from their employment, they may want to pursue a civil action for wrongful dismissal but also believes that discrimination played a part in their dismissal. It is the lawyer’s duty to advise them of all the legal avenues available to them, including the Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario (HRTO) and civil court.\nIn advising the client of the legal avenues available to them, the issue of privacy implications may be central to the client deciding to pursue one avenue over another. One of the first questions we get asked by clients is, “who will see my medical documents” should they choose to commence litigation proceedings. This is a fair question and a valid concern. It is important to advise the client that if they commence a civil claim, everything that is filed with the court becomes available for public consumption, including the initial pleadings, motion records, affidavits and any personal or private documentation that might be appended as exhibits.\nAt the HRTO, on the other hand, the pleadings, disclosure and exhibits at the hearing are all subject to a Freedom of Information (FOI) Request pursuant to the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FIPPA). In accordance with section 21 of FIPPA there is, in effect, a presumption of privacy over the HRTO record and any third party seeking said record must file an FOI request and state reasons as to why they are seeking that information.\nThis presumption, and section 21 of FIPPA in particular, has now been called into question because of the recent Toronto Star v. AG decision (the analysis for which will be provided in a later blog post). It is important to make clients aware of this, although it is difficult to be able to crystalize at this point what the newly drafted sections of FIPPA will look like and how they will affect litigants appearing before tribunals.\nDespite the Toronto Star decision, it is important to recognize that there are practical measures taken by the HRTO adjudicators to balance privacy interests and transparency in the tribunal proceedings.\nFor the purposes of this blog post, and to avoid confusion, we will focus on matters where the client is filing an application at the HRTO.\nb) Medical Documentation and the “Arguably Relevant” Test\nWhen an applicant brings an application before the HRTO alleging discrimination based on the ground of disability, they are putting their disability squarely before the HRTO and inevitably a certain number of medical documents may have to be disclosed to the named respondents and to the HRTO in order for the applicant to be able to prove their case.\nAs the lawyer representing a client with a disability, it is important to ensure that\na) The client is aware of the privacy implications that come along with filing a human rights application; and\nb) Making sure that only medical documents that specifically pertain to the client’s disability central to the application are disclosed to the other parties.\nThe legal test employed by the HRTO is the ‘arguable relevance’ test. The HRTO has made it clear that the threshold for this first stage of disclosure is not a high bar. See for example: Lampi v. Princess House Products Canada Inc.\nWhat should be reassuring for applicants that appear before the HRTO, however, is that the HRTO itself is aware of the privacy concerns of persons with disabilities. InLampi, the HRTO stated,\n“The Tribunal is also sensitive to privacy issues, particularly in relation to the production of medical records. Even where such records are arguably relevant, compelling privacy interests can be protected through such techniques as limiting the documents ordered to be produced, restricting the individuals who may view the documents, or ordering production to the Tribunal for inspection or redaction before disclosure: see, for instance, McEwan v. Commercial Bakeries Corporation 2004 HRTO 13.”\nThis was further emphasized in Logtenberg v. Ontario (Finance), 2010 HRTO 1909, where the HRTO stated,\n“The Tribunal does recognize the sensitive nature of some of the medical evidence provided in its cases, and the Tribunal’s decisions to minimize the unnecessary disclosure of such evidence.”\nDespite the HRTO’s articulation of what constitutes “relevance” when it comes to medical documentation, it is not uncommon for Respondents to request a lot more medical documentation than what is arguably relevant to the matter. For example, a client with multiple disabilities may bring a case based on discrimination and a failure to accommodate only one of their multiple disabilities. The documentation that is arguably relevant in that matter and that is necessary for the applicant to prove their case on a balance of probabilities standard is medical documentation pertaining to the one disability put squarely before the HRTO – not all of their medical documentation pertaining to all of their disabilities.\nSometimes applicant’s counsel may have to undertake certain measures to ensure the HRTO and the respondents that all of the arguably relevant medical documentation has been disclosed. In one matter, for example, a client had multiple disabilities acquired over different periods of time in their life. The respondent requested 20+ years’ worth of medical documentation despite the fact that the disability at the centre of the HRTO complaint had been acquired only 5 years prior to the filing of the complaint. Applicant’s counsel undertook to review all 20+ years of medical documentation and provided two charts, one chart detailing the medical documentation disclosed and another chart listing the medical documentation that was not disclosed and reasons as to why. Despite the respondents’ arguments that this was not sufficient and more medical information should be disclosed, the HRTO found that the provision of the charts and counsel’s undertaking to revise all of the medical documentation sufficed. The HRTO did not require disclosure of the medical documentation not pertaining to the disability central to the discrimination complaint.\nStrong advocacy on behalf of clients is necessary to ensure that the scope of medical documentation is narrowed to the particular disability that is central to the complaint made in the application. In doing so, the lawyer ensures that their client maintains some privacy over the medical information/documentation that is not relevant to the matter before the HRTO.\nPrivacy concerns of complainants appearing before the HRTO and the ways in which the HRTO seeks to strike a balance between privacy interests and the openness of proceedings is addressed in the HRTO’s Practice Direction on Anonymization. It is important to note from the outset that the HRTO does not easily grant requests for anonymization since anonymizing decisions curtail the need for openness and transparency of legal proceedings.\nFirst, let’s define what anonymization means. Anonymization refers to replacing a complainant’s full name with the complainant’s initials on every interim decision and the final decision in a HRTO matter. In some cases, anonymization is automatically granted without a request being made – for example, when the litigant is a minor.\nIn other cases, exceptional circumstances must be present in order for the HRTO to be convinced that anonymization is necessary. In matters where the litigant is concerned about sensitive medical information being revealed in an HRTO decision, a Request for an Order during Proceedings (RFOP) requesting anonymization must be made. It is not enough that a litigant is concerned that their personal information will be laid out in an interim or final decision. It is equally not enough that a litigant may be worried that the information related to their disability contained in an HRTO decision may affect future employment prospects.\nIn saying that, however, the HRTO has also made it clear that there are specific circumstances where anonymization will be granted, including in cases where highly sensitive medical information pertaining to non-evident mental health disabilities have been or will be disclosed throughout the proceedings.\nFurther, the HRTO has paid particular attention to matters where the medical information disclosed in the proceedings speaks to attempted suicide by the applicant. In fact, in C.C. v. [….] Restaurant, the HRTO not only granted a request to anonymize the name of the applicant, but found that the medical information disclosed to be so highly sensitive that Vice-Chair Renton decided it was necessary to also anonymize the name of the applicant’s daughter, two witnesses who had familial relationships with the applicant, the identity of the respondents and the identity and type of the applicant’s service animal.\nIf anything the decision of C.C demonstrates that the HRTO will take each request for anonymization on a case by case basis. It must be stressed to the client that a request for anonymization continues to be rarely granted by the HRTO, as it is the HRTO’s responsibility to ensure that proceedings are open and transparent.\nClients with disabilities have privacy concerns that are particular to them because of their lived experience.

{"question":"What are the key differences between how Brown Pelicans and Australian Pelicans move around their habitats?","answer":"Brown Pelicans and Australian Pelicans have distinct movement patterns. Brown Pelicans are partially migratory, living along both American coasts and moving between areas like Florida Keys, Monterey Bay, and Channel Islands, with some populations migrating and others remaining resident. They primarily stay nearshore, resting near salt bays, oceans, cliffs and beaches. In contrast, Australian Pelicans are generally non-migratory but are known to disperse widely throughout their range, traveling across Australia, New Guinea, Fiji, Indonesia and South Pacific islands. While they don't follow traditional migration patterns, Australian Pelicans may travel throughout the year searching for food across their extensive range.","context":["Sea Wonder: Brown Pelican\nThe brown pelican is one of the more well-known seabirds in the world, and it can be found across the National Marine Sanctuary System.\nThe brown pelican’s coloration isn’t the only thing that makes it unique. Weighing in around ten pounds with a six-foot wingspan wingspan when fully grown, this is the smallest of all pelican species in the world. Their adult coloration is primarily chestnut-colored feathers with tufts of white feathers along the entire neck and top of the head, while juveniles have brown heads and bodies with white undertones. They have flat, gray bills that range in length from nine to 15 inches, and a skin pouch below the bill that expands when foraging. Their legs are darker, ranging in color from gray to black, which helps in blending in to the water around them.\nBrown pelicans live up and down both American coasts, meaning we can see them in or near Florida Keys, Gray’s Reef, Stellwagen Bank, Monterey Bay, Channel Islands, Olympic Coast, and the recently-designated Mallows Bay Potomac National Marine Sanctuaries. They primarily live nearshore, resting and nesting near salt bays, the ocean, cliffs and beaches. Sometimes, we can even see them perching on human-made structures like buoys, docks, and posts.\nBrown pelicans are capable of migrations, but not all populations do.\nDiet & Life History\nBrown pelicans feed primarily on fish like mackerel, herring, and anchovies, and forage by flying over the water at a low height, and diving head-first into the water when they see a school of fish near the surface, making a huge splash and using the expandable pouch below their beach to scoop up and hold their catch. This is the only species of pelican to dive head-first into the water, and their pouches can hold up to three times more food than their stomachs. Once they’ve made their catch, they push the water out the sides of their mouth and push the fish toward the back of the throat. Sometimes other birds will try to steal fish directly from a pelican’s mouth if it has so many that some are hanging out of the mouth, or due to the slow speed at which pelicans move and swallow their prey.\nIn addition to flying, pelicans can swim to get around. They’re known to be very strong swimmers and can reach top speeds of nearly three miles per hour! Young pelicans seem to be strong swimmers before they even know how to fly.\nThese birds generally nest in colonies and mate annually. Individuals between three and five years old are considered sexually mature adults. Pairs of pelicans are monogamous for the season, and the male’s role is to bring nesting materials to the female, who builds the nest. Nests can be around 30 inches across and nine inches high, with the male bringing new materials to add to the nest throughout incubation. Fun fact: brown pelicans rarely vocalize, but will let out low grunts during mating and nesting season.\nUsually between March and May, females will lay between one and three eggs that they incubate with their feet for about a month before hatching. Brown pelicans are born featherless, without sight, and rely on their parents for the first two or three months while they develop their strength and senses needed to survive on their own. Fledgling first flights generally occur at around 75 days of age, and once out of the nest are considered independent juveniles. Juveniles will travel with the group and learn migration paths and foraging strategies for about a year before moving on to new groups into adulthood.\nThreats & Conservation\nBrown pelicans were listed as endangered in the 1970s and 1980s after a pesticide called DDT. Pelicans were regularly exposed to DDT due to their habitat’s proximity to coastal human communities, resulting in eggs with very thin shells, which broke during nesting and incubation and resulted in decreases in the number of surviving offspring. In 1972, after much public outcry and advocacy, DDT was banned by the government and brown pelican populations were able to recover over time. In the late 2000s, brown pelicans were removed from the federal Endangered Species List, though some state and local agencies afford the species protections to this day.\nWhile their populations are generally recovered and healthy, brown pelicans are still affected by the actions of humans. Overfishing, coastal development, marine pollution, and habitat degradation are only some of the activities that pose a threat to brown pelican populations all over the country. We can all help preserve this species by keeping their habitat in-tact and clean, choosing to eat sustainable seafood, experiencing them first-hand through wildlife viewing, and asking for policies that would have positive effects on brown pelicans, whether at the local, state, or federal level.","Pelicans are unmistakable with their enormous bills and giant webbed feet. There are only eight species of pelicans, though they are distributed across every continent except the Arctic and Antarctica. Pelicans are truly enormous birds with wingspans ranging up to 3.5m in the case of the Dalmatian pelican and Great white pelican, but do pelicans migrate?\nSome species of pelicans are partially migratory, including the American White pelican, Brown pelican, Great white pelican and Dalmatian pelican. However, not all colonies migrate at all; some choose to stay where they are all year round, whereas others will migrate just a short distance.\nMigrating pelicans are an incredible sight as they usually travel in large groups, forming a ‘V’ or line formation as they soar through the sky. Pelicans are enormous birds; in terms of wingspan, the Great white pelican is topped only by the Wandering albatross at 3.6m vs 3.7m (so only by around 10cm!)\nPelican migration is still poorly understood, partly because they have such a wide range and partly because different colonies or pods have varying migratory behaviours. Read on to learn more about the migratory behaviours of this truly gigantic water bird!\nA small flock of Brown Pelicans flying in formation\nOf the eight species of pelicans, only four are partially migratory. Some populations of these pelicans will travel only short distances. The primary goal of migration is to find a warmer, food-abundant environment, and most pelicans will not travel further than they need to to find it.\nPelican migration patterns and behaviours vary with the colony or pod. For example, some pods will migrate longer distances than others, despite being in similar locations.\nAmerican white pelican: usually migratory, migrating from Alberta, the Northwest Territories, Washington state, Ontario, California and other parts of North America towards the Gulf of Mexico, southern California, Florida and Panama. Some may rarely end up in Colombia. American white pelicans in Texas and Central America rarely migrate.\nDalmatian pelican: usually migratory, but populations in warmer regions don’t travel far. Some colonies migrate from as far north as Russia and North-East Europe to the Middle-East, Nepal and India. Mongolian colonies travel to China and India. Dalmatia pelican migratory behaviours are sporadic, unpredictable and complex.\nDalmatian Pelicans usually migrate, but not usually long distances\nBrown pelican: sometimes migratory, migrating along the coast from as far north as New Jersey and British Columbia to northern Chile and the Galapagos Islands. Brown pelican migration is complex and quite unpredictable. Some Brown pelicans on the Atlantic side head north in winter rather than south, probably in search of fish.\nGreat white pelican: usually migratory. African populations are resident. Eastern European populations sometimes migrate to North Africa, the Middle East and South Asia. Some reach as far south as Bali. Again, Great White pelican migratory behaviours and routes seem complex and hard to predict.\nPink-backed pelican: non-migratory resident of Africa, India and Arabia.\nAustralian pelican: generally not migratory, but they do travel around their range of Australia, New Guinea, Fiji, Indonesia and the South Pacific islands.\nPeruvian pelican: non-migratory resident of Peru, Ecuador and Chile.\nSpot-billed pelican: non-migratory resident of southern Asia, India and Indonesia.\nAustralian Pelicans are generally non-migratory\nMigratory species and pods of pelicans usually migrate towards the end of the typical breeding season, which starts in around April or May. At the end of summer, typically in September and October, migratory pelicans start heading south.\nSome pods or colonies of pelicans are known for their fluctuating migratory behaviours. Rather than migrating as per a routine clock or calendar like most birds, they seem to migrate earlier, some years and later others.\nPelicans are specialised to temperate and subtropical environments, so they prefer to migrate to warmer regions during winter. This is why almost all North European and North American pelicans migrate, whereas southern species in Africa and Asia rarely migrate or travel short distances.\nPelicans also migrate in search of food. For example, the Brown pelican can sometimes migrate north to rather than south, probably because their favoured fish are more abundant there in winter.\nBrown Pelicans often migrate northwards instead of south\nPelicans head for warmer, more food-abundant environments during the winter. Despite being large and hardy birds, pelicans aren’t generally a fan of freezing winters, and almost all northerly populations migrate. Populations in the south are usually resident or sedentary, e.g. in Central America, Texas and Florida in the Americas and Africa, South Asia, Australia and the Oceanic island in the rest of the world.\nThe American white pelican migrates to different locations depending on where they bread. For example, those breeding towards the east of the Rocky Mountains head south towards the Gulf of Mexico. On the west side of the Rockies, pelicans tend to migrate to the Pacific coast.\nBrown pelicans also tend to head down the east or west US coastline. Some end up in Chile, Peru and Ecuador and others ending up in east Mexico, the West Indies, Venezuela and Colombia.\nGreat white pelicans migrate from East Europe and Central Asia, in Kazakhstan and Russia, to East Africa and South Asia. Some East Asian colonies fly down to Indonesia. The wide distribution of Great white pelicans means that their migration routes are still somewhat of a mystery.\nDalmatian pelicans tend to breed either in Eastern Europe or in Central Asia and Russia. Eastern European populations often migrate to the Mediterranean, whereas Central Asian and Russian populations usually migrate to the Indian subcontinent, Iran and Iraq. Some pelicans find themselves even further south in India.\nWhen migrating, pelicans do not usually complete the whole journey in one go. Instead, they maintain several stop-off points where some pelicans may remain for longer than others, giving the impression that they’re lost.\nPelicans are freshwater or coastal waterbirds, but they tend to avoid the open ocean. Their preferred habitats are lagoons, lakes, coastal beaches, marshes or other wetlands.\nGreat White Pelican coming in to land\nPelicans have huge wingspans and can soar effortlessly, making migration a relatively easy task. They usually fly in a ‘V-shaped formation which reduces energy consumption and aids in navigation. The birds towards the back of the formation take advantage of the slipstream, making flying easier. When the front birds get tired, they swap roles.\nPelicans don’t complete the entire journey in one go - they take breaks to replenish their energy reserves with food and water. Whilst they’re likely capable of non-stop long-distance flight, this just isn’t their preference!\nA flock of American White Pelicans migrating in flight\nPelicans usually don’t winter in freezing conditions - most pelicans distributed across northerly latitudes migrate every year. Pelicans are hardy, though, and they can certainly handle freezing temperatures if required. When pelicans staying further north experience very cold weather, they may undertake a late migration. Some colonies of Brown pelicans have been known to migrate as late as December!\nBrown pelicans do migrate and some travel large distances down both the Atlantic and Pacific coast, from New Jersey and British Columbia as far south as Chile and Venezuela. However, there are pockets of resident Brown pelicans along much of this route and some don’t return to the same locations each year. Moreover, some Brown pelicans actually head slightly north during winter, likely following increased concentrations of fish. As a result, they’re sometimes called dispersive rather than migratory.\nAustralian pelicans do not migrate in the conventional sense, but they do disperse widely throughout their range. Extending for thousands of miles across Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia and the Pacific Islands, Australian pelicans are dispersive and can fly long distances in search of food. Moreover, they may travel all throughout the year, rather than at the end of the conventional breeding season.\nBrighten up your inbox with our exclusive newsletter, enjoyed by thousands of people from around the world."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:14b59c84-bbd4-4945-b276-d0657e7bc3f8>","<urn:uuid:01e04af3-e3c3-449f-926c-958ca416795a>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do traditional mixing consoles handle signal routing compared to modern vertical farming operations handle resource distribution?","answer":"Traditional mixing consoles handle signal routing through physical assign buttons on channel strips that correspond to different busses, allowing manual routing of signals to multiple tracks with features like microphone inputs, effects sends, and EQ controls. In contrast, vertical farming operations manage resource distribution through strategic location planning - they typically position facilities near food distribution centers for efficient delivery networks, while considering factors like energy availability, water usage, and climate conditions to optimize resource allocation and product delivery to consumers.","context":["As multitrack recording took hold during the ‘60s, the Beatles and their contemporaries began looking to experiment by adding odd sounds and other random instrumentation as numerous carefully conceived overdubs. With only four tracks to work with in some instances, engineers would accommodate by “reducing” certain instruments such as drums, bass and rhythm guitar into a “sub-mix.” So adept were the Beatles’ engineers at the art of submixing, in fact, that complexities like “Strawberry Fields” were cut on practically the same equipment as “Can’t Buy Me Love.”\nThough digital technology has all but eliminated track-space issues, submixing parts is still a worthy exercise, since it forces you to commit to a basic combination of instruments ahead of time, thereby making your final mix job that much easier.\nThere are several approaches to combining tracks. In the old days, engineers typically copied the four rhythm-track parts to one or two tracks on a separate tape machine (known as a “dub”), then returned the combined mix to the original machine and continued recording. A more practical method, however, is to send the combined tracks to a separate subgroup known as a “bus,” which serves as a connection point between the channel inputs and the main stereo outputs (or main buss). Busses or subgroups generally come in increments of four, eight, 16 or more. For instance, on a traditional mixing console, configurations might be “16-8-2” or “8-8-2,” meaning 16 (or eight) channel inputs, eight subgroups, and two main outs (i.e., one stereo buss). Obviously, the more busses on board, the more flexibility you’ll have during your recording project.\nThe other key ingredient is signal routing, which, for starters, eliminates the muss and fuss of always re-patching microphone and instrument connections. For instance, let’s say we began a session by recording an acoustic guitar part to Track 1. We then wanted to cut a second guitar part onto Track 2. Do we have to rewire the mic into the Channel 2 input? No - just leave the connection right where it is, only change the routing position from number one to number two, then raise the record level on the corresponding subgroup. All level and EQ adjustments would remain the same; only the signal would now be sent to the number two record track. As you can imagine, this arrangement is particularly helpful when attempting multiple takes on the same instrument (such as a lead guitar), or for double-tracking vocals or layering background harmonies.\nThese days, even budget digital-audio workstations offer some kind of bussing/routing capability; however, the teeny displays and multi-layered menu systems found on econoline DAWs can put a severe strain on your optic nerve. Here’s where a traditional mixer (analog or analog/digital console or digital control surface) comes in handy. A physical mixer allows you to manually route signals to any number of tracks through a series of “assign” buttons that are found on each channel strip, which correspond with the number of busses on your console. Additionally, some consoles come with an assortment of microphone and line inputs, outputs, effects sends, parametric EQ, channel mute and soloing switches, allowing you to make the most of your routing capabilities.\nAssuming you have at least a few different grouping options at hand, you can create different kinds of sub-mixed combinations for the purpose of freeing up track space, or, better yet, to simplify the overall mix process.\nLet’s say you’ve recorded a drum kit using four mics total, recorded to tracks 1-4. Rather than keep all the drum signals active on four different tracks - and particularly if each track level is fairly uniform - you could conceivably take the drum tracks and sub-mix them in mono to Group 1, or any of the available subgroups. (After all, mono drums often have more punch, and does it get any easier than having everything on one fader?)\nStart by raising the level of each drum channel to its desired position, keeping the remaining tracks up in the mix as well to ensure that the balance of the sub-grouped tracks is accurate. You then depress the “1” routing button on each drum channel strip, which sends each of the four signals to the No. 1 buss. Along the way, you can EQ the individual tracks and/or add separate effects, or add a single effect to the combined mix after the fact (remember that processing applied pre-production will be permanently printed onto the grouped mix). Once you have your drums on one fader, you can make a dub of your grouped mix, or simply leave the tracks where they are and move on. (If you wanted your combined tracks in stereo, you’d simply punch up a pair of groups - say, Groups 1-2 - then pan the individual tracks from their corresponding channel positions while setting the subgroup pan controls hard L and hard R.)\nDon’t stop with drums; multi-tracked vocals, guitars and keyboards also make good reduction-mix candidates, as do horns and percussion overdubs. Sub-grouping can also come in handy when recording a live performance, particularly when there aren’t enough inputs and/or tracks to handle the entire job comfortably. To be on the safe side, however, always preserve your original multi-track layout, should you want to attempt another sub-mix later on. If you don’t have the track space, make a backup copy to CD.","Vertical Farming: Location a Key Factor to Success, Says IDTechEx\nVertical farming, the practice of growing crops indoors on vertically stacked layers, has received no small amount of interest over the last few years. Vertical farms commonly tout impressive numbers, such as using 95% less water and providing crop yields 20-30 times that of conventional agriculture. These claims, among many others, have seen many vertical farming start-ups being founded alongside large amounts of industry funding; funding for the industry reached a record high in 2021, with over US$1 billion being raised across the entire industry. The recent IDTechEx report, \"Vertical Farming 2022-2032\", details the economic and technological factors shaping this rapidly growing industry.\nWith crops being grown indoors under controlled environments, a selling point used by multiple vertical farms is that they can grow crops anywhere – even in the heart of a city. This has led to proponents of the industry envisioning \"smart cities\", where vertical farms in city skyscrapers help feed the urban population. While this is achievable in principle, the truth is that the choice of location for vertical farming is much more involved and intricate than it may appear from these claims alone. Choosing an ideal location can be one of the most important factors in determining the success of a vertical farm.\nSome vertical farms may choose to set up their facilities in pre-existing facilities, such as abandoned warehouses. In these cases, identifying the suitability of the venue is the first point of consideration: vertical farms are very energy intensive, and it is important to ensure the facilities chosen can support these energy loads. In addition, the ergonomics of the facility is also important; should the layout not be given proper consideration, this can impede workers and decrease worker efficiency. As labor costs are typically among the largest sources of expenditure for a vertical farm, improving labor efficiency to reduce these costs is of paramount importance.\nWhile growing crops in the center of a city may seem ideal, the reality is that this may be counterproductive. Obtaining and maintaining such a location is expensive and can contribute significantly to the operating expenditure of a vertical farm while presenting logistical challenges in distributing produce; the \"last mile\" of food distribution is often the hardest. Having a farm right next to the consumers themselves may also be less ideal than instead choosing a location near food distribution centers, as this allows for more efficient delivery of produce. As distribution centers are typically located on the outskirts of cities, the cost of land is also much cheaper. This is the approach chosen by UK-based Jones Food Company, which chose Scunthorpe as a location for its vertical farm – this is a relatively low-cost location located near food distribution centers and a network of motorways that could still reach many consumers in a day, even if it isn't right in the middle of the capital city. Vertical farms should carefully consider their place in the supply chain before establishing a base.\nOn a larger scale, vertical farms may prove more profitable in different geographical regions. Vertical farms can reduce water usage significantly over conventional agriculture, and the high degree of control over the growing environment allows them to grow crops in extreme climates – where such crops may not otherwise be able to grow. In return, vertical farms demand more energy to carry out growing operations. To maximize their potential, vertical farms would ideally be located in regions of water scarcity, such as Sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East, or in areas with extreme climates, such as in Scandinavian countries, where the low amounts of sunlight and high costs of regulating greenhouse environments single out vertical farms as an optimal solution. The amount of agricultural land available is also an important factor – regions looking to increase food security and reduce reliance on imports while facing challenges in acquiring sufficient agricultural land would find vertical farms to be ideal. A particularly prominent example of such a country is Singapore, which has demonstrated much interest in vertical farming over the last few years.\nBeyond the considerations of water scarcity and temperature, the general availability of fresh produce and the distribution networks of given countries should also be considered. Vertical farms use the added freshness and higher quality of their crops as a primary selling point, but these are typically offset by higher prices. Should there already be a large supply of high-quality produce made available at lower costs, vertical farms will find it hard to distinguish their own produce and may struggle to establish a significant market share. The converse would also be true; should a country lack easy access to fresh produce, vertical farms are expected to see much demand for their produce. An example of such a region would be the Middle East: leafy greens typically travel several thousand miles to reach stores, resulting in consumers facing high prices and low-quality products. The high price of conventionally farmed leafy greens, alongside government subsidies, makes it easier for vertically farmed produce to approach price parity while providing much fresher, higher-quality products.\nWhile the choice of location is an important consideration, it is only one of many others that must be given proper thought. Only through proper optimization of growing operations to improve efficiency and reduce costs can vertical farms reach their true potential. In the IDTechEx report, \"Vertical Farming 2022-2032\", many further important factors for consideration are discussed in detail, and the future of vertical farming is evaluated through 10-year market forecasts.\nIDTechEx guides your strategic business decisions through its Research, Subscription and Consultancy products, helping you profit from emerging technologies.

{"question":"What potential impact could Philadelphia's energy efficiency program have on poverty reduction?","answer":"According to a report from the Center for Neighborhood Technology, Philadelphia can reduce poverty by 25 percent through a combination of household expense reduction and job creation. The program is expected to create approximately 4,600 direct jobs, with larger investments over $1 million spurring new job creation in the industry. These positions are described as living wage career-type jobs rather than temporary positions.","context":["Philadelphia is moving forward with an ambitious plan to create 10,000 “green jobs” over 10 years. It involves investing $1 billion in public and private money into energy efficiency projects in all city-owned buildings, schools, as well as 25,000 low-to-moderate-income homes and 2,500 small businesses.\nEnergy efficiency plans are often billed as a “win-win-win:” clients save money on energy bills by making upgrades, such as installing a new boiler; the savings pay for the upgrade with money to spare; and finally, boiler-installers and other contractors get more work.\nThe politician pushing the plan, known as the “Philadelphia Energy Campaign,” is City Council President Darrell Clarke. But it’s the Philadelphia Energy Authority, an independent city agency formed in 2010 that is responsible for seeing it through.\nStateImpact Pennsylvania’s Katie Colaneri recently sat down with the authority’s executive director, Emily Schapira to talk about how the plan is going since it was announced last February.\nQ: If I were a home or business owner, I’d be wondering why the city cares if I save money on my energy bills. What’s in it for you?\nA: It’s funny I get asked that question all the time. What’s in it for us is that energy efficiency and clean energy is a really unique vehicle to drive poverty-reduction, economic development in Philadelphia, health, sustainability, so it’s a vehicle that can be used to meet a lot of the other goals of city government and of our city in general.\nAnd that’s actually where we have some really exciting progress to share. We have a multi-family affordable housing pilot up and running, as well as a small business pilot focusing on corner stores and small restaurants. And what we’ve really done is taken the successful models from the city and other MUSH [municipalities, universities, schools and hospitals] sector projects and adapted them to work for residential housing and for small businesses.\nQ: Describe the process. Let’s say I own a corner store in West Philadelphia. What would you do for me?\nA: We can come in and do a free energy audit.\nWe’re focused, in particular, in small business on refrigeration and lighting for a couple of reasons. One is that a lot of these small businesses are tenants, not owners, so you can’t really touch the rest of the building without getting permission from the landlord. Those two things are the biggest energy suck next to HVAC, so that’s where we’re focusing.\nWe’re targeting 30 percent energy reduction in these small businesses. Thirty percent is a number you can achieve without doing major construction to the building.\nSo we’ll figure out what are the measures that can be done here effectively and cost-effectively that help us to find a payback and then we will develop the plan, bring in contractors that can do it, incorporating the PECO and PGW rebates that are available. We’ve also got a grant for the small business sector from Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection that covers about half the cost of all of those retrofits. And then there’s a little sliver to be financed at the end. And so we’ll bring you a package that says here’s how you do this. If you sign on the dotted line, we’ll help you execute it.\nQ: How much will it cost me?\nA: In order to participate in the program, there’s no upfront cost at all. Ultimately though, there will be a portion of the total cost that you’ll be responsible for paying. We’ll provide financing for you to do it, but there is a cost to it ultimately. We expect that to be about one-sixth of the total cost.\nQ: And what I save on my energy bills will ultimately pay me back?\nA: A: Exactly. It’s all designed to have positive cash flow. So your savings will be more than your monthly payment on any loan you’d take out and we design it that way on purpose. We really want to use the energy savings to pay for the project. I think in most cases otherwise we would not see a lot of these business owners doing this work, so we’re really trying to target to this type of business exactly what you need to get the job done.\nQ: Last year, a group of academics looked at the federal program to weatherize low-income homes and upgrade appliances in Michigan. They found the state was spending more than the homeowners were saving. The results were surprising given other studies have shown more positive results for energy efficiency projects. Critics said the study didn’t take into account the value of other health and societal benefits like keeping low-income families warm in the winter.\nThis campaign is going to involve public dollars. How can you assure taxpayers this is going to pay off.\nA: Our goal is to have taxpayers invest as little as possible and really to leverage the private sector. Energy efficiency works and when it’s done well, it’s been proven time and time again that we know for a fact that you can generate positive cash flow on energy efficiency projects. So I think to some degree – even if you leave off all those other social considerations – we should be doing this in a way that is financeable through traditional lenders because we’re creating savings, actual savings that you can see visibly on your bill. So that’s one thing.\nThere’s a report that came out recently from the Center for Neighborhood Technology that shows that Philly – not just any city – can reduce poverty by 25 percent through a combination of household expense reduction and job creation. So that’s exactly what this program models out. We really feel like there are substantive, individual human impacts by doing this project and energy is a vehicle like no other.\nWe talk about healthy homes and the need to address asthma and lead paint in homes and all of these things and those things do not pay for themselves. If you incorporate energy into this, all of a sudden now you have a return on investment that you can use to pay for those things.\nQ: And what about the 10,000 jobs? You’ve said an estimated 4,600 will be people directly employed doing this work. How much of this is keeping current contractors employed and how much is creating demand to develop jobs for more people?\nA: At a small scale, it’s keeping current jobs, so that’s why you’ll see at investments under $1 million, there’s not a ton of job creation because you’re keeping people in business or they’re working a little overtime.

{"question":"What are the key differences between clip gate orientations in lead climbing versus top rope climbing, and how do they affect the overall safety during climbing?","answer":"In top rope climbing, the rope orientation is simpler since it's secured through a permanent anchor at the top of the climb. However, for lead climbing, clip gate orientation is crucial for safety. The safest way to orient quickdraws is with both carabiner gates facing the same direction and opposite to the direction of the route. This ensures the rope runs along the spine (the strongest part) of the carabiner. A closed gate carabiner has 3 times more strength than one with the gate ajar. Additionally, proper clipping technique is essential - the rope should come from the belayer through the backside of the carabiner (closest to the rock) and move upwards on the front side to avoid dangerous back clipping, which could force the gate open during a fall.","context":["Lead climbing and top rope climbing are the two most common types of roped climbing and the two you will usually find in most commercial climbing gyms. Let’s explore each term and why you might choose to lead versus top rope.\nWhat is Top Rope Climbing?\nThe top rope secures your rope to the top of the climb or wall (hence the name, top rope). Often, these anchors are permanent (or fixed), so with a tied knot and a belay, you are permanently attached or ‘protected’ when climbing. Most climbing gyms offer top rope walls and also double wrap the ropes around the anchor. Double wrapping provides a three/four to one climber-to-belayer weight ratio. Someone very light could belay a climber who weighs much more than them, which is why you might find belaying on a double-wrapped top rope more physically demanding than a single wrap; there is so much more friction in the system! To set up a top rope outside, an experienced climber will establish an anchor off of available, secure fixed points like trees, rocks, or metal bolts drilled into the rock. Outdoor anchors like this will be single-wrapped, reducing the climber-to-belayer weight ratio, so be aware of the lower friction!\nWhat is Top Rope Belaying?\nTop rope belaying is managing the rope for someone climbing top rope from the other side of the rope, thus creating opposition. Since the anchor for the rope is at the top of the wall, the belayer takes up the excess slack (loose/extra cord) created as the climber ascends and can give rope as the climber is lowered. If the climber falls, they are caught immediately by the top rope belayer.\nWhat is Lead Climbing (Sport Climbing or Trad[itional] Climbing)?\nLead climbers start with the rope attached only to each other (one on belay, one belaying), with the climber’s task to secure the rope at fixed points up the wall. So lead climbers have not one, but many fixed anchors! These fixed anchors have two primary components:\nBolt: stainless steel anchor drilled into the rock and set with super strong glue\nQuickdraw: a thick piece of webbing (dog bone) with a carabiner attached to each end. These can be permanently fixed or, more often, brought to the climb by the climber.\nThe quickdraw is attached to the bolt with one of the carabiners (quickdraws typically have designated ends for connecting to the wall), and the climber attaches the rope to the other side. Thus until the climber secures their rope into the first quickdraw, they are technically bouldering (aka climbing without any protection). In climbing gyms, quickdraws are already attached to the wall with a quick link (a more durable carabiner). The lead climber then attaches or clips their rope to each subsequent quickdraw as they progress up the wall. Indoors you’ll find a fixed anchor at the top. Outdoors, you’ll find a variety of anchor types (or none at all!), so it’s always good to scope out a guidebook as an expert and/or do your research.\nThe other type of climbing grouped under sport climbing is trad climbing, which is beyond this article’s scope. Just know that trad climbing takes an incredible amount of knowledge and experience and is only performed outside.\nWhat is Lead Belaying?\nUnlike top rope belaying, where the belayer’s responsibility is to take up the excess slack in the rope, a lead belayer manages slack for the climber. Since the rope moves up the wall with the climber, the belayer must slide the rope through the belay device so the climber can advance or pull the cord back/take slack if needed. The lack of a double-wrapped top anchor also means less friction between the belayer and the climber. Thus you want to avoid or mitigate situations where a climber weighs much more or much less than the belayer and takes a fall. When climbers fall on lead belay, they can fall up to twice the distance between them and the last place they clipped in. So this can result in some big falls (or whippers)!\nSo What’s the Big Difference Between Lead and Top Rope Climbing?\nIf you’re an experienced top rope climber, why can’t you jump right into lead climbing? Relative to top roping, lead climbing is both technically demanding and mentally challenging–it can be scary! And not just for the climber. Take the actual climbing out of the equation, and lead belaying is arguably the more challenging position. That is because the mechanism/physics of the anchor points relative to the belayer and climber allow for potentially significant falls. The more rope or slack between the climber and belayer, the longer the fall. Managing risk while lead climbing is a communications task for both the belayer and the climber. The climber must be aware of their comfort zone when tired or putting themselves into a risky position. The belayer must ensure communication/attention and know how to manage the rope and its position relative to the wall/first anchor. For a belayer, this means you are setting yourself up for the best possible outcome if your climber should fall at any given moment. The added level of attention, mechanics, and communication required between climber and belayer warrants the added experience before you begin leading climbing.\nSo what’s the next step? Start watching climbers at the gym! Note which ones are top-roping and lead belaying, and feel free to ask questions to climbers and staff. Use the internet for other videos and tutorials (note–you may see various lead climbing/belaying methods). When you’re ready to take the plunge, check to see if your local climbing gym offers a lead climbing class. The hands-on experience with a trained professional will guide you in a step-by-step learning process and is invaluable to the first-timer.\nWe hope you found some helpful and informational tidbits in the article. Let us know in the comments what’s holding you back from learning to lead climb/belay.","When moving from top rope climbing to lead climbing, like sport, alpine, or trad climbing, there is a jump (pun intended) in the type of gear you need. The most noticeable change is how you connect your rope while moving vertically. Instead of a top anchor feeding the rope between you and your belayer, you are in charge of connecting the rope to pieces of protection along the route using quickdraws.\nWhat are Quickdraws? I’m glad you asked.\nQuickdraws are two carabiners joined by a semi-stiff webbing called a dogbone. The bolt end carabiner connects to a piece of protection on the rock or wall, and the rope end carabiner holds the rope nearest your tie-in knot, but more on that later. Quickdraws vary in lengths for different purposes, types and shapes of carabiner gates, sizes, and weights.\nAlso, there are right and wrong (also read: dangerous) ways to clip into quickdraws. Quickdraws can be used both indoor at climbing walls and outdoors on natural rocks. For this reference guide, “rock” will refer to anything climbable, whether indoor or outdoor.\nSound confusing? No worries. I’ll walk you through commonly used words, phrases, and need-to-know information about quickdraws, so you’ll feel like a pro in no time!\nB – Back clipping\nBack clipping is improper rope placement that can be very dangerous. When clipping, the rope should come from the belayer through backside of the carabiner (closest to the rock) and move upwards on the front side. If a rope is back clipped, a fall could force the gate open and create an unnecessarily longer fall. To prevent back clipping, remember the rope should move up, out, and away from the rock.\nC – Carabiners\nCarabiners are oblong metal rings (see: “Metals”) with a spring-loaded gate that snaps or screws shut; for our purposes on quickdraws, they snap shut. Quickdraws have two carabiners, a rope end that has a rubber keeper, and bolt end that attaches to the piece of protection in the rock. The rope end sometimes has a different colored gate for quick reference! The safest way to orient your quickdraw is with both carabiners’ gates facing the same direction.\nC – Clipping\nClipping quickdraws specifically refer to the rope end carabiner connection, but it is important to ensure the quickdraw is first clipped into the piece of protection in the rock. There are two clipping techniques: the pinch clip and the snap clip. The technique you use is determined by the direction of the gate and which hand you’re using.\nTake a look at the video here for a clipping demonstration.\nOnce you understand the techniques, memorize this chart so while climbing you know the proper method.\n|Clipping Method Chart||Right hand clipping||Left hand clipping|\n|Rope end carabiner facing right||Pinch clip||Snap clip|\n|Rope end carabiner facing left||Snap clip||Pinch clip|\nD – Dogbone (or Sling)\nA dogbone is the semi-stiff webbing between the carabiners made of either light and skinny ultra-high-moledcular-weight (UHMW) polyethylene like Dyneema, Dynex, and Spectra, or heavy and thick sewn nylon or polyester webbing. The bolt end is looser along the dogbone to allow the quickdraw to rotate with you as you ascend, whereas the rope end is stiff thanks to the rubber keeper. The keeper orients and secures the carabiner to ensure it can’t flip and the rope won’t land incorrectly on the gate, possibly pushing it open.\nG – Gates\nGates are the spring-loaded, moveable, locking side on a carabiner. For quickdraws, gates come in two styles, solid or wire, and two shapes, straight or bent. You’re likely familiar with solid gates which have the same structure and material as the rest of the carabiner. They are more likely to be keylocking and therefore easier to clip.\nWiregates are a thinner metal making them lighter and better for alpine climbing. Although less likely to be non-keylocking, they are actually safer than solid gates! The light weight reduces gate flutter; that is the slight opening and closing of a gate during a fall.\nStraight and bent shaped gates are optimal in their own spots. Straight gates are better for the bolt end of quickdraws but can be used on both ends for budget-friendly gear. Bent gates are optimal on the rope end to make clipping easier as the curved shape helps guide the rope into the carabiner. However, bent gates can be more expensive, so while nice to have, they aren’t a necessity.\nK – Keylocking carabiners\nKeylocking carabiners are preferred by sport climbers, because they are easier to unhook from your harness or piece of protection. Some carabiners have a hook or notch on the nose (the point a gate closes to) where the bar on a gate settles to help keep it closed. Others have a flat nose, and those are keylocking. Because keylocking carabiners don’t have a hook, they are less likely to get snagged and leave you hanging while clipping and unclipping.\nL – Lead climbing\nLead climbing is a style of climbing based on rope set up, as opposed to a specific discipline, where the climber clips in the rope as they travel up the route. Sport climbing, alpine climbing, and trad climbing are disciplines that use lead climbing and therefore quickdraws.\nL – Length\nQuickdraw lengths generally range from 10-25 centimeters, but extendable quickdraws can be up to 60cm. It’s recommended to have a variety of lengths to accommodate different needs on the route like edges or overhangs.\nM – Metals\nCarabiners come in two types of metals: aluminum and steel. Most carabiners are made from aluminum, since they are lighter compared to the more durable steel carabiners. However, both are strong and will uphold longer than the dogbone (see “Retiring”). Steel carabiners are best for top roping or the first lead climbing quickdraw, since it can sustain more wear from the rope.\nM – Mock leads\nMock leads are a great way to practice lead climbing with the safety of top roping. Two ropes and two belayers are needed, since one rope is connected to you as you practice lead climbing, and the other first passes through a top anchor before tying to you to catch any falls.\nP – Pieces of Protection\nPieces of protection refer to any piece of equipment placed securely into the rock to be able to clip into. Angers, bolts (and hangers), cams, hexes, and nuts are some examples of protection. Protection can be broken down further into active and passive protection, differentiated by having moving or non-moving parts.\nQ – Quickdraws\nFor you speedy readers, let me recap. Quickdraws are two carabiners connected by sturdy webbing (see “Dogbone”) used in lead climbing to connect the climber’s rope to the rock. There is a bolt end and easily identified rope end thanks to the rubber keeper and occasional different colored gated.\nR – Retiring (equipment)\nNothing lasts forever, and the same is true for climbing equipment. Regularly inspect both carabiners and dogbone of your quickdraw. Look for chips, cracks, and deep grooves from rope wear on the carabiners and large frays, runs, and sun bleaching on the dogbone. As a rule of thumb, UHMW products should be replaced every 3 years and nylon or polyester products replaced very 5 years (see “Dogbone”).\nS – Size\nCarabiner size refers to the distance between the nose and fully extended gate called the gate opening. The less distance of the gate opening, the smaller the size, and therefore the harder to clip. For all my big hand friends who can easily palm a basketball, the small quickdraws might not be your best friend.\nS – Strength\nCarabiners sold by nearly all major equipment companies must pass CE and UIAA strength standards. Each carabiner is tested in three ways: lengthwise (across the major axis), sideways (across the minor axis), and force lengthwise with the gate open. Remember, a closed gate carabiner has 3 times more strength than a carabiner with the gate ajar. If you’re interested, most carabiners have all three test numbers listed on it.\nW – Weight\nThe weight of a quickdraw comes from the carabiner material and size and dogbone material. Alpine climbers greatly consider weight when choosing their quickdraws, whereas sport climbers focus on other aspects like keylocking carabiners (see “Keylocking”).\nZ – Z-clipping\nZ-clipping happens when the rope is pulled from under the previous quickdraw and clipped into the current quickdraw. When tightened, the rope forms a “Z” shape and creates drag that prevents or significantly hinders climbing, so it will be quick to notice and fix.\nWhile this covers a lot of information, and there is a video for reference, nothing will prepare you better for climbing than learning firsthand from an instructor. Then practice, practice, practice. Climbing in any capacity can be dangerous, but lead climbing can increase that risk if you aren’t properly prepared.\nBefore climbing there are many mitigations you can take. Ensure you have the proper equipment, and it fits correctly, like harnesses, helmets, and in this case, quickdraws. The safest way to use a quickdraw is for both carabiner gates to face the same direction and opposite the direction of the route. That way the rope runs along the strongest part of the carabiner called the spine, a fancy name for the solid, non-gate side.\nAlso, practice clipping with both hands while on the ground, so it is muscle memory on the climb.\nAs mentioned, try mock lead climbs with two trusted belayers to experience lead climbing without risking big falls right out of the gate. Don’t be afraid to start with easy routes as you are learning.\nExperiment with different length quickdraws and types of carabiner gates to find what works best for you. The more comfortable you are with your equipment, the safer you can be and more fun you will have.\nUntil next time, on belay, friends!"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:475e3e6f-691d-4f31-9bba-af16d6401f21>","<urn:uuid:0d7671c9-76d3-4317-abe7-b0d5613676fe>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the minimum distance requirements for obtaining official recognition on different pilgrimage routes to Santiago de Compostela compared to completing the full Via Turonensis route from Chartres?","answer":"The Via Turonensis route from Chartres to Gibraltar is 913 km long and takes around 40 days excluding rest days. In contrast, to obtain the official Compostela certificate in Santiago, pilgrims only need to complete the final 100 km on foot or horseback, or the final 200 km by bicycle. This shorter requirement can be completed in 4-6 days and must be documented with at least two stamps per day in the pilgrim's credencial as proof. Several routes offer these minimal distance options, including starting from Sarria on the Camino Francés (118 km), Ferrol on the Camino Inglés (116 km), or Ourense on the Camino Sanabrés (103 km).","context":["Introduction The most northerly of the 4 medieval French routes described by Aimery Picaud in the Pilgrim’s Guide and the one used by pilgrims from France, Northern Europe and the British Isles. Also known as the Via Turonensis after Tours, the most important medieval city along the route.\nThe route.Pilgrims from the UK who want to set off from their homes, tend to walk or cycle to either Paris or Chartres (historically an important secondary starting point) and pick up the Chemin de Tours from there. The first major town on the route from Paris is Orléans, after which the way follows the Loire valley to Tours where it joins the route from Chartres; it then goes southwest through Poitou and the Saintonge to Bordeaux; and finally passes through les Landes to join the routes from Le Puy and Vézelay at Gibraltar just beyond Saint-Palais. The medieval route would have been along Roman roads and the main towns were all major Roman towns at important cross-roads, many already major pilgrimage centres in their own right.\nFor anyone wishing to start in the UK, walkers can use the Vanguard Way (East Croydon to Newhaven), take the ferry (check https://www.aferry.co.uk/ for details of the various sailings etc), then follow the Dieppe to Chartres route from the Association Normande des Amis de Saint Jacques – website: http://chemins-pelerins-normands.fr/.\nAlternatively, sail from Portsmouth to Cherbourg, walk to Mont St Michel and onwards to Saint-Jean-d’Angély. Normandy routes can be seen here. Separate CSJ route overview for Mont Saint-Michel to Saint-Jean-d’Angély here.\nCyclists can follow the Avenue Verte (London Eye to Notre Dame).\nSee Guides below for full details of guidebooks available for these routes.\nLength. From Chartres to Gibraltar is 913 km; from Paris to Orléans about 130 km and from Orléans to Gibraltar 842 km. Journey time is around 40 days excluding rest days and sightseeing. A detailed breakdown of the routes village by village can be found on Wikipedia.\nWaymarking. There is no single waymarked long-distance footpath covering the entire route. Much of the “historic” route now lies under major roads and cannot be walked. Most pilgrims use a mix of the long distance and local footpaths of the French Grandes Randonnées and Grandes Randonnées du Pays system (both waymarked) and small farm roads to replicate the traditional route as far as possible off the main roads.\nThe GR655 is waymarked from Paris (via Chartres) to the Charente Maritime/Gironde border.\nTerrain. The route is easy to walk or cycle. It is generally flat, there are no significant hills or steep gradients and the paths are clearly defined. The chief features are the many wide, wooded east-west river valleys crossed by the route north of Bordeaux and the vast tracts of stabilised sand and pine forest of les Landes south of Bordeaux. The Chartres branch crosses the vast treeless plateau of the Beauce (the “bread basket” of France) and the extensive vineyards of the Loire to reach Tours. The Orléans branch follows the Loire valley with the grand chateaux of the kings and nobility of France. From Tours to Bordeaux, you encounter pleasant agricultural terrain, some deciduous forests and there are numerous rivers to be crossed. The vineyards begin again in the valley of the Charente and from here to Bordeaux, vines and forest mix. These provinces of Poitou and Saintonge are the lands “full of delights” according to the Pilgrim’s Guide. South from Bordeaux the way passes through the unending pine forest of les Landes, an area which has enjoyed a good reputation with neither medieval or modern pilgrims – the former because of the dangers of the shifting sands and the latter because of the rather tedious landscape.\nWeather. An all year-round route with a temperate, maritime climate. Rain, often heavy and persistent and sometimes causing flooding, is the main hazard.\nWhen to go. Any time – but short winter days limit effective daylight hours and much of the route is a popular all-year tourist destination, especially in the spring, July and August and around public holidays.\nWhere to stay. Ample hotel accommodation, plenty of good campsites (along the rivers), some gites d’étape and chambres d’hôte – all catering for tourists rather than pilgrims. No network of free or cheap pilgrim refuges except at Centre de Culture Européen at Saint-Jean d’Angély, at the church of Saint-Eutrope at Saintes, at the Priory of Cayac at Gradignan (south edge of Bordeaux) and at the Franciscan convent at Saint-Palais. However, persistence and good French can sometimes produce a bargain bed.\nMany of the local pilgrim association websites (listed below) will have a list of accommodation.\nHotelF1 is a chain of budget hotels that can be useful as a back-up.\nDistinctive features of the route. No single authentic route – many variations to suit personal pilgrim tastes. Physically easy to walk or cycle at any time of the year – a good route for cyclists especially. Expensive – accommodation, including campsites, is designed for tourists. Wealth of culture: legacies from the Roman, Visigothic, medieval and modern eras. More Romanesque churches than on any other pilgrim route; high risk of cultural overload. Western France can be depressingly wet; les Landes have a reputation for tedium though loved by some pilgrims. The direct route out of Paris is rather suburban and frustrating. Not a lonely route but sufficiently long to absorb the pilgrims using it so not a busy route either.\nBest to read general pilgrim books and tourist guides before leaving for the journey and obtain information from the tourist offices, bookshops and monuments along the way – a wealth of literature is available.\nPilgrim Associations: Useful for local advice and accommodation information. Most will have a list of lodgings (hébergements) on their website.\nDiscussion Forum.

That is that they plan to walk, cycle or go by horseback to Santiago. The credencials are stamped at the albergues, hotels, etc. and the stamps or sellos provide proof to the Pilgrim Office, in Santiago de Compostella, that the pilgrim has completed the distance required to qualify for the Compostella issued by that office.\nThe Pilgrim Office in Santiago issues a Compostela certificate to pilgrims on completion of their Camino provided they have walked or ridden by horseback for at least the last 100k at one time. Cyclists need to complete at least the last 200k to qualify. Pilgrims also need to confirm that they undertook the Camino for religious or spiritual reasons. An alternative certif-\nicate is available to those who do not want to claim religious or spiritual reasons. Pilgrims should obtain at least two sellos a day when completing the last 100/200k and must also ensure that they obtain a sello at the start of their Camino as proof of their starting point. A 100-120k journey can be completed in 4 to 6 days.\nSo, what routes are available to pilgrims who want to obtain a Compostela but for various reason are only able to walk the 100k?\nThe Camino Francés\nSarria is a popular starting location on the Camino Francés, 118k from Santiago. In the first six months of 2014, 19,561 pilgrims started here approximately 34% of those who arrived in Santiago walking the Camino Francés. So this route can be crowded.\nThe Camino Inglés\nThe Camino Inglés, or English Way, traces the route followed by pilgrims who came by ship to the ports of A Coruña and Ferrol on the northwest coast of Spain. You can walk from A Coruña but the distance is less than 100km and does not qualify for a Compostela. From Ferrol the Camino Inglés runs eastwards to skirt the Ria de Ferrol before heading southwards Santiago, a total about 116k.\nThe Camino Portugués\nThis Camino starts in Lisbon and heads north through Portugal to Oporto, Valenca and Tui on the border with Spain and Santiago. Valenca on the Portuguese side of the River Minho and Tui on the Spanish side are about 112k from Santiago.\nThe Camino del Norte\nThe Camino del Norte, for the most part, follows the north coast of Spain to Ribadeo before turning southwest towards Santiago. Numbers of pilgrims on the Camino del Norte are about one twentieth of those on the Camino Francés. How ever, reports from the albergue at Miraz, staffed by English volunteers, suggest that during summer they have to open the church to provide extra sleeping space. Baamonde is 106k from Santiago by the walking route that joins the Camino Francés at Arzúa. Another alternative starting location could be Vilalba, a comfortable one day’s walk before Baamonde.\nThe Camino Primitivo\nThe Camino Primitivo leaves the Norte after Villarviciosa and runs south west to Oviedo and Lugo, joining the CF at Melide. From Lugo the distance is just over 100k. An alternative route from Lugo is to walk via Friol to Sanabres dos Moxes, on the Norte, then either join the CF at Arzúa or take another alternative and cut a corner between Boimorto and Arca, thus avoiding some of the crowding on the CF. This route gives you the option of visiting the 4th century Roman shrine at Santa Eulalia de Bóveda, a Spanish national monument.\nThe Camino Sanabrés\nThe Camino Sanabrés turns off the Via de la Plata two days’ north of Zamora. The distance from Ourense to Santiago is about 103k. One of the joys of arriving in Santiago de Compostela on this route is that you can see the Cathedral from some distance.\nThe Camino Portugués\nThis Camino starts in Lisbon and heads north through Portugal to Oporto, Valenca and Tui on the border with Spain and Santiago. Valenca on the Portuguese side of the River Minho and Tui on the Spanish side are about 112km from Santiago.\nCamino de Muxia y Fisterra\nA lot of pilgrims finish their pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela by walking to Muxia and Finisterra. However, this Camino can also be reversed and the route from Muxia to Finisterra and then Santiago is recognised by the Pilgrim Office. Some parts of this route have waymarks in both directions but most seem to point away from Santiago, so careful navigation will be required.\nThe Camino Invierno (also signed occasionally as the Camino Real or Camino de Sur) is most definitely a road less travelled: so much so that it is not even on the common maps of Camino routes, because it has not been conferred official status (yet). Click to read the full article.\nBeing a pilgrim does not require you to stay at albergues. If you value the privacy of your own room or prefer the comfort of an ensuite bathroom a hotel, hostal or pension room may be the answer. Price varies but is generally less than you would pay in Australia.\nTo ensure pilgrims cover the last 100k on foot (and do not take the bus or taxi!) the Pilgrim Office asks that pilgrims get two stamps a day for their pilgrimage within Galicia. If you are starting before Galicia ie from somewhere in France or elsewhere in Spain, one stamp a day will suffice.\nJohn Brierley is the author of guides to the Portuguese, Frances and Finisterre Caminos.

{"question":"What role do differential pressure measurements play in industrial processes, and what are the key maintenance considerations for filter cartridges used in these systems?","answer":"Differential pressure measurements are extensively used for level and flow measurement, material balance control, and monitoring filter performance. They are critical for maintaining clean room pressure differentials and preventing contamination in pharmaceutical manufacturing. As for filter maintenance, cartridges eventually become blinded by contaminating particles and require proper cleaning. When sized correctly, metal filters can be regenerated to perform at up to 95% of their clean differential pressure. The cleaning process must account for different types of contaminants - inorganics (metals, salts, oxides), organics (oils, grease, wax), and biologicals (bacterial, algae, food material). The cleaning effectiveness can be improved by increasing solution temperature to 80°C, and the process should be followed by rinsing with filtered ambient water for 10-30 minutes in the reverse direction.","context":["Filter cartridges eventually will become blinded by the contaminating particles that are removed from the fluid stream. When properly sized for the application, metal filters can be regenerated to perform at up to 95% of their clean, differential pressure. By following prescribed cleaning methods, it is possible to extend the maximum life of the filters. Water used in these procedures should be filtered to the same micron rating as the final filter used in the process train to avoid recontaminating the filters. Please be sure to wear the appropriate protective clothing, gloves and a face shield when handling chemicals. Consult the Material Safety Data Sheets.\nTypes of Contaminants\nIn order to effectively clean porous metal elements, it is important to identify the types of contaminants that are plugging the filter. By knowing this information, it is possible to determine the most effective cleaning methods. In some instances, it will not be possible to clean the elements and it will be necessary to utilize a commercial cleaning company.\nInorganics: These are considered non-carbon\ncontaining contaminants such as metals, salts, oxides\nOrganic: Typically petroleum based compounds such\nas oil, grease, wax, gums, tars and polymers.\nBiological: Protein based contamination such as\nbacterial, algae and food or plant material.\nSince the contaminants can occur in combination, it may be necessary to utilize more than one cleaning method or cleaning agent.\nFor the cleaning agent, dilute acid such as nitric or phosphoric up to 10%, caustics such as sodium hydroxide up to 15% or commercial detergents such as Alconox or Tergezyme can be utilized. Compatibility should always be verified with the metal as well as the housings if done in a circulation mode. A series of cleaning agents may be required due to the presence of multiple types of contaminants. The effectiveness of the cleaning agent can be improved by increasing the temperature of the solution to 80°C. If doing a static soak, a 4 – 6 hour time period is\nOnce complete, rinse with filtered ambient water for 10 – 30 minutes, in the reverse direction, at a flow rate 1.5 times that of the initial flow rate used on the product filtration. Repeat the cleaning process if necessary if the cartridges do not recover to within 10% of the original DP.\nThis is the simplest cleaning method and should be used routinely to maintain the filter’s condition. In this process, liquid or gas (blowback) is utilized in the reverse direction to remove contaminants from the surface of the filter. Pulsing the liquid in the reverse direction, versus just reverse flow, may provide a more effective result. Be certain to avoid exceeding the recommended reverse pressure rating. Typically, a reverse flow (pulse) at 1.5 to 2 times the typical forward flow or pressure drop is all that is required.\nSoak or Circulation\nThese methods require the introduction of a detergent, acid or caustic as the cleaning agent in either a static or circulation mode. If circulating the cleaning solution, the flow should again be in the reverse direction at 1.5 to 2 times the flow rate/pressure of the forward direction.\nProcedure - All filter housings in a process train must be correctly piped so that they can be isolated, from each other. By installing a valve and tee connection on both the inlet and outlet of the housing, the cleansing chemicals can be brought into and removed from each housing, to drain, without flowing into the previous or next filter housing. The tee and valves should be the same pipe size as the process piping or a size large enough to accommodate a flow rate 1.5 to 2 times that of the process or filtration flow rate. Each filter housing should contain an inlet and outlet valve and pressure gauges upstream and down-stream of the housing. The gauges\nshould be liquid filled and have a face diameter of at least 2.5 inches. The pressure range should be such that each graduation can be easily read and differentiated from the other gauge reading. Accuracy is important.\nDue to the thermal tolerance of porous metal elements, it is possible to burn or volatize the organic or biological contaminants. Temperatures up to 850°F are possible. Since some contaminants may leave ash, additional cleaning methods may need to be employed after the furnace. Developing a cleaning method requires a trial and error approach due to the varying nature of potential contaminants.","Checklist for Best Pressure Measurement Performance\nPressure and differential pressure (DP) measurements are important for regulating inventory, flow, and product quality and are critical for ensuring safe operation. Installation errors and the drift of today’s smart pressure and DP transmitters have decreased by an order of magnitude by compensation of temperature, static pressure, and non-ideal sensor effects. Most of the remaining concerns are associated with impulse lines.\nPressure control of boilers, prime movers (e.g. pumps, fans, and compressors), and headers is important for supply to consistently meet demand. Pressure control in reactors, columns, evaporators, and extruders is the key to reducing variability in product quality. Pressure control is critical for increasing safety and decreasing emissions by preventing excursions that would activate safety instrumentation systems (SIS) and relief devices. Pressure measurements for SIS actions must be fast, reliable, and accurate.\nThe driving force for flow across system resistances and control valves is differential pressure and pressure for critical flow. Pressure and DP measurements can monitor the pressure profile in piping systems, the performance of filters, and the coating of heat exchange surfaces. Portable wireless transmitters can generate process diagnostics and identify installed valve flow characteristics. DP measurements in clean rooms can maintain a differential of 0.25 inches water column for positive air flow out of the room to prevent contamination in pharmaceutical and electronics manufacturing.\nDP is by far the prevalent instrument used for level and flow measurement despite newer technologies, such as radar and Coriolis primarily due to the low cost of a DP. Material balance control, residence time control, flow ratio control, and vessel-sump- tank inventory control most often depend on DP measurements. High levels can cause spills and carry-over of the process into vent systems. Low levels can damage pumps.\nGiven the significant role of pressure and DP measurements in manufacturing, what can be done to get the best implementation? The following checklist is not intended to cover all the installation and specification requirements but some of the major application details to be addressed for automation component. The following list assumes the materials of construction have been properly specified, the sensor will work safely and reliably with acceptable accuracy for the maximum possible temperature, and the electrical connections and enclosure will meet electrical area classifications and codes. For a detailed understanding see Chapters 3-5 in the ISA book Essentials of Modern Measurements and Final Elements in the Process Industries. Reliability and precision (noise, repeatability, resolution, and threshold sensitivity) are most important.\n- Is the transmitter fast enough for application (e.g. damping < 0.2 sec for compressor control)?\n- For gas, is transmitter mounted above process connection to prevent accumulation of liquids?\n- For liquid, is the transmitter below process connection to prevent trapping gases?\n- Do impulse lines have a continuous slope with no bends or smooth long radius bends?\n- Do impulse lines have vent and drain valves?\n- Does a DP have an equalization valve?\n- Does process pressure connection design prevent appreciable velocity head?\n- Do transmitter and impulse lines need freeze protection?\n- If heat tracing is used, are high temperatures prevented that could alter fluid composition in impulse lines or transmitter (e.g. vaporization, reactions, or formation of tars and polymers)?\n- For plugging services, can impulse lines be purged or eliminated?\n- For purged impulse lines is purge flow and purge pressure high enough?\n- For purged impulse lines is purge flow and purge pressure adjustable and indicated?\n- For purged impulse lines is liquid purge needed to eliminate transients from compressibility of gas purge during fast static pressure disturbances and to prevent solids build-up from drying at bubbler tip?\n- Can impulse lines be eliminated by direct mount of transmitter or use of capillary system?\n- Should an extended diaphragm be used to minimize fouling of a direct mounted level DP?\n- Does diaphragm area need to be increased to improve threshold sensitivity?\n- Does diaphragm area need to be decreased to increase speed of response?\n- Is capillary length minimized to increase speed of response?\n- Are the capillary systems at the same temperature (e.g. sun versus shade)?\n- For DP measurement with low static pressure, can DP be computed from dual direct mounted transmitters to eliminate the need for impulse lines?\n- Can a smart transmitter be used to detect plugged impulse lines?\n- Can wireless transmitters be used to provide portability for process troubleshooting?"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:5e38b047-5f0b-4558-ad73-2fcfb080b49c>","<urn:uuid:2433f5f5-0153-4ba0-a4fb-8a29c3e3ae6d>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the responsibilities of caring for rescued farm animals, and what damage do marine heat waves cause to ocean ecosystems?","answer":"Caring for rescued farm animals requires providing shelter, warmth, companionship of their own kind, and cool water under harsh weather conditions. Adopters must commit to the animal's entire natural lifespan and ensure they're never bred, sold, or used for consumption. In marine ecosystems, heat waves cause severe damage, particularly to coral reefs where high temperatures don't just cause bleaching but can kill the coral animal entirely. The deceased coral's skeleton becomes overgrown with algae and bacteria, leading to rapid erosion and weakening of the reef structure, which affects the entire marine ecosystem including crustaceans, molluscs, and the millions of humans who depend on these ocean resources.","context":["With numerous organisations doing great work to rehome cats and dogs and our wildlife carers providing a great network of coverage across the country, what becomes of farmed animals? These creatures are forgotten from our animal protection legislation and often forgotten from people’s thoughts, however they are never forgotten by Edgar’s Mission. In fact, it was the lot of one pig that changed the life of Edgar’s Mission Founder and Director, Pam Ahern, in 2003.\nStruck by the fact that farmed animals had nowhere to live lives where they were valued for who they were, not for what they could provide, Edgar’s Mission trotted into gear. Over the years, we here at Edgar’s Mission have come to realise just how much an organisation like ours is needed, not only to provide a voice for farmed animals but moreover to provide sanctuary for those animals who have become lost or abandoned with no identifiable owner. The latter of these reasons has been a driving force for securing our new forever home. But we have also come to acknowledge that whilst the animals think us super heroes, we are not, and sadly we cannot provide every single farmed animal in need with a forever place to call home sweet home, as well as continue to maintain the first class level of care to the animals already in our care, be good stewards to the land, be advocates for animals and last, but of equal importance, to give due diligence to our own physical and emotional wellbeing.\nThe task of rescuing animals in need, whilst often difficult, heart breaking and expensive, is something we will never shy away from. Rendering care, veterinary attention, rehabilitation along with all the kindness, love and tender mercy we can muster will always be our charter. But we need to ask your assistance to help share the love. So we now ask, “Will you be there?”\nWill you be there to provide a rescued animal with a forever home? A home where they will have the company of their own kind, with shelter and warmth through the coldest of days and shade and cool water under the harsh Australian sun. A home where these gentle souls will never want for anything, where they will never be bred with or from, one where they will never be on-sold, given away, or (perish the thought) killed for human or animal consumption. A home where they will never again be forgotten, where they will be valued for the unique and beautiful creature they are, not as a something. Will you be there to provide a rescued animal with a life truly worth living?\nIf you think you fit this lofty bill, we would love to hear from you as we seek to expand our base of adoptive ‘parents’. Through social media and publicity, the work of Edgar’s Mission reaches farther afield each day but so too do the number of calls from members of the public, animal rescue organisations, council pounds and even the police, to help farmed animals in need. We are deeply touched that so many have great faith in our work, and we take great pride that we are indeed able to provide a beacon of hope for farmed animals. Indeed this is something which we wish to continue providing.\nLike to find out more? Please check out prospective adoption form below for more information or email Pam.\nPlease note Edgar’s Mission is located in Lancefield, Victoria, Australia.\nA quick FAQ on our rehoming scheme\nWhich animals do you adopt out?\nThis is a really really difficult question. Animals who have resided at the sanctuary for several years, who have made bonds with their fellow kind or who we know will have on-going special needs will remain with us. We prefer to adopt animals in pairs or family groups to make their transition to their new forever home as stress free as possible.\nWhy so many questions in your prospective adoption form?\nPlease understand our first duty is always to the animal/s in our care, animal/s whose terrified ear we have whispered into that we would never let them be in harm’s way ever again. And whilst you may know you are good folk, we do not yet. Over the years we have received many an odd call from members of the public wishing to ‘obtain’ an animal from Edgar’s Mission for a less than satisfactory end. Whilst some may feel our questions seem a little personal, in all honesty the information is nothing a dear friend of yours would not know and after all, that is what we would like to be should you adopt an animal from Edgar’s Mission. Rest assured also that no information supplied is ever passed on to any third party and is always held strictly confidential.\nWe will also keep in touch with you and your new friend/s should the adoption proceed and we will always be on hand to offer advice should the need arise.\nHave you considered our three R’s of Rehoming?\nResearch – Make sure you do your homework to see what is involved in bringing a farmed animal into your home and your heart. Do you have the means and the ability to cater to their specific needs? Do you understand the species specific requirements for the animal you are looking to adopt?\nResponsibility – welcoming an animal into your world is a big responsibility and requires commitment for the entire natural lifespan of the animal.\nRemember – While you have may many interests in your life, you are the life source for your new friend and they need you to be there strong for them.\nSo how long do farmed animals live (approximately)?\nChicken 7-10 (note rescued battery hens and broiler birds have greatly reduced life spans because of the terrible lives they have endured and the un-natural breeding they have undergone)\nDucks: 10 years\nRabbits: 8-12 years\nSheep: 8-15 years (will greatly depend on the start in life they have had)\nGoats: 10 -15 years\nAlpacas: 15-20 years\nPigs: 8- 12 years (factory farmed or intensively bred pigs have shortened lives due to the terrible conditions they have endured and un-natural breeding they have undergone)\nCows: 15 -20 years\nHorses: 20-25 years\nBut I want an alpaca?\nAlpacas, due to their limited numbers in Australia and relatively small niche market tend to be very well cared for and as such, thankfully so, they are rarely in need of our assistance. And our current alpacas are much needed at the sanctuary.\nWhich animals are most in need of my help?\nThe animals most in need of forever homes are roosters, pigs, goats and sheep. Sorry we currently do not have any hens available for adoption. Due to our current numbers of roosters we need to keep a stable number of hens.\nWill the animal be healthy?\nAll animals are thoroughly health checked, treated for parasites and in the best of health they can be prior to placement.\nHow does the process work?\nOur adoption process consists of three stages. Stage one is the submission of your Prospective Adoption Form. Stage two involves a telephone interview with the final stage being a property inspection/verification.\nOnce an animal has been adopted to their new forever home, it won’t be the last you hear of us We will check in with you throughout the life of the animal to ensure all is going well and assist you with any questions you may have. And in the unlikely event your circumstance change and you can no longer provide the home the animal/s need, they come back to Edgar’s Mission. Animals are NEVER to be on-sold, given away or relocated to a property other than the one occupied by the adopter (unless express agreement have been received from Edgar’s Mission). Many thanks in anticipation of your understanding.\nCan anyone adopt an animal from Edgar’s Mission?\nEdgar’s Mission will only adopt rescued animals to people who can provide a forever home, not to those offering short term or foster care or those intending to rehome the animal themselves. If you are after a cheap lawnmover please try one of the many hardware stores or ebay. Please note we are not able to adopt animals to schools, child care facilities, aged care homes or community groups.\nOh and one last thing, if you are prepared to offer your heart and home to a rescued farmed animal please standby for one of the most rewarding times of your life. So if you are still with us and wish to be there for a rescued farm animal, start clicking.","Indian Ocean coral, bleached, but able to recover.

Ocean heat waves can devastate coral reefs and other ecosystems – and these too are on the increase.\nHeat extremes on the high seas are on the increase, with ocean heat waves disturbing ecosystems in two hemispheres and two great oceans, US scientists report.\nAnd these same sudden rises in sea temperatures don’t just damage coral reefs, they kill the corals and start the process of reef decay, according to a separate study by Australian researchers.\nAndrew Pershing of the Gulf of Maine Research Institute and colleagues report in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that they examined data from 65 marine ecosystems over the years 1854 to 2018 to work out how frequently ocean temperatures suddenly rose to unexpected levels.\nThey found such deviations from the average in the Arctic, North Atlantic, eastern Pacific and off the Australian coasts. They expected to find evidence of occasional hot flushes. But they did not expect to find quite so many.\n“Severe marine heatwave events can have a far more severe impact than coral bleaching – the animal dies and its underlying skeleton is all that remains”\n“Across the 65 ecosystems we examined, we expected about six or seven of them would experience these ‘surprises’ each year,” Dr Pershing said. “Instead, we’ve seen an average of 12 ecosystems experiencing these warming events each year over the past seven years, including a high of 23 ‘surprises’ in 2016.”\nIntense and sudden changes in sea temperatures affect crustaceans, algae, corals, molluscs and many millions of humans who depend on the oceans for income. And a new study by researchers from Australian universities reports that even a rise of 0.5°C is reflected in deaths during an outbreak of coral bleaching.\nCorals live in symbiosis with algae: ocean warming periodically disturbs this normally beneficial relationship. The coral animals evert (turn out) the algae and once-lurid reefs will bleach, and become more vulnerable to disease.\nCorals support the world’s richest ocean ecosystems so such changes are a challenge, both to the survival of biodiversity and to local incomes from the tourism linked to the beauty of the reefs.\nVery warm water\n“What we are seeing is that severe marine heatwave events can have a far more severe impact than coral bleaching: the water temperatures are so warm that that the coral animal doesn’t bleach – in terms of a loss of its symbiosis – the animal dies and its underlying skeleton is all that remains,” said Tracy Ainsworth of the University of New South Wales.\nThe researchers report in the journal Current Biology that they used computer tomography scanning techniques to explore the marine destruction. In 2016, more than 30% of the northern part of Australia’s Great Barrier Reef experienced temperatures higher than those in which corals can survive.\n“We find that the skeleton is immediately overgrown by rapid growth of algae and bacteria,” said Bill Leggat of the University of Newcastle, a co-author.\n“We show that this process is devastating not just for the animal tissue but also for the skeleton that is left behind, which is rapidly eroded and weakened.” − Climate News Network\nAbout the Author\nTim Radford is a freelance journalist.

Scientists around the world are currently monitoring the sixth extinction, predicted to be the most devastating extinction event since the asteroid impact that wiped out the dinosaurs. This time around, the cataclysm is us. In prose that is at once frank, entertaining, and deeply informed, New Yorker writer Elizabeth Kolbert tells us why and how human beings have altered life on the planet in a way no species has before. Interweaving research in half a dozen disciplines, descriptions of the fascinating species that have already been lost, and the history of extinction as a concept, Kolbert provides a moving and comprehensive account of the disappearances occurring before our very eyes. She shows that the sixth extinction is likely to be mankind's most lasting legacy, compelling us to rethink the fundamental question of what it means to be human.

{"question":"How do pocket gophers adapt their digging behavior to different substrate conditions, and what techniques are most effective for controlling their burrowing activity in gardens?","answer":"Pocket gophers adapt their digging behavior significantly based on substrate conditions. In soft substrates, they use scratch-digging with their forelimbs to loosen and remove the substrate. In harder substrates, they combine chisel-tooth and scratch-digging, using their teeth to penetrate the hard substrate while using forelimbs to remove loosened material. Their force production varies dramatically, from 0.08 body weights in soft substrate to 2.0 body weights during chisel-tooth digging in the hardest substrates. As for controlling their burrowing activity, several effective techniques exist. The main options include lethal methods like spring-loaded traps, baiting with toxic substances (zinc phosphide, strychnine, chlorophacinone, or diphacinone), and tunnel gassing. Non-lethal alternatives include installing mesh or wire barriers buried at least 2 feet deep with a 6-inch overhang, using plant barriers like grain crops that lack large underground structures, or employing ultrasonic repellents and scent deterrents.","context":["Online Program ScheduleThe program schedule is subject to change.

Niederschuh S.*, Institute of Systematic Zoology and Evolutionary Biology, FSU Jena; Thomas H., Department of Biomechatronics, Ilmenau University of Technology; Danja V., Department of Biomechatronics, Ilmenau University of Technology; Witte H., Department of Biomechatronics, Ilmenau University of Technology; Schmidt M., Institute of Systematic Zoology and Evolutionary Biology, FSU Jena email@example.com |\nAbstract: While the facial (mystacial) sinus hairs are intensively studied regarding their structure, follicle anatomy and biological role in various mammals, less is known about the tactile hairs found on the palmar side of the rat’s forelimbs near the wrist. These carpal sinus hairs are assumed to play an important role during locomotion in dark or narrow environments as well as for animals possessing a poor vision. In these cases, sensing substrate properties and diameters before touchdown of the forelimbs would facilitate the adjustment of body posture to maintain the dynamic stability of the trunk. So, a coupled sensorimotor control mechanism between the sinus hairs’ sensory system as well as the proprioceptors of the body should exist. To explore the biological role of the carpal sinus hairs and their function during substrate contact, spatiotemporal speed-dependent and kinematic parameters of the limbs and spine were quantified. Measuring was done by x-ray fluoroscopy and normal-light high-speed cameras. A continuous and a discontinuous substrate in the form of a treadmill were used. Data were collected under the presence and absence of the sinus hairs during the preferred animals’ speed. Our investigation shows a time window of approx. 30 ms from carpal sinus hairs’ contact to the substrate until forelimb touchdown. Within this time, adjusting the body posture due to a changing surface takes place. While the sensory input of the carpal sinus hairs does not affect the failure rate on a perforated substrate, it affects the mystacial sinus hairs’ motion (whisking) pattern and has a stabilizing effect on the trajectory of the center of mass, pointing to a connected sensorimotor control loop. Further the carpal sensors act as speedometer by influencing the speed dependence or speed-dependent adaptations of the limb and body kinematics.\nLOC6-2 11:45 am 3D dynamics of burrowing in pocket gophers . Moore Crisp AL*, UNLV; Lee DV, UNLV firstname.lastname@example.org |\nAbstract: Using a self-designed force-sensitive tunnel tube inside an X-Ray, we have been able to measure burrowing in realistic and natural substrates. Here, we present the first full 3-D dynamic analysis of burrowing biomechanics in a vertebrate. The Tunnel-Tube 3.0 is comprised of two tubes arranged in series, with each half mounted on an ATI nano-17 6-axis load cell. The animal enters the first tube and begins digging at the second tube, which is filled with the substrate material. The substrate-filled tubes are uniformly packed and can be exchanged between trials, allowing for a more consistent substrate over time. The dual-tube design allows us to independently measure forces produced by the animal’s fore- and hindlimbs. We tested our design in a representative digger: the Botta’s pocket gopher (Thomomys bottae), which spend most of their lives underground. Pocket gophers burrowed through the Tunnel-Tube in four substrate conditions: Soft radiolucent substrate, hard radiolucent substrate, soft natural soil, and hard natural soil. In soft substrates, pocket gophers exhibited scratch-digging, using the forelimbs to loosen and remove the substrate. In harder substrates, pocket gophers exhibited both chisel-tooth and scratch-digging, typically using the teeth to penetrate the hard substrate and the forelimbs to remove loosened substrate. As substrate hardness increased, the pocket gophers produced more force in order to penetrate the substrate. During scratch digging, gophers produced a minimum mean force of 0.08±0.03 body weights in soft radiolucent substrate and a maximum of 2.0±0.81 BW force during chisel-tooth digging in the hardest substrate. The fact that force profiles spanned nearly two orders of magnitude between treatment conditions indicates that gophers are able to effectively modulate force production during digging in response to soil conditions.\nLOC6-3 12:00 pm The kinematics of grooming: How mammals clean their coat. Schmidt M.*, Friedrich Schiller University Jena; van Beesel J., Friedrich Schiller University Jena; Dargel L., Friedrich Schiller University Jena; Fischer M.S., Friedrich Schiller University Jena email@example.com |\nAbstract: Non-locomotory movements in the behavioural context of grooming, social interaction or food acquisition, in sum referred to as idiomotion, play a major role in the daily activities of mammals. We are interested in their significance for the functional morphology of the motion system in order to better understand the evolutionary role of idiomotion in mammals. So far, studies into grooming, reaching, grasping and other idiomotory activities are mainly initiated by neurobiological questions. Our present studies focus on grooming and we studied the kinematics of grooming-associated movements of limbs and trunk in species with different locomotor adaptations (rats, rabbits, dogs and squirrels) using biplanar X-ray fluoroscopy. Our observations so far support the notion that idiomotion rather than locomotion explains the form and mobility of ball-and-socket joints. Idiomotion also involves repetitive and stereotypic motion cycles (e.g., during scratching or face washing), likely controlled by central rhythm-generating networks. However, grooming movements are less symmetrical than locomotory movements. Differences across species appear to be related to the mobility of the trunk. Rats are able to groom almost all of their body regions using mouth, tongue and teeth, and make use of a plenty of assisting and stabilising postures. Rabbits and dogs have in common a rather limited overall flexibility; they predominantly scratch their fur using the hindlimbs. For the future, we hope to further expand the base for interspecific comparison with respect to the biomechanics of idiomotion as the prerequisite for linking variations in structure and behaviour. This research project is funded by the budget of the institute.\nLOC6-4 12:15 pm Out on a limb: effects of substrate compliance on the gait mechanics of common marmosets (Primates: Callithrix jacchus). Chadwell BA*, Northeast Ohio Medical University (NEOMED); Stricklen BM, Kent State University; Young JW, Northeast Ohio Medical University (NEOMED) firstname.lastname@example.org |\nAbstract: The arboreal “fine-branch niche” - the zone at the edge of canopies where supports are narrow and compliant - has been cited as fundamental in adaptive scenarios of primate locomotor evolution. However, though previous studies have evaluated the influence of substrate breadth on primate locomotor performance, the influence of substrate compliance has been mostly unexamined. We investigated how substrate compliance affects the gait kinematics of marmosets (Callithrix jacchus; n = 2 males) moving over simulated arboreal substrates. As small-bodied quadrupeds with limited grasping abilities, marmosets are a reasonable analogue for ancestral stem primates, and a good model for testing the performance demands of fine-branch locomotion. We used 3D-calibrated video to quantify marmoset locomotion over a 4m long trackway constructed of differently-sized poles (5, 2.5 and 1.25cm), analyzing a total of 120 strides. Depending on experimental condition, the central 0.6m of the trackway was either immobile or mounted on compliant foam blocks. Marmosets predominantly used asymmetrical gaits (i.e., gallops and half-bounds), using symmetrical gaits in only 8% and 15% of strides on the stable and compliant substrates, respectively. Marmosets responded to substrate compliance by increasing contact durations (i.e., greater forelimb and hindlimb duty factors) and more evenly distributing hindlimb contacts (i.e., relatively longer lead durations). Together, variation in duty factor and hindlimb lead spacing explained nearly 60% of the variation in compliant substrate displacement over a stride, suggesting a direct performance advantage to these kinematic changes. Overall, our results show that compliant substrates can exert a significant influence on primate arboreal locomotor performance. Substrate compliance, and not just substrate breadth, should be considered a critical environmental variable in models of primate locomotor evolution.

Shapiro D*, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey email@example.com |\nAbstract: Understanding the relationship between bony pelvic morphology and locomotor behavior has long been of interest to evolutionary anthropologists seeking to use the fossil record to reconstruct our lineage's transition to bipedalism. While early work focused on morphological variation in the external anatomy of the innominate, recent technological advances have permitted the examination and quantification of the internal trabecular architecture of this skeletal element. As trabecular bone is understood to change during life in response to mechanical loading, it is first crucial to characterize the cancellous architecture of extant primates of known locomotor mode in order to build a comparative sample for later work on fossil primates. One of the issues here is that pelvic loading (particularly in non-human primates) is not well understood. Recent experimental work has suggested potential loading regimes for the primate lower ilium (e.g., axial compression, bending, and torsion), which may serve as hypotheses to be tested via trabecular bone analyses (i.e., each should produce different, predictable patterns of trabeculae). The aims of this study were to quantify bone volume fraction and degree of anisotropy (which together explain greater than 80% of mechanical properties of bone) in the lower ilium of 31 extant primates (six species) using high-resolution X-ray CT scans, and to test hypotheses about relationships between loading regime/locomotor mode and these trabecular variables. These results will be novel, as primate iliac trabecular architecture has not previously been quantified at such a fine-grained resolution, and will have important implications for future work using cancellous bone in reconstructing locomotor behavior in fossil primates.

Vereecke EE*, University of Leuven; Vanhoof M, University of Leuven; Szu-Ching L, University of Kent; Kerkhof F, University of Leuven Evie.Vereecke@kuleuven.be |\nAbstract: Primates use their thumb both in manipulation and locomotion leading to conflicting mechanical demands. High thumb mobility is required for manipulative skills while stability and strength are important in locomotion. In this study, we want to investigate how the anatomy of the primate thumb is adapted to this stability-mobility conflict. We focus on two highly dexterous catarrhines, the bonobo (Pan paniscus) and the olive baboon (Papio anubis), with a distinct locomotor, postural and prehensile behavior leading to a different thumb use and load. We obtained fresh-frozen cadaveric hand and forearm specimens via collaboration with the Royal Zoological Society of Antwerp (RZSA), Belgium (5 bonobos; Bonobo Morphology Initiative) and the CNRS, France (3 baboons). A detailed dissection was performed of each specimen with quantification of soft-tissue parameters (e.g. muscle mass and length, fascicle length, ligament dimensions). Each specimen was CT scanned and 3D surface models were created for the trapezium and first metacarpal (MC1) using Mimics software to assess the geometry of the trapeziometacarpal (TMC) joint. Bonobos and olive baboons have a fully opposable thumb, which is reflected in the well-developed thumb musculature. Bonobos have a saddle-shaped TMC joint allowing a wide range of motion, while the prominent volar beak and high joint curvature provide stability. In addition, five ligaments surround the TMC joint, acting as passive stabilizers. We believe that this anatomical configuration offers the required stability for forceful gripping during climbing and suspensory locomotion. Thumb loading is relatively low in baboons, being restricted to occasional climbing and palmigrady. Despite the cylindrical-shaped TMC joint, opposability is maintained by the relatively long length of the thumb. We want to thank Drs. Nauwelaerts, Stevens, Pereboom (RZSA), and Berillon (CNRS) for giving us access to the primate specimens.\n[back to schedule]","Pocket gophers are rodents that feed on plants and vegetation, particularly those with succulent tap roots or large rooted crops. They’re a frequent nuisance that can cause considerable damage to gardens, pastures, and croplands. Intervention is often necessary to prevent continued vegetation damage.\nHow to get rid of gophers? To get rid of gophers, you can either choose a lethal or non-lethal route. The lethal options include spring-loaded traps, baiting, or tunnel gassing. Non-lethal ways include mesh or plant barriers, ultrasonic repellents, scent deterrent products, or placing owl boxes to encourage natural predators.\nIn this article, we’ll discuss the options for gopher control in more detail. We’ll also provide some ways for you to identify and confirm whether your resident pest is a gopher or another rodent. Additionally, we’ll give a complete overview of how to set a gopher trap for a higher success rate.\nWhat Is a Gopher?\nA gopher is a medium-sized rodent. Gophers are generally considered to be pests. They’re herbivores that live underground in extensive tunnel systems. The continental U.S. is home to more than a dozen species of pocket gophers.\nWhat Does a Gopher Look Like?\nA gopher has fur that’s usually brown or greyish, and they boast a set of large incisors. They’re named for their signature fur-lined cheek pouches used for carrying food or nesting material.\nGophers are commonly confused with moles and voles, so you’ll want to confirm which species is indeed causing the problem before proceeding with elimination methods.\nHow Big Can Gophers Get?\nPocket gophers generally get as big as six to ten inches long (15.24 to 25.4 cm). As medium-sized rodents, they weigh about half a pound (0.23kg) to one pound (0.45kg) on average. Male gophers are usually larger than female gophers.\nWhere Do Gophers Come From?\nGophers are part of the Geomyidae family, which has evolved from 33.7-28.5 million years ago based on fossils of nine extinct genera found in North American sediments.\nGophers exist in both North and Central America and are attracted to areas with loose, sandy, or clay-based soil. They can be found in many different habitats, from coastal regions to high mountains and many climates in between.\nHow Long Do Gophers Live?\nGophers can live up to 3 years, which is a common lifespan for rodents of their size. They generally reach reproductive age at about 1 year and are solitary creatures that only come together several times a year to breed. They have many predators, but the species remains very populous.\nWhat Does a Gopher Hole Look Like?\nAn easy way to differentiate between gophers and similar animals is to observe the tunnels.\nA gopher hole generally looks like a fan-shaped mound created by pushing dirt to the surface. In comparison, moles leave runways on the surface that look like small ridges, and they rarely include open holes to the surface.\nVoles also create runways but typically stick to the surface or make small ones underneath the surface about two inches (5.08 cm) in diameter.\nWhen Do Gophers Come Out of Their Holes?\nGophers generally don’t leave their holes for many reasons. At times, they’ll pop their heads out of a tunnel to reach nearby food sources. But predators like owls or hawks may snatch a gopher up if it leaves its holes, so they tend to be extremely cautious about exposing themselves above ground.\nWhat Do Gophers Eat?\nGophers eat a plant or vegetable-based diet and are herbivores. Preferred food sources include the roots and fleshy parts of plants found by digging or close to their tunnel opening above ground. They also prefer herbaceous plants, shrubs, and trees.\nWhat Attracts Gophers to Your Yard?\nWhat attracts gophers to your yard are areas that are most conducive to their burrowing and feeding. This includes areas with cool, moist, healthy dirt or locations that possess desirable plants for feeding.\nSo, it’s fair to conclude that the nicer your lawn or garden looks, the more likely you’re to attract gophers.\nAre Gophers Dangerous?\nGophers aren’t generally dangerous, nor do they usually attack humans. However, they potentially carry rabies or fleas and ticks that can be transmitted to people or pets. Additionally, if they’re trapped or caught, they can bite.\nHow Do I Get Rid of Gophers? Step by Step Instructions\nIf you have a gopher issue, there are ways for you to resolve it and eliminate them.\nTo get rid of gophers, follow these step by step instructions:\nPlace Traps in the Gopher’s Tunnel Opening\nTrapping gophers is one of the most effective methods of removal for small to mid-sized areas. Many body-gripping traps exist, typically as either a two-pronged pincher trap or a choker-style box trap.\nTraps are placed at the entrance of the main gopher tunnel and are triggered when a gopher pushes against them when tunneling. Generally, baiting isn’t necessary for these types of traps, though it’s an option.\nPlace Bait Directly Into the Gopher Tunnel\nBaiting is another option for pocket gopher control that’s generally used in situations less than 20 acres (8.09 hectares). Both baiting and trapping can be used year-round but are most effective during spring and fall when gophers are most active.\nToxic baits generally consist of zinc phosphide, strychnine, chlorophacinone, or diphacinone and cause death to gophers when consumed over time. The best gopher bait typically comes in grain form, such as the Monterey Gopher Bait, or in pellet form, like the Motomco Gopher Killer.\n- For Pocket Gophers\n- Use Below Ground Only\n- Keep Your Gardens Safe\n- No Assembly Required\nHere are the steps on how to place the bait correctly:\n1. Utilize a probe to locate the main tunnels, similar to the trapping method.\n2. Place the bait directly into the tunnel according to directions on the label.\n3. Take care to only place bait in an area with no risk of consumption by other animals, pets, or children as serious harm can occur.\n4. After placing bait, check the site periodically for two weeks and dispose of any carcasses found.\nHire a Professional Fumigator\nWhile gas elimination methods utilizing smoke or gas generally aren’t successful, the use of aluminum phosphide may be effective at getting rid of gopher populations. However, this is a restricted-use material that requires applicator certifications. If you choose this method, you’ll need to hire a professional to apply it.\nGetting Rid of Gophers in Some Specific Places?\nHere’s how to get rid of gophers when they’re in your pasture, garden, or under your house:\nHow To Get Rid of Gophers in Pasture?\nTo get rid of gophers in a large area like a pasture, lethal methods like trapping, gassing, or baiting can be most effective. Additionally, strategic crops, such as grain crops, can be planted for barriers. These options will be discussed further in related sections of this article.\nHow To Get Rid of Gophers in My Garden?\nTo get rid of gophers in your garden, trapping is likely the most desirable option, as it’s only a small area. Baiting may also be used with care to avoid ingestion by pets or children. Natural options like frightening devices or other repellents may also prove effective.\nThese will also be discussed further in this article.\nHow To Get Rid of Gophers Under the House?\nTo get rid of gophers under your house, you may also be able to try to bait or trap, but you risk gophers dying in hard-to-reach areas. Using a frightening device or marking in and around the area with other natural or chemical repellents may be more desirable due to the accessibility of the areas.\nHow To Keep Gophers Away?\nTo keep gophers away, you can do the following:\nUse Frightening Devices\nMany devices exist for the purpose of frightening pocket gophers away from an area. These devices utilize ultrasonic sound, vibration, or other non-chemical repellents. Unfortunately, these don’t always prove effective, possibly due to gopher desensitization from other environmental sounds and sensations.\nUse Other Repellents\nThe use of chemical or natural repellents can also help decrease the attractiveness of a potential gopher habitat. Chemical repellents are usually granular moth crystal products (naphthalene and paradichlorobenzene). Suggested natural repellent products include castor oil, peppermint oil, and garlic stakes.\n- WHY WE LOVE IT: Sky Organics Organic Castor Oil is a natural...\n- FOR FULLER LOOKING HAIR: Sky Organics Organic Castor Oil helps...\n- COLD-PRESSED: Sky Organics 100% pure Organic Castor Oil is...\n- FOR BEST RESULTS: Warm a quarter sized amount of Sky Organics...\n- GOOD FOR YOU, GOOD FOR THE PLANET: Sky Organics Organic Castor...\n- 100% Pure & Natural Peppermint Essential Oil - What sets Artizen...\n- Don't Fall Victim To Cheap Diluted Peppermint Oil - Most of the...\n- Most 4 Ounce Peppermint Oils Contain Less Than 1/3 Of Natural Oil...\n- High Quality Glass Bottles With Eyedropper - We use high quality...\n- Lifetime Warranty - The manufacturer, Artizen Essential Oils,...\nWhat Keeps Gophers Away?\nWhat keeps gophers away from your yard or garden include lethal options, such as utilizing traps, baits, or gas, and non-lethal options, such as using repellents or natural barriers.\nBest Gopher Traps\nBelow are a few examples of effective body-gripping gopher traps found on Amazon:\n- GopherHawk Trapping Set.

The barrier is buried at least 2 ft (60.96 cm) deep, allowing an additional 6-in (15.24-cm) overhang at a 90° angle away from where you’re planting.\nExtend the barrier at least 12 in (30.48 cm) above the surface to prevent gophers from entering at ground level. While this isn’t a perfect method, as gophers can sometimes tunnel more than 2 ft (60.96 cm) deep, generally, this method will provide sufficient protection for most cases.\nPlant or Crop Barriers\nSpecific varieties of crops or plants can also be used as a natural gopher barrier. Grain crops are one example of this, as they lack large underground structures, which offer insufficient food for pocket gophers to survive year-round.\nThese grain crops can be planted in strips around hay fields or used as rotation crops for gopher prevention. There are also many types of gopher-resistant plants, such as rosemary, oleander, citrus, lavender, onion, garlic, eucalyptus, and many others.\nYou can also use a trap crop to keep gophers away from your valued plants, as it’s a preferred food source that lures gophers away from other locations. One example of this is nasturtiums, which are easy to seed, easy to care for, can be reseeded easily, and gophers love them.\nOne benefit of using nasturtiums is that they’ll wilt when a gopher nibbles on the roots, which will alert you to gopher activity below.\nNatural Gopher Predators\nMany wild predators such as barn owls, snakes, and coyotes eat pocket gophers. To eliminate gophers, increasing the presence of barn owls is the easiest choice. You can attract barn owls to an area through the installation of nesting boxes.\nThey tend to hunt areas with abundant prey, so they may not be effective for complete elimination but can help maintain gopher population control.\nHow To Catch a Gopher?\nTo catch a gopher, set up a gopher trap and get them out of their hole.\nHow To Set a Gopher Trap?\nHere are the steps on how to set a successful trap using the GopherHawk:\n1. Walk through the intended area and tamp down all of the mounds. This creates a blank slate so you can easily spot new activities the next day. The goal is to find fresh holes with recent activity.\n2. Mark the tamped holes with a flag such as the Ace Supply Marking Flags for easy surveillance.\n- MARKER FLAGS FOR LAWN - Use our orange flag markers for yard...\n- BUILT TO LAST - Our yard marker flags are constructed of 16 gauge...\n- AERATOR LAWN TOOL - Use yard marking flags to mark sprinkler...\n- SURVEY EQUIPMENT - Our marking flags 100 pack are perfect to use...\n- GRASS PAINT - Use pin flags with grass seed spreader to fill in...\n3. Return the next day to look for new mounds. The smaller the mound, the better. Bigger mounds are more difficult to excavate and determine direction.\n4. Use a spoon or probe tool to search for an opening, not a well-filled tunnel. When you find an open tunnel, the spoon helps determine if it’s a long run or immediately curves. Those that immediately curve or change direction won’t be an optimum location for trap placement.\n5. Excavate the end of the hole using the spoon.\n6. Insert the trap, vertically if using the GopherHawk.\n7. Ensure the trap is in the middle of the tunnel; if not, juvenile gophers will be able to scoot around the trap without setting it off.\n8. Remove the probe and insert a long screwdriver into the probe hole of the Gopher Hawk. Wiggle the screwdriver to open the hole and insert the trap.\n9. Pull up on the trap to set. Don’t press down with pressure, as this will distort the trap opening and make it useless.\nHow To Get Gopher Out of Hole?\nTo get the gopher out of the hole once you’ve trapped them, follow these steps:\n1. Check for capture the next day by tugging on the trap gently upward. If you feel resistance, you likely have a gopher. Don’t attempt to pull the trap up with the gopher, as this will bend and distort the wire mechanism and ruin the trap.\n2. Instead, insert a shovel down behind the trap and remove portions of soil until you can easily lift the trap and gopher out of the now-opened hole.\n3. If the trap wasn’t tripped, there’s no soil in the exit hole, and there are fresh mounds in the area, then you didn’t find a fresh enough tunnel. Try again with new mounds.\n4. If the trap wasn’t tripped, but the exit hole is filled with soil, the trap wasn’t set in a straight tunnel. A juvenile likely got around the edge, or the trap direction was incorrect, so try again.\nAs we detailed in this article, there are many options to get rid of gophers, ranging from prevention to elimination. The most effective methods to keep gophers out of your garden or small area are generally trapping or baiting.\nHowever, if you’re not comfortable with lethal removal methods, non-lethal options can be employed for prevention and discouragement that may prove sufficiently suitable.\nList of Sources\nBaldwin, R.

{"question":"As a marine biologist, I'm curious about how sea ice affects Arctic versus Antarctic marine ecosystems. What are the contrasting trends and impacts of sea ice changes in these polar regions?","answer":"The Arctic and Antarctic show opposite trends in sea ice extent. In the Arctic, sea ice has dramatically decreased over the last 50 years, reaching its lowest extent in 1450 years. This affects the complex Arctic food web that includes phytoplankton, copepods, fish, seals, whales and polar bears. In contrast, Antarctic sea ice is actually growing during winter months. This increase is linked to ice shelf melting from below by warm Circumpolar Deep Water, which releases cold, fresh water that creates a cool surface layer. This surface layer freezes more easily and insulates the sea ice from warmer waters below, leading to increased sea ice formation.","context":["Capped with a formidable ice and snow cover, plunged into total darkness during the winter, buffeted by blizzard winds, and bitterly cold, the Arctic Ocean is one of the most inaccessible and yet beautiful environments on Earth. Life here endures some of the greatest extremes in light and temperature known to our planet. Yet despite these inhospitable conditions, the Arctic Ocean is teeming with life.\nGreat polar bears roam the Arctic ice and swim the Arctic seas. Supporting these top predators is a complex ecosystem that includes plankton, fish, birds, seals, walruses, and even whales. At the center of this food web, supporting all of this life, are phytoplankton and algae that produce organic material using energy from the sun.\nThe Arctic’s extreme environmental conditions have limited our opportunities to study this complex food web. Expeditions to the remote Arctic are difficult and expensive. When we can get there at all, it is usually only in summer. Such gaps in our observations have compromised our ability to understand the food web’s intricacies and vulnerabilities—at a time when the ecosystem appears to be increasingly vulnerable.\nScientists now know that warming temperatures are affecting the Arctic Ocean, producing changes that may have cascading effects on the Arctic’s interlinked and delicately balanced food web. Changes in the food web not only threaten life in the Arctic region, they also could have impacts on Earth’s climate. Populations of Arctic plankton for example, not only provide food at the base of the food web, they also convert carbon dioxide from the atmosphere into organic matter that eventually sinks to the ocean bottom—effectively extracting a heat-trapping greenhouse gas from the atmosphere.\nEvery spring, after the long dark night of Arctic winter, the sun reappears over the horizon. Then, a cumulative sequence of events begins, and life in the Arctic springs into action.\nWith each day longer than the previous one, light begins to penetrate through the thick cover of snow and ice to the undersurface of the ice, where ice algae begin to grow, like mold on a damp ceiling. One green, string-like form, Melosira, grows long, hanging under the ice like Spanish moss. It eventually detaches from the under-ice surface and sinks to the seafloor where it is consumed by the animals living there.\nAs days lengthen, light and warmth increase, and the winter snow cover that accumulated over the ice begins to melt. Once the snow melts, enough light can penetrate through the ice to spur the growth of phytoplankton— very small, drifting, plantlike organisms that live in the water. They become available as food for higher organisms in the food web, the zooplankton—tiny marine animals that, in turn, are eaten by larger animals, from fish to jellyfish to whales.\nNowhere is the plankton ecosystem less well-understood than in the Arctic Ocean. Without more detailed knowledge about the workings of these ecosystems and the life histories of the individual life forms in them, we cannot predict how they will be affected by climate changes. But those changes already appear to be happening.\nScientists have documented dramatic shifts in Arctic ice cover, water temperature in the Arctic Ocean, and the atmosphere above it—all potentially due to the effects of a warming climate. Such changes are likely to affect, and may alter, the Arctic food web and ecosystem. They may change the amounts of water, nutrients, and plankton coming into the Arctic Basin, or change the timing of spring growth.\nThe great bowhead whale, for example, depends on plankton patches found along the northern coast of Alaska for food during its migrations between the summer feeding grounds off of Arctic Canada and its overwintering grounds in the Pacific. Climate-induced changes in the availability of these plankton patches may have dramatic impacts on the whales, with either more or less food available along their migration route.\nPopulations of Arctic plankton are a conduit for the uptake, processing, and transformation of carbon dioxide. Warming related changes in the Arctic environment, such as ice cover, may have impacts on this planktonic conduit. Changes in the amount of carbon that flows and cycles through this food web will change the amount of carbon retained in the ocean or respired back into the atmosphere. These changes may fundamentally alter the structure of Arctic ecosystems.\nTo begin to shed light on the dimly understood Arctic ecosystems and food webs, I lived during parts of 1997 and 1998 at the SHEBA (Surface HEat Budget of the Arctic) ice camp, a major science encampment both on and in the ice in the part of the Arctic Ocean known as the Beaufort Sea, where I studied seasonal and life cycles of the Arctic plankton ecosystem. The heart of the camp was the Canadian Coast Guard icebreaker Des Groseilliers—a big, bright red ship conspicuously and intentionally frozen into the ice for the entire year. It served as a comfortable and opulent (for ice camps!) hotel and laboratory base. Separate labs were scattered on the ice surrounding the ship, housed in structures ranging from small tents to a 20-foot blue metal, bear-proof container, affectionately named the “Blue Bio,” because it supported biological studies.\nLeaving the ship for the labs held risks for the unwary. During summer months, we observed firsthand the effects of a warmer climate, as our stable ice platform melted into an impressive resemblance of Swiss cheese. Life jackets were required equipment when venturing off the ship onto the ice—in case we made a false step between the holes on our way to the labs. In addition, the threat of polar bears was very real, and all eyes were on watch at all times. Often, the tracks of visiting polar bears were visible in the snow in the morning. We had several opportunities to watch these fascinating creatures from the safety of our warm, red ship.\nMy studies focused on copepods—small (1 to 7 millimeters-long) crustaceans that are a critically important link between phytoplankton and larger animals. I concentrated on four species of copepods that dominate the zooplankton community both in terms of numbers and biomass (weight). Each has a different size, different life cycle strategies, and different roles in the food web marked by the quantity and type of prey that they consume.\nTwo of the species are fairly large and are members of the genus Calanus, which are believed to be omnivores (eating both plant-like phytoplankton and tiny animal-like microzooplankton). One medium-sized species, Metridia, is an omnivore and a voracious consumer of Calanus copepod eggs and juveniles. The fourth is the extremely abundant and very small Oithona, also an omnivore.\nAt the SHEBA ice camp in 1997 and 1998, I studied the abundance, reproduction, growth and development rates, and sizes of these four copepod species over their seasonal cycles with my colleague Bob Campbell from the University of Rhode Island. We verified that previous studies dating back to the 1950s through 1970s underestimated the biomass of zooplankton in the Arctic Basin. It may be as much as 10 times greater than we previously believed.\nWe confirmed that Calanus copepods live to be three years old, reproducing during the summer when food is plentiful. Two species (Oithona and Metridia) have more prolonged reproduction that extends over much of the year. The fourth species (C. glacialis) cannot successfully reproduce in the central Arctic, we think, so C. glacialis populations there must be brought in by currents from the surrounding Arctic shelves.\nThese different life histories may have important consequences for the species, and they give scientists new insights into understanding the species’ chances to survive changing seasonal cycles or food availability that might occur with climate change.\nIn an ongoing project, Campbell, Eveleyn and Barry Sherr of Oregon State University, and I are exploring planktonic food webs in western Arctic shelves and basins. We are measuring the rates at which the tiniest animal plankton, called microzooplankton, consume Arctic phytoplankton. We then measure the rates at which the copepods (which are middle-sized plankton, or mesozooplankton) consume phytoplankton and microzooplankton. We also are finding out the food preferences of the different groups. Do copepods prefer a phytoplankton or a microzooplankton diet, for example? Do they eat ice algae?\nTo do this, we conducted feeding experiments during two six-week-long cruises to the Arctic in the summer of 2002, on the U.S.C.G. Healy, the United States’ newest icebreaker—a ship not frozen into the ice! First, we collected plankton by towing plankton nets to catch the copepods and determine their abundance in the water. In feeding experiments, we collect animals and seawater, select a known number of copepods, and incubate them with their prey to measure how much they eat in 24 hours.\nThen we couple the grazing (feeding) rates of individuals with their abundances in the water to calculate the flow of carbon through the food web. This fundamental information is critical to our basic understanding of Arctic food webs, and it gives biological modelers the data they need to predict more accurately the potential impact of environmental and climate change on the fate of carbon in this ecosystem.\nIn the summer of 2004, we will embark on two more cruises on Healy to continue this work. We plan to concentrate on investigating the potential of ice algae as a food source for copepods. We also want to document whether one of the Calanus copepods (C. glacialis) can reproduce using its stored fat alone, or whether it requires available food.\nEvery trip to the largely unexplored Arctic seas brings new challenges, surprises, and insights for researchers. Every trip also contributes to our understanding of this remote, severe, but very active ocean and its role in sustaining life on Earth.\nThe Arctic ecosystem has a unique, complex food web that is fashioned by its distinctive plankton, animal species, and environmental factors. Carbon also cycles through the web from atmosphere to seawater and back. Phytoplankton and algae take up carbon dioxide from seawater and transform it into the organic carbon of their tissue. Then it flows through successive levels of eating animals that convert their prey?s carbon into their own tissues or into sinking fecal pellets. Along the way, some carbon dioxide escapes back to the atmosphere through the organisms' respiration. (Illustration by Jayne Doucette, WHOI)","Sea ice and ice shelves\nWhat is sea ice? Sea ice is frozen sea water; it perennially expands and contracts during each year’s winter and summer. Amongst the sea ice are icebergs calved from tidewater glaciers and ice shelves. Melting sea ice does not contribute directly to sea level rise (ice floats and displaces the same volume of water), but sea ice is important because it enhances climate warming. It changes the reflectivity of the sea water, reflecting lots of sunlight back (it has a high albedo), and is therefore an important component of the climate and cryospheric (icey) system.\nShrinking sea ice in the Arctic\nRecent observations of sea ice extent in the Arctic have shown that the extent of sea ice in the Arctic has plummeted, with observed decreases over the last 50 years meaning that the annual sea ice now is at a minimum not reached for the last 1450 years1. The decreasing extent of sea ice in the Arctic is often used as evidence for the impact of climate change on our world, and graphically illustrates how sensitive our cryospheric system is.\nGrowing sea ice in the Antarctic\nHowever, sea ice extent in Antarctica is actually growing 2. Year on year, there is more sea ice in Antarctica during the winter months. Surely this disproves the notion that climate change is occurring, and that our world is not as sensitive as we thought? Actually, no. There is a whole raft of data showing that the glaciers in Antarctica are responding rapidly to a changing climate, ranging from ice shelf collapse 3 as a result of melting from below and above 4-7, to glacier recession 8, thinning 9 and acceleration 10. It turns out that all this activity has an impact on the ocean around Antarctica.\nIce shelves melt because they are warmed from below by upwelling Circumpolar Deep Water11. Circumpolar Deep Water is relatively warm, and accesses the undersides of ice shelves through deep submarine trenches. This warm subsurface water has enhanced the basal melting of ice shelves, leading to increased amounts cold, fresh water being released from the ice shelves. Together with the release of large quantities of floating ice to the Southern Ocean, the basal melting from the undersides of ice shelves also cools the surface waters of the Southern Ocean and results in a cold, fresh surface layer on the ocean’s surface – and decreased sea surface temperatures (SSTs) 12. A paper just published in Nature Geoscience by Bintanja et al. (2013) indicates that this cool, fresh surface layer insulates sea ice from the warm upwelling waters that are melting ice shelves from below. A 100 m thick layer of sea water is separated from the saltier water below, and is cooled even more by the cold air above. Because these waters are cool and fresh (not salty), they freeze more easily, resulting in peaks in Antarctic sea ice in the autumn and early winter12.\nChanges in snowfall over Antarctica\nWinkelman et al. (2013) argued that climate change may result in increased snowfall in Antarctica13 (although this is likely to be mostly moderated by increases in ice discharge). Most numerical models also predict strong decreases in Antarctic sea ice over coming decades. However, Bintanja et al. (2013) argue that increases in ocean temperature will continue to melt ice shelves from below, releasing cool waters onto the surface of the ocean and maintaining high sea ice cover. Precipitation (snowfall) over Antarctica is related to sea surface temperatures, so increased ice cover and decreasing sea surface temperatures over coming decades may well offset this projected precipitation increase. This may mean that the contribution to sea level rise from Antarctica over coming decades may be underestimated 12.\n1.

{"question":"What are the main symptoms of type 2 diabetes, and how can genetic testing help predict its development?","answer":"Type 2 diabetes symptoms include increased thirst, frequent urination, increased hunger, weight loss, fatigue, blurred vision, and slow-healing sores. In terms of genetic prediction, researchers have identified four loci on genetic maps that correspond to diabetes risk, explaining up to 70% of the genetic background of type-2 diabetes. They found that people with type-2 diabetes have a mutation in a zinc transporter called SLC30A8, which affects insulin secretion. This genetic information can be used to develop tests to predict an individual's risk of developing the disorder.","context":["Patient A.R. belonged to a high-risk group for type 2 diabetes. A.R. became the focal point for this study. It is imperative to interview to forewarn A.R. of the possible debilitating impact of type 2 diabetes. The said ailment is technically defined as a “heterogeneous collection of hyperglycemic syndromes phenotypically and genotypically different … Some type 2 diabetes cases have multifactorial pathogenesis to the complex interaction between unhealthy lifestyle habits, lack of physical activity, and overconsumption of alcohol” (Thomas, 2013, p.3). This medical condition is the outcome of the body’s resistance to insulin, and it gives rise to a common symptom – abnormal glucose levels in the blood (Dods, 2013). Those afflicted with the said malady suffers from a combination of physical manifestations that are listed as follows: 1) increased thirst; 2) frequent urination; 3) increased hunger; 4) weight loss; 5) fatigue; 6) blurred vision; and 7) slow-healing sores (Mayo Clinic, 2016). The proponent of this study interacted with A.R. creating an indirect form of intervention to warn him of the potential complications of the said dreaded disease. Ignorance of the symptoms can lead to the development of heart disease, nerve damage, foot damage, kidney damage, eye damage, and skin conditions.\nspecifically for you\nfor only $16.05 $11/page\nRisk Factors of Developing Type 2 Diabetes\nA.R. validated the rationale for his selection as the main participant in this study. He belonged to the high-risk group because of the high probability of manifesting symptoms of type 2 diabetes. There were several factors mentioned during the interview that verified the said claim. He struggles with weight problems. Obesity is a common denominator when it comes to health issues faced by the immediate members of his family.\nA.R. consumes large amounts of high-calorie meals. He also indulges in different types of junk food like sugared drinks and cakes. His inability to control unwanted food intake exacerbated his weight gain problem. A.R also consumes alcoholic beverages over the recommended daily allowance. He created a type of lifestyle shaped by his association with family members and close friends.\nPreventive Measures to Reduce the Probability of Contracting Type 2 Diabetes\nThe application of preventive measures to mitigate the impact of high blood sugar requires a radical transformation of certain lifestyle habits. However, these actions necessitate the establishment of certain core values. Knowledge and experience are the prerequisites to establish the said core values that alter the way A.R. perceives food intake and the need to socialize friends and loved ones.\nAn effective intervention strategy for weight loss and reduced food intake calls for a sober appreciation of the negative consequences of type 2 diabetes. For example, A.R. needs to understand that millions of cases of type 2 diabetes remain undetected. In other words, millions of people are unknowingly suffering from the deadly consequences of the said disease. They go through life unable to reach their full potential because the symptoms of the said medical condition weigh them down. It is the best time to initiate the process of overhauling certain lifestyle habits.\nDifficulties in Preparing a Healthy Diet\nIn discussions and consultations with health workers, the issue of food intake and alcohol consumption will inevitably crop up. However, it is not prudent to make a matter-of-fact pronouncement that eating healthy alternatives to junk food is the silver bullet that the health care industry utilizes in eradicating obesity. Long-term success is assured if healthcare workers enable A.R. to express the challenges he faces every time he decides to turn a new leaf and clean up his lifestyle concerns. Consider, for instance, the high cost of fresh fruits and vegetables compared to the relatively low prices for processed and canned goods.\nAside from the price difference, it is also important to point out the adjustment problems that A.R. must overcome to ease into a new diet. The consumption of junk food over a long period conditioned his palate to appreciate fast food meals over home-cooked meals. A.R. faces daunting challenges during the initial phase of the transformation process. Health care workers and counselors are expected to assist A.R. in dealing with these issues.\n100% original paper\non any topic\ndone in as little as\nSeeking Medical Intervention\nAs mentioned earlier, there are millions of undetected cases of type 2 diabetes worldwide (Dods, 2013). Therefore, it is sensible to seek medical assistance if a person belonged to a risk group. In the case of A.R., he will reap the benefits of early detection (LeRoith, 2012). He can make drastic changes to his lifestyle before the damage to limbs and internal organs become more extensive.\nPlanning Care for the Group\nAfter interacting with A.R., the opportunity to look into his personal history and personal struggles enabled the proponent of the study to see beyond A.R.’s challenges. It became clear that socio-economic factors influenced A.R.’s actions. It is not enough to deal with their problems by simply prescribing medication, a common approach that deals only with the symptoms and not the root cause of the medical condition. A holistic approach is needed to help the members of the high-risk group overcome the threat of type 2 diabetes. For example, it is best to help them establish a support group comprised of people afflicted with the same disease. Acting as an emotional anchor and source of positive reinforcements, the support group makes it easier for them to face the challenges up ahead. Patients suffering from the consequences of weight problems and excessive consumption of alcohol require the assistance of a physician and the help of counselors, confidants, and respected leaders of the community. They will act as a life coach for them.\nPeople belonging to a high-risk group for type 2 diabetes must undergo a transformation process to overcome the need to consume high-calorie food and the desire to ingest large amounts of alcoholic beverages. They need to acquire new information, and they need to understand the sober realities of a life afflicted with the said medical condition. However, it is also important to realize the socio-economic factors that hurt those trying to lose weight and trying hard to change unhealthy lifestyle habits. Effective intervention strategies and reliable plans for helping at-risk individuals are only possible if healthcare workers and counselors acknowledge the daunting challenges encountered by people struggling with type 2 diabetes symptoms. One of the best ways to increase the likelihood of success is to establish support groups. People like A.R. require more than the scientific knowledge of a physician because they also need the help of a life coach.","Gene features linked to type-2 diabetes risk\nResearchers have identified the most important genes associated with a risk of developing type-2 diabetes.india Updated:\nResearchers have identified the most important genes associated with a risk of developing type-2 diabetes. The study is the first time the genetic makeup of any disease has been mapped in such detail.\nIt should enable scientists to develop a genetic test to show an individual their likelihood of developing diabetes mellitus type 2, commonly known as type-2 diabetes.\nThe researchers identified four loci, or points on individuals' genetic maps, which corresponded to a risk of developing the disorder. The scientists, from Imperial College London, McGill University, Canada, and other international institutions, believe their findings explain up to 70% of the genetic background of type-2 diabetes.\nIn addition, one of the genetic mutations which they detected might further explain the causes behind type-2 diabetes, potentially leading to new treatments.\nThe research revealed that people with type-2 diabetes have a mutation in a particular zinc transporter known as SLC30A8, which is involved in regulating insulin secretion. Type-2 diabetes is associated with a deficiency in insulin and the researchers believe it may be possible to treat it by fixing this transporter.\n\"The two major reasons why people develop type-2 diabetes are obesity and a family link. Our new findings mean that we can create a good genetic test to predict people's risk of developing this type of diabetes,” said Professor Philippe Froguel, one of the authors of the study from the Division of Medicine at Imperial College London.\n\"If we can tell someone that their genetics mean they are pre-disposed towards type-2 diabetes, they will be much more motivated to change things such as their diet to reduce their chances of developing the disorder. We can also use what we know about the specific genetic mutations associated with type-2 diabetes to develop better treatments,\" he added.\nThe scientists reached their conclusions after comparing the genetic makeup of 700 people with type-2 diabetes and a family history of the condition, with 700 controls. They looked at mutations in the building blocks, called nucleotides, which make up DNA.\nThere are mutations in around one in every 600 nucleotides and the cientists examined over 392,000 of these mutations to find the ones specific to type-2 diabetes. The mutations are known as single-nucleotide polymorphisms.\nThe researchers confirmed their findings by analysing the genetic makeup of a further 5,000 individuals with type-2 diabetes and a family history of the disorder, to verify that the same genetic mutations were visible in these individuals.\n\"Until now, progress in understanding how genes influence disease has been painfully slow. This study is one of the first large studies to report results using the new genome-wide technology that governments and research charities have invested heavily in during the past few years,” said Professor David Balding, co-author on the study from Imperial's Division of Epidemiology, Public Health and Primary Care.\n\"Our research shows that this technology can generate big leaps forward. The task now is to study the genes identified in our work more intensively, to understand more fully the disease processes involved, devise therapies for those affected and to try to prevent future cases,\" he added."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:b6a6e71d-ffc6-470f-a2c7-4677f09d2b9e>","<urn:uuid:121df168-1988-4c0d-ae27-bccbf8514fc0>"],"error":null}

This version creates humor by changing the ending while keeping the familiar beginning of the original idiom.","context":["Try a Play on Words (Aka the Joy of Wordplay)\nHave you come across any writing that uses the rule of three, exaggeration, or comical comparisons using a simile? Yes. Great! (No. Okay, keep looking.)\nThe cliché is back in this lesson as part of a technique involving wordplay. By definition, a cliché is an overused expression. The expression was clever once but has become so overused it has lost its impact.\nYou can use clichés to comical advantage by twisting them or using what the authors of Comedy Writing Secrets call reforming. Take a well-known expression, idiom, piece of advice (aka a proverb), or phrase and change the ending to something unexpected. You can also change the words within these widely known sayings provided you retain some of the original words and structure.\nHere’s how comedian (and fellow Canadian) Jim Carrey twisted the idiom “Behind every great man is a great woman”.\n“Behind every great man is a woman rolling her eyes.”—Jim Carrey\nNotice in Jim Carrey’s version he switched the ending to create the humor, which only works because most people are familiar with the original idiom.\nHere’s another example of a poster I saw on Facebook that uses this wordplay technique. Can you guess which well-known proverb it’s based on?\nThis poster is based on twisting the proverb “The grass is always greener on the other side of the fence”.\nAnd the same proverb was the basis of another twist used on the back cover of a memoir on surgical history that I proofread:\n“The bedsheets are always whiter on the other side of the curtain.”\nWhat makes this last version work is it retains the key parts of the original proverb. The word grass is swapped with bedsheets, greener is swapped with white, and the fence is swapped with the curtain. (So clever. I wish I’d come up with it.)\nI did, however, come up with the following sentence to describe my proofreading skills by twisting the words “across a crowded room”:\n“I can spot a missing comma across a crowded page.”\nHere’s another example from the blog post “How to Get Started with Video Content Marketing” on the Top Rank Marketing website:\n“Don’t practice random acts of video.”\nYou can expand this wordplay technique to twist other well-known items such as book titles, song titles or lyrics, slogans, or catchphrases to name a few. The essence of the humor is to base your wordplay on widely recognizable phrases and terms.\nI’ve come across this form of wordplay often in book and chapter titles, which helps add a humorous tone, for example, these two books on grammar:\n• The Joy of Syntax: A Simple Guide to All the Grammar You Know You Should Know by June Casagrande\n• Kiss My Asterisk: A Feisty Guide to Grammar and Punctuation by Jenny Baranick\nIf you peek inside Jenny Baranick’s book, you’ll find fun chapters like these:\n• Goldilocks and the Three Bars: En Dashes, Em Dashes, and Hyphens\n• The Scarlet Punctuation Mark: The Ellipsis\n• Textual Healing: Proofreading\nDo you recognize the origins of these titles?\nScott Martin used wordplay to title this article on the Crazy Egg blog: “Let Me Press Your Buttons: 6 Rules for Clickable CTA Buttons”.\nAs my examples show, you can use wordplay to add fun within your writing or to create a title. Think of a well-known expression and change part of it to give it a twist. To have the best impact, add the twist to the end of the expression. What’s important is to keep some elements of the original expression so people recognize it.\nTwist a cliché. Choose one or more of the following clichés or find one of your own:\n• The acorn doesn’t fall far from the tree.\n• Actions speak louder than words.\n• All dressed up and nowhere to go.\n• Be it ever so humble there’s no place like home.\n• Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.\n• Give them an inch, and they’ll take a mile.\n• People who live in glass houses shouldn’t throw stones.\n• Slow and steady wins the race.\nI’ve added bold to highlight words you might consider changing.

{"question":"As someone studying animal behavior, I'm curious: how do natural abilities and instincts influence the training approaches for falcons compared to dogs?","answer":"The training approaches for both animals are significantly shaped by their natural abilities and instincts, but in different ways. For falcons, training works with their wild hunting instincts, focusing primarily on teaching them to hunt and return to their owners. The training process is highly specialized and cannot deviate from their natural predatory behaviors. In contrast, dog training is more flexible and can be adapted based on the specific breed's natural talents - whether it's retrieving, herding, or other inherent skills. While falcon training is limited to working with their hunting instincts, dog training can incorporate and enhance a wider variety of natural abilities through different activities like structured games, tricks, and puzzle toys that align with their particular skills.","context":["How To Train a Falcon\nFalconry is an ancient art. The word used to refer to a system of hunting using birds of prey, but nowadays it’s considered a sport. It involves training birds of prey such as hawks, sparrowhawks, goshawks, or eagles which, in theory, are wild. The objective is to train these birds so that they hunt and always return to their owners. Let’s take a look at some of the elements involved in order to better understand this interesting activity, and learn how to train a falcon.\nHow to choose the bird\nIt’s important to take the trainer’s level of experience into account when choosing a falcon to train. If the trainer is an apprentice, a Red-tailed Hawk or a female Woolly Hawk are good options.\nIf the trainer is more experienced, a Harris Hawk might be better. This species is known to be easy to handle, as they’re very intelligent birds and excellent hunters.\nHow to train a falcon: steps to follow\nTo train a falcon, the first thing you have to do is to gain the bird’s trust. The falcon has to accept you. Since they’re wild birds, this process can be very slow and difficult. For the first few weeks it’s a good idea to keep it at home, so that you get used to each other’s presence.\nFood is the fundamental link between the trainer and the falcon. This is the basis of training and the only stimulus these birds respond to, by instinct. To get started, the falcon has to be able to jump or fly to its owner’s glove, where a piece of food will be waiting.\nThe trainer should then teach the falcon to fly further away in order to develop its muscles and make it stronger. To do this, put a lure in a kite for the bird to go after. Before it begins to fly, you should probably put a transmitter on its leg so that it doesn’t get lost.\nA matter of patience\nFalconry, or falcon training, is a sport which requires a lot of time and constant dedication. First, you’ll need to take a course or get help from an experienced teacher. It can also be useful to read all the information you can find on falcons and how to train them.\nIt’s a good idea to find out about the laws that are in place where you live regarding this practice. You might need a special license to practice falconry.\nThe training itself demands a lot of patience and perseverance. It’s not the same as training a dog: falcons are wild and fearful animals, so you’ll need to use specific techniques to establish a bond with your bird. You’ll have to dedicate many hours to training and repeating the exercises over and over.\nEquipment needed to train a falcon\nThe activity requires a lot of space; trainers often practice it on the grounds of a country house or something similar. You also have to ensure that health and hygiene conditions are optimal.\nIn addition, there are a few tools that are indispensable during training in order to guarantee the protection and safety of both the bird and the trainer.\nOne of the most important pieces of equipment is the falcon hood. This should be made of leather and serves to cover the bird’s eyes and keep it calm. Another fundamental component is the trainer’s glove, which is also leather. This helps make the arm more comfortable for the falcon and, at the same time, to protect the trainer from the bird’s claws.\nIn addition you’ll need some jesses, which are leather straps that you tie to the falcon’s legs. They’ll help you control the animal while it’s on the glove or on the perch.\nHow to acquire a falcon\nIn some countries, the only legal way to acquire a falcon is through a center where they’re held in captivity. If the bird comes from another country, you need a CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) certificate. This is an international agreement to protect certain species of animals.\nA controversial activity\nFalconry is an activity that’s surrounded by much controversy. For some people, it’s a hunting practice that threatens wildlife. For others, it’s an intricate method of communication that creates a very strong bond between man and bird.It might interest you...\nAll cited sources were thoroughly reviewed by our team to ensure their quality, reliability, currency, and validity.

Whether it’s dogs, cats, birds, or even reptiles, training them is often a necessary part of ensuring they’re happy, healthy, and well-embedded into your family life. In this article, you’ll find valuable insights on how to develop a training program for your pet, specifically dogs, that not only helps them learn new skills but also enhances their natural abilities. With the right techniques, you can ensure that training is a positive and rewarding experience for both of you.\nBefore we delve into the nuts and bolts of creating a training program, it’s important to understand the inherent abilities of dogs. All breeds of dogs have specific talents that, if nurtured correctly, can make training more effective and enjoyable.\nPet dogs are descendants of wolves and retain many of their wild relatives’ traits. For instance, retriever breeds have an instinct to fetch, while herding dogs are excellent at gathering other animals. Recognizing these natural abilities and incorporating them into your training can significantly enhance their learning experience.\nStart by observing your dog to identify their natural skills. Maybe your pet loves to dig, runs exceptionally fast, or has a keen sense of smell. Once you identify these skills, you can tailor your training program to emphasize and enhance them.\nNow, onto the actual training process. Positive reinforcement is a tried-and-tested method that uses rewards to encourage good behavior. This approach is not only effective in training dogs but can also help strengthen your bond with your pet.\nIn positive reinforcement, you reward your dog immediately after they perform the desired behavior. This could be a verbal praise, a treat, or their favorite toy. The reward should be something that your dog finds highly desirable, so they associate the reward with the behavior, making them more likely to repeat it.\nRemember, timing is crucial. The reward must be given immediately after the behavior so that your dog associates the reward with the behavior.\nPlaytime can be a powerful tool in training your pet. It keeps them engaged and makes learning new behaviors a lot more fun. Plus, incorporating games into your training can help enhance your pet’s natural abilities.\nFor example, if your dog has a natural affinity for fetching, you can use a game of fetch to train them on commands such as ‘sit’, ‘stay’, or ‘come’. During play, you can also introduced structured games that stimulate their mental abilities and keep them engaged.\nHide-and-seek, for instance, is a fun game that also teaches your dog to stay and come on command. Plus, it keeps them mentally stimulated as they try to find you or a hidden treat.\nAdding tricks to your training program can bring an element of fun and challenge and can also help fine-tune your dog’s natural skills. When teaching tricks, select ones that align with your dog’s inherent abilities.\nIf your dog loves to dig, teach them to dig in specific areas or containers. If they’re a fast runner, train them to race on command. If they have a keen sense of smell, train them to find hidden objects or treats.\nTricks can be a great way to channel your dog’s natural instincts into behaviors that are enjoyable and entertaining. It can also provide mental stimulation, which is essential for your dog’s well-being.\nLastly, but crucially, being consistent and patient throughout the training process is key. Dogs learn through repetition, so being consistent with your commands and rewards will help them understand what you expect from them.\nPatience is also vital. Training takes time, and progress can be slow. Additionally, some behaviors might be difficult to teach depending on your dog’s age, breed, or temperament.\nDespite these challenges, don’t give up. Celebrate small victories along the way, and know that with time and persistence, your pet will learn the required behaviors.\nTraining your dog should be an enjoyable process that strengthens your bond and enhances their natural abilities. With the right approach and techniques, you can create a training program that your pet will not only find rewarding but fun too.\nIf you’re looking for advanced ways to enhance your dog’s natural abilities and provide mental stimulation, consider introducing clicker training and puzzle toys to your training program. Using these tools can help to further develop problem-solving skills in your dog, making them more intelligent, focused, and agile.\nClicker training is an effective positive reinforcement training technique that capitalizes on the concept of \"marking\" a good behavior. In this method, a distinct sound, usually from a small mechanical device called a clicker, is used to signal to the dog that it has performed the desired action correctly. The click is immediately followed by a reward, thereby reinforcing the positive behavior. By incorporating clicker training into your training sessions, you can help your dog to learn new commands and tricks faster.\nOn the other hand, puzzle toys are great tools for mental stimulation. They challenge your dog’s brain, fostering their problem-solving skills. These toys require your dog to figure out how to get the treat hidden inside them, and in the process, they learn patience, persistence, and creative thinking. Plus, these toys can keep your dog occupied for extended periods, allowing you to squeeze in some much-needed quiet time.\nRemember, mental stimulation is as important as physical exercise. A well-stimulated dog is not only happier but also less likely to engage in destructive behaviors.\nWhile training your dog at home can be a rewarding experience, sometimes, it may be beneficial to enlist the help of a professional dog trainer. Particularly if you’re training a dog to perform specific tasks such as being a service dog or if you have a dog with behavioral issues that you’re finding difficult to address, professional help can be invaluable.\nProfessional dog trainers have extensive knowledge and experience in handling different breeds and temperaments. They can also provide more advanced training techniques tailored to your dog’s specific needs. Furthermore, they can help identify and correct any potentially harmful behaviors in your dog before they become ingrained habits.\nHowever, hiring a professional dog trainer doesn’t mean you’re off the hook. You will still need to reinforce the training at home consistently. Moreover, you can learn effective training techniques from the professional trainer, which you can later apply in your training sessions.\nTraining your dog doesn’t have to be a tiresome task. With the right mindset and techniques, it can be a fun and rewarding process that enhances your dog’s natural abilities. Whether you’re using positive reinforcement, teaching dog tricks that align with your dog’s inherent skills, or incorporating play into your training sessions, the key is consistency, patience, and a strong bond with your dog.\nRemember, every dog is unique, and what works for one dog may not work for another. Therefore, it’s essential to understand your dog’s natural abilities and tailor your training techniques accordingly.\nA well-trained dog is not only a delight to be around but also a happier, healthier, and more balanced companion. So invest your time and effort into training your dog and, in doing so, you will reap the rewards of a loving and lasting relationship with your furry friend."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:e30494b3-fea6-48c2-b602-008b2901c039>","<urn:uuid:0a6a2981-a3e5-4b7b-9944-c45e6d94aa16>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do the Bang & Olufsen BeoLab 90 and Technics SB-G90 speakers compare in terms of their driver configuration and power output?","answer":"The BeoLab 90 and SB-G90 have significantly different configurations. The BeoLab 90 features 18 Scan-Speak drivers per speaker (7 tweeters, 7 midrange drivers, 3 woofers, and 1 front woofer) powered by 14 ICEpower amplifiers and 4 class D amplifiers, delivering up to 8,200 watts per speaker. In contrast, the Technics SB-G90 uses a 3-way 4 speaker configuration with two 16cm woofers and a coaxial unit combining a 16cm midrange and 2.5cm tweeter, with a much lower power handling of 100W rated and 200W maximum.","context":["Are lifestyle, and audiophile exclusive design terms from one another?\nIs it a form vs. function debate?\nI’ve been struggling a bit with the concept lately in the strictest sense of the words, and the BeoLab 90 I’m writing about here brought the question to the forefront for me again. The 90 is about as far as you can get from a conventional audiophile loudspeaker design, yet with it’s $90,000 USD ($118,000 CAN) price tag it is firmly planted in ultra high-end audio territory.\nCould either muscle out the other when it comes to loudspeaker design (or any high-fidelity product for that matter)? I think yes, and it can certainly go either way.\nWe’ve all seen our share of audiophile-centric designed turntables, amps, and speakers that are so single-purposed in their aesthetic execution (function) that many wouldn’t want them gracing their living, or listening rooms.\nAt the other end of the spectrum, lifestyle-oriented hi-fi designers are meant to focus on the looks of a product (form), and integrating it into a home environment, with ultimate fidelity perhaps suffering in deference to that mandate.\nSo if we can consider lifestyle, and audiophile as extremes of the same spectrum, where’s the median? Who’s working to bring those two disparate goals into the middle?\nBang & Olufsen is an example of a company who’s focused on creating high-fidelity products that sound as good as they look. They’re all about integrating music into daily life, and they do it at a lot of price points, and for every type of room, apartment, or detached home. But could we consider them an audiophile company?\n“Most audiophile loudspeakers are designed for a person – we often say – with one chair, and no friends…” jokes B&O’s Geoff Martin in a promotional video for the 90.\nThe BeoLab 90 is B&O’s rarely heard/seen flagship loudspeaker design, and it is firmly entrenched in the company’s lifestyle-design roots, with it’s integration into the rest of B&O’s multi-room control technology, but again, it is most certainly marketed at audiophiles.\nI wrote a few weeks back that I had stumbled across a pair of the über-rare, multi-driver, DSP-enabled, bespoke-amplified loudspeakers with active-room compensation at Commercial Electronics a few blocks from my home in Vancouver, British Columbia. But at the time they had not had their basic DSP options set up, so Chris Jones asked if I could come back for a listen when they had the 90s set up proper-like. Fast forward, and I was told they would be ready to listen to on Monday. I walked down around 11 a.m., and Commercial Electronics’ product specialist Mike Steiger joined Jones in helping to get me settled in with the 90s for a listening session.\nBut first a little background on the BeoLab 90 for those not familiar with Bang & Olufsen’s statement 8,200-watt, Dalek-inspired behemoths.\n“BeoLab 90 has 18 state-of-the-art Scan-Speak loudspeaker drivers placed in carefully defined locations and directions to deliver maximum performance in frequency, time and space. The floor speaker packs a combination of 14 channels of the latest generation ICEpower amplifiers – a compact and highly efficient platform developed by Bang & Olufsen – and four additional class D amplifiers, all customized for the BeoLab 90. In total, the amplifiers can deliver up to 8,200 watts per loudspeaker.”\nFor those wondering just what’s in the box, a full list of specs is included at the end of this post. B&O describes these loudspeakers thus:\n“It will not be for everybody, but it will be for the right somebody. Three years in the making, BeoLab 90 is the culmination of our wildest dreams. And with no less than 8,200 watts per loudspeaker, by far the most powerful sound experience we have ever built.\nCreating perfect sound in a room meant for nothing but listening is one thing. It is a whole other ball game to create perfect sound in a room designed for living. BeoLab 90 is perhaps the world’s most advanced digital loudspeaker, providing unprecedented user control of its acoustic performance – adapting to your living space and preferred listening modes through intelligent design.”\nAs I said, B&O is big on lifestyle. Their products are designed with socialization, and enjoyment of life while listening to music as a paramount design principle. One could describe this as diametrically-opposed to current, conventional audiophile design précis where you have the aforementioned individual sequestered in a room with one chair. But which camp does the 90 truly fall in? At it’s price point, this isn’t the transducer for someone looking to kit out the family room with a nice set of speakers – the BeoLab 17s or 20s can easily fill that niche at a considerably lower price point – the 90s seem targeted at someone who takes high fidelity very seriously indeed.\nThis was what I had on my mind while I sat down to listen,.\nSince I wanted to see what the B&O statement loudspeakers were capable of from an audiophile’s standpoint, Jones, and Steiger let me play very loudly indeed. I appreciated the ability to push the SPLs into the 100dB+ territory, but in the back of my mind I kept wondering how’d they be at a much more social volume in a living room full of friends playing party games.\nThe Commercial Electronics space is a large one, with soaring 20-foot ceilings in a large, carpeted, concrete, loft-like space. The 90s were approximately 10 feet apart, and I was about 12 feet back from the driver plane. I downloaded the BeoLab 90 app for my iPhone which let me choose three DSP listening modes: Wide, Narrow, and Omni. I did all my listening in either Wide or Narrow Modes. Wide is for a more standard stereo presentation, Narrow is what I would describe as the sweet-spot mode, and Omni is for a non-directional, or social-listening experience; think party.\nI brought a USB stick along with a number of high-resolution files for listening, and started off in Narrow Mode, and the first album up was Beck, Morning Phase in 24/192. The soundscape was absolutely enormous, with imaging well behind the speaker plane despite the sub-optimal placement of the 90s (distance from the front wall was about 15 inches), so in my mind B&O’s DSP/Active Room Compensation was doing it’s job well enough to create the aural illusion that the speakers were about eight feet out. The only catch was the sonic dispersion seemed a touch beamy if you will. A little compressed laterally for my liking. Switching to Wide Mode halfway through Morning (just a touch on the phone app) instantly opened everything up even wider/deeper especially in the vertical plane from a spatial standpoint. The difference was not subtle. Beck’s guitar strumming took on a hyper-real quality to the fret, and string work, and the decay on his voice was spilling over behind my listening position. Quite a trick indeed. Narrow Mode seems to concentrate imaging in a cluster of about a 10-foot horizontal oval about eight-feet in front of the listener, but there is a slight edge, or crispness to upper registers at high volume that was lacking in Wide Mode to my ears.\nKruder Dorfmeister, The K&D Sessions (24/48) is an album I play often, it’s a fantastic downtempo electronic mash with huge, roiling bass lines, and sound effects galore, but through the big 90s it exhibited more bass definition, control, and transient speed to notes from every instrument on this particular track (Roni Size, Heroes) than any other loudspeaker I’ve heard it on. I just want to emphasize that I had the volume level loud. Really loud. Live venue loud. Loud enough that customers in other parts of the store seemed to be leaving, but Jones, and Steiger never once asked me to turn it down. Few loudspeakers I’ve heard have been able to portray as convincing a human-sized spatial presentation as the BeoLab 90s did. There was never a sense of compression, or that sense that that’s enough volume, back it off laddy, that just about every other system I’ve heard at high SPLs has exhibited. I’ve used the terms effortless, and sense of unlimited headroom before, but in this instance the 90s went an order of magnitude beyond either.\nFink, Sort of Revolution (24/44.1) has an almost laid-back insistence to it’s percussion, and guitar work whenever I’ve listened to it previously, but there has always been a cohesive gel – if you will – keeping the frontman firmly glued to the rest of the band. Not so here. Here the vocals, and guitar were portrayed in a startlingly forward manner, as if Fin Greenall was sitting well in front of the rest of the band on the sound stage. Switching to Narrow Mode did little to dispel the illusion, but it did reign-in the size of the performance somewhat. Engegard Quartet’s String Quartet (24/192) sounded exceedingly lifelike in their room presence, with huge amounts of spatial decay off their strings which created a palpable sense of live, wood-bodied instruments being played in very close proximity. Switching to Wide Mode allowed the quartet to regroup itself within the sphere of sonics created around my listening position by the BeoLab 90s, and have a bit more space between the individual performers. Tone, and timbre were just slightly thinner than my personal preference, but the realism, and reproduction of resined bows on individual strings, and fingerboards being pressured during play almost gave the feeling of zooming-in on a photo with a smartphone. The closer you got to the origin of the sound, the more clarity, and contrast of the performance was revealed.\nThe BeoLab 90 sound to my ears is one of transparency, and speed, but the bottom end, despite being incredibly taught, was really fleshed out: a truly noteworthy feat. It had the feeling of being fat, without any flab, of real driver excursion without any sacrifice of definition at the lowest octaves. It’s difficult to have a true preference between the two modes I experimented with because both sounded amazing, albeit different, and depending on the cut/mastering the Wide/Narrow beam presentation radically changed the sonic landscape.\nFinishing up my time with the 90s brought me back to my original vexation: Is it a lifestyle or audiophile product? I think it is such a unique design, and concept, especially with it’s ability to instantly adjust its sonic presentation on-the-fly (down to focus-tailoring the sound based on one’s sitting position in a room when fully digitally-optimized through beam width/direction control), that it is a wholly new type of high-fidelity product in my eyes. It is both lifestyle, and audiophile. With the 90s only dependence on what source you feed them, this new type of high-fidelity breed is something we are sure to see more of in the future (there are already a number of powered monitors on the market with many digital/analogue inputs, DSP, and active-room compensation, but not at this level of sophistication. Thirty-eight drivers per pair is an incredible technical accomplishment, and sets the BeoLab 90 apart in my estimation). My hope is that as time passes, the technology that B&O has invested into the 90 will trickle down, and we’ll see more of it in their entry-level products. Until then – if you are lucky enough to have a B&O dealer in your vicinity – these are worthy of tracking down, and scheduling a listening session to experience firsthand.\nBeoLab 90 specifications:\nWeight: 137 kg, Wireless Input (Master and Slave speaker): Wireless Power Link (24 bit / 48 kHz), WiSA (24 bit / 96 kHz).\nAnalogue Input (Master speaker): Power Link RCA, XLR (fully balanced).\nDigital Input (Master speaker): USB Audio (24 bit / 192 kHz) S/P-DIF (24 bit / 192 kHz) Toslink (24 bit / 96 kHz).

Building on the linear-phase, point- sound-source concept, this system reproduces a vast sound field with excellent clarity, precision and realism over a wide range. From low to super-high frequencies.\nUnwanted vibration thoroughly eliminated to achieve clear sound imaging\nBalanced Driver Mounting Architecture\nEquipped with a newly developed Balanced Driver Mounting Architecture, the speaker unit is mounted to a sub-baffle installed inside the cabinet at the speaker unit‘s centre of gravity, which suppresses unwanted vibration of the speaker unit itself. Also, because the speaker unit is not mounted to the baffle on the front, transmission of unwanted vibration from the speaker unit to the baffle can be suppressed.\nThis makes it possible to reduce distortion from the drive unit and in addition reduce unwanted vibration from the front baffle. As a result, the speaker can reproduce a sound field which gives impressive imaging with both realism and clarity, allowing visualisation of the fine details of each and every sound.\nHigh Rigidity Cabinet\nCabinet strength is increased by using a cross construction with sub-baffles, to which the speaker units are mounted, and horizontal reinforcing panels. A separate sub-baffle is used for each speaker unit, which minimises the effect of mutual vibration between speaker units.\nHigh accuracy achieved by a newly developed coaxial unit\nPoint Sound Source Speaker System\nWhen reproducing sound with full spatial expression, ideally the wave-fronts emitted from the speaker units are aligned at the listening position, i.e. providing a point sound source.\nWhile inheriting the linear phase concept, the SB-G90 has newly developed two-way coaxial cone units (including mid-range and tweeter) targeting high-speed reproduction with high sensitivity.\nWide Range & Low Distortion Reproduction\nIn order to fully reproduce the wide frequency spectrum in high-resolution music sources, the SB-G90 uses both a newly developed 25-mm phase precision tweeter and two newly developed 16-cm low-distortion, long-stroke woofers, achieving a wide frequency range of 27 Hz to 100 kHz.\nIn addition, the diaphragm material of all the speaker units is made of anodized aluminium in order to unify the tones over the entire frequency range.\nAlso, all the speaker units have features such as copper rings and high-linearity-drive voice coils, thereby achieving low distortion over a wide frequency range.\nThese characteristics enable smooth and well-balanced music reproduction.\nPhase Precision Driver (Coaxial 2-Way Speaker Unit)\nA lightweight, high-rigidity aluminium anodized 25mm dome is used for the diaphragm of the tweeter. The driver achieves a wide frequency range up to 100 kHz by using a new dome shape optimized through simulation, as well as achieving greater uniformity in phase characteristics by the use of a phase plug.\nIn addition, the SB-G90 uses high-linearity-drive underhung voice coils, the magnetic gaps of which have had magnetic fluid injected to suppress temperature rise, thereby ensuring superior power linearity. These features provide reproduction of the high-frequency range with superb detail and beauty.\nAs with the tweeter, the mid-range also uses an anodized, lightweight, high-rigidity aluminium cone diaphragm. The magnetic circuit achieves low distortion and enhanced drive power by using large magnets, copper caps, and high-linearity-drive underhung voice coils.\nAlso, the SB-G90’s drive unit feature a frame using die-cast material. This minimises resonance, thereby eliminating even the slightest unnecessary resonance from the sound. These features enable reproduction of mid-range with excellent precision and response.\nLow-frequency reproduction with excellent response and low distortion\n16cm Low Distortion Long Stroke Woofer\nThe 16cm Low Distortion Long Stroke Woofer woofers have features such as double magnets producing increased drive power, and the magnetic circuit with high-linearity-drive overhung voice coils, copper rings, aluminium short rings, and this newly developed long-stroke unit achieves low-frequency reproduction with wide dynamic range as well as excellent low distortion and response even for large amplitude signals.\nAlso, the frame uses a die-cast structure that disperses resonance, thereby thoroughly eliminating even the slightest unnecessary resonant sound. A lightweight, high-rigidity aluminium cone diaphragm on which anodizing has been performed is used for the diaphragm to ensure uniformity in tone with the mid-range and high frequencies. These features reproduce deep and powerful bass.\nEmotive Acoustic Technology\n- Balanced Driver Mounting Architecture\n- Point Sound Source Speaker System\n- Wide Range & Low Distortion Reproduction\n- Phase Precision Driver(Coaxial 2-way Speaker Unit)\n- 16-cm Low Distortion Long Stroke Woofer\n- High Quality Network Circuit\nTechnics Definitive Design\n- Magnet Fixed Fabric Grille\nDimension (W x H x D)\n- 302 x 1114 x 375 mm (11-7/8 x 43-27/32 x 14-3/4 Inch) *Including Grille and Terminals with Spike\n- Approx. 32kg (Approx. 71lbs) /pc\n- 3-Way 4 Speakers Bass Reflex\n- *Including Coaxial 2-Way for Midrange and Tweeter\n- Speaker Unit: Woofer: 16cm (6-1/2\") Cone Type x2\nMidrange/Tweeter: Coaxial, 16cm (6-1/2\") Cone Type x1 / 2.5cm (1\") Dome Type x1\n- Crossover Frequencies: 480Hz, 3.2kHz\n- Frequency Range: 27Hz - 100kHz (-16dB), 32Hz - 85kHz (-10dB)\n- Sound Pressure Level: 88dB /2.83V (m)\n- Input power (IEC): 100W (Rated), 200W (Max)\n- Recommended Amp.

While it is designed to protect you from a range of potential risks and liabilities, there are some events and scenarios that are not covered under your policy. That’s why it’s crucial to read your policy carefully and understand what is and isn’t covered.\nThe Fine Print: What Homeowners Insurance Does Not CoverIt’s essential to read the fine print of your homeowners insurance policy to understand what is not covered. Some of the most notable exclusions include:\n- Natural disasters: As mentioned, homeowners insurance does not cover damage caused by earthquakes, floods, or landslides.\n- Home maintenance: If damage occurs due to wear and tear or lack of maintenance, it is not covered. For example, if a storm damages your roof, but it was already in poor condition, any repairs or replacements may not be covered by your policy.\n- Criminal activity: If damage occurs as a result of criminal activity such as theft or vandalism, it may not be covered.\n- Business activities: If your home is being used for business purposes and damage occurs, it may not be covered under your standard homeowners policy.\nWhy Natural Disasters Are Excluded from Homeowners InsuranceThe reason natural disasters are excluded from homeowners insurance policies is that they are considered high-risk events, and the potential insurance payouts can be significant. As a result, insurance companies typically require homeowners to purchase additional coverage or riders to protect against these types of events. Even with additional coverage, there may be exclusions and limitations based on the specific circumstances of the event. For example, earthquake insurance may not cover damage to your swimming pool, while flood insurance may not cover damage to your seawall.\nA Closer Look at Flood, Earthquake, and Landslide CoverageWhile standard homeowners insurance policies do not cover natural disasters, there are additional insurance policies available to help homeowners protect against specific risks. Flood insurance: Flood insurance is available through the National Flood Insurance Program and private insurance companies. It offers protection against damage caused by flooding, which is not covered under a standard homeowners policy. However, it’s essential to note that flood insurance typically has a waiting period of 30 days before coverage kicks in. Earthquake insurance: Earthquake insurance is available as a separate policy or as an add-on to your homeowners policy. It offers protection against damage caused by earthquakes, which are not covered under a standard policy. However, earthquake insurance can be expensive, and deductibles are often high. Landslide insurance: Landslide insurance is much more limited than flood and earthquake insurance and is only available in certain areas. It offers protection against damage caused by landslides or mudslides, but coverage is typically limited to damage to the structure of your home and not the land around it.\nWhat Homeowners Can Do to Protect Against Natural DisastersIn addition to purchasing additional insurance coverage, there are several steps homeowners can take to protect their homes against natural disasters.\n- Invest in home maintenance: By keeping your home in good condition, you can reduce the risk of damage from natural disasters and increase the chances of coverage from your insurance policy.\n- Prepare for disasters: By having an emergency plan in place, you can minimize the risk of damage and make the claims process smoother if there is damage.\n- Consider home improvements: Installing features such as a sump pump or reinforced roofing can help protect against damage from floods or high winds."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:739ef5dc-e86e-483c-b436-b88864e07144>","<urn:uuid:c687d6ff-a6de-4a40-b28e-d8a690c5b0ed>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the challenges of implementing permanent sanitation solutions in informal settlements, and what technological alternatives are emerging globally?","answer":"Implementing permanent sanitation solutions in informal settlements faces several challenges including unsuitable topography, settlement density, proximity to infrastructure like power lines or railways, and the need for underground water and sewer networks. However, emerging technological alternatives include new toilet systems that operate independently of traditional infrastructure, such as urine diversion and dehydration toilets being piloted in some areas. Additionally, innovations like the No-Mix Vacuum Toilet system offer potential solutions by significantly reducing water usage and enabling resource recovery through waste separation, though implementation considerations would need to account for local conditions and infrastructure constraints.","context":["Do residents of Cape Town’s informal settlements receive inferior sanitation services to those provided to residents living in wealthier areas? Does this constitute unfair discrimination?

The most iconic instance of this campaign was the public toilet queue for Sanitation, Safety and Dignity held on Global Water Day, 20 March 2010. Since then SJC has engaged with the City on numerous occasions through protest action, public hearings and participation in the City’s budget processes.\nIn its court papers, the SJC argues that every person has a fundamental right to decent, safe and adequate provision of sanitation services. Essentially, SJC argues that this right places an obligation on the City to develop a reasonable plan for the provision of permanent sanitation services to residents of informal settlements. This must all be done within the City’s available resources.\nThe SJC claims that at least 65% of the toilets provided to informal settlements are container, chemical or portable flush toilets (PFTs). These toilets are different from full flush toilets which are typically found in wealthier homes. Full flush toilets are toilets which are connected to a sewerage and wastewater system. Container, chemical and PFT toilets on the other hand, are essentially temporary in nature and require regular maintenance and servicing.\nThe SJC argues that these toilets are demeaning, undignified and considered socially and culturally unacceptable by their users. It also argues that these toilets, especially PFTs, are unsafe to use at night because one has to relieve oneself outside. This safety risk is worse for women who live in informal settlements with high crime rates. The SJC states that these toilets do not provide privacy because family members have to relieve themselves in front of each other. Lastly, the SJC says these toilets, especially chemical toilets and PFTs, are unhygienic due to the harsh chemicals which are used and the repeated delay by City officials to collect and empty them regularly. Many of the SJC’s supporting affidavits contain descriptions by people who have contracted diarrhoea and other diseases because, they claim, of these toilets.\nThe primary argument in the SJC’s papers is that because these sanitation services are of an inferior nature, the City’s actions constitute unfair discrimination on the grounds of race, socioeconomic status and location. This is because most informal settlement residents are black Africans many of whom live in poverty. The SJC argues that the absence of a reasonable plan to eradicate these toilets perpetuates race inequality inherited from apartheid. Lastly, in its expert affidavit, the SJC says that providing full flush toilets to residents of informal settlements will be cheaper in the long run than providing the current temporary solutions.\nThe SJC wants an order that will compel the City (1) to develop a reasonable plan for the provision of permanent sanitation services to Enkanini and CT Section in Khayelitsha; (2) to make that plan available to residents of those areas; (3) to take reasonable steps to implement that plan; and (4) to report back to the court under oath on the steps it has taken.\nIn its response the City argues that the law does not prescribe the use of any particular type of toilet. The City also points out that globally governments are beginning to move away from providing full flush toilets because they are not environmentally sustainable. As such, governments around the world are beginning to experiment with new types of toilet technologies which are independent of water, sewerage or electricity. The City has one such pilot project which has been running since 2010. In this community, a toilet referred to as a “urine diversion and dehydration toilet” is being used. The City argues that in the future, it may well begin to roll out entirely different types of toilets.\nAt present however, the City says that it would ideally like to prioritise water-based sanitation to residents of informal settlements. The City says that ideally one flush toilet should be provided for every five households. Flush toilets require a water supply and sewer reticulation network both of which are usually stored underground and connected to bulk services such as a water reservoir and wastewater treatment plant. But due to some constraints, the City argues it is not always feasible to provide full flush toilets.\nSome of these constraints include the topography of the particular settlement, the density, and whether the informal settlement is an unsuitable location such as near a power line, railway, major road, or landfill site. Also, the City argues that the provision of sanitation and water services should not be viewed in isolation. To the contrary, when the City improves services to communities this is done in the context of upgrading informal settlements in general. So the City aims to improve the living conditions in informal settlements across the board by also ensuring better access to electricity, jobs and community facilities. The City currently plans informal settlement upgrades in accordance with its five-year plan which is reviewed annually.\nThe City denies that the services it provides to residents in informal settlements are inferior, unsafe to use or pose health risks. The City also denies the allegation of racial discrimination and argues that in most cases the reason for not providing full flush toilets is due to the constraints described above.\nFor example, in CT section Khayelitsha, full flush toilets have not been provided because 24% of the location is in a low-lying flood-prone area, where it is impossible to sustain flush-toilet infrastructure. The City also argues that informal settlements are not the only type of area in the city where there are poor households. The City argues that provision must also be made for people living in backyard dwellings, sub-economic housing and overcrowded areas. The City’s key argument is that the provision of immediate sanitation services to residents of informal settlements must be balanced against the need for longer terms plans for the upgrading of informal settlements which must take into account various constraints.\nThe Equality Court will now have to determine the fate of the infamous portable flush toilets and similar toilet technologies. The court will have to consider whether the City complied with its constitutional obligations and created a reasonable plan for the provision of adequate, safe and decent sanitation services to residents of informal settlements.\n© 2017 GroundUp.\nThis article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License.\nYou may republish this article, so long as you credit the authors and GroundUp, and do not change the text.

Their invention involves a new toilet system (dubbed the No-Mix Vacuum Toilet) that can turn human waste into electricity and fertilizers while reducing the amount of water needed to flush by up to 90 percent – in comparison to the currently used toilet systems in Singapore.\nHow does this innovative system reduce the amount of water used? By using vacuum suction technology – which is used in airplane lavatories–which would only require 0.2 liters of water to flush liquids and one liter to flush solids. This is a significant reduction from the currently existing conventional toilet which uses 4 to 6 liters of water with each flush. Estimates have speculated that if this system were to be installed in a public restroom, they would save 160,000 liters of water each year per hundred flushes!\nCurrently the scientists are trying to conduct a trial by installing the prototypes of this toilet in two NTU restrooms, and then to share this technology with the world in the next three years. But as Associate Professor Wang Jing-Yuan, Director of the Residues and Resource Reclamation Centre (R3C) at NTU points out, conserving water is not the only benefit and goal of this system – the goal is to “have a complete recovery of resources so that none will be wasted in resource-scarce Singapore.”\nProfessor Wang shares:\n“Having the human waste separated at source and processed on-site would lower costs needed in recovering resources, as treating mixed waste is energy intensive and not cost-effective. With our innovative toilet system, we can use simpler and cheaper methods of harvesting the useful chemicals and even produce fuel and energy from waste.”\nThe No-Mix Vacuum Toilet has two separate chambers that separate the liquid waste and the solid waste. The liquid waste would then get diverted to a processing facility where nitrogen, phospherous and potassium can be recovered and reused for fertilizer. The solid waste would be sent to a bioreactor where it would be digested to release a bio-gas containing methane–methane is odorless and can be used to replace natural gas used in stoves for cooking, and can be converted to electricity.\nIf this new toilet is functional and lives up to its claims, then this could help save water around the world. Flushing the toilet is one of the top uses of water in a home: It has been estimated that the average toilet can use up to 3.5 to 5 gallons of water per flush. Jack Sim, the founder of the World Toilet Organization, told Time Magazine that “chances are you’re dumping up to 22 liters of drinkable water every day, one three- to six-liter flush at a time.”\nBut that’s not the only problem. After flushing, a lot of resources are spent to clean flushed water and thereby, increases the carbon footprint of toilets. Rose George, author of The Big Necessity: The Unmentionable World of Human Waste and Why it Matters shares that “the sewage system uses as much energy as what the largest coal fire station in the [country] produces.”"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:f1a5cd91-c44b-4f6c-b31e-40b88e3e01a7>","<urn:uuid:3e0e2c99-3a4a-4317-a87a-eb9c0a23fa3d>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How much revenue was generated from renewable energy sources on public lands in FY 2018? これは重要な質問です。","answer":"In FY 2018, wind and solar projects generated over 22 million dollars in revenue, while geothermal energy accounted for an additional 15 million dollars in revenue, totaling over 37 million dollars.","context":["Public Land Renewable Energy Development Act\nStatement for the Record\nBureau of Land Management\nU.S. Department of the Interior\nSenate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources\n“S. 2666, Public Land Renewable Energy Development Act”\nNovember 7, 2019\nChairman Murkowski, Ranking Member Manchin, and Members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to provide the Bureau of Land Management’s (BLM) views on S. 2666, the Public Land Renewable Energy Development Act (PLREDA), which seeks to promote and expedite the development of geothermal, wind, and solar energy projects on Federal lands and to provide economic certainty to the renewable energy industry.\nThe BLM recognizes the sponsor’s work to encourage the development of renewable energy on public lands, as well as address feedback from industry regarding the BLM’s management of our renewable energy program. The BLM supports many of the goals of S. 2666, PLREDA, and would like to work with the Committee and the sponsor on technical changes to achieve the bill’s intent to promote and expedite the development of renewable energy on public lands.\nRenewable Energy on Public Lands\nThe BLM is a key contributor to the Administration’s America First Energy plan, an “all of the above” strategy which includes renewable energy. The BLM oversees development on public lands of three primary renewable energy sources: solar, wind, and geothermal. To date, the BLM has approved over 125 renewable energy projects with the potential to provide nearly 18,000 megawatts (MW) of generation capacity. Wind and solar projects on public lands have created approximately 9,000 construction and operation jobs since 2011 and generated over 22 million dollars in revenue in FY 2018. In the same time period, geothermal energy accounted for an additional 15 million dollars in revenue. Laws enacted in most western states require energy companies to supply a portion of their energy from renewable resources. As a result, the BLM anticipates a continued interest in public lands for renewable energy development.\nSolar and wind energy development projects on BLM-managed public lands are authorized as rights-of-way (ROWs) under Title V of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA). The applicant is required to pay the Federal Government’s costs in processing the ROW application, and all projects require review under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). Geothermal development projects are authorized via the issuance of leases and the approval of drilling permits and utilization plans under the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970, as amended.\nS. 2666, Public Land Renewable Energy Development Act\nS. 2666, the Public Land Renewable Energy Development Act, seeks to promote and expedite the development of geothermal, wind, and solar energy projects on Federal lands by establishing priority areas for solar, wind, and geothermal; codifying a renewable energy coordination office within the Department of the Interior; and outlining interagency coordination procedures. S. 2666 also establishes a renewable energy goal of 25 gigawatts of electricity from renewable energy projects on public lands by 2025. Further, the bill establishes a new disposition of revenues for receipts from solar and wind authorizations, and reestablishes the expired special account and distribution provisions for revenues from processing geothermal energy authorizations. Additionally, S. 2666 allows for limited “grandfathering” of project owners to pay the rental and fees at the rates in effect before the effective date of the BLM’s Wind and Solar rulemaking, and revises how the BLM determines base rental rates. Lastly, the bill allows for noncompetitive geothermal leasing for co-production of geothermal energy to a lessee with a producing oil and gas well, and for noncompetitive leasing of parcels adjacent to existing leases that have a valid discovery under certain conditions to the lessee of the proven lease.\nLand Use Planning, Environmental Review & Permit Coordination (Sections 3-6)\nS. 2666 (section 3) requires the BLM to establish, review, and modify within certain timeframes priority and other “variance” areas for geothermal, wind, and solar energy development. Additionally, the bill (section 4) directs that in some cases additional review under the NEPA may not be required for proposed renewable energy projects if the Secretary determines the analysis conducted under the relevant Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (PEIS) is sufficient. Finally, the bill (section 5) establishes a renewable energy permit coordination office and requires the Secretary to enter into a Memorandum of Understanding with Secretaries of Agriculture and Defense to help improve coordination for permitting renewable energy projects.\nThe BLM supports the goal to simplify and expedite the development of renewable energy projects on public lands. As noted in the bill, the BLM, through its land use planning process, completed wind, geothermal, and solar energy PEIS documents in 2005, 2008, and 2012 respectively. The BLM Wind and Solar Rule also established “designated leasing areas,” as preferred locations for solar or wind energy development. The geothermal planning effort identified lands on both BLM-managed public lands and National Forest System lands that are available and open for geothermal leasing, together with appropriate protective stipulations or use limitations.\nThe BLM notes that the agency has existing authority to identify preferred locations for wind and solar projects. The BLM is reviewing potentially available solar energy development areas, as contemplated in the 2012 Solar PEIS and Record of Decision (ROD). For example, the BLM is currently evaluating a proposed plan amendment in Nevada for the Dry Lake East area that considers identifying new or expanded Solar Energy Zones.\nIn addition, the BLM supports efforts to continue to streamline lengthy and unnecessarily burdensome environmental reviews. Under this Administration, the Department and the BLM have made it a priority to improve its environmental review and permitting authorization procedures for energy and infrastructure projects. One such example is Secretary’s Order (S.O.) 3355 (Streamlining National Environmental Policy Act Reviews and Implementation of Executive Order 13807), which provides a number of internal Departmental directives to increase efficiency of environmental reviews, including setting page and time limit goals on all NEPA analysis. We appreciate Congress’s focus on addressing unnecessarily burdensome requirements, and would like to work with the sponsor and Committee on authorizing other methods to streamline environmental reviews, including consideration of potential Categorical Exclusions for renewable energy similar to those in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (PL-109- 58, Section 30).\nFinally, while we support the goal to expedite permitting and interagency coordination as outlined in the bill, we would like to retain the flexibility to adjust these offices in the future to adapt to emerging renewable energy workloads. The BLM already has an existing Renewable Energy program within its Energy, Minerals, and Realty Management Directorate and would like to work with the Committee on making technical changes to make this section more effective.\nIncreasing Economic Certainty for Renewable Energy Development on Public Lands (Sections 6-9)\nS. 2666 (section 6) establishes the rate of increase for rent for wind and solar authorizations once the initial base rent is determined, and provides criteria for determining how and when rents can be reduced. The bill also (section 7) allows for limited grandfathering to certain project owners that applied for a ROW on or before the effective date of the Wind and Solar Rule, and would permit them to pay the rents and fees in effect before the date of the rule making. Section 8 establishes a goal of 25 gigawatts of electricity from wind, solar, and geothermal energy projects by not later than 2025. Further, the bill (section 9) establishes a new deposition of revenues for receipts from solar and wind authorizations. Under the bill, until December 2039, 25 percent would be allocated to the States; 25 percent to the Counties; 35 percent to Renewable Energy Resource Conservation Fund (the Fund); and 15 percent to the U.S. Treasury to be made available to facilitate the processing of permits. After 2040 the distribution changes and 40 percent of the revenues would go into the Fund and 10 percent would go to the U.S. Treasury. The Secretary would be permitted to make amounts in the Fund available to other Federal and State agencies for protection and restoration of important wildlife habitat and corridors and water resources; securing recreational access to Federal lands; and carrying out activities authorized under the Land and Water Conservation Fund.\nUnder FLPMA, (section 504g) the BLM is required to collect Fair Market Value (FMV) for all ROW authorizations on public lands. We have concerns with section 6 of the bill as written, as it would eliminate the BLM’s discretion to increase, or decrease, wind or solar rental rates to match market fluctuations in land values over the 30-year term of a grant. In order to receive FMV over the lifespan of a project, the BLM updates its rent schedule every five years, indexed to changes in agricultural land values collected by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\nThe BLM recognizes the concerns raised by some grant holders regarding disproportionately high rents in Southern California, and would be interested in working with Congress on technical modifications to the current rent schedule structure. Further, the BLM does not generally object to criteria identified in section 6 that could inform rental rate determinations for wind and solar. Some of the criteria listed are already in BLM regulations and would be redundant. The BLM would like to work with the Committee on technical changes to make this section more effective while still receiving FMV for land use.\nWhile the BLM is committed to reducing unnecessary burdens on industry and recognizes the increasing costs associated with the development of renewable energy on public lands, the BLM does not support the grandfathering (i.e. exempting) of existing projects and applications as proposed in section 7. Similar to the concerns outlined above, the BLM has concerns that “grandfathering” all existing projects or applications to fixed payments, at 2016 rates, would be inconsistent with the requirements of FLPMA to collect FMV for use of the public lands. The BLM is currently working on regulatory and administrative alternatives for potential rent adjustments. Both the BLM and the Forest Service would like to work with the Sponsor and the Committee on making technical changes to make this section more effective.\nAdditionally, the BLM notes that all revenues from solar and wind energy authorizations on public lands currently go to the U.S. Treasury. We do not support the diversion of solar and wind energy receipts and have concerns with the potential long-term costs associated with such diversion. The BLM would like to work with the sponsors and the Committee to determine how best to achieve the overall goal of this title, while ensuring that U.S. taxpayers receive fair market value for these resources.\nFinally, under existing authorities, the BLM currently collects full cost recovery as costs are incurred throughout the wind and solar application process. Due to the difficulty in estimating the total cost for processing an application up front, the Department recommends continuing its current cost recovery process instead.\nGeothermal Development on Public Lands (Sections 10-12)\nS.2666 (section 10) proposes to renew and maintain the disposition and distribution of geothermal revenues originally enacted in the Energy Policy Act of 2005, where 50 percent would be allocated to the States; 25 percent to the Counties; and 25 percent to the U.S. Treasury.\nS. 2666 (section 11) allows for noncompetitive geothermal leasing for co-production of geothermal energy to the holder of a producing oil and gas well, and section 12 permits noncompetitive leasing of parcels adjacent to existing leases that have achieved a paying well or other valid discovery to the lessee of the existing lease with the valid discovery of geothermal resources.\nThe BLM appreciates the sponsor’s effort to facilitate co-production of geothermal energy from a producing oil and gas well as outlined in S. 2666 and would like to work with the sponsor and Committee on how best to achieve such a goal. However, the Administration has concerns with the bill’s revenue sharing proposal, which runs counter to the President’s FY 2020 Budget proposal to restore the disposition of Federal geothermal leasing revenues to the historical formula of 50 percent to the States and 50 percent to the U.S. Treasury.\nWe note that the co-production proposal is a complicated matter, and the BLM would need to draft new regulations and guidance for co-producing geothermal with oil and natural gas resources. The BLM generally supports maintaining competitive leasing processes for the development of Federal energy resources but recognizes that there may be situations in which non-competitive leasing may be appropriate. We would also like to work with the sponsor to ensure that the Department’s Office of Valuation Services will have the appropriate discretion to determine the FMV of the resources to be leased, consistent with the DOI’s standard valuation practices under any new statutory direction.\nThank you for the opportunity to provide this statement. We look forward to working with you to continue to adopt innovative solutions to reduce regulatory burdens on the development of domestic energy and its delivery to the American people."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:638891a0-9550-46af-ac2f-f11dab6081a5>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I'm a healthcare professional looking to understand: How do the addictive properties and withdrawal symptoms compare between sugar and opioids?","answer":"Both sugar and opioids show similar addictive properties, though opioids are significantly more potent. Both substances trigger dopamine release in the brain's reward centers and can lead to powerful physical cravings. When stopping use, both can cause withdrawal symptoms, though opioid withdrawal is more severe. Opioid withdrawal includes symptoms like nausea, vomiting, muscle aches, runny nose, dilated pupils, sweating, and excessive yawning. Sugar withdrawal, while less intense, can also cause uncomfortable symptoms when quitting cold-turkey. Both substances can lead to tolerance, requiring increasing amounts to achieve the same effects. Additionally, both can negatively impact physical and mental health - opioids can cause respiratory depression and various health complications, while excessive sugar consumption is linked to obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and inflammation.","context":["As delicious as a sweet treat can be from time to time, most of us don’t realize the amount of added sugar we’re consuming every single day. If we understood the health benefits of quitting sugar and a no sugar diet we would look at those treats differently.\nThe recommended amount of daily sugar consumption for adults is 12 teaspoons or less. However, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports most adults are taking in 17 teaspoons or more of added sugar on a daily basis.\nThere is a direct link between sugar and diseases like obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and – surprise, surprise – addiction. Sugar is addictive and it’s making us sicker.\nOne of the biggest reasons we’re consuming so much sugar is because it is literally in everything we eat. Even foodstuffs, like salad dressing, yogurt, ketchup, bread, pastas, and many other products contain sugar.\nWhether we consider these foods healthy or not, at the very least they are not seen as desserts, so they are not perceived as foods that contain added sugars.\nTo make matters more pressing, the truth is that sugar shares many of the same addictive properties as illicit drugs like heroin, cocaine, opioid prescription painkillers, and benzodiazepines.\nSimilarities Between Sugar and Addictive Drugs\nIt can be just as difficult to go on a no sugar diet as it is to stop using many addictive drugs for some of the following reasons…\n- A surge of the “feel good” neurotransmitter dopamine is released in the brain with both addictive drugs and sugar\n- In brain scans, sugar lights up the same areas of the brain as do habit forming or addictive drugs\n- Physical cravings for both substances are powerful and can cause people to binge on sugar or go on, for example, a drug or alcohol bender\n- Too much sugar, just like with alcohol and drugs, can lead to poor physical and mental health\n- Giving up sugar cold-turkey, just like other drugs, can cause extremely uncomfortable withdrawal symptoms\nThese symptoms should sound familiar to anyone with an addictive personality who has been addicted to drugs just as much as those who find it difficult to stop eating sugar.\nThe cravings alone keep people coming back for more drugs or alcohol, and the same can be said for sugary foods too.\nTrying to overcome any form of addiction can be a struggle, and sugar is no different. The benefits of not eating sugar, or severely cutting back on it will take vigilance simply because of the number of products it’s in.\nBut with a bit of discipline, and learning how to form new habits, the rewards and benefits of cutting out sugar and living a sugar-free lifestyle can be quite substantial.\nHere are 10 Healthy Benefits of Quitting Sugar and a No Sugar Diet\n1. Better Weight Management From Quitting Sugar\nI can eat all the sugar I want and not gain a pound, said nobody ever. We all know desserts are a guilty pleasure, and no matter how good we feel when eating them, the guilt will creep in later when we get on the scale.\nWeight gain occurs because regular sugar consumption increases insulin levels, which affects our metabolism and turns those sugary calories right into belly-fat.\nGiving up sugar helps our bodies burn fat for fuel and keeps our weight down or stable. Trading sugar-loaded foods with healthier alternatives like fruits for dessert make it easier to cut back.\n2. Increased Energy\nA sugary snack might perk us up, but only for a moment because as it leaves the system, there’s a blood sugar crash, leaving us more lethargic and less focused.\nSome recreational drugs do the same thing, and that feel good moment is fleeting. Once the initial rush of euphoria passes, it drags us down and we feel worse than before we started.\nInstead, rely on slow-burning carbs and protein, like an apple or banana with peanut butter. This provides a sweet treat without the refined sugar and offers the body fuel for more energy without the crash. This works great 20 minutes or so before working out too.\n3. Decreased Inflammation\nSugar increases inflammation in the body’s soft-tissue, which leads to aches and pains in the joints, a poor immune system, and is known to be a factor in depression.\nInflammation in the body isn’t something that we can outwardly see, and because it’s invisible, we never know when it becomes an issue. Sure, we feel its affects, but we simply think having pain or being sick is a normal part of life.\nThe benefits of quitting sugar or significantly cutting back on it can do wonders for decreasing inflammation and improve the way we feel now and over time as we age.\n4. Better Heart Health\nWith weight gain and inflammation comes high blood pressure issues, as well as coronary heart disease, all of which lead to a greater risk for heart attacks.\nSugar can also contribute to increasing bad cholesterol and decreasing good cholesterol.\nSomething as straightforward as ditching sugary soda is a good first step for reducing these risks, and removing other sugary foods will take it a step further.\nHeart health is important for all the systems in the body, so taking care of it is worth finding better foods to eat with less sugar.\n5. A Healthier Liver\nToo much refined sugar can lead to a fatty buildup in the liver, which then causes liver disease. In some cases, experts believe too much sugar is as hard on the liver as too much alcohol.\nHere again is another comparison of sugar to an addictive substance like alcohol. We never think of sugar as a drug, until we see how both can have an unhealthy impact on the body.\n6. Decreased Risk of Diabetes\nWeight gain is a key factor in the development of type 2 diabetes. Excess fat makes the body resistant to insulin and eventually the pancreas can’t produce enough to meet demand.\nAvoiding sugar, exercising, and managing weight will definitely lower the risk for diabetes.\nFortunately for those who may have developed type 2 diabetes, lifestyle changes like exercising, losing weight, and giving up sugar can reverse many of the effects and some people might return to pre-diabetic health levels.\n7. Reduced Cravings\nThe rush of dopamine we get from eating sugar reinforces the desire for more of it. Giving up sugar can help return the body’s dopamine levels to normal and reduce physical cravings.\nIronically, cravings are part of the brain’s reward center and the euphoric feelings we get are difficult to overcome, until we realize the real reward comes after we give up sugar and the cravings go away.\n8. Diminished Risk of Cancer\nThere’s plenty of evidence that quitting sugar can lower the risk of cancer partly because sugar leads to weight gain and body fat, which increases the risk of cancer.\nAt least one study of people with a lot of refined sugar in their diets showed an increase in pancreatic cancer.\nAlcohol has recently shown a connection to various types of cancer, and the mechanisms and reasons are thought to be similar to sugar.\n9. Healthier Skin\nOver time, sugar in the body creates an unhealthy connection to proteins that are responsible for producing collagen that helps keep our skin elastic, youthful, and free of wrinkles. When that happens we lose the benefits of collagen.\nWhen too much sugar leads to inflammation, it can cause the skin to be more prone to acne and other unhealthy conditions. This is probably why we were told as teens that candy bars cause pimples. It’s not quite that simple or direct, but they are somewhat related.\n10. Better Mood and Mental Focus\nThe sum total of all the benefits of cutting out sugar from our diet is better overall mental health combined with restful and restorative sleep.\nReducing inflammation in the brain and body, combined with better sleep leads to an improved ability to concentrate and think clearly.\nThese same reasons have shown that people experience a better mood each day with a lower risk of dealing with depression.\nBenefits of a No Sugar Diet and Cutting Out Sugar For Recovery\nThe health benefits of quitting sugar and sticking to that no sugar diet outlined above make it easy to see why having a goal to cut back our intake is important. But how does it impact those in recovery from drugs or alcohol?\nIt can be tricky and even more difficult for people overcoming a substance addiction to quit sugar, especially all at once, cold turkey. In fact, a better option might be to taper off slowly instead of all at once.\nThis is even more important for those who rely on sweets as a coping mechanism for depression, stress or anxiety.\nBecause too much sugar can cause depression, this might sound counter-productive, and it is in the long term. So it’s recommended to ease into it and slowly give up sugar over time by making it a goal for the future.\nQuitting drugs or alcohol is much more physically and psychologically grueling than quitting sugar. To maintain the focus on sobriety, many people might need some added help from a crutch like ice cream or other favorite sugary snacks.\nSugar can trigger similar reward signals from dopamine in the brain as many drugs and provide an emotional safe place that is healthier than relapse. If this works, set a clear intention to only use it temporarily until cutting back further is more manageable.\nNo Sugar Diet Food List\nIn the meantime, introduce healthier food swaps like:\n- lean meats\n- whole unprocessed grains\nIn due time, making the switch away from processed foods loaded with sugar will become much easier.\nGood nutrition is vitally necessary for those in recovery and setting a goal to eat healthy foods and achieving that no sugar diet is a worthwhile goal. Incorporating a regular exercise plan will contribute to feeling good, and when we feel better, we also eat better.","Reading Time: 7 minutes\nThe class of opioid drugs include illicit opioids like heroin and prescription painkillers, such as morphine, Vicodin, Percocet, OxyContin, tramadol, and fentanyl. They work by binding to opioid receptors, which are responsible for regulating pain, stress, temperature, respiration, endocrine activity, gastrointestinal activity, mood, and motivation. Opioids alleviate pain and can create a sense of relaxation as well as feelings of euphoria. Because of these desirable effects, opioids are highly addictive, and many people who begin taking them for medical reasons end up misusing them and developing an opioid addiction.1,2\nSigns and Symptoms of Opioid Addiction\nOpioids are highly addictive because of the intense feelings of euphoria and pain-relief they produce. Prescription opioids are classified as a Schedule II drug, which means it has a high potential for misuse, dependence, and addiction, while heroin is a Schedule I controlled substance since it has no accepted medical use.3\nOpioid tolerance develops quickly, leading you to take increasingly higher doses of the drug to experience the same effects. Tolerance can then speed up the development of physiological dependence, which occurs when your body requires the presence of an opioid to function normally. Both tolerance and dependence play a major role in contributing to the development of an opioid addiction.4\nDiagnostic Criteria for Opioid Use Disorder\nOpioid use disorder is a condition characterized by repeated, compulsive opioid use despite negative consequences. It is the formal term for an opioid addiction.5\nCommon signs of opioid use disorder include:5\n- Experiencing strong cravings for opioids\n- Failing to quit or control opioid use despite efforts to do so\n- Taking higher or more frequent doses of opioids than intended\n- Continuing use despite physical or psychological problems caused or worsened by use\n- Continuing use despite negative effects on relationships, work, school, etc.\n- Using opioids in physically hazardous situations, such as while driving\n- Spending a great deal of time obtaining and using opioids as well as recovering from their effects\n- Neglecting important hobbies or recreational activities in favor of opioid use\n- Developing a tolerance\n- Experiencing opioid withdrawal symptoms when you suddenly stop taking them\nWhen you abruptly quit or reduce opioid use, you may experience a myriad of unpleasant or distressing withdrawal symptoms, such as:5\n- Nausea and vomiting\n- Muscle aches\n- Runny nose or teary eyes\n- Dilated pupils\n- Goose bumps\n- Profound sweating\n- Excessive yawning\nCall our 24/7 helpline at 800-926-9037 (Who Answers?) if you are worried you or someone you know may be addicted to opioids. Our caring and compassionate treatment support advisors can help you get the treatment you need.\nSigns of Opioid Abuse and Addiction\nSome signs that someone you know may be misusing opioids include:5\n- Initial euphoria followed by apathy\n- Depressed mood\n- Drowsiness (being “on the nod”)\n- Slurred speech\n- Impaired memory or attention\n- Pupillary constriction\n- Impaired judgment\nOther signs of opioid addiction are specific to the individual’s method of administration, such as injecting or snorting. If your loved one is injecting opioids, you may notice the following:5\n- Collapsed veins\n- Puncture marks\n- Track lines\n- Peripheral edema\n- Circular scars\nAdditionally, people who inject opioids or other drugs are at an increased risk of contracting HIV or hepatitis C, as well as bacterial endocarditis, an infection of the heart lining.5\nMeanwhile, snorting opioids can lead to other harmful effects, such as:5\n- Nose bleeds\n- Irritation of the nasal mucosa\n- Perforation of the nasal septum\nTaking an opioid like morphine, oxycodone, or heroin over a long period can cause nerve damage in the brain that prevents cells from producing endorphins. This can create an inability to manage pain as a result, which can lead you to take even more of the drug to achieve the same effect.6\nWho is at Risk of an Opioid Addiction?\nIf you have issues with severe, chronic pain, your physician may prescribe an opioid as a part of your treatment. Anyone who takes an opioid for the treatment of pain is at risk of developing an opioid addiction. The risk of addiction increases significantly when you misuse the medication by taking higher or more frequent doses than prescribed, mixing it with other substances, or using it in a way other than directed (e.g., injecting or snorting).10\nOther risk factors for opioid misuse and addiction may include:11\n- Personal/Family history of substance misuse\n- Young age\n- History of criminal activity or legal problems, including DUIs\n- Regular contact with high-risk people or high-risk environments\n- Problems with past employers, family members, and friends\n- Risk-taking or thrill-seeking behavior\n- Heavy tobacco use\n- History of severe depression or anxiety\n- Stressful situations\n- Prior drug or alcohol rehabilitation\nHow to Treat an Opioid Addiction\nMedical Detox for Opioid Withdrawal\nThe first step on the continuum of opioid addiction treatment is often medical detox, in which you receive 24/7 medical care to manage your opioid withdrawal symptoms and cravings. Medical detox often takes place in a hospital setting, giving you access to a team of medical professionals who can keep you safe and comfortable throughout withdrawal. They will administer an opioid withdrawal medication, such as methadone or buprenorphine, which alleviates withdrawal symptoms and cravings. They’ll also provide supportive care, such as intravenous fluids or symptomatic medications for symptoms that aren’t managed by withdrawal medications.\nInpatient and Outpatient Rehab\nOnce you complete opioid detox, the next step is to transition into a rehab program. Opioid addiction treatment occurs in either an inpatient or outpatient setting. Inpatient treatment involves residing at the treatment center for the entire program. You receive around-the-clock treatment and care, with little to no exposure to triggers. Inpatient provides more structure and intensiveness, which many people find beneficial.\nConversely, outpatient opioid addiction treatment offers more flexibility and less scheduling conflicts. You live at home while attending therapy and counseling during the day. The time commitment for outpatient ranges from just a few hours per week to several hours per day. If your opioid addiction is more severe but you are unable to attend inpatient, you may want to opt for a partial hospitalization program (PHP) or intensive outpatient program (IOP).\nUltimately the right treatment setting for you depends on your opioid addiction, other substance use, mental health condition, physical health, priorities, schedule, and more.\nDuring treatment, the treatment team may include an opioid addiction treatment medication, known as medication-assisted treatment (MAT).\nMedications for opioid addiction recovery may include:12\n- Naltrexone: Naltrexone binds to opioid receptors in the brain and blocks the sedative and euphoric effects of opioids, which reduces cravings.\n- Methadone: Methadone is a full opioid agonist that eases opioid cravings. Although it’s an opioid, it doesn’t cause a euphoric high.\n- Suboxone (buprenorphine/naloxone): Buprenorphine is a partial opioid agonist, which alleviates opioid cravings without producing a high, and naloxone is an opioid antagonist, which reduces the risk of diversion and misuse.\nOpioid Addiction Therapies\nOpioid addiction treatment programs may vary depending on treatment philosophy and approach. For example, some rehabs integrate holistic treatment modalities while others may take a faith-based approach. But all quality opioid rehabs should utilize evidence-based therapies and approaches, such as:\n- Individual therapy: This involves meeting with a therapist one on one to help you understand the reasons behind your opioid misuse and to overcome your struggles. This is an opportunity to work on developing trust in another person and learning to speak openly about yourself and begin developing new, healthier coping skills.\n- Group therapy: Group therapy is an important part of treatment. It can help to know someone else is experiencing similar issues and that you are not alone. Overcoming the isolation that is typically part of opioid addiction is a key factor in recovery. This provides peer support, which is essential. Group therapy allows you to express your emotions and receive feedback that helps you learn new coping skills and to develop new, healthy relationships.\n- Family therapy: A person’s family is their support system and relationship issues may need to be addressed. Family therapy can help people work out their differences and develop healthier connections. Support from your family helps you become more open to your loved ones and provide healing and closure.\nFor help finding an opioid rehab, call our confidential helpline at 800-926-9037 (Who Answers?) to speak to a rehab support specialist about options in your area.\n- Johns Hopkins Medicine.

{"question":"I'm planning to attend my first trade show next month. How can I prepare effectively to make the most of my time there?","answer":"To prepare effectively for a trade show, start planning a month in advance with these steps: 1) Define clear, specific goals for what you want to achieve, beyond vague ideals. 2) Contact the show organizers for a floor plan and booth directory. 3) Cross-reference the floor plan with the directory to create a walking route. 4) Prioritize exhibitors using a system like colored highlighters to mark first, second, and third priority booths. 5) If attending with co-workers, allocate specific tasks and goals among team members. 6) Select comfortable, sturdy walking shoes that look professional. 7) Travel light - avoid carrying briefcases or unnecessary items that could tire you out. 8) Plan your schedule to be structured yet flexible enough for unexpected opportunities like lunch meetings or demonstrations.","context":["- THE MAGAZINE\nSo you're thinking about going to a trade show? Whether it's your first one or your 10th, there's a method to getting on board, and having a productive, enjoyable time as you work your way through the list of speakers, seminars and hands-on projects, and pick and choose your route through the booths manned by all of the companies and manufacturers you came to see.\nHow do you take advantage of all of the opportunities? After the cost of registering for the show, the flight, hotel room and food, you want to make sure your experience is complete, and valuable to your business.\nWhat to do, then, in navigating a trade show? While there are no hard and fast rules, ICS Cleaning Specialist, Commercial Floor Care magazines, and the World Floor Covering Association, did get together to develop a navigation guide to trade shows. The Navigation Guide is designed to simplify what sometimes turns into a frustrating exercise. And it all begins before you ever set foot in the trade show pavilion.\nWhen you plan ahead, you're setting yourself up for a satisfactory trade show experience. It's a good idea to begin planning a solid month before the event. You've already heard about the show, have received emails and standard mail encouraging your attendance, have spoken with fellow association members, even discussed it on the ICS Cleaning Specialist and CFC Bulletin Boards.\nBefore you even register, it's important to consider two of the most important aspects of attending a trade show: What are your goals for the show, and what do you need to do to achieve them?\nWhen you've decided on what you want to get out of a show, don't fill the plan with vague ideals. \"See what's new in the industry\" and \"meet new distributors\" are fine main points, but they aren't specific. Make a list of points under each heading that are flexible enough to allow you to make on the spot adjustments, but focused enough so you don't lose sight of what you want to accomplish.\nAn Attendance Strategy\nView the trade show as a sporting event, where the coach enters the playing field with a game plan. As a professional cleaner in the cleaning and restoration industry, you should have a game plan in hand every time you walk onto the trade show floor.\nDefining your strategy takes no more time than setting up steps to achieving your goals. It's important to understand that you can't achieve all of your goals, so be realistic. It's equally important to understand that if you're attending a trade show with co-workers or employees, allocate your goals (tasks). This is one of the more effective, yet overlooked, ways to successfully achieve all that you want from your plan.\nGet Show Materials Immediately, If Not Sooner\nTrade shows are unique, and each has its very own floor plan and booth/display designation. With that in mind, it's important that attendees familiarize themselves with trade show geography before walking through the front door.\nGive yourself time; contact the trade show sponsor association or organization and ask for a floor plan and booth directory. Cross-referencing the floor plan with the directory will allow you to lay out a game plan: A walking route through the key trade show areas that you want to see. Doing so will save you countless hours of aimless wandering and backtracking. You can always meander aimlessly later, after you've visited each key point on your list.\nPrioritize Your 'Sight-seeing'\nNot all things are created equal, and that especially holds true at trade shows where there are some exhibitors who are more important to you than others.\nPrioritizing booths that warrant your attention is important if you want to enjoy a successful trade show. Try using multicolored highlighters or colored stickers to group those exhibitors as first priority for your attention, and/or second and third priority. Check off those booths as you visit them, and move on to the next in your order of priority, sticking with your plan. Finish with each priority listing before moving on to the next.\nNow that you are ready to traverse the trade show floor, keying in on your high-priority exhibitors first, remember: Keep your focus. Here are a few guidelines that may prove helpful as you move through the aisles.\nDon't slow yourself down by carrying a briefcase, product literature or other unnecessary items, all of which can tire you before you've had the chance to dent your priority list. Check them at the desk or leave them in your hotel room. Remember: travel light.\nPick out a decent pair of walking shoes, make sure they're comfortable, sturdy and built for walking in, and wear them. You'll have a better time if your feet aren't killing you. And make sure your walking shoes look good.\nPick Your Talking Points\nYou've now started visiting your first priority exhibition booths. Well, don't allow yourself to be gobbled up by pointless conversation. Steer the conversation into an area you want to talk about, and stick to what you want to talk about. And make sure booth staffers know what you want to talk about. Endless talking about products that don't concern your business does you very little good. Instead, ask specific questions keyed on in specific products that interest you; you'll get more out of the trade show experience that way.\nTrade show attendees sometimes judge the success of trade show attendance by the number of seminars attended. That's not necessarily the case. As in prioritizing your exhibition booth visits, do the same with seminars. Attend those that are of prime importance to your business, and try to obtain seminar information from the B-list in some other way. Attending too many seminars keeps you from the trade show, wasting valuable show time.\nReturn Home Prepared\nPrepare a briefing for coworkers who were not able to attend the trade show. Fill them in on what you saw, exhibitors you talked with, and how important the information you've brought back is to the business.\nThe most important piece of advice in navigating a trade show is this: Use your time wisely.\nIf you have three days to work with, don't try to schedule everything in two days. Design a plan structured enough to allow you to stay on track, but flexible enough to allow for sudden changes, such as lunch with an exhibitor, an off-site product demonstration by an important exhibitor or manufacturer, and so on.\nThe Boy Scouts of America holds an annual jamboree, attended by hundreds of thousands of people, and it comes off seemingly without a hitch year in and year out. There's a lesson to be learned there: Be prepared."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:6a5319fe-9d72-49a2-83a6-31c6eb4168c3>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Which tool provides more detailed graphical pipeline analysis - Android Memory Profiler's graphics buffer tracking or Visual Studio Graphics Diagnostics' pipeline visualization?","answer":"Visual Studio Graphics Diagnostics provides more detailed graphics pipeline analysis compared to Android Memory Profiler. While Android Memory Profiler only tracks graphics buffer queues for displaying pixels and GL surfaces as part of its memory categories, Visual Studio Graphics Diagnostics offers comprehensive pipeline visualization that shows results of each stage independently, allows debugging of individual shader stages, and provides detailed state information between pipeline stages. It also includes features like pixel history visualization and the ability to analyze how colors are combined in complex scenes. Additionally, it supports debugging Direct3D 10, 11, and 12 pipelines with specialized tools for analyzing rendering problems at each stage.","context":["The Memory Profiler is a component in the Android Profiler that helps you identify memory leaks and memory churn that can lead to stutter, freezes, and even app crashes. It shows a realtime graph of your app's memory use, lets you capture a heap dump, force garbage collections, and track memory allocations.\nTo open the Memory Profiler, follow these steps:\n- Click View > Tool Windows > Android Profiler (you can also click Android Profiler in the toolbar).\n- Select the device and app process you want to profile from the Android Profiler toolbar. If you've connected a device over USB but don't see it listed, ensure that you have enabled USB debugging.\n- Click anywhere in the MEMORY timeline to open the Memory Profiler.\nWhy you should profile your app memory\nAndroid provides a managed memory environment—when it determines that your app is no longer using some objects, the garbage collector releases the unused memory back to the heap. How Android goes about finding unused memory is constantly being improved, but at some point on all Android versions, the system must briefly pause your code. Most of the time, the pauses are imperceivable. However, if your app allocates memory faster than the system can collect it, your app might be delayed while the collector frees enough memory to satisfy your allocations. The delay could cause your app to skip frames and cause visible slowness.\nEven if your app doesn't exhibit slowness, if it leaks memory, it can retain that memory even while it's in the background. This behavior can slow the rest of the system's memory performance by forcing unnecessary garbage collection events. Eventually, the system is forced to kill your app process to reclaim the memory. Then when the user returns to your app, it must restart completely.\nTo help prevent these problems, you should use the Memory Profiler to do the following:\n- Look for undesirable memory allocation patterns in the timeline that might be causing performance problems.\n- Dump the Java heap to see which objects are using up memory at any given time. Several heap dumps over an extended period of time can help identify memory leaks.\n- Record memory allocations during normal and extreme user interaction to identify exactly where your code is either allocating too many objects in a short time or allocating objects that become leaked.\nFor information about programming practices that can reduce your app's memory use, read Manage Your App's Memory.\nMemory Profiler overview\nWhen you first open the Memory Profiler, you'll see a detailed timeline of your app's memory use and access tools to force garbage collection, capture a heap dump, and record memory allocations.\nAs indicated in figure 1, the default view for the Memory Profiler includes the following:\n- A button to force a garbage collection event.\n- A button to capture a heap dump.\n- A button to record memory allocations. This button appears only when connected to a device running Android 7.1 or lower.\n- Buttons to zoom in/out of the timeline.\n- A button to jump forward to the live memory data.\n- The event timeline, which shows the activity states, user input events, and screen rotation events.\n- The memory use timeline, which includes the following:\n- A stacked graph of how much memory is being used by each memory category, as indicated by the y-axis on the left and the color key at the top.\n- A dashed line indicates the number of allocated objects, as indicated by the y-axis on the right.\n- An icon for each garbage collection event.\nHowever, if you're using a device running Android 7.1 or lower, not all profiling data is visible by default. If you see a message that says, \"Advanced profiling is unavailable for the selected process,\" you need to enable advanced profiling to see the following:\n- Event timeline\n- Number of allocated objects\n- Garbage collection events\nOn Android 8.0 and higher, advanced profiling is always enabled for debuggable apps.\nHow memory is counted\nThe numbers you see at the top of the Memory Profiler (figure 2) are based on all the private memory pages that your app has committed, according to the Android system. This count does not include pages shared with the system or other apps.\nThe categories in the memory count are as follows:\n- Java: Memory from objects allocated from Java or Kotlin code.\nNative: Memory from objects allocated from C or C++ code.\nEven if you're not using C++ in your app, you might see some native memory used here because the Android framework uses native memory to handle various tasks on your behalf, such as when handling image assets and other graphics—even though the code you've written is in Java or Kotlin.\nGraphics: Memory used for graphics buffer queues to display pixels to the screen, including GL surfaces, GL textures, and so on. (Note that this is memory shared with the CPU, not dedicated GPU memory.)\n- Stack: Memory used by both native and Java stacks in your app. This usually relates to how many threads your app is running.\n- Code: Memory that your app uses for code and resources, such as dex bytecode, optimized or compiled dex code, .so libraries, and fonts.\n- Other: Memory used by your app that the system isn't sure how to categorize.\nAllocated: The number of Java/Kotlin objects allocated by your app. This does not count objects allocated in C or C++.\nWhen connected to a device running Android 7.1 and lower, this allocation count starts only at the time the Memory Profiler connected to your running app. So any objects allocated before you start profiling are not accounted for. However, Android 8.0 includes an on-device profiling tool that keeps track of all allocations, so this number always represents the total number of Java objects outstanding in your app on Android 8.0 and higher.\nWhen compared to memory counts from the previous Android Monitor tool, the new Memory Profiler records your memory differently, so it might seem like your memory use is now higher. The Memory Profiler monitors some extra categories that increase the total, but if you only care about the Java heap memory, then the \"Java\" number should be similar to the value from the previous tool.\nAnd although the Java number probably doesn't exactly match what you saw in Android Monitor, the new number accounts for all physical memory pages that have been allocated to your app's Java heap since it was forked from Zygote. So this provides an accurate representation of how much physical memory your app is actually using.\nView memory allocations\nMemory allocations show you how each object in your memory was allocated. Specifically, the Memory Profiler can show you the following about object allocations:\n- What type of objects were allocated and how much space they use.\n- The stack trace of each allocation, including in which thread.\n- When the objects were deallocated (only when using a device with Android 8.0 or higher).\nIf your device is running Android 8.0 or higher, you can view your object allocations at any time as follows: Just click-and-hold in the timeline and drag to select the region where you want to view the allocations (as shown in video 1). There's no need to begin a recording session because Android 8.0 and higher includes an on-device profiling tool that constantly tracks your app's allocations.\nIf your device is running Android 7.1 or lower, click Record memory allocations in the Memory Profiler toolbar. While recording, Android Monitor tracks all allocations that occur in your app. When you're done, click Stop recording (the same button; see video 2) to view the allocations.\nOnce you select a region of the timeline (or when you finish a recording session with a device running Android 7.1 or lower), the list of allocated objects appears below the timeline, grouped by class name and sorted by their heap count.\nTo inspect the allocation record, follow these steps:\n- Browse the list to find objects that have unusually large heap counts and that might be leaked. To help find known classes, click the Class Name column header to sort alphabetically. Then click a class name. The Instance View pane appears on the right, showing each instance of that class, as shown in figure 3.\n- In the Instance View pane, click an instance. The Call Stack tab appears below, showing where that instance was allocated and in which thread.\n- In the Call Stack tab, click on any line to jump to that code in the editor.\nBy default, the list of allocations on the left is arranged by class name. At the top of the list, you can use the drop-down on the right to switch between the following arrangements:\n- Arrange by class: Groups all allocations based on class name.\n- Arrange by package: Groups all allocations based on package name.\n- Arrange by callstack: Groups all allocations into their corresponding call stack.\nCapture a heap dump\nA heap dump shows which objects in your app are using memory at the time you capture the heap dump. Especially after an extended user session, a heap dump can help identify memory leaks by showing objects still in memory that you believe should no longer be there. Once you capture a heap dump, you can view the following:\n- What types of objects your app has allocated, and how many of each.\n- How much memory each object is using.\n- Where references to each object are being held in your code.\n- The call stack for where an object was allocated. (Call stacks are currently available with a heap dump only with Android 7.1 and lower when you capture the heap dump while recording allocations.)\nTo capture a heap dump, click Dump Java heap in the Memory Profiler toolbar. While dumping the heap, the amount of Java memory might increase temporarily. This is normal because the heap dump occurs in the same process as your app and requires some memory to collect the data.\nThe heap dump appears below the memory timeline, showing all class types in the heap, as shown in figure 4.\nIf you need to be more precise about when the dump is created, you\ncan create a heap dump at the critical point in your app code by calling\nIn the list of classes, you can see the following information:\n- Alloc Count: Number of allocations in the heap.\nNative Size: Total amount of native memory used by this object type (in bytes). This column is visible only for Android 7.0 and higher.\nYou will see memory here for some objects allocated in Java because Android uses native memory for some framework classes, such as\nShallow Size: Total amount of Java memory used by this object type (in bytes).\n- Retained Size: Total size of memory being retained due to all instances of this class (in bytes).\nAt the top of the class list, you can use the left drop-down list to switch between the following heap dumps:\n- Default heap: When no heap is specified by the system.\n- App heap: The primary heap on which your app allocates memory.\n- Image heap: The system boot image, containing classes that are preloaded during boot time. Allocations here are guaranteed to never move or go away.\n- Zygote heap: The copy-on-write heap where an app process is forked from in the Android system.\nThe list of objects in the heap are arranged by class name, by default. You can use the other drop-down to switch between the following arrangements:\n- Arrange by class: Groups all allocations based on class name.\n- Arrange by package: Groups all allocations based on package name.\n- Arrange by callstack: Groups all allocations into their corresponding call stack. This option works only if you capture the heap dump while recording allocations. Even so, there are likely to be objects in the heap that were allocated before you started recording, so those allocations appear first, simply listed by class name.\nThe list is sorted by the Retained Size column, by default. You can click on any of the column headers to change how the list is sorted.\nClick a class name to open the Instance View window on the right (shown in figure 5). Each listed instance includes the following:\n- Depth: The shortest number of hops from any GC root to the selected instance.\n- Native Size: Size of this instance in native memory. This column is visible only for Android 7.0 and higher.\n- Shallow Size: Size of this instance in Java memory.\n- Retained Size: Size of memory that this instance dominates (as per the dominator tree).\nTo inspect your heap, follow these steps:\n- Browse the list to find objects that have unusually large heap counts and that might be leaked. To help find known classes, click the Class Name column header to sort alphabetically. Then click a class name. The Instance View pane appears on the right, showing each instance of that class, as shown in figure 5.\n- In the Instance View pane, click an instance. The References\ntab appears below, showing every reference to that object.\nOr, click the arrow next to the instance name to view all its fields, and then click a field name to view all its references. And if you want to view the instance details for a field, right-click on the field and select Go to Instance.\n- In the References tab, if you identify a reference that might be leaking memory, right-click on it and select Go to Instance. This selects the corresponding instance from the heap dump, showing you its own instance data.\nIn your heap dump, look for memory leaks caused by any of the following:\n- Long-lived references to\nDrawable, and other objects that might hold a reference to the\n- Non-static inner classes, such as a\nRunnable, that can hold an\n- Caches that hold objects longer than necessary.\nSave the heap dump as HPROF\nOnce you capture a heap dump, the data is viewable in the Memory Profiler only\nwhile the profiler is running. When you exit the profiling session, you lose the\nheap dump. So if you want to save it for review later, export the heap dump\nto an HPROF file by clicking Export capture to file\n, in the toolbar below the timeline. In the dialog that appears, be sure\nto save the file with the\nYou can then reopen the file in Android Studio by dragging the file into an empty editor window (or drop it in the file tab bar).\nTo use a different HPROF analyzer like\nyou need to convert the HPROF file from Android format to the Java SE HPROF format.\nYou can do so with the\nhprof-conv tool provided in the\nandroid_sdk/platform-tools/ directory. Run the\ncommand with two arguments: the original HPROF file and the location to write the converted HPROF\nfile. For example:\nhprof-conv heap-original.hprof heap-converted.hprof\nTechniques for profiling your memory\nWhile using the Memory Profiler, you should stress your app code and try forcing memory leaks. One way to provoke memory leaks in your app is to let it run for a while before inspecting the heap. Leaks might trickle up to the top of the allocations in the heap. However, the smaller the leak, the longer you need to run the app in order to see it.\nYou can also trigger a memory leak in one of the following ways:\n- Rotate the device from portrait to landscape and back again multiple times while in different\nactivity states. Rotating the device can often cause an app to leak an\nViewobject because the system recreates the\nActivityand if your app holds a reference to one of those objects somewhere else, the system can't garbage collect it.\n- Switch between your app and another app while in different activity states (navigate to the Home screen, then return to your app).\nTip: You can also perform the above steps by using the monkeyrunner test framework.","Overview of Visual Studio Graphics Diagnostics\nVisual Studio Graphics Diagnostics is a set of tools for recording and then analyzing rendering and performance problems in Direct3D apps. Graphics Diagnostics can be used on apps that are running locally on your Windows PC, in a Windows device emulator, or on a remote PC or device.\nDebugging rendering problems in a graphically-rich app is not as straight-forward as starting a debugger and stepping through some code. In each frame, hundreds of thousands of unique pixels are produced, each according to a complex set of state, data, parameters, and code—of these, perhaps only a few pixels will exhibit the problem you are trying to diagnose. To complicate matters even further, the code that generates each pixel is executed on specialized hardware that processes hundreds of pixels in parallel. Traditional debugging tools and techniques—which are difficult to leverage in even lightly-threaded code—are ineffective when faced with so much data.\nThe Graphics Diagnostics tools in Visual Studio are designed to help you locate rendering problems by starting with the visual artifacts that indicate the problem and then tracing back to the source of the problem by focusing only on relevant shader code, pipeline stages, draw calls, resources, and device state—in the app's own source code.\nGraphics Diagnostics supports apps that use Direct3D 12, Direct3D 11, and Direct3D 10, and provides limited support for apps that use Direct2D. It does not support apps that use earlier versions of Direct3D, DirectDraw, or other graphics APIs.\nWindows 10 introduces the next version of Direct3D, Direct3D 12, which is substantially different from Direct3D 10 and Direct3D 11. These differences bring DirectX back into alignment with modern graphics hardware and unleashing its full potential, but they also bring big API changes and place greater responsibility on the programmer to manage resource lifetimes and contention. Having great debugging tools is crucial to help graphics programmers make this transition, so Graphics Diagnostics in Visual Studio 2015 supports Direct3D12 right from the start. Despite the differences, Graphics Diagnostics with Direct3D 12 maintains feature-parity with Graphics Diagnostics with Direct3D 11.2, with the current exception of the Frame Analysis feature. Soon, support for Frame Analysis in Direct3D 12 will be added, followed by new diagnostics tools to help you solve new kinds of bugs you might encounter in Direct3D 12.\nWindows 10 also maintains support for previous versions of Direct3D and the games and applications that rely on them. Graphics Diagnostics in Visual Studio 2015 continues to support Direct3D 10 and Direct3D 11 on Windows 10, as well as on Windows 8.1.\nIn Windows 8.1, DirectX 11.2 introduces new features that include support for capturing graphics information through its runtime. Windows 8.1 uses the new runtime-based capture—known as robust capture—exclusively for all versions of DirectX that Windows 8.1 supports. Robust capture also supports new features of Direct3D 11.2.\nBecause Direct2D is a user-mode API that’s built on top of Direct3D, you can use Graphics Diagnostics to help debug rendering problems in apps that use Direct2D. However, because only the underlying Direct3D events are recorded instead of the higher-level Direct2D events, Direct2D events won't appear in the Graphics Event List. Also, because the relationship between Direct2D events and the resulting Direct3D events are not always clear, using Graphics Diagnostics to debug rendering problems in apps that use Direct2D is not straight forward. Still, you can use Graphics Diagnostics to get information about low-level rendering problems in apps that use Direct2D.\nGraphics Diagnostics has a dedicated interface—the Graphics Analyzer window—for diagnosing rendering problems, but it also adds some tools to the Visual Studio interface.\nWhen you run your app under Graphics Diagnostics, Visual Studio displays a diagnostics session interface that you can use to capture frames and which also displays the current CPU and GPU load. The CPU and GPU load is displayed to help you identify frames you might want to capture due to their performance characteristics, rather than rendering errors.\nThis isn't the only way to capture frames though. You can also capture frames by using the programmatic capture interface, or by using the command-line capture program, dxcap.exe.\nSee Capturing Graphics Information for more information.\nGraphics Diagnostics can also profile the performance of your Direct3D app. Because profiling data would be skewed by recording details of graphics events, this is separate from capturing frames to be used examined with the Graphics Analyzer.\nSee GPU Usage for more information.\nThe DirectX control panel is a component of DirectX that you can use to change the way that DirectX behaves—for example, you can enable the debug version of the DirectX runtime components, select the kind of debug messages that are reported, and disallow certain graphics hardware capabilities from being used to emulate less-capable hardware. This level of control over DirectX can help you debug and test your DirectX app. You can access the DirectX control panel from Visual Studio.\nTo open the DirectX control panel\nOn the menu bar, choose Debug, Graphics, DirectX Control Panel.\nThe Visual Studio Graphics Analyzer is a dedicated interface for examining rendering and performance problems in frames you've already captured. Inside Graphics Analyzer, you'll find several tools to help you explore and understand the rendering behavior of your app. Each tool exposes a different kind of information about the frame that's being inspected, and the tools are designed to be used in concert to intuitively narrow-in on the source of a rendering problem, starting from the its appearance in the framebuffer.\nThis illustration shows a typical layout of tools in the Graphics Analyzer.\nInside the Graphics Analyzer, the graphics log document is the most prominent tool window. This window represents all of the frames you captured by running your app under Graphics Diagnostics. From here, you can select a different frame to examine or select a specific pixel that you want to examine with the Pixel History tool. The framebuffer image displayed in this document changes to reflect the currently selected Event so that you can see how the framebuffer is affected over time.\nThe Graphics Log Document is also the entry point to the Frame Analysis tool, which helps you understand the performance of a frame by changing the way certain aspects of rendering are configured and providing benchmark results to compare with the original.\nGraphic events mark each Direct3D API call and user-defined event.\nThe Graphics Event List shows all of the graphics events that were recorded during the frame you're examining. To help you find what's important, the event list can be viewed hierarchically—with recent state-changes underneath the subsequent draw call—or as a timeline. Additionally, events are color-coded based on the queue they belong to and you can filter the list to only include the events you're interested in.\nWhen you select an event in the list, the rest of the Graphics Analysis tools reflect the state of the frame at the time of that event. In this way, you can see the effect of any event on the GPU. For example, you can see the immediate effect of any draw call on the framebuffer, even if it becomes obscured by subsequent draw calls. Some events also have hyperlinks you can follow to see more details about its parameters or related resource objects.\nEach draw call in your app goes through the graphics pipeline provided by Direct3D. At each stage in the pipeline, output from the previous stage is transformed by a small program, called a shader, and then passed to the next stage until it is finally rendered to the screen. Many rendering errors occur at the boundary between pipeline stages when the output format is different than the next stage expects, or when any one stage simply produces incorrect results. Normally, you only get the final results as you would see on your screen and you can't easily tell where in the pipeline the error occurred.\nThe Graphics Pipeline Stages window visualizes the result of each stage independently, so that you can more easily determine which stage a rendering problem first appears in. Once you've determined which stage that is, you can start debugging its shader right from the Pipeline Stages window.\nRendering operations depend on a lot of state that's typically spread across multiple objects. Many kinds of rendering problems are caused by misconfigured state.\nThe Graphics State window collects the state information relevant to each draw call together in one place so that it's easier to find, and also highlights the state changes that have occurred since the previous draw call.\nIn complex scenes, it's not uncommon for a pixel to be shaded multiple times in a single frame. Sometimes the earlier color is just overwritten, but other times the colors are combined together to achieve effects such as transparency. When the result of combining them together doesn't have the right appearance you can't easily tell if it's because one of the colors was incorrect, or if there's a problem with the way they were combined. Other times, an object might appear to be missing because its contribution to the pixel was rejected for some reason.\nThe Graphics Pixel History window visualizes the complete shader history of every pixel in the frame, including rejected contributions. For contributions that weren't rejected, it displays the raw shader results and how each new color was combined with the previous one. With this information, it's much easier to locate the source of errors in pixels that blend shader results, or when a rendered object is missing because its contribution to the pixel was incorrectly rejected.\nShader code isn't the only source of rendering problems in a Direct3D app, sometimes your app's source code passes the wrong parameter or doesn't configure Direct3D quite right. One kind of error that the previously discussed feature, Pixel History, can help you find is when a rendered object is missing because all its pixels have been rejected. This kind of error usually happens when you misconfigured a setting, such as the one that controls how the depth test is performed, and you can usually find your mistake somewhere in the call stack of the missing object's draw call.\nThe Graphics Event Call Stack window displays the complete call stack of every graphics event in the Event List, and even lets you jump to your app's source code if debugging information is available. This is a powerful tool for following an error from where it first appears, on the GPU, back to where it originated in your app's source code.\nEvery frame your app renders is probably backed by hundreds or even thousands of resource objects. These can include back buffers and render targets, textures, vertex buffers, index buffers, general buffers—almost everything Direct3D remembers is an object.\nThe Graphics Object Table displays all the objects that exist at the time of the graphics event selected in the event list. Since most objects in a typical app are textures, the event list is optimized to show details relevant to images at a glance. The Type column tells you what kind of object is in each row, and the Format column further shows the sub-type or version of the object. Other details are also shown. Some objects also have hyperlinks you can follow to view the object with a more specialized viewer, such as textures (you can view the texture as an image), or buffers (you can choose how the buffer viewer parses and displays the raw buffer bytes by defining the buffer format).\nYour app's graphics don't just need to be correct – they need to be fast, too. Even on less-powerful devices like laptops with integrated graphics or mobile phones. And they still need to look great too.\nThe Graphics Frame Analysis tool explores potential performance optimizations by automatically changing the way the app uses Direct3D and providing benchmark results for comparison. For example, Frame Analysis can enable mip-mapping on every texture, which might reveal textures that could benefit from mip-mapping but don't currently have it enabled. On hardware that supports it, Frame Analysis also presents information collected from the GPU's performance counters—this level of information can identify hardware-level performance issues, such as high numbers of texture fetch stalls or cache misses.\nBut Frame Analysis isn't just about going fast – it's about gaining the most performance you can while giving up the least amount of visual quality. Sometimes an expensive effect that looks great on a large display doesn't make the same impact when viewed on the small screen of a phone, where a simpler effect might look just as good without draining the battery. The automatic changes and benchmarks that Graphics Analysis provides can help you find the balance that’s right for your app across a range of devices."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:950be9cb-f1d4-4164-9118-75b8c811ebe4>","<urn:uuid:f09142e1-4d16-4655-bf14-fbb25cd74298>"],"error":null}
