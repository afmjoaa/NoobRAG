{"question":"I'm planning a visit to Berlin - what's the main difference between Hitler's former chancellery site and the Topography of Terror museum's location?","answer":"While both sites are historically significant Nazi-era locations in Berlin, they are distinct places. The chancellery site is where Hitler was made chancellor and famously saluted crowds from the window on January 30, 1933, at Wilhelmstrasse. In contrast, the Topography of Terror museum is located at the former headquarters of the SS Reich Security Main Office, Gestapo, and SD on Niederkirchnerstrasse (formerly Prinz-Albrecht-Strasse). The Topography of Terror site was largely destroyed by Allied bombing in 1945 and later became a museum, while preserving parts of the Berlin Wall that ran along its boundary.","context":["|\"A man walks past a poster advertising the exhibition 'Berlin 1933: The Road to Dictatorship' at the Topography of Terror museum in Berlin. The exhibition coincides with the 80th anniversary of Adolf Hitler's accession to power.\" (AFP/Getty)|\nAgence France-Presse dispatch in The Telegraph, January 30, 2013\n\"Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Wednesday that Adolf Hitler's rise to power 80 years ago should go on reminding Germans that democracy and freedom cannot be taken for granted. Mrs. Merkel was speaking at the inauguration of an exhibition in Berlin to commemorate eight decades since Hitler became chancellor on January 30, 1933 -- an anniversary which has aroused much interest in Germany. 'Human rights don't assert themselves. Freedom doesn't preserve itself all alone and democracy doesn't succeed by itself,' Mrs. Merkel said. 'That must be a constant warning for us, Germans,' she added referring to Hitler's arrival at the chancellery. The exhibition, 'Berlin 1933. On the Path to Dictatorship', is on a site charged with history as the former headquarters of the Gestapo, the secret police of the Nazi regime. It now houses The Topography of Terror, an open-air documentation centre whose exhibition traces Hitler's first months in power through photos, newspapers and posters. Mrs. Merkel noted that it only took six months for the dictator to 'wipe out all the diversity' of German society. But she also underscored that a large part of society had supported 'or at least acquiesced' to Hitler's regime.\nIn a black-and-white photo, visitors to the exhibition can make out the Fuehrer saluting the crowd from the chancellery window on the evening of January 30, 1933, after earlier having been made chancellor and been charged by president Paul von Hindenburg with forming a new government. 'The hour has come! We are at Wilhelmstrasse (the site of the chancellery at the time). Hitler is chancellor of the Reich. Like in a fairytale,' wrote Joseph Goebbels, who was to become Nazi propaganda chief, in his diary on January 31, 1933. Posters go on to show images of the Reichstag going up in flames the following month and then the first measures taken against the Jews on April 1, with the start of a boycott of Jewish shops, doctors and lawyers. 'Germans, defend yourselves! Don't buy from Jews,' a poster states. Andreas Nachama, director of The Topography of Terror, said the arrival of the failed painter from Austria at the helm of power in Germany was an 'incision' in history, although nobody at the time thought he would last. However the parliamentary system of the Weimar Republic failed to find a stable majority and Hitler, on the back of over-simplified themes, rallied millions of unemployed and people who had lost everything in the economic crisis. According to Mr. Nachama, the exhibition shows the 'daily erosion of democratic institutions' as the Nazi regime began to build up steam, eventually leading to World War II and the deaths of 40 to 60 million people, including six million Jews. The 80th anniversary has sparked much interest in Germany, with a novel that imagines Hitler's return to modern-day Berlin entitled 'He's Back' (Er Ist Wieder Da) becoming a bestseller here. Another two exhibitions are also due to open -- one on Berlin and the Nazis at the German Historical Museum and the other offering a thematic tour of Berlin's symbolic sites from the Third Reich. Just ahead of the anniversary, Mrs. Merkel said in her weekly podcast that Germany had 'an everlasting responsibility for the crimes of National Socialism, for the victims of World War II, and above all, for the Holocaust'. 'We're facing our history, we're not hiding anything, we're not repressing anything. We must confront this to make sure we are a good and trustworthy partner in the future, as we already are today, thankfully,' Merkel said.\"\n[n.b. This is the complete text of the dispatch.]","Topography of Terror\nThe Topography of Terror (German: Topographie des Terrors) is an outdoor and indoor history museum in Berlin, Germany. It is located on Niederkirchnerstrasse, formerly Prinz-Albrecht-Strasse, on the site of buildings, which during the Nazi regime from 1933 to 1945 was the SS Reich Security Main Office, the headquarters of the Sicherheitspolizei, SD, Einsatzgruppen and Gestapo.\nThe buildings that housed the Gestapo and SS headquarters were largely destroyed by Allied bombing during early 1945 and the ruins demolished after the war. The boundary between the American and Soviet zones of occupation in Berlin ran along the Prinz-Albrecht-Strasse, so the street soon became a fortified boundary, and the Berlin Wall ran along the south side of the street, renamed Niederkirchnerstrasse, from 1961 to 1989. The wall here was never demolished. The section adjacent to the Topography of Terror site is the longest extant segment of the outer wall, as the longer East Side Gallery section in Friedrichshain was part of the inner wall, not visible from West Berlin.\nThe first exhibitions of the site took place in 1987, as part of Berlin's 750th anniversary. The cellar of the Gestapo headquarters, where many political prisoners were tortured and executed, was found and excavated. The site was then turned into a memorial and museum, in the open air but protected from the elements by a canopy, detailing the history of repression under the Nazis. The excavation took place in cooperation with East German researchers, and a joint exhibition was shown both at the site and in East Germany in 1989.\nIn 1992, two years after German reunification, a foundation was established to take care of the site, and the following year, it initiated an architectural competition to design a permanent museum. A design by architect Peter Zumthor was chosen. However, construction was stopped due to funding problems after the concrete core of the structure had been built. This stood on the site for nearly a decade until it was finally demolished in 2004 and a new building begun.\nThe construction of the new Documentation Center according to a prize-winning design by the architect Ursula Wilms (Heinle, Wischer und Partner, Berlin) and the landscape architect Heinz W. Hallmann (Aachen) was finished in 2010. The new Documentation Center was officially opened on 6 May 2010 by Federal President Horst Köhler on the occasion of the 65th anniversary of the end of World War II. The new exhibition and documentation building and the redesigned historic grounds were opened to the public on 7 May 2010.\nAfter the demolition of the ruins in the 1950s, the area was used as a bumper car site and a dumping ground for rubble from the renovation of Kreuzberg. The plans for a memorial site on the former site of the Gestapo goes back to 1978, when Berlin architecture critic Dieter Hoffmann-Axthelm was one of the first to note, in essays and surveys, the significance of the former site of the Gestapo, SD and RSHA headquarters.\nThe first exhibition on the site's history was created for the 750th anniversary of Berlin in 1987. The research continued after it, leading to a documentation centre that collected some more evidence for the terror of the National Socialists in Germany. In 1992, a foundation was created for the construction and maintenance of the centre with an associated permanent exhibition. The managing director is Rabbi Andreas Nachama.\nA tender in 1993 to design the museum complex was won by the Pritzker Prize-winning Swiss architect Peter Zumthor. Based on the temporary exhibition building, his design was likened to the skeleton of a barracks, allowing light through the glazed gaps in the concrete beams. Although critically acclaimed, the structure proved expensive to build and when the original contractor became insolvent in the middle of construction, no other contractor willing to continue the project for the fixed fee could be found. With the city of Berlin unwilling to pay an additional three to five million Euros for a reduced design and funding from the federal government delayed until more progress was achieved, the site was left with just the concrete stairwells of the design. Having spent 13.9 million Euros already, these were demolished, despite the protests of Zumthor and other architects, in 2004.\nArchitectural design competition 2005\nIn June 2005 a new architectural design competition was launched following the aborted partial construction of Zumthor's design. Out of 309 submitted and 23 chosen drafts, architect Ursula Wilms from the Berlin architects office Heinle, Wischer and Partner and landscape architect Heinz W. Hallmann from Aachen won in January 2006 the final round. The draft included a two-storey, ashlar-formed, paned building with an available surface of 3,500 square metres. For the construction around €15 million was available. Another five to nine million Euro was used for the interior and the redevelopment of the historical site. These costs were defrayed jointly by both the federal government and the federal state of Berlin, each contributing 50%. The architects estimated construction costs at a maximum of €20 million and a construction period of two years.\nThe construction was finished on time and the new building was opened to the public on 7 May 2010.\nThe open-air exhibition in the trench alongside the excavated segments of cellar wall on Niederkirchnerstraße (formerly Prinz-Albrecht-Straße) was retained and sheltered with glass. The room for the permanent exhibition is 800 cubic metres and presents the development and functions of the security apparatuses during the Nazi regime. A room for events at the back of the building can accommodate 200 participants. In the southern part of the area outside is a copse of robinias, the remains of \"Harrys Autodrom\" from the 1970s, whereas the rest of the open space is covered with greywacke. Around the flat-roofed building is a façade made of metal lamellae, which opens the building in a way that it is possible to look out of it to the surroundings anywhere on the ground floor of the building. In the basement is the seminar centre, the library with about 25,000 volumes, the memorial department and offices for 17 employees of the Topography of Terror Foundation.\nWith the inauguration of the new Documentation Center, three permanent exhibitions are open to the public. All three are presented bilingually in German and English.\nTopography of Terror. Gestapo, SS, and Reich Security Main Office on Wilhelm- and Prinz-Albrecht-Straße\nThe \"Topography of Terror\" permanent exhibition was shown in the open air until the new documentation center opened. The thoroughly revised and redesigned \"Topography of Terror\" permanent exhibition is presented over 800 square meters in the new building. The focus of the exhibition is the central institutions of the SS and police in the \"Third Reich\" as well as the crimes they perpetrated throughout Europe. Attention to the Nazi regime's many victim groups will assume a central place alongside the portrayal of the system of terror.\nBerlin 1933–1945 Between Propaganda and Terror\nA permanent exhibition about the capital Berlin during the \"Third Reich\" will be on display in the exhibition trench alongside the excavated segments of cellar wall on Niederkirchnerstraße (formerly Prinz-Albrecht-Straße). It will address National Socialist policy in Berlin and its consequences for the city and its population.\nTopography of Terror Site Tour. The History of the Site\nWith the opening of the new Documentation Center, the grounds of the \"Topography of Terror\" are once again completely open to the public. The site tour, which mainly follows the exposed building remnants, encompasses 15 stations. Informational signs provide an overview of the historic location and the site's use during the Nazi period and the postwar era. The tour also integrates remains of the Berlin Wall, which have been designated a historic monument.\nSpecial and temporary exhibitions\nThe Face of the Ghetto. Pictures taken by Jewish Photographers in the Litzmannstadt Ghetto 1940–1944\nThis special exhibition will be presented in the Topography of Terror Documentation Centre from 23 June 2010 on. It was developed by Dr. Ingo Loose and Dr. Thomas Lutz in cooperation with the State Archive in Łódź.\nThe \"House Prison\" at Gestapo Headquarters in Berlin. Terror and Resistance 1933–1945\nA bilingual German-English exhibition on the \"House Prison\" at the Gestapo Headquarters was shown in a special open-air exhibition area and included the 'ground memorial' including remains of former basement prison cells.\nWith altogether 400 photos and documents, for the first time the exhibition comprehensively related the history of the prison at Prinz-Albrecht-Straße 8 and reminded the fate of numerous detainees.\nThis presentation lasted from August 2005 to April 2008 on the site of the 'Topography of Terror'.\nThe Trial of Major War Criminals in Nuremberg\nThis exhibition was presented on the occasion of the 60th anniversary of the Nuremberg Trials and comprised around 110 photo and 50 text documents as well as 15 audio stations. It outlined the genesis, process, ambition and importance of the trial led by the Allies at Nuremberg focussing on the accused, whose culpability for the war crimes is demonstrated.\nThe presentation was located on the construction hoarding at the area of the Topography of Terror from October 2005 to April 2007.\nThe \"People's Court\" - Hitler's Political Tribunal\nGerman-English documentation on occasion of the 70th anniversary of the foundation of the people's court.\nThe exhibition was developed in cooperation with the Memorial to the German Resistance.\nFire! Anti-Jewish Terror on \"Kristallnacht\" in November 1938\nThe exhibition was developed in cooperation with the Foundation Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe and the Stiftung Neue Synagoge - Centrum Judaicum. The cooperative project presented on the 70th anniversary of the Kristallnacht pogrom presents historical documentation of the attack, seen around the world, on German Jewry after five and a half years of Nazi dictatorship.\nThe presentation was displayed from November 2008 to March 2009 in the Centrum Judaicum in Berlin.\nThe library of the Topography of Terror Foundation is a special library focusing on the police, SS, Gestapo in the Third Reich and on the National Socialism in general. It currently comprises about 25 800 media elements, about 120 regularly and 100 closed magazines. It is situated around a fountain reminding of Zen gardens and freely accessible.\nMemorial Museums Department\nThe Topography of Terror Foundation provides comprehensive advice and coordination tasks in the field of national and international memorial sites. In Germany, the Memorial Museums Department is the central coordination office for memorial sites and initiatives for memorial sites and increasingly promotes the international collaboration.\nDocumentation Centre NS Forced Labor\nThe last well-preserved former Nazi forced labour camp is located in Niederschöneweide. In the Second World War it served as one of the more than 3000 collective accommodations dispersed throughout the city for forced labourers. The Documentation Centre on Nazi Forced Labor opened in the summer of 2006 on a part of historical grounds that once belonged to the camp and which are today protected as a monument. The Documentation Centre offers two permanent exhibitions: \"Forced Labour in the Daily Round 1938-1945\" and \"Between two stools. The History of the Italian Military Internees 1943-1945\". Entrance and guided tours are free.\n- Lucarelli, Fosco: Zumthor’s Topographie des Terrors (1993–2004): visual history of birth, growth and death of a project Archived 2015-04-02 at the Wayback Machine, 14 November 2011\n- Topographie des Terrors. \"Köhler weiht Dokumentationszentrum in Berlin ein\" stern.de, 6 May 2010 (in German)\n- Topography of Terror.

Tobacco use can lead to nicotine dependence and serious health problems. Cessation can significantly reduce the risk of suffering from smoking-related diseases. Tobacco dependence is a chronic condition that often requires repeated interventions, but effective treatments and helpful resources exist. Smokers can and do quit smoking. In fact, today there are more former smokers than current smokers. Nicotine Dependence - Nicotine is the psychoactive drug in tobacco products that produces dependence. Most smokers are dependent on nicotine. Nicotine dependence is the most common form of chemical dependence in the United States. Research suggests that nicotine is as addictive as heroin, cocaine, or alcohol. Quitting smoking is difficult and may require multiple attempts. Users often relapse because of stress, weight gain, and withdrawal symptoms. Examples of nicotine withdrawal symptoms include irritability, anxiety, difficulty concentrating, and increased appetite. Health Benefits of Cessation - Breaking free from nicotine dependence is not the only reason to quit smoking. Cigarette smoke contains at least 250 chemicals known to be toxic or carcinogenic (i.e., cause cancer). Cigarette smoke can cause serious health problems, numerous diseases, and death. Fortunately, people who stop smoking greatly reduce their risk for disease and premature death. Although the health benefits are greater for people who stop at earlier ages, cessation is beneficial at all ages. Smoking cessation is associated with the following health benefits: Smoking cessation lowers the risk for lung and other types of cancer. Smoking cessation reduces the risk for coronary heart disease, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease. Coronary heart disease risk is reduced within 1 to 2 years of cessation. * This is a privately authored news service and educational publication of Progressive Management.

{"question":"As someone studying theatre history, I'm curious about the exact changes made to the Lincoln's Inn Fields stage during its 1661 renovation. What did these alterations involve?","answer":"While the exact nature of the alterations remains unknown, evidence suggests they involved repositioning the backscenes further upstage. The original staging used old scenery from The Cockpit theatre which had a depth of only 16 feet, while Lincoln's Inn Fields had 28 feet of stage depth. The alterations likely allowed for the use of new custom-built scenery that better utilized the full stage space, moving the backscenes about 12 feet further from the audience compared to the original arrangement.","context":["On October 21, 1661 four months after the opening of Sir William Davenant’s theatre at Lincoln’s Inn Fields (hereafter LIF), Samuel Pepys notes in his diary that the scenic arrangement at the theatre had changed: “To the Opera which is now newly begun to act again, after some alteracion of their scene, which do make it very much worse; but the play ‘Love and Honour’ […] well done”. Pepys’s entry suggests that any model of the LIF stage derived from analysis of post-‘alteration’ LIF plays, my own included, may not be applicable to the first LIF productions. Discussion of this first period of production must, therefore, consider a possible earlier version of the LIF stage arrangement. Edward Langhans speculates that the alteration was the addition of additional grooves upstage “for the benefit of deep vistas”. My analysis of LIF plays reveals no clear indication of demand for such vistas; however, Langhans is almost certainly correct in thinking that Davenant made a structural change of some kind to the LIF stage. The exact nature of this change will remain a mystery unless new evidence is found, but I believe it is possible to glean more from the evidence that we do have. The following is, as far as I know, the first attempt to examine this evidence with the aim of inferring the first scenic arrangement at LIF.\nLanghans makes some interesting speculations about the nature of the changes, but it is possibly more productive to begin by asking why the changes were made at this particular time, rather than suggesting a possible form. It is curious that the alterations arrive when they do. Although records are by no means complete the London Stage has no record of any LIF performances between September 11 and October 21, a gap of 40 days. There was also a hiatus of 35 days after the initial off-season run of The Siege of Rhodes. However, it is easier to view the earlier production as a special case – Rhodes generated much needed cash and put LIF on the map ready for its first season after the summer holiday. The stutter in LIF’s post-alteration production might suggest teething problems at the new theatre, but there is no indication of this in either Pepys’s dairy or in John Downes’s account of Restoration theatre production, Roscius Anglicanus. Admittedly, Downes, who was the prompter at LIF and later with Betterton throughout his career (he retired in 1706), was writing retrospectively, but while his dates may be occasionally faulty, his memory of events at this exciting time in his life is particularly vivid. Pepys has nothing but praise for Rhodes and two out of three other productions that he attended before the alterations. Of Rhodes 1 he says, “the scene opened; which indeed is very fine and magnificent” (July 2); The Wits he pronounces, “a most excellent play, and admirable scenes” (August 15); similarly Hamlet was “done with scenes very well” (August 24); we do not know what he thought of Twelfth Night because he was so conscience-struck for attending that he “took no pleasure at all in it” (September 11). Not only was Davenant’s new venture artistically successful it was evidently making money: Pepys reports that he saw a King’s company production during the initial run of Rhodes and remarked how strange it was to find the Vere Street theatre “that used to be so thronged, now empty since the Opera begun” (July 4). Downes gleefully reports that Rhodes “continu’d Acting 12 days without interruption with great applause”; that The Wits was performed eight days successively; that Hamlet was the company’s most profitable tragedy; and that Twelfth Night “had mighty Success”. None of these reports suggests a theatre with technical problems. The closure and subsequent alterations may, therefore, have been planned. Davenant was a careful and patient manager, he did not rush his actresses into performance before they had been properly trained, and he did not convert Lisle’s tennis court hastily. He first leased the court in March 1660 and by January 1661, deciding, as he put it, “there wanted room for the depth of scenes in the ground belonging to the said Tennis Court”, he leased further ground to build a scene store, which he had already started building by March. If in January 1661 he had a fair idea of how big his scene store should be it seems out of character that he would miscalculate so badly the size of his scenic stage, especially as he seems to have given himself ample time in which to make the conversion. It is beginning to look likely that a closure at some point was planned by Davenant. Lack of cash could well be the reason why he opened with what he did, and excellent box-office receipts the reason why he closed when he did. He might have planned to make the final alterations when he had the cash, and the financial success of his opening productions enabled him to make the necessary alterations at an earlier date. Alternatively, he might have planned the closure date from the start. Either way, Davenant’s financial situation may well have been the determining factor. Cash flow is a problem at the start of any venture, and then as now the building of a theatre is a risky and costly investment. Hotson records Davenant’s underhanded attempt to secure the position (hence, revenues) of Master of the Revels in Ireland, his persistent evasion of the license-fee claims of the English Master, Sir Henry Herbert, and his selling of a number of Duke’s Company shares. All these activities suggest that finances were tight, and in the matter of the shares Nicoll concludes that Davenant’s hand was forced: “Within a few months expenses were accumulating so steadily that in June further shares were disposed of and some more followed the following year”. Given this financial situation, and the fact that he already had in store scenery for The Siege of Rhodes and for his Commonwealth ‘operas’ The Cruelty of the Spaniards in Peru and The History of Sir Francis Drake (plus, perhaps, some pre-Civil War items), it would make sense if Davenant had planned to open his new theatre with a production for which he already had scenery, and with old plays that made few scenic demands, while he slowly built up a new scenery stock and improved his cash flow.  By opening his new theatre with both parts of The Siege of Rhodes he was not only making a personal artistic statement he was also extracting further use from old scenery, and thereby saving money.\nHaving considered the question of Davenant’s timing, we may now turn to the form of the alterations. There is an obvious observation to make about the idea of using old scenery from Rhodes 1 on the LIF stage – it was designed for a smaller stage, was therefore smaller in dimensions, and made use of only three pairs of fixed wings. This very fact, however, might explain Davenant’s need to alter his scenic arrangement at some point. As John Orrell has shown, John Webb’s design for the Rhodes frontispiece records two sets of dimensions (ink and lead) that correspond to the original production at Rutland House and subsequent production at the Cockpit, Drury Lane. The scenic opening is constant in height, about nine feet, but Orrell shows that the width, 18ft 4in in the elevation, was later modified to 16ft 10in. The proscenium opening at LIF was certainly larger, Graham Barlow proposes an opening roughly 25ft square. If the original Rhodes frontispiece was used at LIF, the stage must have been dressed with large amounts of curtain ruches to the top and sides to render it visually acceptable. Acceptable, but not perfect, as the prologue to Rhodes 2 suggests. The prologue apologises for the stage’s “narrow Place” that compared to Continental examples must seem like a mere “Chess-board”. Here, I think Peter Holland is only half right when he states, “None of the editions [of The Siege of Rhodes] in 1663 or later provide any evidence of the staging of The Siege at Lincoln’s Inn Fields”. This may well apply to the play proper, but Davenant’s prologue refers to backstage actresses – “our Women” – quivering with “bashfull fear” of the wits in the audience. As no women would have acted in any pre-Restoration performance of this play it seems likely that the prologue is directly connected to the LIF production. In which case, the prologue’s references to “this narrow Place” make perfect sense. It must have embarrassed Davenant that he was not yet in a position to exploit the available height and width of his new theatre. Far from being ‘unnecessary’ as Holland believes, Davenant’s comments may refer to the temporary stage set up for Rhodes on the larger LIF stage but not to the LIF stage itself.\nThere is another dimension to consider – the stage depth. The Rhodes stage at The Cockpit, Drury Lane was approximately 16 feet deep, measured from backcloth to frontispiece. The corresponding figure for Barlow’s LIF model is 28 feet, a difference of 12 feet. If Davenant was using old scenery to save money it is unlikely that he would have added to his costs by requesting another wing position to make use of the extra stage depth. Even had he wanted to do so it is difficult to see where the additional wings would have been positioned. An extra rear or mid pair would have distorted perspectives; an extra front pair would have required a new frontispiece. To maintain visual coherence, use of the old scenery would have demanded use of the original positioning and perspectives. However, as noted above, Rhodes 2 implies changeable wings, a flexibility that appears to question my suggestion of a limited staging for the opening LIF productions. Adding just one more wing pair in each position would have near doubled the original scenery costs. Davenant may not have been able to afford changeable wings at this time, but on the other hand he may have felt such expenditure was artistically necessary. Either way, it would not have affected the adaptation of the old scenery to the LIF stage; this modification would not have altered the original scale and perspective. There is little doubt that Davenant was financially hard pressed at the opening of his new theatre. In this respect the appeal for money in the Rhodes 2 prologue may be more specific to future developments at LIF than has so far been recognised:\nOh Money! Money! If the WITTS would dress,\nWith Ornaments, the present face of Peace;\nAnd to our Poet half the Treasure spare,\nWhich Faction gets from Fools to nourish Warr;\nThen his contracted Scenes should wider be,\nAnd move by greater Engines…\nI suggest that the success of the opening productions enabled Davenant to be as good as his word and that once he had made his modifications, LIF scenes were indeed ‘wider’ and moved in necessarily ‘greater’ grooves. Significantly, there are no records of the first part of Rhodes being performed after the alterations, but the London Stage lists several subsequent performances of the second part, the last being at Dorset Garden on March 24, 1677. It may not have been technically difficult to accommodate Rhodes 1 on the altered LIF stage, but reverting to the cramped staging necessitated by the old scenery would certainly have looked odd and it may no longer have been considered appropriate for the fashionable venue that LIF had become by the mid-1660s. In contrast, post-alteration revivals of Rhodes 2 may well have been presented with the fuller staging suggested by the text. Whatever changes were made by Davenant to the LIF stage it is important to recall that they did not affect Pepys’s enjoyment of the play and he makes no further mention of it in his diary (even though he attended three performances of Love and Honour in October 1661).\nIn conclusion, if Davenant was short of money after converting Lisle’s tennis court, as seems likely, it would have made sense for him to have opened the new theatre with a tried and tested production and a scenic arrangement that required minimal outlay. However, restaging the Cockpit production of The Siege of Rhodes for both parts of the play (with minor modifications) would not have exploited the full stage space available at LIF. Pairs of single, fixed-wing scenes at three wing positions would have positioned the backcloth around 12 feet closer to the audience in comparison to any likely future arrangement. Therefore, when in September-October, 1661 Davenant subsequently altered his scenic stage to allow the use, if I am correct, of new, custom-built scenery, the backscenes would have been positioned further upstage. A more distant positioning of the backscenes might well explain Pepys’s initial and probably naïve aversion to Davenant’s alterations – the scenery had less initial impact because it was further off. This suggestion has the advantage of fitting the available evidence such that the nature of Davenant’s changes, their timing, and Pepys’s reaction may be seen as related and explicable.\n Langhans, ‘Staging Practices in the Restoration Theatre 1660-1682’, unpublished PhD thesis, Yale (1955 ) p.289.\n Keenan, ‘Early Restoration staging: play production at Lincoln’s Inn Fields, 1661-1674’, unpublished PhD thesis, London (2006).\n The London Stage notes that the theatrical season remained fairly constant during the 40 years from 1660-1700: the “schedule prevailed from October to June, with less frequent acting from June through September” (op cit introduction lxvii).\n As well as being the Duke’s Company’s prompter, Downes made his acting debut at the premiere of The Siege of Rhodes. Unfortunately, the presence of the King and his nobles had a debilitating effect: “the sight of that August presence, spoil’d me for an actor” (Roscius Anglicanus, op cit p.34).\n Although both parts of Rhodes were initially performed at LIF, most of Pepys’s references to Rhodes are to part two.\n Op cit pp.21-3. There is no evidence to show how scenery was allocated to these old plays, but it was likely to have been minimal judging by a promptbook for a later LIF revival, Shirley’s The Witty Faire One, which was allocated only three settings (see Langhans, Restoration Promptbooks, op cit p.43).\n See Hotson, Commonwealth and Restoration Stage, op cit pp.124-5.\n Ibid. pp.220-1.\n History, op cit, p.301.\n John Freehafer refers to the possibility of pre-Restoration scenery in his ‘Perspective Scenery And The Caroline Playhouses’ (Theatre Notebook, 1973, vol.27, no.3, p.111), though it is doubtful that any such scenery could have been used at LIF without modification.\n See Theatres, op cit pp.68-74.\n Ibid. The height of the frontispiece is 11ft but this includes a 2ft architrave. Surprisingly the narrower opening was required to fit the otherwise larger Cockpit space.\n See Thesis, op cit vol.3, Fig. 16.\n Danchin, Prologues 1.1, op cit p.67\n Holland, Ornament of action, op cit p.257, n.65.\n Danchin, Prologues 1.1, op cit p.67.\n Webb shows 18ft but this includes approximately 2ft behind the backcloth.\n Danchin, Prologues 1.1, op cit p.67.\n The London Stage editors list a performance of the first part in May 1667, their evidence being a Lord Chamberlain’s list of royal performances for this period (reproduced by Nicoll, History, op cit p.346), but the LC entry records only the play title not the part and is therefore inconclusive. Further alterations to the scenery must have been made for the DorsetGarden revivals.\n The London Stage calendar records no performance at LIF from September 11 to October 21, though records are by no means complete. If this is anywhere near accurate, the theatre was closed for at least a month. Judging by the Warrants for carpentry work at Court theatres (See Boswell, Restoration Court Stage, op cit p.236) this would have been more than enough time for some major restructuring, if required."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"advanced_reasoning"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:e8c26e90-c264-4eeb-b864-022d302b17ae>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Can you compare how PSE&G and Glanbia used data analytics to improve their operations and reduce costs? Both cases seem like interesting applications of data-driven decision making.","answer":"Both companies used data analytics in different ways to optimize their operations. Glanbia partnered with Paragon Software Systems to analyze complex routing data including delivery windows, traffic patterns, rail crossings, and SAP system integration to optimize delivery routes. PSE&G collaborated with EDF, Google Earth Outreach, and Colorado State University to gather and analyze methane leak data using specially equipped Google Street View cars and spatial analytics methods. This data was used to prioritize pipeline replacements. While Glanbia's analysis focused on route efficiency and vehicle utilization, PSE&G's analytics targeted infrastructure replacement priorities. Both approaches led to significant cost savings - Glanbia through reduced fuel use and fleet size, and PSE&G by achieving the same emissions reduction while replacing one-third fewer gas lines at $1.5-2.0 million per mile.","context":["There's no getting around it: there's great value in a software program that gets your delivery truck to its destination in the quickest and most cost-efficient manner. But route optimization means much more than just enabling fast deliveries. It can really help a company pare unnecessary services, routes and vehicles. After partnering with a routing and scheduling software provider, Glanbia, the global dairy business and nutritionals group, eliminated 106,000 kilometers a year from its operations in the Republic of Ireland. That's more than 99,000 miles, which adds up to a lot of fuel and wear and tear on vehicles. But the savings don't stop there.\nThe need to optimize its delivery operations became acute as the economic downturn of 2008-2009 began to impact consumer confidence and purchasing, says Denis Conway, the company's national logistics manager. That created difficulties for retailers and their suppliers, whose sales diminished considerably. Some stores closed, major retailers moved to central distribution models and the growth of discounters in the market began to take shape and impact the traditional retailer model.\nAt the same time, the cost of fuel began to rise, which was especially onerous for any company needing to make regular deliveries. It became obvious that Glanbia, like many others, had too many vehicles in its fleet, and its routing was not as efficient as it needed to be.\n“The reality is that there was a reduction in our customer physical customer base,” Conway says. “Our routes became inefficient because we had more trucks on the road than we needed, and at the same time the cost of fuel was starting to rise.”\nThe manual routing and scheduling process was outdated, so Glanbia partnered with a provider who promised to optimize its transportation operations. (It wasn't long before Glanbia realized its partner wasn't delivering on its promises, so Plan B went into effect.) “We turned to Paragon Software Systems, says Conway.\nParagon had long experience providing route planning and scheduling solutions for grocery stores, food and beverage, retail and field service companies. It set to work right away on Glanbia's operations.\nThe drastic reduction in mileage racked up by Glanbia delivery vehicles didn't occur right away, Conway says. Paragon had to master the intricacies of Glanbia's business and its routing needs – not only the stores and end customers it needed to serve but taking into consideration such mundane things as time lost at rail crossings, school opening times, traffic congestion, and most importantly, the interaction between SAP and Paragon. Once the complete routing picture was formed, paring of routes could begin. Conway estimates that the system has reduced the annual number of routes by 10 percent. In addition, vehicle utilization was improved by 15 percent.\nAn added bonus, which is not to be discounted by stakeholders, is the overall reduction in CO2 emissions of more than 100 tons per year.\nA closer look at Glanbia's transport challenge involves daily planning and optimizing of same-day direct-to-store deliveries that have a narrow two-hour (6 a.m. to 8 a.m.) delivery window, and Cold Box depot deliveries between 4 p.m. and 6 a.m. the following day.\nThere are two networks, Conway says, the dairy operation, which includes milk, and the chilled network, which moves cheese, yogurt, smoothie drinks and nutritionals.\nThe dairy operation runs six days a week. It supplies major retailers and Milk Agents who distribute Glanbia products from the Cold Box network. With more than 4,500 weekly deliveries across 136 routes, and contending with more than 250 individual delivery windows, Glanbia was keen to see how Paragon could improve the operation and improve efficiencies wherever possible, Conway says.\nHaving first set up the base case with information about depots, agents, hauliers and customers to model the current routes and costs, Glanbia was then able to try out various scenarios aimed at improving efficiencies. Several options were tested involving more flexible delivery times for Cold Box locations. The greatest efficiencies came from standardizing Cold Box time windows at a regional level, while combining Cold Box deliveries with time-constrained direct-to-store deliveries. As a result, routing efficiencies yielded a 15 percent gain in vehicle utilization, a 10 percent drop in loads per week – and the dramatic fuel reduction that equates to more than 100 tons of CO2 per year.\n“It’s really important that we make the best use of our vehicle fleet and that loads are maximized and routes optimized,” says Paul Devlin, senior route planner for Glanbia's Consumer Foods Ireland division. “Paragon gives us the power to do that and, when used in conjunction with our SAP business software, has resulted in efficiency gains across our dairy product delivery operation which spans the entire Republic of Ireland.”\nConway describes the confluence of events during the recession as a “perfect storm” for the company. That's why it was mandatory to improve routing and scheduling. But the optimization of the fleet – a reduction of close to 40 percent over the space of five to six years – while very important, is not the only advantage that Glanbia has realized from the partnership.\n“The system is not just a simple routing tool or transport management tool,” he says. “We use it for strategic planning as well. We can create scenarios of how our network could and should look if we were to make changes to the business model. There's a lot of strategic value to it.”\nTimely, incisive articles delivered directly to your inbox.","Using methane leak data developed by EDF to prioritize pipeline replacement efforts, Public Service Electric & Gas (PSE&G), New Jersey's largest utility achieved an 83% reduction of methane emissions by replacing one-third fewer miles of gas lines than that needed to achieve the same result under a business as usual scenario.\nThe effort was part of a three year, $905 million program approved by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities in November 2015.\nMap: Impact of leak flow rate on gas line replacement priority\nEDF quantified the overall methane leak flow rate associated with gas lines in 30 one-square-mile grids that PSE&G had identified for replacement and ranked the grids by that flow rate. The map reflects that PSE&G replaced a relatively small proportion of pipeline miles to achieve big benefits.\nSelect an area to see the ranking before and after incorporating leak flow rates.\nAbout this collaboration\nOver the three year period from 2016 through 2018, PSE&G is planning to replace 270 miles of low-pressure cast iron distribution pipes (\"gas lines\") on their system, out of a total 510 miles of pipeline targeted for replacement over this period. How quickly PSE&G reduces the leak flow rate associated with these gas lines depends on the order in which they are prioritized for replacement.\nThis effort draws on a pioneering collaboration among PSE&G, EDF, and its partners, Google Earth Outreach and Colorado State University. Using cutting-edge spatial analytics methods developed by scientists at Colorado State University and methane sensors specially fitted to a Google Street View car, data indicating the location and relative size of methane leaks from underground lines was gathered in select areas of PSE&G's service territory. PSE&G provided EDF with locations and types of gas lines in areas it was targeting for replacement, making it possible to gather data relevant to the company's gas line replacement efforts.\nFor six months in 2015, the Street View car took millions of individual readings over hundreds of miles of roadway in PSE&G's service territory in New Jersey. Our research team used algorithms developed and tested over several years to assess the vast data stream.\nMap: New Jersey methane leaks\nBy using that data to help plan their gas line replacement efforts, PSE&G was able to reduce methane emissions more quickly, by replacing significantly fewer miles of gas lines than would have been necessary to achieve the same emissions savings without the new data.\nPSE&G divided its service territory into one square mile grids that were proposed for gas line replacements, and ranked each grid (displayed as \"original ranking\" in the map above) using an algorithm that considers safety risks associated with gas line segments. EDF quantified the overall leak flow rate associated with gas lines in a subset of 30 grids, and ranked the grids on this basis. Leak flow rate per mile reflects the volume of methane released per minute for a mile of gas line.\nUsing their original ranking algorithm, PSE&G replaced grids with the highest rankings first, and used EDF's leak flow rate ranking to determine relative priority among grids with comparable rankings. In other words, where grids had similar original rankings, the grid with the higher leak flow rate ranking was prioritized first, locking in reductions in methane emissions more rapidly than otherwise possible, while keeping safety considerations paramount.\nOur readings indicated an average of about one leak for every mile of gas line within grid areas where leak flow rate was quantified.\nCars with methane sensors took readings from May-November 2015. Our map represents a snapshot in time and may not reflect current leaks. A number of the leaks identified through this collaborative project have already been repaired or eliminated through the replacement of cast iron pipes, including all leaks deemed hazardous by PSE&G's existing leak grading system.\nStudies have consistently shown that a few large leaks are often responsible for a substantial portion of emissions from a population of leaks. Here, we observed a similar pattern. The three grids that PSE&G prioritized based on leak flow rate accounted for over 37% of the emissions, but represented only 9% of the gas line miles for which leak flow rates were quantified.\nUsing leak flow rates for prioritization allowed PSE&G to achieve an 83% reduction of methane emissions early on by replacing one-third fewer miles of gas lines than that needed to achieve the same result under a business as usual scenario. This difference is noteworthy considering that the typical cost to replace one mile of gas line on PSE&G's system is $1.5 to $2.0 million.\nThe results from PSE&G's leak quantification and gas line prioritization program have significant implications for the nation's gas utilities:\n- Older pipes made from cast iron and unprotected steel represent the most leak prone pipelines, according to national studies.\n- If PSE&G's ratio of emissions to gas line miles (37% to 9%, respectively) were to be found nationally, prioritizing replacements for 9% of the highest-emitting cast iron gas lines in the nation could result in 12,000 tons of methane emission reductions, which is a comparable climate benefit to taking over 200,000 cars off the roads each year.1\n- Significant methane emission reductions through cast iron distribution pipeline replacement programs can be achieved more quickly by using leak flow rate data to prioritize such programs.\n- Based on a 20-year global warming potential for methane of 84."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:242da927-495f-4205-b986-65f2c7f9bb5a>","<urn:uuid:69138da1-dc0a-44e2-bf0a-eef4b8f2d44e>"],"error":null}

Tilapia come into sexual maturity at about eleven weeks old, which is several months before they are fully grown out (1 lb. or so). Once they reach sexual maturity, they spawn about every five to six weeks so each female can produce 200 to 300 mixed sex fry at each spawn. That’s a lot of fish.\nThese are natural, sexually active fish so raising them means taking responsibility for their offspring or controlling their breeding.

The world’s population is expected to reach 9.6 billion people by 2050 and aquaculture-raised seafood, one of the fastest growing food sectors in the world today, is expected to fill in the supply-demand gap for high-quality, easily digested protein sources (FAO 2018). Aquaculture consumes 70% of total fishmeal production and 73% of total fish oil production (Rabobank 2017).\nOily “forage fish” like sardines, anchovies and menhaden are currently harvested from the wild and used as a component in feed for farmed-raised fish. Fishmeal and fish oil provide the protein and essential fatty acids such as DHA, EPA and ARA that are critical nutrients for aquaculture. The industry has improved efficiency and produces more seafood from the fishmeal and fish oil used, but it still takes roughly half a kilogram of fishmeal to produce one kilogram of salmon (IFFO). A recent study found that if ‘business as usual’ continues, forage fisheries will reach ecological limits by 2037—in 18 years. (Nature Sustainability June 2018).\nThe long-term availability of fishmeal and fish oil presents major supply chain bottlenecks for aquaculture. The industry is projected to contract when wild-caught supplies diminish in 2030 without the availability of substitute ingredient supplies (World Bank 2013). Forage fish are also crucial food for other commercial fisheries like cod, salmon, tuna, as well as marine mammals like whales, dolphins, seals and seabirds (Science2011). If these wild fish populations at the center of the food chain disappear, so will the life that depends on.\nA survey of U.S. residents by Cargill found that 72% of American consumers believe seafood is important to their health and nutrition, and 88% of those same consumers are willing to pay more for seafood that is certified as sustainably and responsibly sourced. (Undercurrent News Aug. 17, 2017).\nThe F3 Challenge\nThe F3 team has launched two X-prize style contests related to innovation in fish-free aquaculture feed. The first contest, F3 (Fish-Free Feed) Challenge, was to innovate and sell the most “Fish Free Feed” in a global competition. One of China’s largest aquaculture and feed producers, Guangdong Evergreen Feed Industry Company, was awarded the $200,100 prize in Oct. 2017 for selling over 85,000 metric tons of fish-free fish feed. In total, over 120,000 metric tons of fish-free feed was sold by the global participants of the F3 (Fish-Free Feed) Challenge during the 16-month contest, which is estimated to have saved over 120 million forage fish from being used as fish feed.\nThe second, F3 Fish Oil Challenge, will award a $100,000+ prize to the contestant who develops and sells the most “fish-free” fish oil. The challenge is intended to accelerate innovation in substitutes to fish oil without the use of marine animal ingredients that can be scaled up for their widespread use in aquaculture operations. The contest will run from Nov. 30, 2018 to Sept. 15, 2019.\nThe global fish oil market is projected to reach over $4 billion by 2020, and the rapidly expanding growing global aquaculture industry is the greatest source of demand for fish oil. Demand for fish oil as an ingredient in dietary supplements and pet food is also on the rise (GrandView Research 2016). The market for fishmeal and fish oil substitutes is large and presents a great market opportunity for enterprising companies, while promoting ocean sustainability.\nF3 Challenge Press Releases\nFeed Innovation Network\nThe Feed Innovation Network (FIN) brings together aquafeed buyers and sellers, fish farmers, innovators and scientists to advance the development and adoption of substitute fish-free ingredients by the aquaculture industry.

While human Olympians have amazing physical abilities, for wild animals strength, speed, agility and endurance mean more than just medals, they are a matter of survival. Here are some animal Olympians with gold medal-worthy abilities.\nThe champion of the animal world may be the spittle bug. This insect is only as long as a pencil eraser but it can jump 115 times higher than its body length. That would be like a person leaping over a 70-story skyscraper.\nGoing the Distance\nChinook salmon may travel more than 2,000 miles as they swim inland from the sea and head up the rivers and streams where they hatched. That’s about the distance between Detroit, Michigan and Los Angeles, California. Then there is the Arctic tern, a bird with the longest migration, traveling from the Arctic all the way to the Antarctic, and back again, each year. They literally migrate from one end of the planet to the other, 50,000 miles in total!The sooty shearwater would take the silver medal with a migrating journey beginning in New Zealand and ending in the North Pacific, 40,000 miles annually. The Pacific gray whale can only hope for the bronze. It’s the longest migrating mammal, traveling a round-trip journey of 12,000 miles.\nWhat animal takes the prize among the best leapers? Most scientists agree: it’s the tiny southern cricket frog, a tree frog living on the ground in many southeastern states. It’s only about an inch long but can jump 62 times its body length.\nThe beaked whale, actually more closely related to dolphins than whales, can dive deeper in the ocean than any other animal. Heading down to depths of 6,230 feet—that’s over a mile deep—it can then hold its breath for 85 minutes before resurfacing for air.\nThe African Bush Baby is a tiny primate and lives in the treetops. It has incredible leaping abilities. As it prowls the tropical forests at night looking for fruits and insects to devour, bush babies can make leaps of 20 feet or more, which is many times their own body length. They are great jumpers and acrobats too as they move in complete silence and can see in almost absolute darkness with the help of their huge eyes.\nRun, Run, Fast as You CanThe fastest mammal on the planet is the cheetah which can run as speeds over 60 miles per hour. But even that doesn’t always ensure that this big cat gets a meal. The gazelles and other small antelope that are the cheetah’s main prey are not as fast as the cat, but they have greater endurance and agility in a high-speed chase and often escape the spotted speedster. The bronze medal would go to the pronghorn, the planet’s second-fastest mammal with a top speed that almost matches the cheetah’s. Both land-cruisers are slower than our gold-medal winner, the peregrine falcon, which reaches speeds in excess of 200 miles per hour when diving after prey.\nFast SwimmersThe killer whale or orca can swim up to 30 or 40 miles an hour. But it usually cruises at much slower speeds, between 2 to 6 miles an hour. The gentoo penguin can’t fly in the air like other birds, but it can fly through the water. It has a perfect shape for swimming and wings that work like paddles. It can reach a speed of 15 miles an hour, three times faster than humans.\nKids can be Olympians right in their own backyards.

{"question":"As someone interested in environmental certifications, how do Coca Cola's water stewardship goals compare to FSC's forest management requirements in terms of verification and oversight?","answer":"Coca Cola's water stewardship program and FSC's forest management requirements both involve external verification, but with different approaches. Coca Cola's system focuses on water neutrality by 2020, using metrics like water volume replenishment (68% achieved through returning 108.5 billion liters), plant assessments (91% completed), and efficiency improvements (8% achieved). Their verification involves tracking specific water-related metrics across their value chain. FSC's oversight system is more documentation-heavy, requiring regular third-party audits by organizations like SmartWord, specific procedural documentation, training requirements, and strict tracking of certified materials. FSC mandates a complete chain of custody verification from forest to final product, with unique tracking numbers for each logo used to enable validity tracking.","context":["Four Ways to Secure Sustainable Sourcing Networks\nFour Ways to Secure Sustainable Sourcing Networks\nMultinationals like Coca Cola, Interface and others are making public commitments to ramp up their sustainability efforts across the supply chain in response to escalating consumer pressure, the “compliance” squeeze and a desire to improve efficiency and reduce costs. They are forging a path to a greener and more profitable future – one that relies on our ability to build a strong supply base of alternative materials that compete with the status quo on price and availability. Here’s the catch: achieving a fully sustainable and transparent supply chain, one that generates no net harm to society and the environment, depends on responsible sourcing going mainstream. Currently companies are facing major barriers to adopting responsible alternatives, like bio-based plastics and FSC-certified fibres, because demand simply isn’t strong enough to put them on a level playing field with conventionally-produced materials. So how do we raise the bar?\n4 Ways to Build a Sustainable Sourcing Network\nTetra Pak cartons are largely composed of paperboard (on average of 74%) so we began our chain of custody journey with paperboard by asking our suppliers to be FSC™ CoC (Chain of Custody) certified, ensuring traceability of the wood fibre from forest to store. Getting 98% of our paperboard suppliers globally FSC CoC certified was a long journey and there is still significant room for improving forest management certification. Tetra Pak established a Procedure for Responsible Sourcing, to only source wood-based products in accordance with the principles of sustainable forest management.\nWhile Tetra Pak works towards establishing a chain of custody for bio-based plastics globally, they are working with Braskem, the world leader for producing environmentally sustainable green polyethylene (Read more about the first biobased plastic capped carton to enter the market). The deployment of bio-based polymers for caps and coatings will expand in tandem with the renewable polymer space and customer demand for green materials.\nIn the meantime, a Code-of-Conduct established in 2010 with Proforest (a natural resources consultant from the UK), frames our commitment to our sustainability vision for using bio based materials. This has enabled our sub-suppliers to meet our Code-of-Conduct accounting for more than 90% of purchased volumes, as verified by external consultants.\nFrom a lifecycle perspective, the extraction and production of aluminum accounts for the greatest single climate impact in Tetra Pak cartons. While no credible chain of custody standards are yet available, Tetra Pak was among the group companies that pioneered the Aluminum Stewardship Initiative (ASI) in 2012 with the support of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). They plan to develop a chain of custody standard that will to be implemented this year.\nAnother ambition is to explore ways to reduce our use of aluminum and develop an alternative barrier to replace aluminum (see world's first plant based beverage carton - Tetra Rex).\n- Establish a Business Code Of Conduct for Suppliers (BSfS)\nA social and environmental code of conduct will drive responsibility throughout the supply chain by holding each supplier to a higher standard with respect to environmental protection in sourcing, manufacturing, distribution and the treatment of workers and communities. To be effective, a code of conduct cannot rely on a signature alone as it requires active and regular engagement through data reporting, third party inspections and audits. For some industries, codes of conduct have been developed through a collaborative process and are now widely used, such as the Higg Index 2.0 for apparel and footwear. For others, credible standards have yet to be developed or are in their infancy with much work still to be done. Implementing BSfS across the value chain helps develop a shared mindset about sustainability issues, drive accountability, strategy and performance, strengthen competitiveness and deliver long term sustainable shared value.\n- Build Upstream Partnerships\nConducting regular assessments of your suppliers’ environmental performance (e.g., greenhouse gas emissions, BOD, VOC, recycling, etc.) and ensuring they meet minimum requirements is the foundation for collaboration. Engage your base material suppliers by working collaboratively to meet your responsible procurement goals. Working directly with your suppliers is a big opportunity to close identified gaps with a continued focus on driving responsible sourcing. In this sense you are committed to ensuring they, at a minimum, adhere to applicable legal requirements and support your corporate goals consistently by meeting and exceeding customer expectations of quality, cost and delivery.\n- Establish a Chain of Custody\nA chain of custody provides transparency from resource extraction to the point of sale and ultimately, it prevents uncontrolled sources from entering the system. Third party management and chain of custody certification is more credible than a self-declaration from suppliers as proof that raw materials came from well-managed areas.\n- Reporting and evaluating your supply chain\nLifecycle Analysis (LCA) of a supply chain is carried out in four distinct stages: 1) Goal and Scope Definition 2) Inventory Analysis 3) Impact Assessment 4) Interpretation. The key purpose of performing life cycle analysis is to evaluate the potential impacts associated with identified inputs and releases, interpreting the final results to make informed decisions and communicate them in a fair, complete, and accurate manner.\nCase Study: Coca Cola’s Water Stewardship\nCoca-Cola understands a number of factors are threatening water security, and clean and accessible water is critical to the health of communities, ecosystems and economic growth and for Coca Cola, water is the main ingredient in its beverages. It is central to their production process and it is necessary for cultivating the agricultural crops used as ingredients.\nAs industry stewards, they have set a goal to return the equivalent volumes of water they use back to communities and the ecosystem by 2020 to become water neutral. In order to do this, Coca Cola established the right partnerships to develop a global system that responsibly manages, replenishes and/or balances the supply throughout their entire value chain. The system is becoming more efficient in its water consumption by reducing the amount used per liter of product, even as production volumes increase. So far, they balanced 68% through replenishing 108.5 billion communities and ecosystems; returned approximately 160 billion litres through treated wastewater; 91% of bottling plants have completed source vulnerability assessments; 99% of bottling plants align with wastewater standards; 68% of plants have begun implementation of source water protection plans; improved their water efficiency by 8%; and introduced a water recovery system to improve water use efficiency by upto 35%.\nAt Tetra Pak, we also realize how important it is to respond to shocks arising from discontinuous feedstock supplies. We must be able to change raw material inputs and find environmental and socially sustainable ways to secure supply and consistently meet customer demand. Our Moving to the Front campaign aims to take responsibility mainstream as we encourage businesses to explore opportunities for adopting renewable materials into their supply chain and to raise demand for stringent resource management standards.\nThis blog initially appeared in CSRwire Talkbalk.","At our January meeting, the Digital Imaging Association featured FSC—Forest Stewardship Council—Certification. The presentation was lead by Vivian Peachey from SmartWood, a company that acts on behalf of the Rainforest Alliance’s forest division to certify companies as FSC compliant, and to police and approve the use of each and every FSC and AFF (Ancient Forest Friendly) logo. Attendees learned what is involved in the certification process, what are the costs and implications to a supplier of printing and related services, and what leads the charge to certification.\nRainforest Alliance’s mission is to protect ecosystems and the people and wildlife that live within them by transforming land-use practices, business practices, and consumer behavior. In Canada, a champion of the cause is Market Initiatives, a Vancouver-based Greenpeace-associated firm, that has endeavours to increase consumer awareness of the reduction in the critical Boreal Forest in North America. Their high impact is evident in their coup of getting JK Rowling to “green-up” the Harry Potter series and put pressure on the big five Canadian banks to lower their impact on the Boreal Forest and Ancient Forests by printing only on FSC certified stock—to name only two examples. The day following the DIA presentation, JK Rowling’s blog on Whattheythink.com stated that when it was found that FSC-certified stock was not available to the selected printer of the Finnish version, Rowling pulled the printing\nIt is consumer pressure that is driving corporations to make the statement that they are environmentally responsible. And you can make the statement of your environmental responsibility by choosing FSC-certified papers and emblazoning the FSC symbol on your printed materials. Print providers can be a part of the group that champions our environmental future by doing what it takes to achieve and retain FSC Certification.\nWhat it is and how it works\nFSC Certification’s Chain of Custody begins with forest management—a systematic and measurable process that is traceable and auditable. Chain of Custody further tracks the product from FSC-certified forests until the final finished product to keep intact the integrity of the FSC seal. Printers, said Peachy, can be assured that the paper supply chain is fairly contained and that most in the chain are certified. The FSC Canada web site—fsccanada.org—has an up-to-date list of FSC-certified papers and printers.\nThe print based chain of custody looks like this:\nForest—Pulp Mill—Paper Mill—Merchant—Printer\nAs you can see, FSC isn’t just about the paper. In order to be able to put an FSC symbol on printed materials, the printer must also hold FSC Certification. FSC requires each link to obtain certification to retain the credibility of the claim of FSC-certified forests as the source. No claim or label is allowed unless the chain is unbroken.\nTo obtain and retain certification requires a system-based approach which includes:\nAssigning people to take responsibility\nDocumenting your procedures\nTraining on procedures\nConfirming that procedures are continually followed\nCreating forms and records to demonstrate that only certified stock has been used throughout a press run. Procedurally, it is absolutely essential to develop a foolproof process so that certified and uncertified stocks are not mixed.\nBe audited regularly by organizations like SmartWord\nFSC actually has three different logos to be used for very specific printed product applications. The symbol that addresses intent fully is the one that shows the product has been printed on paper that can be traced to content from 100% well-managed forests. Another symbol states that the paper used is from mixed sources—a combination of well-managed forests, controlled sources, and recycled wood or post-consumer fiber. The third designates recycled content that supports the responsible use of forest resources. Each logo used has a number unique to the Auditing company and the Printer to enable tracking validity of its use (i.e. Smartwood, Chain of Custody, and the Printer’s own number).\nCost and ROI\nCost to printers of achieving and maintaining certification, advised Peachey, depends on complexity, size, and preparedness. It can range from $1500 to $5000, plus the annual Audit fee. Actively marketing your company as one that is an intrinsic part of the Chain of Custody can lead to the potential of more work from customers who recognize their own responsibility to our environmental future. On a broader scale, this also represents a catalyst for change. Operations are required to make changes to social, economic, and systems issues just as often as environmental issues. Certification also creates a discipline of process control, which assists with efficient production—the ultimate outcome translates to increased corporate pride and increased profits."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:783420cf-012d-491f-bca8-074cc541b910>","<urn:uuid:abf19d87-1bf6-4841-ab3e-02558ffffbbc>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What chemical compounds and processes are needed to create iron gall ink, and what physical properties characterize green vitriol in its pure form?","answer":"Iron gall ink requires four main ingredients mixed in equal measure: oak galls (which release gallic acids and tannins when soaked in water), copperas (iron sulfate/green vitriol), gum arabic (which acts as a binder and improves flow), and water. The mixture must be stirred for two weeks before use. As for green vitriol itself, in its pure form it is known chemically as iron sulfate heptahydrate (FeSO4·7H2O) and appears as a transparent pale green solid with a glassy luster. Like all vitriols, it is water-soluble and forms sulfuric acid solutions. When used in ink, the interaction between the iron sulfate and the gallic acids/tannins produces a black pigment that turns rusty-brown over time.","context":["WHAT IS A VITRIOL?\nSimply put, a vitriol is a metallic sulfate compound, often but not always hydrated. The crystals of most vitriols are glassy and all are soluble in water, making solutions containing sulfuric acid. In fact, the very word vitriol has its origin in the Latin word for glass, vitrum.\nOut of the ten or so vitriol compounds, one is common and occurs along faults and oxidized zones in metallic mineral deposits: green vitriol, better known to geologists and miners as the mineral melanterite, or to chemists as iron sulfate heptahydrate, FeSO4·7H2O. Pure green vitriol is a transparent pale green solid. Not surprisingly, it has a glassy luster just like broken glass.\nOn the surface of the earth, green vitriol that is most common form of vitriol. As the mineral melanterite, you can find it at most iron, zinc, lead, copper and other metallic mineral deposits. These mineral deposits bearing melanterite will all have the following properties in common: iron, sulfur in some form and lots of oxidation. You need all three to make melanterite.\nFind a fault in a mine or find a place where there is water seepage in or next to a metallic mineral mine and that’s where you’ll probably find melanterite. Why? Well, for three reasons.\n- The first is the presence of the common sulfide minerals which occur in many mineral deposits. Pyrite, also known as iron sulfide, FeS2, or as fool’s gold, is a good example of a common sulfide mineral. Sulfide minerals provide green vitriol with the sulfur it needs to form.\n- The second reason is water, which prefers to travel along joints, fractures and faults in rocks. The thing about water is that it is rich in oxygen and lots of oxygen is required for the iron and sulfur in rocks to be oxidized.\n- The third reason is the abundance of iron. Iron is everywhere waiting to be oxidized. Iron is the fourth most-abundant element in the earth’s crust. The abundance of iron is the reason that most metallic mineral deposits have a cap or “gossan” of oxidized-iron minerals in the form of limonite, a rust-colored melange of various oxidized iron compounds. You can often find melanterite in gossans if the climate isn’t too dry. You can also find melanterite in streams with acid mine drainage or on tailings piles rich in limonite or along seeps and faults inside, on top of, or next to old mines.\nAnother name for green vitriol and one that all of nineteenth or earlier English-speaking ancestors would have known was copperas. Along with alum, copperas was one of the essential raw materials of the pre-industrial world.\nThe Uses of Green Vitriol\nGreen vitriol – or copperas, if you prefer – was formerly used for all sorts of things and is still used today. In the Middle Ages, it was the starting material to make early formulations of sulfuric acid. It should not be a surprise that the old pre-industrial name for sulfuric acid was oil of vitriol.\nGreen vitriol was also used as a leather dye commonly sold as shoemaker’s black. In addition, it was utilized as a mordant to fix dyes for the coloring raw cloth – and it retains that use to this day. It was an ingredient in several black ink recipes from antiquity to the early twentieth century. In leather dye and in oak gall ink, the soluble iron from the green vitriol would react with the tannic and gallic acids in the leather or proto-ink solution, respectively, to form iron tannate and iron gallate, both of which are black.\nModern uses of this chemical compound include as a supplement for treating anemia, as a preventative medicine for constipation, as a water treatment to prevent eutrophication, as a fertilizer and lawn conditioner (often bagged and sold as copperas), and as a reducing agent in environmental remediation to reduce chromium VI to less toxic forms. Because of its ready solubility and its power as a reducing agent, it is widely used in many industrial processes.\nMaking Green Vitriol\nThe easiest and most ancient way to make green vitriol is to evaporate naturally-occurring spring water that was saturated with iron sulfate. As unlikely as this may sound, evaporating such saturated waters from springs or from mine drainage waters was described by the first-century AD Roman encyclopedist Pliny the Elder. Such waters still exist today, though I’m not sure anyone is using them for producing modern chemicals for sale. I’ve personally observed such waters precipitating sulfates in the California Coast Ranges.\nAs an example, here’s a photo I took while working at a Superfund site that shall remain nameless. The tank shown below collected the drainage of an inactive mine before it was piped into a treatment plant. The pH of this saturated solution was less than one. One of the folks I worked with on this project actually had to invent a test to measure pH less than zero in order to test some of the waters at this site. This stuff was acid mine drainage on steroids, the worst of which was later shown to be the most acidic fluid discovered on earth.\nI grabbed a sample of the mine drainage in the tank and took it home with me, where I allowed it to evaporate. I got lovely green crystals of green vitriol as a result. I then used my green vitriol to dye some leather black for some reenactment stuff that I do as a hobby.\nThe next method for making green vitriol is to collect rocks rich in both iron and sulfur, like pyrite which is FeS2. The starting rocks are broken up and soaked, and the solutions are drawn off and allowed to evaporate, thus congealing vitriol crystals. Up into the nineteenth century, it was common to lower strips of iron into the sulfate-saturated solutions. As you may recall from the chemistry of the electromotive series from high school chemistry, the insertion of the metallic iron will force the precipitation of any copper out of the solution and provides a preferential site on the iron strips for the precipitation of the iron sulfate heptahydrate crystals. Using iron strips was necessary since copper was and is a common contaminant in metallic mineral deposits.\nAgricola mentions this method in his classic sixteenth century opus on mining and minerals, De Re Metallica. The problem here is that Agricola plagiarized this method from Biringuccio’s Pirotechnia, published a few years before De Re Metallica. Maybe Agricola stole it from Biringuccio because a few years before Agricola published De Re Metallica, Biringuccio has previously plagiarized his earlier work, De Re Fossilium. So one plagiarized the other, who then plagiarized the first in return, which just goes to show you that two wrongs can make a write…\nInteresting Vitriolic Trivia\nWe get the word vitriolic from vitriol’s former association with the production of sulfuric acid.\nIn the later half of the sixteenth century, most green vitriol was made and sold by the Holy See. Newly Protestant England with its huge cloth trade was in trouble because it couldn’t get vitriol to fix cloth dyes in the textile trade that was its life blood. Queen Elizabeth the First supported and encouraged the creation of copperas houses for the manufacture of green vitriol using the exposed rocks method. The starting material was raw copperas – the mineral pyrite – that washed out of the London Clay along beaches in Kent and Essex.\n- Allen, T., Cotterill, M., and Pike, G., 2004, Copperas: An account of the Whitstable Works and the first industrial-scale chemical production in England, Canterbury Archaeological Trust Occasional Paper No. 2., ISBN 1-870545-08-7.\n- Alpers, C.N., J.L.

For some, including myself, there is no better way to glimpse aspects of medieval life than getting lost in the details of illuminations depicting the fashions, pastimes, professions, and objects of every day life. But this post is dedicated to the ink that made the composition of all of those beautiful manuscripts possible.\nYesterday I came across a wonderful little recipe for iron gall ink held in The UK National Archives.\nIron gall ink is a purple-black ink, that turns a rusty-brown colour over time (notice how the ink in the image below looks brown). It was used across Europe until at least the nineteenth century and vast numbers of medieval and renaissance manuscripts were written with it. The transcript of the recipe on the National Archive’s website has a few errors, so here’s my own:\nTo make hynke. Take gall\n& coporos & or vitrial quartryn\n& gumme of eueryche a quartryn\noþer helf quartryn & a halfe\nquartryn of gall more &\nbreke þe gall a ij oþer a iij\n& put ham togedere euery-\nche one in a pot & stere hyt\nij wykys after Ʒe mow\nwryte þer wyþ.\n& yf Ʒe have a quartryn of\neueryche take a quarte of\nwatyr yf halfe a quartryn\nof eueryche þan take half\na quartre of watyr.\nThe recipe instructs that four substances should be mixed together in equal measure: oak galls, copperas (aka iron sulfate, ferrous sulfate or iron vitriol), gum arabic, and water. The mixture should be stirred often over a two week period, after which time it is ready to use.\nWhen soaked in water (or, in some recipes, wine!), the oak galls release gallic acids and tannins, which, when mixed with the iron sulfate, produce a black pigment. The addition of gum arabic acts as a binder to fix the pigment, it helps the ink to flow better and bind to the parchment or paper, and it gives a richer tone to the colour of the ink.\nThough incredibly popular with medieval scribes, iron gall ink deteriorates over time, flaking off and burning through the parchment or paper it’s written on. This is seriously bad news for researchers working with original medieval documents and manuscripts and great care has to be taken to reduce the texts’ exposure to humidity and severe temperature fluctuations. The image below shows just how corrosive the ink can be over time; it has literally eaten through the parchment containing music.\nSo, next time you find yourself captivated by a beautiful medieval illumination, take a few moments to appreciate the text that it accompanies. It wants to be seen – to be read and admired – before it slowly and silently disappears.\nFor more information about Iron Gall Ink, and the implications it has for the long-term preservation of manuscripts, see http://www.irongallink.org\nUPDATE: to include a link to my segment ‘The Ink That Helped to Write the History of Our World‘ in BBC Four’s Oak Tree: Nature’s Greatest Survivor.

{"question":"I'm new to cameras - can someone explain how zone focusing works on street cameras like Leica vs Fuji?","answer":"Zone focusing is a technique that lets you pre-set your camera to keep everything sharp within a specific distance range. On a Leica, you use manual markings on the lens barrel - for example, setting f/11 can keep everything from 3 meters to infinity in acceptable focus. The Fuji X100F achieves this differently using its autofocus system - at f/5.6, focusing at 5 meters (the hyperfocal distance) will keep everything from 2.5 meters to infinity in focus. Both systems let street photographers shoot quickly without having to focus on each shot, but use different methods - the Leica uses mechanical lens markings while the Fuji uses electronic autofocus that can be locked.","context":["Those are the two key words you need to know about focusing with a Leica. If you’ve used a rangefinder before, you already know this; if you haven’t, then read on.\nLeica cameras don’t focus like the DSLRs, ILC (Interchangeable Lens Compacts like the Olympus E-P2), or point-and-shoot digitals that we’re all used to. For one, Leica lenses are all manual-focus lenses. For another, unlike most other digital cameras today, you’re not focusing through the lens (TTL). You’re actually using a separate viewfinder to do the framing and focusing for you.\nTake a look at the image below. It’s a bit hard to capture the view through a Leica’s viewfinder, but see that slightly bright rectangle near the top-left of the circle? That’s your focusing aid. Now, see how the part of the poster that’s in that rectangle is doubled? Well, on a Leica, you adjust the focus ring of the lens till the two images merge into one.\nThat’s the first way to focus a Leica, and when you’re at a wide-open aperture like f/2.5, it’s the surest way to gain critical focus. But that’s not how zone focusing works.\nGoogle defines zone focusing as “A way to focus that utilizes the depth of field scale rather than the actual distance from camera to subject. Zone focusing is most useful for candid, street photography.” To understand this, let’s take a look at the lens barrel of a Leica.\nIn the image below, you’ll see that there are a number of markings on the barrel. First, closest to the business end of the lens, is the aperture adjustment. In this case, we see that it’s set to f/11.\nNext is the focus ring, and this is where that whole zone focusing thing comes in. Using the tab shown in the image below, you adjust that ring to match the markings at the very base of the lens barrel. Those markings, you’ll notice, are marked with the numbers 4, 8, 11, 16. These are aperture markings, and are arranged so that the get progressively higher in number as they move out from the center of the scale.\nIn the image shown, I’ve arranged the focus ring so that the infinity mark on the lens rests over the f/11 marker. Looking at the other side of the scale, we see that the 3-meter mark on the focus scale is right over the f/11 marker.\nThat means that the lens is now focused in a way that all objects between 3 meters and infinity will be acceptably sharp, as long as the aperture remains at f/11.\nThat’s zone focusing for you. You determine your zone of coverage, the range within which all subjects will be acceptably sharp, then use the markings and the focus ring to set it. If I changed the aperture to f/8, for example, I would get a range of something like just over 3 meters to somewhere short of infinity.\nIs this system precise? No, not if you’re trying to get critical focus on a specific object at a close distance, or if you’re trying to shoot at wide-open apertures. But if you’re a landscape or street photographer, zone focus is your friend. It allows you to quickly raise your camera to your eye and snap off a shot without having to wait till you manually focus your Leica. Set that thing to f/11 and everything from about 10 feet to infinity is acceptably sharp.\nFocusing with the Leica was perhaps one of my challenges. All too often, I was unsure whether I really was getting images that were sharp enough; it took a while to get used to trusting the zone focus system, and even longer to get to a point where I wasn’t constantly peering through the viewfinder and adjusting the focus ring to zero onto a subject, completely changing the focus range I’d set moments ago.\nYet once I got used to it, the use of the Leica as a street shooter’s dream camera started to make more sense. When you use zone focus, it’s just lift, frame, shoot. Assuming you’re not horrible at estimating distances, there’s a pretty good chance that your shot will be spot-on. In the image below, taken in Sausalito, CA, I fixed the aperture at f/16, marked it off so that I had a range of between 2 meters and infinity, and shot away. As you can see, he and the background elements are all in sharp focus.\nAs DSLR shooters, we’ve gotten used to isolating our subjects by shooting with the aperture wide open and blurring the background. Zone focusing doesn’t truly lend itself to shooting wide open, which is why you have to get better at framing your subjects so that even sharp background objects don’t distract from your main subject. I included the photo above precisely because it’s an example of bad framing; the background objects do distract from the main subject.\nIn the end, focusing with the Leica takes a bit of getting used to. What I found most remarkable was that zone focus was a fantastic aid when shooting landscapes. While shooting at Rodeo Beach in the Marin Headlands, I don’t think I touched the focus ring once after I set zone focus.\nZone focus was one of those things that was an “Aha!” moment, as are a lot of things about this camera system. Things that initially don’t make sense suddenly do, and preconceptions that I had going into this project often got broken to pieces, leading to a lot of frustration and angst.\nNext up, The Leica Diary, Part IV – An Unexpected Thing or Two.\nLatest posts by Sohail Mamdani (see all)\n- Field Report: Sony a7RII, a7SII In-Camera S-Log2 4K Samples - March 10, 2016\n- Field Report: Sony a7S II S-Log2 vs S-Log3 Test - January 27, 2016\n- Color Grading Made Eas(ier) with FilmConvert - January 21, 2016","version anglaise – traduction prochaine\nWhen out for street photography, I like to use zone focusing, and set my lens to the hyperfocal distance. With the Fuji X100F, and an aperture of f5.6, the hyperfocal distance is at 5 meters. So if I prefocus my camera to this distance, I know that everything between 2.5 meters and infinity will be in focus.\nThat’s the theory…\nBut when I got the X100F, I had to figure out how to apply this on the field…\nI tried first to use the camera manual focus. But this did not work for me because the focusing ring is very sensitive on the X100F. When the camera was hanging at my neck, the focus frequently changed after a few streets, without me knowing it. And working with the zone focus is a matter of trust and speed… I had to find another way…\nSo here is what I do now : I set the camera to single AF mode, use the AEL/AFL button as a back button and set its lock-mode to switch. This way, when I set the focus with the back button, the focus stays active. The shutter does not refocus when pressed or half pressed. Important detail : I do not enable the AF+MF feature so that the manual focus ring is not active in single AF mode. Otherwise, we are back to the beginning of the story…\nThat’s it ! Before starting to take pictures, I point the focus point to an object that is at the hyperfocal focus distance, and focus on that object with the AE/AFL or whatever the back button is. This locks the focus. The little focus square in the EVF becomes green, and I’m good to go.\nI know that some interactions with the camera will unlock the focus, as for instance displaying pictures, going in the menu or the Q custom settings… This is where becoming friend with the camera comes into play !\nHere are my settings:\nFocus mode : single AF\nAF/MF Setting :\nAF MODE > SINGLE POINT\nAF+MF > OFF\nSet up :\nBUTTON/DIAL SETTING > FUNCTION(Fn) SETTING > AELAFL > AE/AF LOCK or AF LOCK ONLY\nBUTTON/DIAL SETTING > AE/AF-LOCK MODE > AE&AF ON/OFF SWITCH\nPOWER MANAGEMENT > AUTO POWER OFF > OFF\nComing from the Ricoh world where zone focusing is completely another story thanks to the snap mode, I had to dig into the manual and all the options of the X100F in order to become friend with it. I wanted to share !\nThat’s all for today. Enjoy you walks with your X100F buddies ! I think I just fell in love…\nI’ve been shooting a lot now with the Fuji X100, either in urban streetphotography or when traveling. So I thought it’s about time to give you my updates about the back focusing method with this camera.\nAlthough my way of back focusing remains the same, I do not use back focusing any more !\nBackfocusing was my way to shoot sport and quick photography with my old camera buddy which was a Canon 5dM3. It’s been gone for a while now, and and changed my shooting automatics…\nHow do I shoot now ?\nNowadays for streetphotography or when shooting sport photography, I use the camera focusing system and the shutter button. I do not use the back focus button at all. The habit has quickly gone.\nWhy don’t I use back focusing anymore ?\nFor several reasons in fact :\n- Back focusing relies on the single point focus and not on the zone focus. And I noticed that the focusing system is far more accurate with the zone system. So I prefer to stay in a mode where I can use the zone focus, that is either single AF or continuous AF and not manual anymore.\n- Single AF and continuous AF with zone focus are real quick. I’ve got another habit now : I move the focus area with my thumb instead of keeping it on the back focus button.\nWhat about the fuji x-t2 ?\nI do the same with my fuji x100F and the fuji x-t2. That’s real great because the learning curve, in fact the get-the-reflex-back curve is very small…\nHere is a post where I show my setting for streetphotography.\nFAQ about zone focusing\nWhat is zone focus?\nZone focusing is a technique which has been widely used for street photography and reportage. You preset your camera to be reasonably sharp between a distance A and a distance B from you.\nDepending on your camera, the setup for using the zone focus system may vary. I describe in my post how to use zone focusing with the Fuji X systems.\nHow do I calculate the zone focus in streetphotography ?\nFirst you evaluate the distance between you and the subject. The focal length of your lens and camera sensor allow you to calculate at this distance the zone before and the zone after this distance that will be reasonably sharp.\nFor instance, with a Fuji X100F (lens is a 23mm) at f5.6 if you focus at 3m, the zone focus will be between 1,20m and 5,20m.\nDOFmaster is a calculator that will help you find those charts for your lenses.\nOn my smartphone, I use DOF Calculator.\nWhat is the difference between zone focus and hyperfocal ?\nWhen you setup your camera for zone focusing, you select an aperture and choose a focus distance which give you an area where subjects will be acceptably sharp. For instance between 3 and 5 meters from you.\nWhen you setup your camera with the hyperfocal, you select an aperture and a focus distance equal to the hyperfocal, which will give all subjects between half the focus distance and infinity reasonably sharp."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:21cd93dd-fdc0-424b-b0d7-69d14c66637e>","<urn:uuid:a05ff9fd-7b41-4ac0-87a7-a7ced3215dd3>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I'm a student of film studies and I'd like to know how fear and instability are portrayed differently in traditional narrative films versus montage sequences?","answer":"Fear and instability are portrayed differently through these two approaches. In traditional narrative films, fear is depicted as a fundamental motive of human existence, often shown through linear storytelling that emphasizes how fear preserves power structures and government control. In contrast, montage sequences handle instability by breaking down time and space through techniques like news-headline montages, photo-montages, and repetitive event sequences. These montage techniques effectively convey the inherent instability of the world by fragmenting and condensing time, reinforcing the scientific principle that instability is fundamental to existence and that all attempts to create artificial stability will eventually fail.","context":["Film director Sergei Loznitsa compares cinema with sculpture: \"The rock is the idea, which you work on step by step, and throw away the unnecessary parts. The same is with cinema, where the most important thing is the idea. Then come the scenes, characters, heroes.\"\nLoznitsa, Belarusian by origin but having studied in the Ukraine and living in Germany, is a favorite and expected guest at international film festivals. A few years ago, his feature debut My Joy with its innovative structure and saturation of depressive reality caused waves. The film received many awards, including the Silver Apricot Special Prize at the 7th Yerevan Golden Apricot International Film Festival. This year, Loznitsa's film In the Fog was awarded the Grand Prix at the Golden Apricot, after receiving the FIPRESCI prize at Cannes.\nPrior to making films, Loznitsa, a mathematician and engineer by profession, was involved in the development of expert systems and artificial intelligence at the Institute of Cybernetics in Kiev. He makes films according to the rules of mathematic formulas — clearly and accurately. And in the outcome, the viewer is left with surprising heated and mixed reactions. The language of Loznitsa's cinema might terrify and despair viewers into the abyss (as in My Joy) or remind one of the attraction of classic analytical cinema (as In the Fog, which raises the issue of man staying in war), but it definitely doesn't leave anyone indifferent.\nLoznitsa is a cold and meticulous filmmaker, who gives a preference not to the linear development of the story itself but in the study of the environment. \"For me, it's not death that's important, but the question of how death perceives the surroundings,\" he says, commenting on one of the most striking parts in In the Fog — mass murder. For 11 years Loznitsa tried to bring Vasil Bykaŭ's 1989 novel of the same name to the screen, confident that aggression and the inner readiness to kill a man are at the heart of war. And this subject is quite current today.\nWith My Joy, it seems you tried to break free from traditional dramaturgy and you created the film anew. While In the Fog turned out to be a film that develops according to classic rules, where real (in the classic sense) heroes live.\nThere was no hero as such in the film My Joy; he was simply a guide in the space. The film depicted a space, the structure of which falls apart when social ties are broken — trust disappears and instead there is animosity and aggression… While the main character in In the Fog is a hero, who makes a decision and takes action. Yes, to some extent, it's an epic story with a classic structure, the center of which is the hero's fate. In this film, I'm creating the story — not dismantling it.\nI'm sure that the pillars of education for any person are mathematics and music\nFlows of information have become extremely accelerated. How does that impact man's self-awareness?\nI won't be revealing a secret if I say that every second of our lives is surrounded by flows of information. And their effect depends specifically on people. It's been a long time that I, for example, haven't watched television (it simply doesn't interest me); I don't read newspapers (with the rare exception); and I view the Internet mainly as a gateway to a vast amount of literature. I often buy books online.\nAnd is cinema changing under these circumstances? One view holds that films are mostly becoming audiovisual products.\nI don't agree with that view — cinema, as well as painting, literature, music and architecture are firstly embodied ideas. And if ideas exist then that already is a creation.\nThe spread of digital tools made making films easier. But did this help, in fact?\nFilm is an illusion, and much depends on good quality images. If you want a good image, good audio and good acting, then you won't shoot a film with a mobile phone. Finances and good equipment are important in film. At the end of the day, film is based on a completely different perception. Of course, Beethoven's symphony can be played also on an instrument with one string but it will be a completely different piece of music.\nResources are important because they enable [us to do things]. Money is feasibility, nothing more, since mastering the language is necessary in order to create.\nYou said that television for the most part changed the language of film. What happened?\nWhen television became the main commissioner of films, the language of films essentially changed. TV channels began to dictate what they wanted. And that was mainly largeness. Generally, largeness (greatness) is an element of film language, but imagine there exists a processor and suddenly one of its elements begins to dictate to the processor — say, the cord. This demanding cord wants the calculation rules to be amended hereafter or, for example, the number of registers. It's simply not possible. But this is pretty much what's happening with our cinema. I call this incompetent interference. But what to do? This is how it is.\nWe have to get accustomed to the thought that the flows surrounding us which are called life are constantly changing. And any attempt to block those flows will always fail\nTelevision (video) not helps but interferes with film, since it doesn't allow working with long and overall shots. Video likes big shots while film avoids these.\nYou're a master of long film shots; don't you think that the slow, \"flowing\" film pace is often not perceived by audiences accustomed to the speed of short clips?\nI strongly disagree with this idea. Next to fast films full of 3,000 edited scenes are many almost \"unbearable\" films of long shots. And they are magnificent films where the depth and value of a shot is felt.\nTo tell the truth, the phrase \"clips thinking\" for me is incomprehensible. Does, for example, Artavazd Peleshyan, whose films have a very fast pace, think in clips? After all, if there's thought then it doesn't matter how it is. The important thing is that there's thought.\nRussia's influence grows daily in Armenia. And to put it mildly, not all Armenians are pleased by this since Russia is not one of the best examples to emulate. In your opinion, how will Russia (and presumably Armenia) look like in the coming 10 years?\nOhhh [laughs]! Everything is so unpredictable in Russia right now that it's impossible to make any kind of logical forecast. In any case, the situation in Russia today doesn't differ in any way from the situation in 1917, 1930, 1940, and so on, and so on. This is one line, which is still ongoing. If we examine events with historical forecasts and place them on one line, we'll be convinced that from the point of view of ideas and nature nothing new has appeared. Nothing.\nWill there be something new 10 years later? I don't know. But if this constant process of \"nothing new\" continues, only the degree of \"nothing new\" will change — essentially, it will remain the same. If we compare, for example, Soviet and modern Russian cinema we'll see many similarities. But the degree of decline and decay of cinema today is incomparably great. Probably it's the same situation in any sector.\nPolitics often suddenly and sharply infringe upon a creator's life. You, it seems, are able to refrain from the political arena.\nPolitics are not politicians but people. Politicians are in the arena only because people think like that. And this is where the problem lies. We can criticize politicians or scream that they have to leave, but what can we do about people? We can't change the way they think with one move or one click, can we? They will continue to think the same way as they have done for years. And they'll make the same mistakes.\nPeople will continue to think the same way as they have done for years. And they'll make the same mistakes\nNationalist ideas are often built on fear. I think, in both Russia and Armenia, this is the case: the authorities say, elect us or things will be bad. Stability will be undermined, for example…\nThe idea of instability as the cornerstone of the world's existence has long been proven. 1977 Nobel Prize in Chemistry laureate Ilya Prigogine proved that the world is from the start unstable. So the conservative idea of stability is deeply flawed. We have to get accustomed to the thought that the flows surrounding us which are called life are constantly changing. And any attempt to block those flows won't be successful and will always fail.\nYou can, of course, create a situation of degradation, which will leave the illusion of stillness/quiet/composure, but all the same, that situation will explode sooner or later and will lead to far worse consequences than can be predicted. This is the most important conclusion, which is made by chemistry, physics and any science in general. This conclusion is known but accepting it is difficult. It's a question of consciousness.\nThe fear factor is very clear. Fear is one of the main motives of man's existence. All government is built and survives on fear. And if the balance of fear and agreement is preserved then government is also preserved. But if fear begins to surpass the intrinsic agreement (we withstand the government only because we fear it) then the government collapses.\nYou know, it always interested me — what will happen after? Say, the government collapsed. We can't sit around and wait for manna, can we? I think the source of manna is man; more accurately, each person's worldview. Apart from ourselves, no one can give us anything. We ourselves create ourselves. From above it's easy to blame people, but to understand that government is an ethereal substance is difficult. It is this awareness that is absent in Russia and in Armenia — and everywhere in general. Even Germany's and France's problems are internal. To save man he has to change inwardly. And education is the only road to salvation.\nI'm sure, as well, that the pillars of education for any person are mathematics and music.\nInterview conducted by Nune Hakhverdyan.","Editing – Montage (Part 2)\nLet’s now get into the heart of the topic: montage for condensing time and space. After introducing montage as a way to display methodical actions, we will now review how this storytelling technique can help depicting trips and territorial expansions, the passing of time, its effects on characters and their relationships, and so on.\nMontages are especially effective at shrinking long journeys down to short sequences. Ironically, paring down a trip to a variety of stages conveys a sense of length and duration — for example in Spartacus (S. Kubrick, 1960). Alternating between scenery shots and character shots yields a more subjective approach, as we experience the trip through the characters’ eyes — e.g. in Gandhi (R. Attenborough, 1982).\nThese kinds of montages are commonly used as opening titles. Most often, the film begins in medias res and the credits montage starts right after the introductory action scene, as in Willow (R. Howard, 1988) and Silverado (L. Kasdan, 1985). Note how music binds completely unrelated shots into a consistent sequence, which is key to conveying the right feeling.\nMore elaborate montages frequently resort to maps as guiding threads, from trip to territorial expansion sequences. A map is usually superimposed to the action, combined with all kinds of effects like place names popping up — as in Robin Hood (R. Scott, 2010) — or a projected track line following through — as in Raiders of the Lost Ark (S. Spielberg, 1981). Again, music is almost ubiquitous in this kind of montages.\nPassing of time\nLikewise, speeding up time with a montage of selected moments effectively conveys a sense of duration. In Conan the Barbarian (J. Milius, 1982), the passing of time is suggested by alternating character shots and time-context shots in a montage sequence. In Rumble Fish (F. F. Coppola, 1983), the passing of time is suggested by a montage of stretching-shadow shots in quick motion.\nInstead of conspicuously resorting to symbolic time-context shots, montages often emphasize the evolution of a situation over time with short ‘slice-of-life’ sequences. For instance, in Four Minutes (C. Kraus, 2006), such montage is used to bring out the evolution of Jenny as she gets more serious about practicing piano in prison. In The Blue Lagoon (R. Kleiser, 1980), an amazing ‘slice-of-life’ montage follows Richard and Emmeline as they transition from childhood to adolescence.\nWhen focusing specifically on the evolution of a relationship, the ‘slice-of-life’ montage can be derived to display repeatedly the same character configuration in different contexts. This technique has been used in Marnie (A. Hitchcock, 1964) to show the lack of evolution of Mark’s and Marnie’s relationship during their fake honeymoon, and in Full Metal Jacket (S. Kubrick, 1987) to show the positive effects of Pyle’s instruction by Joker over time (Note: this movie clip is a trimmed down version of the original sequence). Note how dialogs makes music unnecessary in those cases.\nLead-ups and aftermaths\nIn fact, the repetitiveness of an event over time can be emphasized by a montage — which doesn’t mean that the sequences have to look the same. For example, in Perfume: The Story of a Murderer (T. Tykwer, 2006), Grenouille’s killing spree is depicted by a montage of short crime sequences, all staged differently, focusing less and less on abductions, more and more on consequences (read more about repetitive actions).\nMore generally, montages are second to none for transitioning from causes to effects. For instance, photomontages can effectively picture the consequences of an action — as in Run Lola Run (T. Tykwer, 1998) when Lola bumps into a woman whose future gets depicted in a series of snapshots — or an entire movie, as in Midnight Express (A. Parker, 1978) when Billy reunites with his family after spending five years in prison.\nProbably one of the most classic depictions of the aftermaths of an event over time is the ‘news-headline’ montage, in which the consequences of that event are displayed in a series of newspaper headlines, as in A Clockwork Orange (S. Kubrick, 1971) and The Godfather (F. F. Coppola, 1972).\nLong journeys, the passage of time and its effects on characters and their relationships, the aftermaths of one or more repetitive events, they all benefit from montage for its amazing ability to condense time and space. Moreover, sound continuity (e.g. music, voice over, dialog) will always bind the most jarring shots into the most exciting montage sequence.\n- Editing – Montage (Part 1)\n- Editing – Montage (Part 3)\n- Portrait galleries and evocations\n- Time compression and dilation\n- Repetitive actions\n- Multiple angles of the same subject\n- Breaking the 180-degree rule"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:9827dd97-09ba-4cac-a851-a3b59d7c987d>","<urn:uuid:f104cec7-4190-4a52-ba95-a5d3edb73eaa>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Having spotted both birds in wetland areas, could someone explain the key differences in feeding behavior between Lesser Yellowlegs and American Crows when foraging for food?","answer":"Lesser Yellowlegs and American Crows exhibit different foraging behaviors. Lesser Yellowlegs is an active forager that runs in shallow water to catch prey, primarily feeding on aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates, particularly flies and beetles, with occasional consumption of small fish and seeds. In contrast, American Crows are opportunistic feeders that primarily feed on the ground and are known to eat almost anything - from earthworms, insects, and other small animals to seeds, fruit, garbage, and carrion. Crows show more advanced feeding behaviors, such as carrying hard-shelled mollusks high in the air and dropping them on rocks to break them open. They also demonstrate tool use to obtain food and will scavenge at garbage dumps and agricultural fields.","context":["The Lesser Yellowlegs is a graceful, slender, medium-sized shorebird recognized by its bright yellow legs and distinctive tu tu call. It is an active forager, often running in shallow water to catch prey. The breeding range extends from central Canada westward through Alaska and they winter throughout Central and South America, the West Indies, and the southern United States. The Lesser Yellowlegs migrates through Tennessee each spring and fall and is fairly common in appropriate habitat statewide.\nDescription: Medium-sized active shorebird with bright yellow legs, thin neck, long dark bill, an upright stance, and square white rump patch. The body is grey brown on top and white underneath; the neck and breast are streaked with dark brown. In fall and winter, it is grayer overall. Males, females and juveniles are similar in appearance. Bill length is only slightly longer than the length of the head, which is important in distinguishing this species from the Greater Yellowlegs (see below). Distinctive call can also be helpful in identification.\nWeight: 2.8 oz.\nVoice: Flight call is a two-noted short whistled tu tu, typically softer than Greater Yellowlegs. Also commonly gives an alarm call of kleet.\n- Greater Yellowlegs has a slightly upturned bill with a blunt-tip, while Lesser Yellowlegs has a straight, sharp-pointed bill. Lesser's bill is always dark, while Greater's bill is grayish at the base in non-breeding season. Greater Yellowlegs has a proportionally larger bill that is much longer than the length of the head. Voice is best distinguishing character: Greater gives three or four piercing notes, Lesser two rapid, softer short whistles (sometimes or three).\n- Solitary Sandpiper has greenish legs and a barred tail.\n- Stilt Sandpiper is slightly smaller, has greenish yellow legs, and a slightly drooping bill.\nHabitat: Mudflats, sand bars, and lake and pond edges.\nDiet: Aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates, particularly flies and beetles; occasionally small fish and seeds.\nNesting and reproduction: Lesser Yellowlegs has not been documented nesting in Tennessee.\nStatus in Tennessee: Fairly common migrant statewide.

Corvus brachyrhynchos may be distinguished from Common Ravens by their smaller size, their straight to barely rounded tails (seen from under, ravens’ tails are wedge-shaped), and their higher-pitched calls.\nAmerican Crow profile\nRavens even have more large bills and longer, shaggier feathers at their throats. American Crows are bigger than the intently associated Northwestern Crows however have higher-pitched voices.\nAmerican Crows are acquainted over a lot of the continent: massive, intelligent, all-black birds with hoarse, cawing voices. They are widespread sights in treetops, fields, and roadsides, and in habitats starting from open woods and empty seashores to city facilities.\nThey normally feed on the ground and eat virtually something – sometimes earthworms, bugs, and different small animals, seeds, and fruit but in addition rubbish, carrion, and chicks they rob from nests.\nTheir flight fashion is exclusive, a patient, methodical flapping that’s not often damaged up with glides.\nAmerican crows are native to the Nearctic area throughout North America. They may be discovered within the decrease a part of Canada and thru the continental United States.\nThe American crow is a big passerine bird species of the family Corvidae. It is a standard bird discovered all through a lot of North America. American crows are the New World counterpart to the carrion crow and the hooded crow.\nAlthough the American crow and the hooded crow are very comparable in size, construction and behavior, their calls are totally different. The American crow, nonetheless, occupies the identical function that the hooded crow does in Eurasia.\nFrom beak to tail, an American crow measures 40–50 cm (16–20 in), virtually half of which is tail. Mass varies from about 300 to 600 g (11 to 21 oz). Males are usually bigger than females. The most traditional call is CaaW!-CaaW!-CaaW!.\nThe American crow is all black, with iridescent feathers. It seems very similar to different all-black corvids.\nAmerican Crows are very social, typically forming flocks within the hundreds. Inquisitive and typically mischievous, crows are good learners and problem-solvers, typically raiding rubbish cans and choosing over discarded metal containers.\nThey’re additionally aggressive and sometimes thrust back bigger birds together with hawks, owls, and herons.\nAmerican crows are widespread, widespread, and prone to the West Nile virus, making them helpful as a bioindicator to trace the viruses unfold. Direct transmission of the virus from crows to people is unimaginable.\nAmerican Crows are widespread birds of fields, open woodlands, and forests. They thrive around people, and also you’ll typically discover them in agricultural fields, lawns, parking heaps, athletic fields, roadsides, cities, and city rubbish dumps.\nAmerican Crow Description\nAdult American crows are utterly blackbirds weighing on average 450 g. The feathers have a shiny and barely iridescent look. Crows have robust legs and toes.\nThe bill can also be black with a slight hook on the end. Stiff bristles cover their nostrils. About 20% of male birds are barely bigger than females.\nYoung crows are about the identical size as adults, however, have blue eyes and pink contained in the mouth. Both the eyes and mouth darken because the bird turns into an adult.\nIn younger birds, the ends of tail feathers are symmetrical and are more pointed than the huge, flat-ended feathers of adults.\nThe wing and tail feathers of the younger can turn fairly brown and ragged by means of the first winter and spring and solely turn into darker and shinier-like adult feathers after the first molt.\nAmerican crows are sometimes confused with widespread ravens. American crows may be distinguished from widespread ravens (Corvus corax) most simply by size (ravens are a lot bigger), by voice (ravens are hoarser), by the bill (ravens have heavier, “roman-nosed” bills), and by the form of the wings and tails, which come to a degree in ravens however not crows.\nCrows are regarded as amongst our most intelligent birds, and the success of the American Crow in adapting to civilization would appear to verify this.\nDespite previous makes an attempt to exterminate them, crows are more widespread than ever in farmlands, cities, and even cities, and their distinctive caw! is a well-recognized sound over a lot of the continent.\nSociable, particularly when not nesting, crows might collect in communal roosts on winter nights, typically with hundreds and even tens of hundreds roosting in a single grove.\nThe oldest recorded age of a wild American crow is 14 years and seven months.\nA big, long-legged, thick-necked bird with a heavy, straight bill. In-flight, the wings are pretty broad and rounded with the wingtip feathers unfold like fingers. The quick tail is rounded or squared off on the end.\nAmerican Crows are all black, even the legs and bill. When crows molt, the old feathers can seem brownish or scaly in comparison with the shiny new feathers.\nAmerican Crow Distribution and Habitat\nThe range of the American crow now extends from the Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic Ocean in Canada, on the French islands of Saint-Pierre and Miquelon, south by means of the United States, and into northern Mexico.\nThe improvement in timber all through the Great Plains in the course of the previous century as a consequence of hearth suppression and tree planting facilitated range expansions of the American crow in addition to range expansions of many different species of birds.\nVirtually all sorts of the nation from wilderness, farmland, parks, open woodland to cities and main cities are inhabited; it’s absent solely from Pacific temperate rain forests and tundra habitat, the place it’s changed by the widespread raven.\nThis crow is an everlasting resident in many of the US, however, most Canadian birds migrate some distances southward in winter. Outside of the nesting season these birds typically collect in massive (hundreds and even thousands and thousands) communal roosts at night.\nWoodlands, farms, fields, river groves, shores, cities. Lives in all kinds of semi-open habitats, from farming nation and open fields to clearings within the woods.\nOften discovered on shores, particularly within the Pacific Northwest, the place the coastal inhabitants were previously thought of as a separate species referred to as “Northwestern Crow.” Avoids sizzling desert zones. Is adapting to cities and even cities, now typically nesting in city parks.\nAmerican Crow Behavior\nAmerican crows have an uncommon social system – they’re cooperative breeders. This implies that they might keep near the place they had been born to assist elevate younger and defend the realm towards predators.\nIt is just not properly understood why these offspring don’t receive mates and lift their very own households, however, pairs with such helpers don’t look more profitable at fledging offspring than these without helpers. Family members typically preen one another (allopreening).\nMost American crows defend massive all-purpose territories. All members of the family help in chasing predators away from the territory.\nSome people might stay on their territories in the course of the winter, even when they take part in winter roosts or massive flocks looking for meals.\nWinter roosting behavior begins in autumn and peaks in mid-winter. Large numbers of crows, from tens to a whole lot of hundreds, will assemble within the late afternoon hours in a space with massive timber. Often the flock will transfer from this space to a closing roosting space at dusk.\nSome American crows migrate. Researchers have discovered marked crows from southeastern Michigan as far south as Tennessee, however, more typically migrants go shorter distances.\nIn addition to family teams and winter roosts, crows might be part of the 3rd form of the social group referred to as a floater flock. During the breeding season, floater flocks of as many as 50 birds have been noticed.\nFlock members in all probability lack mates; not less than a few of these people additionally spend time on their natal territories as helpers.\nAmerican crow floater flocks haven’t been properly studied however in different species they permit people to roam a space discovering mates or vacant territories whereas staying safely in a gaggle.\nAmerican crows interact in an enchanting behavior referred to as anting. A crow will place itself over an anthill and permit ants to scramble amongst its feathers, or it might decide up an ant and smear its feathers with it.\nAmerican crows are thought of among the many most intelligent birds, although there may be little scientific proof to show this. American crows are resourceful of their meal habits and are extraordinarily tough for researchers to seize in traps.\nAmerican Crow Diet\nOmnivorous. Seems to feed on virtually something it may possibly discover, together with bugs, spiders, snails, earthworms, frogs, small snakes, shellfish, carrion, rubbish, eggs, and younger of different birds, seeds, grain, berries, fruit.\nThe American crow is omnivorous. It will feed on invertebrates of every kind, carrion, scraps of human meals, seeds, eggs and nestlings, stranded fish on the shore, and numerous grains.\nAmerican crows are lively hunters and can prey on mice, frogs, and different small animals. In winter and autumn, the diet of American crows is more dependent on nuts and acorns.\nOccasionally, they are going to go to bird feeders. The American crow is one in every of just a few species of bird that has been noticed modifying and utilizing instruments to acquire meals.\nOpportunistic, shortly making the most of new meal sources. Feeds totally on the ground, typically in timber. Scavenges alongside roads and at dumps.\nWill carry hard-shelled mollusks high in the air and drop them on rocks to interrupt them openly. Indigestible elements of meals are coughed up later as pellets.\nLike most crows, they are going to scavenge at landfills, scattering rubbish within the process. Where obtainable, corn, wheat, and different crops are favorite meals.\nThese habits have traditionally brought on the American crow to be thought of as a nuisance. However, it’s suspected that the hurt to crops is offset by the service the American crow offers by consuming insect pests.\nAmerican Crow Communication\nAmerican Crows are extremely vocal birds. Unlike most different songbirds, men and women have identical songs. They have a posh system of loud, harsh caws which can be typically uttered in the repetitive rhythmic collection.\nShorter and sharper caws referred to as “kos” are in all probability alarm or alert calls. Slightly longer caws are in all probability utilized in territorial protection, and patterns of repetition could also be matched in what could also be thought of as “countersinging,” or exchanges between territorial neighbors.\n“Double caws,” quick caws repeated in stereotyped doublets, might function a call-to-arms vocalization, alerting family members to territorial intruders. Sometimes pairs or family members coordinate their cawing in a duet or refrain. Harsher cawing is used whereas mobbing potential predators.\nAmerican Crow Reproduction\nAmerican crows are socially monogamous cooperative breeding birds. Mated pairs kind massive households of as much as 15 people from a number of breeding seasons that stay collectively for a few years.\nOffspring from an earlier nesting season will normally stay with the family to help in rearing new nestlings. American crows don’t attain breeding age for not less than two years. Most don’t depart the nest to breed for 4 to 5 years.\nThe nesting season begins early, with some birds incubating eggs by early April. American crows construct cumbersome stick nests, almost at all times in timber however typically additionally in massive bushes and, very not often, on the ground.\nThey will nest in all kinds of timber, together with massive conifers, though oaks are most frequently used. Three to 6 eggs are laid and incubated for 18 days. The younger are normally fledged by about 36 days after hatching.\nPredation primarily happens on the nest site and eggs and nestlings are continuously eaten by snakes, raccoons, ravens, and home cats.\nAdults are much less continuously predated, however face potential assault from great horned owls, red-tailed hawks, peregrine falcons, and eagles.\nThey could also be attacked by predators equivalent to coyotes or bobcats at carrion when incautious, though that is even rarer.\n4-6, typically 3-9. Dull blue-green to gray-green blotched with brown and grey. Incubation might be largely or totally by a feminine, about 18 days. Young: Fed by each parent and typically by “helpers.” Young depart nest about 4-5 weeks after hatching.\nFed by each parent and typically by “helpers.” Young depart nest about 4-5 weeks after hatching.\nAmerican Crow Nesting\nIn courtship on the ground or in a tree, male faces feminine fluffs up body feathers partly spread wings and tail, and bows repeatedly whereas giving a brief rattling song.\nMated pairs perch shut collectively, touching bills and preening one another’s feathers. Breeding pair could also be assisted by “helpers,” their offspring from earlier seasons.\nNest site is in a tree or massive shrub, 10-70′ above the ground, normally in the vertical fork or at the base of the branch towards the trunk. Rarely nests on the ground or on constructing a ledge.\nNest (constructed by each sex) is a big cumbersome basket of sticks, twigs, bark strips, weeds, and dirt, lined with softer materials equivalent to grass, moss, plant fibers, feathers.\nAmerican Crow Facts\nAmerican Crows congregate in massive numbers in winter to sleep in communal roosts. These roosts may be of some hundred as much as two million crows.\nSome roosts have been forming in identical basic space for properly over 100 years. In the last few long times, a few of these roosts have moved into city areas where the noise and mess trigger conflicts with people.\nYoung American Crows don’t breed till they’re not less than two years old, and most don’t breed till they’re 4 or more. In most populations, the younger assist their parents to elevate younger for a couple of years. Families might embody as much as 15 people and include younger from 5 totally different years.\nIn some areas, the American Crow has a double life. It maintains a territory year-round wherein the whole prolonged family lives and forages collectively. But throughout a lot of the year, particular person crows depart the house territory to affix massive flocks at dumps and agricultural fields, and to sleep in massive roosts in winter.\nFamily members go collectively to the flocks, however, don’t stay collectively within the crowd. A crow might spend a part of the day at dwelling with its family on the town and the remaining with a flock feeding on waste grain out within the nation.\nDespite its tendency to eat roadkill, the American Crow is just not specialized to be a scavenger, and carrion is barely a really small part of its diet.\nThough their bills are massive, crows can’t break by means of the pores and skin of even a grey squirrel. They should anticipate one thing else to open a carcass or for the carcass to decompose and turn into tender sufficient to eat.\nCrows are artful foragers that typically observe adult birds search out the place their nests are hidden. They typically steal meals from different animals.\nA bunch of crows was seen distracting a river otter to steal its fish, and one other group adopted Common Mergansers to catch minnows the geese had been chasing into the shallows.\nThey additionally typically observe songbirds as they arrive from a long migration flight and seize the exhausted birds. Crows additionally catch fish, eat from outside dog dishes, and take fruit from timber.\nCrows typically make and use instruments. Examples embody a captive crow utilizing a cup to hold water over to a bowl of dry mash; shaping a chunk of wooden after which sticking it right into a gap in a fence put up in the hunt for meals, and breaking off items of the pine cone to drop on tree climbers close to a nest.\nThe oldest recorded wild American Crow was not less than 16 years Four months old when it was recaptured and rereleased throughout a banding operation in New York. A captive crow in New York lived to be 59 years old.\nWhere to search out\nAmerican Crows are pretty widespread and conspicuous all through many of the decrease 48 states outdoors the southwestern deserts.\nYou can discover American Crows by trying round open areas close to patches of woods, or in human-modified landscapes like city parks, rubbish dumps, campgrounds, manicured lawns, athletic fields, cemeteries, and parking heaps. Listen for his or her loud cawing.\nCrows have been killed in massive numbers by people, each for recreation and as a part of organized campaigns of extermination.\nAmerican crows are protected internationally by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918. Despite makes an attempt by people in some areas to drive away or remove these birds, they continue to be widespread and quite common.\nIn 2012, BirdLife International estimated the number of American crow inhabitants to be around 31 million. The massive inhabitants and huge range outcome within the least concern standing for the American crow, which means that the species is just not threatened.\nOther Recommended Articles\n- Arctic Tern (Sterna paradisaea) Bird Facts\n- Great Skua (Stercorarius skua) Bird Profile\n- Parasitic Jaeger (Stercorarius parasiticus) Profile\n- Common Eider (Somateria mollissima) Bird Profile\n- Sabine’s Gull (Xema sabini) Facts and Description\n- Greater scaup (Aythya marila) – Bluebill Facts\n- Red-throated Loon (Gavia stellata) Bird Profile\n- Northern Fulmar (Fulmarus glacialis) Bird Profile\n- Northern Gannet (Maurice busanus) Bird Profile\n- Wilson’s Storm Petrel Bird Fact and Profile\n- Atlantic Canary Bird Facts and Profile\n- Harz Roller Canary Bird Facts and Information\n- Red Factor Canary Facts, Profile, and Information\n- Rainbow Budgie Bird Profile and Information\n- Blue Budgie Bird Facts, Color and Information\n- Buff Orpington Chicken Eggs Rooster Hen For Sale\n- Plymouth Rock Chicken – Partridge, Barred, White, Blue, Silver\n- Barred Rock Plymouth Chickens Facts and Information\n- White Orpingtons Rooster Hen Chicken Breed\n- Brown Egg Layer – Chickens that Lay Brown Eggs"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:e48d06f3-6c8e-4dd0-ab18-3b93d2d8febc>","<urn:uuid:ff2f0fcf-fb9c-4292-b653-08c44b91bb7b>"],"error":null}

Its unique shape, structure, and design have made it every tourist’s dream, you surely can’t say you’ve been to Paris without visiting this amazing piece of French engineering.\nIn this post, we’ll be discussing some interesting facts about this gigantic metal tower that may just surprise you.\n1. It Was Completed in Just 26 Months.\nConsidering how big and complicated the tower’s design looks, it was completed relatively fast. It took the workers 2 years, 2 months, and 5 days to complete it. That is about 26 months in total.\n2. Gustave Eiffel Didn’t Actually Design It\nWhile the tower was named after Gustave Eiffel- the owner of the engineering firm that built it, it was actually designed by Maurice Koechlin and Émile Nouguier- two engineers that worked for Eiffel’s company.\n3. Its Design Was Inspired by The Latting Observatory in New York City\nEiffel admitted that the tower’s design was American-inspired. The Latting Observatory was only around for a few years- between 1853 and 1856. It was made primarily of wood and was destroyed by a fire that started in a nearby shop.\n4. It Was Built As The Entrance to The 1889 World’s Fair\nThe tower was purposefully built as the centerpiece of the 1889 world’s fair to mark the 100th year anniversary of the French revolution. It was also built to be the tallest man-made structure at the time.\n5. It Was The Tallest Building In The World For Decades\nWhen it was constructed, the tower stood at 300 meters (984 feet)- the equivalent of a 75-story building. It was the tallest man-made structure on earth, overtaking the Washington Monument which was about half the Eiffel Tower’s height. It maintained this record for 41 years until 1930 when the Chrysler Building in New York was completed.\n6. Some Extra Height Was Added Decades Later\nThe tower is a little bit taller than what it was initially. In the 1950s, broadcasting antennae were added to its top and some extra work was done in the year 2000 that increased its height by 24 meters (79 feet). Its current height is 324 meters (1063 feet).\n7. It Was To Be Brought Down After 20 Years\nThe building was permitted to stay only for 20 years, after this, it was to be brought down. In fact, part of the design requirements from the city’s officials was that it should be easy to dismantle. The city decided against bringing it down when it had become a prominent symbol, and a useful communication tower.\n8. Gustave Eiffel Owned The Rights To Its Commercial Exploitation For 20 Years\nBecause Eiffel footed a huge chunk of the tower’s costs, he was given the commercial rights to this building for 20 years, after which it became the property of the City of Paris.\n9. It is The Most Visited Paid Monument in The World\nAbout 7 million people pay to visit this iconic mega-structure every year. Out of this figure, about 75% are foreigners. Also, more than 300 million people have visited it since it was first commissioned in 1889. This gives some insight as to how popular the tower is. Here are some tips to help you save money on a trip to Paris.\n10. There Were Protests Against its Erection\nNot everyone agreed with the city’s decision to permit the tower’s construction, in fact, prominent architects, painters, artists, and sculptors protested against it. In a publication, the tower was likened to the tower of Babel and even to a black factory chimney. There were huge concerns that it will dwarf other important artistic French expressions with its huge size and metallic design.\n11. It has 3 Floors Available To Visitors\nThe Eiffel tower is not just a huge metal structure, it has three floors that house exhibition rooms, restaurants, shops, and even a special room that recreates Eiffel’s office with wax figures of him, Thomas Edison and Claire- Eiffel’s daughter.\nThe first two floors can be accessed by elevators and stairs while the topmost floor can only be accessed by elevators.\n12. It’s Made of 7,3oo Tons Of Metal\nThe impressive tower is very heavy too. It was constructed with 7,300 tons of puddle iron, 18,038 iron parts, and 2.5 million rivets to put the structure in place. When you add the weight of its extra features like shops, rooms, antennae, and elevators, the combined weight is about 10,100 tons.\n13. It is Hand-Painted Every 7 Years\nOnce in about 7 years, 25 specialists paint the tower by hand. The painting typically takes about 18 months to complete and incredibly involves about 60 tons of paint. This is done to preserve the integrity of the metal and costs about 4 million Euros to accomplish.\n14. It was almost destroyed by Hitler\nDuring the Second World War, during the German occupation, the French resistance cut the cables to the tower’s elevators, making it less accessible to the Germans. When the allies were closing in on Paris, Hitler ordered the German governor of Paris to destroy the tower. Thinking Hitler was insane, the governor- General Dietrich von Choltitz didn’t obey this order.\n15. There Are More Than 50 Replicas Around The World\nThere’s a chance that you might have seen a structure that looks like the Eiffel tower in another city. While most of the replicas aren’t exactly the same design and height, they are usually very similar and on different scales. Popular examples are:\n- Blackpool Tower (UK)\n- Tokyo Tower (Japan)\n- Las Vegas Eiffel Tower (USA)\n- Eiffel Tower of Window of the World (China)\n- Paris, Texas Eiffel Tower (USA)\n- Eiffel Tower- Paris, Tennessee (USA)"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:4797fa35-a9ee-4fae-84fc-8d40ade71c19>","<urn:uuid:e921e7ed-8e3c-4e0f-9331-6f83e8ba7828>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do mold and dust mite allergies compare in terms of home prevention methods?","answer":"Both mold and dust mite allergies require similar home prevention methods focused on controlling moisture and cleanliness. For dust mites, prevention includes using allergen-proof bed covers, washing bedding weekly, maintaining humidity below 40-50%, regular dusting with a damp cloth, and avoiding carpeting in favor of wood/tile flooring. Similarly, mold prevention requires controlling humidity below 50% using dehumidifiers, cleaning wet spots promptly, ensuring adequate ventilation, and keeping bathrooms and kitchens clean and dry. Both conditions benefit from using air conditioners and regular cleaning, though mold specifically requires addressing water leaks and seepage, while dust mite control emphasizes bedding maintenance and dust removal.","context":["What is Dust Mite Allergy?\nDust Mites are very small bugs which get mixed with house dust and feed on dead skin cells which are shed by people. These bugs tend to adapt to virtually all environments and feed on the dead cells that the people shed everyday. Dust Mites thrive in warm temperatures and hence can be found around the beds or in places where woolen clothes are kept. An individual may not be aware of this but it unknowingly inhales waste products of dust mites.\nDust mites may not affect for some time but with repeated exposure the immune system gets triggered and identifies the inhaled waste products of dust mites as invaders and starts to produce antibodies which release chemical called histamines which trigger symptoms like sneezing, watery and itchy eyes which are classic symptoms of Dust Mite Allergy.\nWhat Causes Dust Mite Allergy?\nDust Mite Allergy is caused by the action of the immune system of the body. When an individual is repeatedly exposed to waste products of dust mites which can be present anywhere in the house, the immune system starts to identify those substances as harmful for the body and starts producing antibodies to fight the substances. This results in releasing of chemical called histamine which in turn produces symptoms of itchy eyes, runny nose, and sneezing which are the classic presenting features of a Dust Mite Allergy.\nPeople may think that they have a clean house but in fact there may be places where some dirt is still there and that is the breeding ground for dust mites. This is especially under the carpeting, bedding, cushions which all hold moisture from the air and allow these bugs to thrive ultimately resulting in Dust Mite Allergy.\nWhat are the Symptoms of Dust Mite Allergy?\nThe symptoms caused by dust mite allergy may range from mild to severe. some of the symptoms of dust mite allergy are:\n- Runny nose\n- Postnasal drip\n- Itchy skin\n- Nasal congestion\n- Sinus pressure which at times may cause facial pain\n- Water eyes\n- Redness in the eyes\n- Scratchy throat\n- Persistent cough\n- Swollen eyes which may have a tinge of bluish discoloration just beneath the eyes\n- Trouble with sleeping due to the above symptoms.\nIn case if an individual has asthma and additionally has dust mite allergy then apart from the above mentioned symptoms he or she may also experience:\n- Chest pain or tightness\n- Problems with breathing\n- Problems with talking\n- Severe asthma attack.\nHow is Dust Mite Allergy Diagnosed?\nIn order to identify whether an individual has dust mite allergy, he or she needs to consult with an allergist who will perform a series of tests. The best test to identify whether an individual is allergic to dust mites is by performing a skin prick test. In this test, common allergens like products released by dust mites are used and applied to the skin in the arm or the back with tiny punctures made. If an individual has dust mite allergy, he or she will develop hives or a raised bump at the site where the allergen was applied. This will confirm the diagnosis of Dust Mite Allergy.\nWhat is the Treatment for Dust Mite Allergy?\nThere is no cure for allergies but symptoms can be controlled to a large extent by medications and allergy shots but limiting exposure to dust mites is the best way to avoid dust mite allergy. The medications which can used to treat the symptoms of dust mite allergy are:\n- Treating Dust Mite Allergy with Antihistamines: These medications block the production of histamines and hence relieve the dust mite allergy symptoms like nasal congestion, runny nose, and watery eyes. Some of the medications which come under this class are Allegra and Claritin\n- Nasal Corticosteroids: These medications are also quite effective in treating the symptoms of Dust Mite Allergy. Some of the medications which come under this class are Flonase and Nasonex\n- Decongestants: These medications help in clearing the congestion in the nose and get rid of the symptoms of dust mite allergy. Some of the medications under this class are Sudafed and Afrin.\nSome of the other medications that may be used for treatment of symptoms of Dust Mite Allergy are:\n- Cromolyn sodium\n- Allergy shots.\nNasal lavage is also quite an effective way in opening the nasal passages and help with the symptoms of Dust Mite Allergy. This can be done by rinsing the nasal passage with warm water mixed with salt on a daily basis.\nHow to Prevent Dust Mite Allergy?\nApart from these treatments there are also certain preventive measures that you can take top prevent Dust Mite Allergy. These methods are:\n- Use allergen-proof bed covers on the mattress and pillows.\n- Wash all bedding at least once a week. This includes bed sheets, pillow covers, blankets and bed covers. Let them dry in sunlight.\n- Use an air conditioner or dehumidifier so as to keep the relative humidity down to about 40%\n- Buy only washable stuffed toys and wash them often.\n- Dust frequently with a damp towel or mop\n- Clean curtains and upholstered furniture regularly\n- Avoid use of carpeting and try using wood, tile, or vinyl flooring.","We spend up to 90% of our time indoors. So, if you or someone in your family suffers from asthma or allergies, indoor air pollution may be the cause. In fact, the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America (AAFA) says, “Your home might even be a ‘high priority public health risk.’ This is probably where you are exposed to most allergens and irritants.”\nLet’s take a look at some of the allergies you or your family may suffer from because of unhealthy indoor air. And what you can do about it.\nAsthma symptoms include coughing attacks, shortness of breath, and chest tightness or pain. These symptoms occur because your airways narrow and swell and produce extra mucus. It is a chronic condition that varies from person to person. For some people it is just a nuisance. For others it is a major problem they need to deal with every day. And an asthma attack can even be life threatening.\nAsthma cannot be cured, but the symptoms of asthma can be controlled. So it is important to know what is in your home or work environment that might trigger an asthmatic reaction. Asthma triggers include:\n• Airborne substances and particles, such as pollen, dust mites, mold spores, pet dander, or particles of cockroach waste.\n• Respiratory infections, like the common cold.\n• Cold air.\n• Air pollutants and irritants, such as smoke.\nWhat can you do to reduce or even eliminate the triggers that cause your asthma attacks? Controlling airborne substances is the key. This can reduce your exposure in the home. Some of the recommendations of the Mayo Clinic include:\n• Use your air conditioner to reduce the amount of airborne pollen entering your home and to lower indoor humidity.\n• Minimize dust in your bedroom to help with nighttime asthma symptoms. To minimize dust in a bedroom use dustproof covers on pillows, mattresses, and box springs. Remove carpeting and install hardwood or linoleum flooring. Keep curtains and blinds clean.\n• Use a dehumidifier.\n• Prevent mold by cleaning wet and damp areas around the house, especially the bathroom and kitchen.\n• Avoid pets. If you do have a dog or cat, bathe them regularly to reduce pet dander.\n• Clean your home regularly, at least once a week.\nIf you’re allergic to mold, breathing in mold spores causes your immune system to overreact. You will experience coughing, itchy eyes, or other symptoms that make you feel sick. Mold allergy can also be linked to asthma in some people.\nThere are many molds that grow in your home, but only certain kinds cause allergies. The most common of these include alternaria, aspergillus, cladosporium, and penicillium. They cause an overly sensitive immune system to produce histamine, triggering itchy/watery eyes, runny nose, and sneezing.\nMold thrives in moist, damp areas in your home. Eliminate dampness and moisture from surfaces and from the air. This is the best way to lessen you and your family’s exposure to airborne mold. Here’s how:\n• Use a dehumidifier to lower humidity to less than 50%.\n• Clean up wet spots caused by leaky pipes, water seepage during rainstorms, and flood damage. Keep your kitchen and bathrooms clean and dry.\n• Adequate ventilation is key to keeping your house moisture free. Tight windows and door seals tend to trap moisture indoors, creating the conditions for mold to grow.\nTypical cat, dog, and pet allergy symptoms include sneezing, runny nose, asthma-like wheezing, and difficulty breathing. Allergy sufferers may also experience facial pressure and pain, frequent awakening at night, or swollen, blue-colored skin under the eyes. Skin may also get inflamed causing raised red patches, eczema, and itchy skin.\nPet dander is the culprit in most of these unpleasant symptoms. The dead flakes of skin that dogs and cats shed daily is what causes these reactions. Pets also produce allergens from their saliva, urine, and feces. Cats cause allergies because of the Fel d 1 protein produced by their skin, saliva, and sebaceous glands.\nIn dogs, it’s the Can f 1 and Can f 2 protein that trigger allergic reactions. These microscopic pet allergens remain suspended in the air for long periods of time. They easily stick to furniture, bedding, and fabrics.\nDogs and cats aren’t the only pets that create allergens. Rodent pets such as hamsters, gerbils, mice, and guinea pigs do, too. The ones you don’t have to worry about don’t have fur, such as fish or reptiles.\nThe best way to avoid pet allergy is to not have a pet around the house. If you do decide to keep a pet, there are medications you can take to help relieve symptoms. Also remember to keep your home as clean and dust free as you can. Air conditioners and quality air purifiers will do a good job of keeping your indoor air fresh, clean, and pure.\nAs you might have guessed, dust mites live in household dust. They are close relatives to ticks and spiders, but are too small to be seen without a microscope. However, you will know they are there if you experience dust mite allergy symptoms like sneezing, runny nose, asthmatic wheezing, and breathing is difficult. It’s not the dust mites themselves that cause the allergy in people, but the feces and decaying bodies of the mites.\nDust mites live on the skin cells shed by people, and thrive in warm, humid surroundings. The optimal environments for dust mites in your home include bedding, upholstered furniture, and carpeting.\nTo control dust mites, keep the humidity in your home low. That coupled with regular and thorough house cleaning, especially in the bedroom, is the key to controlling dust mites.\nMore Tips on Controlling Dust Mites:\n• Use allergen-proof bed covers.\n• Wash bedding weekly.\n• Keep relative humidity below 50% in your home.\n• Remove dust regularly to prevent it from getting into the air.\n• Vacuum regularly using a cleaner with a double-layered microfilter bag or a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter to decrease dust emissions from the cleaner.\n• Cut clutter around the house as knickknacks, books/magazines, and table top ornaments collect dust.\nThe Mayo Clinic recommends you install a high efficiency media filter in your home furnace and air conditioner. Get a filter with a Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value (MERV) of 11 or 12 and leave the fan on to create a whole house air filter. With the fan turned on, the air inside your home circulates and the filter traps the airborne particles.\nCold-like symptoms such as runny nose, itchy eyes, congestion, sneezing, and sinus pressure are sure signs of pollen allergy, also called hay fever or allergic rhinitis. It is caused by outdoor and indoor allergens, including pollen. Symptoms occur when your immune system misidentifies pollen as harmful. That causes the release of histamines in your bloodstream, leading to the misery of hay fever.\nHay fever sufferers know that you can’t completely avoid pollen in the air. But there are simple things you can do to minimize pollen in your home. The Mayo Clinic suggests:\n• Close the doors and windows during pollen season.\n• Don’t put laundry on the line outside as pollen can stick to sheets and towels.\n• Use air conditioning in your house.\n• Use an allergy-grade filter in your home ventilation system.\n• Reduce humidity indoors with a humidifier.\n• Use a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter in rooms you spend the most time in.\n• Wear a dust mask when house cleaning."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:1e672ce7-2abd-428e-b9cf-db7a7440f6bc>","<urn:uuid:8b897850-a7e3-4ec6-b42d-0546b6117f0f>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the similarities between the ceremonial practices of the Nharangga people and the artistic traditions described in Aboriginal art from different regions of Australia?","answer":"Both the Nharangga people and other Aboriginal groups across Australia maintained strong ceremonial and spiritual traditions tied to their ancestral beliefs. The Nharangga held corroborees and meetings for various purposes including initiation, marriage, trade, and storytelling, with specific ceremonies like the Munga corroboree for rain. Similarly, across different regions of Australia, art was intimately connected to ceremony and the Ancestral Realm or Dreaming, with artwork having layers of meaning - 'inside' stories for initiates and 'outside' interpretations for the public. In both cases, ceremonial practices were ways of expressing connections to ancestral beings and the land, maintaining spiritual and social identity through totems, ritual songs, dances and art creation.","context":["Nharangga people have always lived on Yorke Peninsula. Their country extends as far north as Port Broughton and east to the Hummock Ranges. Their neighbours were the Kaurna of the Adelaide Plains and the Nukunu to the north, with whom the Nharangga would meet for trade and ceremony. The Nharangga nation was made up of four clans, the Kurnara in the north of the peninsula, Windera in the east, Wari in the west and Dilpa in the south.\nWe can rebuild a picture of the Nharangga lifestyle, customs and environment through various means:\n- reading accounts of early European travellers, settlers and missionaries;\n- through interviews between Nharangga people and anthropologists in the late 1800’s and early 1900’s;\n- through stories passed down to, and recounted by, contemporary Aboriginal people;\n- through the study of the materials left by past generations of Nharangga people.\nThe Nharangga managed and preserved their lands. They used fire to clear old grasses and promote fresh plant growth. Fresh water rock holes were covered with slabs of stone or brushwood to keep the water clean and to prevent animals from drinking from them. Track ways were maintained through the thick mallee forests, linking places and people throughout the peninsula.\nCeremony played an important role in their lives. Corroborees and meetings were held to settle disagreements, for initiation, marriage, trade, or to share stories and experiences. For instance, the rain corroboree, or Munga corroboree, would be sung and danced to break a drought. Large meetings would be held at various places such as Bubladowie Waterhole (Pupuldawi) and Weavers Lagoon.\nAn early European settler who lived on Moorowie Station saw many corroborees and wrote:\n“…they were usually held at night. The men would dance around a fire and imitate kangaroo hunts, fishing exploits or fights with other tribes. They used to daub themselves with pipeclay and red ochre. The men would chant a kind of song and the women sat around in a circle with a possum rug in their laps rolled up to make a drum.” (Carmichael 1988:3)\nThe Nharangga had uses for a wide variety of plants and animals. Roots, seeds and native fruits formed a significant part of their diet. The following song tells of gathering quandongs:\nParabara wanarni tjindu kalala kambarni\n(wild peach come sun light burn)\njarugareitija madeitja tjindu kalala kambarni\n(go around and gather them sunlight burn)\nClothing was made from wallaby, kangaroo and possum skins while wood and roots were used as spears, digging sticks and shields, and for constructing shelters and housing. Fishing and hunting nets were made from a reed, Buntu Buntu, which women would prepare over several days; picking it, drying it and rolling it into string.\nTheir expertise at fishing was admired by many of the early European settlers with butterfish, salmon, mullet and snapper traded for tobacco and other supplies.\nA swimmer would sometimes carry a bait fish into deep water and return to shore where others would net the schools of fish that would follow, or a spotter would signal from the cliff tops as to where the schools of fish were.\nShell fish were also important in the Nharangga diet. People would walk out onto the reefs at low tide to collect periwinkles and warreners or dive into deeper water for abalone. The shells would be put into string bags along with the occasional crab or crayfish and carried back to camp.\nThe peninsula is criss crossed with stories of the dreamtime with particular locations relating to the exploits of various beings. Budera, Ngarna the powerful club thrower, Curlew the Owl, Bulgawan the wicked old woman and Madjitju the bat man were some of the beings who lived on the peninsula during the dreamtime. On a trip to Marion Bay you might come across the small mud huts of the Illawari, the little people, and see the bones of Badara lying in the middle of a salt lake. At Point Yorke you might hear the evil spirit Wainjira breaking on the rocks.","World of Dreamings\nTraditional and modern art of Australia\nAn exhibition held at the State Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg | 2 February - 9 April 2000\n- Dr Brian Kennedy, Director, National Gallery of Australia\n- An introduction to Aboriginal art by Susan Jenkins and Carly Lane\n- The Aboriginal Memorial We have survived, by Djon Mundine\n- The Aboriginal Memorial 1987-88 A description\n- John Mawurndjul The resonating land by Luke Taylor\n- All the world The paintings of Nym Bandak by Kim Barber\n- 'Who's that bugger who paints like me?'

This exhibition focuses on the work of six artists: Nym Bandak, Fiona Foley, Emily Kam Kngwarray, John Mawurndjul, Tracey Moffatt, and Rover Thomas. It also includes two major collaborative works from Arnhem Land and Cape York: The Aboriginal Memorial, a magnificent set of painted hollow log coffins by 43 artists from Ramingining, and a group of ceremonial sculptures by Wik artists. While the work of these artists is based in age-old traditions, it embodies the realities of Aboriginal Australians living in the modern world: a world that has undergone great social, political and cultural upheavals since Europeans colonised the country over two centuries ago. These upheavals continue to have repercussions today. Aboriginal art is at the very frontier between indigenous and non-indigenous Australia and reflects the contemporary realities of its makers.\nArt, specifically Aboriginal art created in a European-dominated Australia, can be seen as a medium of negotiation between cultures, and of the exchange of ideas and beliefs; exchanges that are not always equal. The circumstances in which the paintings by Bandak and the Wik sculptures were made, involved the active participation of anthropologists and missionaries. Fiona Foley and Rover Thomas question the 'official' histories of Australia. A focus of the films and photographs of Tracey Moffatt is the definition of identity in a multicultural society. Emily Kam Kngwarray and John Mawurndjul, to varying degrees, have become favourites of the marketplace. The Aboriginal Memorial, on the other hand, was made specifically to register an Aboriginal voice in the clamour of Australia's celebration of two centuries of European occupation. These are but some of the contexts in which art by Aboriginal people operates. Simultaneously, this art expresses the complex of the relationships between the individual, the group, the land, the ancestral beings and the spiritual forces which have invigorated Aboriginal life for generations, past and present.\nAboriginal art is the oldest continuing art tradition in the world. While Europeans mark the start of their third millennium, Aboriginal Australians are marking (at least) their fiftieth. Archaeological research indicates that rock paintings in Arnhem Land in northern Australia date back 50,000 years and rock engravings in southern Australia at least 30,000 years, predating Palaeolithic rock paintings of Altamira and Lascaux in Europe. Graphic symbols and designs found in such rock art continue to be used by artists today.\nAboriginal art manifests in a wide range of forms and media: from ancient rock art to ephemeral body decoration, ground paintings and sand sculptures; from bark paintings and sculpture in wood to jewellery and woven fibres. In recent decades, introduced media such as synthetic paints and canvas, print making materials, textiles, photographic film and computer technology have extended the means by which Aboriginal artists express themselves.\nThere is not one but several traditions of indigenous art in Australia, each with a distinct visual language, its own vocabulary of icons and symbols. Designs usually have layers of meanings, determined by the context in which they are used - whether in a ceremony with a restricted audience of initiates, or in the public domain of the uninitiated. Artists distinguish between the different levels of meaning: the 'inside' stories for the initiated and the 'outside' interpretation. This enables them to make sacred images in the public domain without compromising the work's true cultural significance, nor the artist's integrity.\nTraditionally, the great themes of Aboriginal art relate to the Ancestral Realm, commonly known as the Dreaming. The term 'Dreaming', however inadequate, is used by both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people alike. It does not mean a state of dreams or unreality, rather a state of reality beyond the mundane, incorporating the spiritual and physical worlds.\nThe Ancestral Realm refers to the genesis of the universe and to the supernatural and ancestral beings who created it - beings whose spiritual powers continue to influence and sustain successive generations of Aboriginal people. In the Dreaming these beings and creator ancestors travelled across the unshaped world in both human and non-human form, creating the landscape and laying down the laws of social and religious behaviour. Much Aboriginal art concerns stories (also known as Dreamings) about the epic deeds and activities of the creator ancestors. The entire Australian continent is covered in an intricate web of ancestral tracks. Some are specific to, and contained within, a region whilst others span across regions, connecting those whose land they cover.\nThe powers of the supernatural and ancestral beings are present in the land, in natural species and within individuals. Activated through ceremony, they continue to sustain their human descendants. An individual's links with the ancestral beings and the land, and his or her spiritual and social identity, are expressed through totems of natural species and phenomena, which feature in ritual songs, dances and through the creation of art.\nBefore European colonisation, more than 200 distinct languages and up to 600 dialects were spoken across the continent. Equally, there is a myriad of cultural practices, spiritual beliefs and art traditions and styles.\nSimply, indigenous Australian art can be categorised according to a number of stylistic regions, in which artists share common visual vocabularies and specific media. Among those represented in this exhibition are the 'Top end' (Arnhem Land and its surrounds), the Kimberley, the desert and Cape York. In addition, artists such as Fiona Foley and Tracey Moffatt have been raised in the cities, outside traditional communities.\nArnhem Land, in the tropical north, is one of the richest art producing regions in the country. Covering some 114,000 square kilometres, it is renowned for hundreds of rock art sites, mighty rivers, freshwater lagoons, jungles, forests, mangrove swamps and sandy beaches.\nAt least 30 distinct languages and dialects are spoken in Arnhem Land, each as different as, say, Russian is to English; yet the region's clans (or extended family groups) have close associations through similar social organisation, spiritual beliefs and ceremonial activity.\nThe major forms of artistic expression are weavings in natural fibres produced mostly by women, sculptures and bark paintings. Painting on sheets of bark of the eucalyptus tree is the most distinctive form of art in the region. The tradition stems from painting on the inside walls of bark shelters, rock art and paintings on the human body for ceremonies (bark paintings are often considered to be reflections of the body). The tradition was stimulated during the twentieth century by the desire of Europeans to collect portable examples of local art.\nThe bark is best stripped from the stringy-bark tree (Eucalyptus tetradonta) in the wet season of October to March, when the rising sap makes it easy to remove. It is then cured either on a fire and flattened under weights. The outer surfaces are cleaned by stripping excess bark, then the inner painting surface is made smooth.\nThe standard colours used in bark paintings are red and yellow ochre, white kaolin or pipe clay, and black charcoal. These powdery pigments are mixed with binders to make paint. Traditionally, birds egg or orchid juice were used but in recent decades artists have favoured commercial wood glues which have similar qualities and are readily available. The most common brush used to execute the fine cross-hatching on barks is a short stemmed brush with only a few long hairs attached. Other brushes are made from such things as the frayed ends of sticks. Today, commercial brushes are also used.\nCross-hatched patterns, referred to as rarrk or miny'tji, are common throughout Arnhem Land. These are achieved by building up layers of lines using the fine hair brush. The patterns are used to give the surface a visual vibrancy, which evokes the power of the ancestors. This can be seen, for example, in John Mawurndjul's paintings, which have direct references to body designs.\nThe Aboriginal Memorial is an installation of 200 hollow log coffins, of the type used in secondary mortuary ceremonies in Arnhem Land to keep the bones of the deceased clan members. This collaborative piece was made on the occasion of the Bicentenary of Australia's white settlement, in remembrance of Aboriginal people who had died protecting their land during conflict, but who were denied proper burial. It was the artists' hope that the bicentennial year would mark a transition of Australia from an unjust and racist past to a more egalitarian future.\nTo the west of Arnhem Land and Darwin lies Wadeye (Port Keats) in the Daly and Fitzmaurice rivers area, home of the Murrinhpatha and related peoples. This coastal area features sandy beaches, mangrove swamps, creeks, rivers and low hills. Bark painting was introduced to the area in the 1950s, following the commercial success of this portable collectable art form in nearby Arnhem Land. Wadeye bark paintings are distinctive, however, as artists commonly fashion them into an oval shape. The style of painting has similarities with the rock art of the area. Also distinctive is the extended palette, which included greens (a mixture of yellow ochre and black), purples (red ochre and black) and pinks (red ochre and white).\nNym Bandak was the pre-eminent artist of the Wadeye community; a prolific bark painter, he lived through a period of great social and cultural upheaval. Bandak produced the paintings in this exhibition in the late 1950s at the request of the anthropologist W.E.H. Stanner, who sought to investigate the artist's conception of his environment. The result was not only a unique group of works but a long encounter and friendship with Stanner, which lead to a better understanding of indigenous culture by European Australians.\nThe Kimberley area in the north west of Australia, ranges from monumental rock formations in the east to where the desert meets the sea in the west. This area has a great diversity of language groups and art styles. The Kimberley is home to the ancestral Wandjina (agents of procreation) whose images first appeared in rock paintings in the region about 3000 years ago.\nThe practice of making headdresses and other paraphernalia for ceremonial dances in the Kimberley lead to the recent use of painted boards which are carried across the dancers' shoulders. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, a school of painting emerged in the eastern Kimberley of which Rover Thomas was the leading figure.\nIn contrast to the lush tropical north of Australia, vast areas of the centre of the continent are desert. This harsh environment of sandhills, mountain ranges, rock formations, plains, saltpan lakes, seasonal waterways and rare permanent waterholes is the country of several distinct but related groups who share systems of graphic representation and iconography.\nThe desert was the birthplace of one of the most important movements in modern Australian art, known as the Papunya movement. In the early 1970s senior men at the government settlement of Papunya, west of Alice Springs, began to make portable paintings in acrylic using the traditional symbols of their ceremonial sand drawings, ground paintings and body painting.\nThe developments at Papunya spread in time to other desert communities, including Utopia, north east of Alice Springs, where the Utopia Women's Batik Group began in the late 1970s. By 1988, the artists at Utopia had begun painting on canvas. They employed a range of styles, including naturalistically rendered landscapes and the ubiquitous symbols of the desert.\nIn the work of Emily Kam Kngwarray, symbols are used sparingly to transcend the narrative aspect of the Dreamings they evoke. Kngwarray's strong gestural marks and fields of colour express the resonance of ancestral power in the landscape, as does the cross-hatching in Arnhem Land bark paintings.\nThe areas of Cape York in far north Queensland and the islands of the Torres Strait, which form a bridge to Papua New Guinea, are home to a number of different groups.\nWest Cape York Peninsula is the country of the Wik people, whose art has some affinities with that of Arnhem Land across the Gulf of Carpentaria to the west. The Wik have intentionally limited their engagement in the public art world -most of their art continues to be made specifically for ceremonies - although in recent times, weavings and sculptures have been made more frequently for the public domain. The sculptures in this exhibition were made for a public performance of an initiation ceremony.\nThe influence of Queensland sculptural traditions is evident in some major 'urban' artists' work. Fiona Foley, for example, a southern Queenslander, references the forked stick form in her installation work.\nAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who live in rural and urban areas, away from traditional environments, have played a significant role in the resurgence of indigenous culture. Such people are not concentrated in one cultural bloc and often have grown up away from their homeland or language group, without the traditional upbringing often expected of Aboriginal people.\nAboriginal art practice in areas where indigenous people are a minority dates back to the nineteenth century, with artists such as William Barak (c.1828-1903) and Tommy McRae (1836-1901). Their distinctive drawings give us rare glimpses of life at the time through Aboriginal eyes.\nArt by Aboriginal people in the city was neglected by the wider art world until the 1970s when Aboriginal social and political movements gained public attention. In 1967 citizenship rights were granted to all Aboriginal people and the first acknowledgment of their rights to land occurred in the mid 1970s. Such reforms provided indigenous artists with opportunities that were previously denied them.\nAn entire generation of artists has emerged in the cities and towns. Not restricted to stereotypical notions of Aboriginal art, they are able to freely use a range of materials, media and recent technology. Such artists articulate various subjects - notions of identity, the link to land, and other political issues concerning the indigenous view of Australian history. The so-called 'urban' movement has flourished to the point where such artists are now at the cutting edge of Australian art. The resulting work presents unique perspectives born of distinctive experiences.\nThe work of all the artists in this exhibition is intended to inform and educate its audience about the breadth and scope of art by Aboriginal people in recent years. It is also intended to challenge stereotypical perceptions of 'Aboriginality' based on notions of the 'authentic' and the 'primitive'.\nTracey Moffatt, for example, has consistently taken the stance that the categorisation of 'Aboriginal artist' is limiting. A maker of photographs and films, she regards herself as an Aboriginal person who makes art; she in fact spends most of her working time in New York.\nFrom New York to Milmilngkan in Arnhem Land, this exhibition represents the broad diversity of art by Aboriginal people at the turn of the century.\nIn the nineteenth century, Aboriginal people were classified as primitive and their material culture often shared spaces in museums with 'strange' specimens of Australian flora and fauna. By the twentieth century, with the beginning of serious anthropological interest in Aboriginal culture and society, it became clear that the preconceived ideas were in fact 'primitive' rather than Aboriginal people themselves. Now, at the beginning of the twenty-first century, Aboriginal art in all its styles and media, and from every part of the continent, is recognised as a vital and dynamic expression of the contemporary world. Today, artists are no longer disregarded on the basis of race, gender, geography and the domination of classical European models.\nThe interest in Aboriginal art which has flourished since the 1970s has created new opportunities for indigenous artists, as their work leaves the communities to be shown in museums and galleries around the world. Meanwhile, the imperatives to produce art for traditional purposes continue, and the expanded environment in which indigenous art now operates has created further compelling reasons for artists to continue expressing the values of their culture to the wider world. In the public domain, Aboriginal art can be appreciated for its spirituality and aesthetic qualities, and as a reflection of the social and political achievements and aspirations of the peoples who create it.\nSusan Jenkins and Carly Lane"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:7d50997e-3e97-4b23-a4ba-1296133d625a>","<urn:uuid:f54ee2fb-0db4-40af-98e7-71e5c6dec018>"],"error":null}
{"question":"For someone with high cholesterol, which would be more effective at lowering LDL levels: African walnut extract or mung beans?","answer":"Both foods demonstrate cholesterol-lowering abilities, but through different mechanisms. Mung beans have been specifically shown to inhibit LDL cholesterol oxidation through their antioxidant properties, particularly their flavonoids that act as free-radical scavengers. This helps prevent LDL accumulation in blood vessel linings. T. conophorum has also demonstrated effects on lipid metabolism, as studies showed the extract appreciably elevated BUN levels at 500 mg/kg dosage while reducing them at 750 mg/kg dosage when compared to untreated subjects. However, since the direct LDL-lowering effects are more explicitly documented for mung beans in the research, they may be more reliably effective for specifically targeting high cholesterol levels.","context":["TETRACARPIDIUM CONOPHORUM EXTRACT EXHIBITS ANTI-FATIGUE ACTIVITY IN RATS VIA REDUCED PROTEIN CATABOLISM, INCREASED ANTIOXIDANT STATUS AND DELAYED LACTATE ELEVATION\nThirty rats of both sexes were assigned into 5 categories of six animals apiece. Animals in the unadministered (control) group were placed on distilled water. Group 1M and Group 1F animals were administered 500 mg/kg body weight (b.w) of T. conophorum aqueous nut extract whereas animals in Group 2M and Group 2F were administered 750 mg/kg dosage of the extricate (0.5 ml) orally once daily for 32 days. Phytoconstituents present in the extract include: saponins, flavonoids, tannins, phenols and alkaloids. The extract at 750mg/kg b.w notably (p<0.05) raised extracellular glucose in masculine rats when matched with males that received 500 mg/kg b.w. The 500 mg/kg dose of the extract appreciably (p<0.05) elevated BUN in both sexes, but with reduction in both groups at 750 mg/kg b.w when juxtaposed with their respective untreated animals. The extract at 500 mg/kg b.w increased LDH activity in male group when compared with male rats that received 750 mg/kg dose. The 750-extract dosage did not statistically (p>0.05) alter LDH activity in both sexes. The extract at 500 and 750mg/kg b.w increased the 3rd‒6th swim in male rats. Substantive (p<0.05) rise in swimming endurance time was first noticed at the 2nd swim when matched up with the control and group treated 500 mg/kg b.w, in female rats. Sequel to these research findings, it is hypothesized that the anti-weakness effect of T. conophorum might be adduced to delayed increase in lactate and reduction in protein catabolism\nAjaiyeoba, E.

Although in most parts of the world they’re less popular than other bean varieties, like chickpeas or black beans, mung beans have some huge health benefits to offer!\nWhile mung beans may be new to most people in the U.S, they’ve been a part of traditional Ayurvedic diets in India for thousands of years. Mung beans are considered “one of the most cherished foods” in the ancient Indian practice that’s been a traditional form of medicine since roughly 1,500 B.C.\nThese days, mung beans are beginning to pop up in protein powders, canned soups and in restaurant dishes state-side. So here’s what you need to know about mung beans:\n- Mung beans are a high source of nutrients including: manganese, potassium, magnesium, folate, copper, zinc and various B vitamins.\n- They are also a very filling food, high in protein, resistant starch and dietary fiber.\n- You can find mung beans in dried powder form, as whole uncooked beans, “split-peeled” form (just like you’d find split green peas), as bean noodles, and also as sprouted seeds (which are the kind you’d see used on sandwiches or salads).\n- Their dried seeds may be eaten raw, cooked (whole or split), fermented, or milled and ground into flour.\n- Because of their high nutrient density, mung beans are considered useful in defending against several chronic, age-related diseases, including heart disease, cancer, diabetes and obesity.\nClinical evidence continues to show that plant-derived foods have various potential health benefits, including lowering inflammation. Health experts recommend that plant-based foods make up a large portion of every person’s diet, and many worldwide health organizations have recommended an increase in the intake of plant-derived foods to improve health status and to prevent chronic diseases. Among plant-based sources of protein and nutrients, mung beans are one of the foods gathering the most attention.\nAs you’ll come to learn, mung beans are one of the healthiest sources of plant protein there is when you consider how many other nutrients they contain in addition to amino acids (the building blocks of proteins). As the Journal of Chemistry Central puts it, “mung beans have biological activities including antioxidant, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, antihypertensive, lipid metabolism accommodation, antihypertensive and antitumor effects.” (1)\nMung Beans Nutrition Facts\nOne cup of cooked mung beans contains the following (percentages based on the RDAs for the average adult female): (2)\n- 212 calories\n- 14 grams of protein\n- 15 grams of fiber\n- 1 gram of fat\n- 4 grams of sugar\n- 321 micrograms of folate (100%)\n- 97 milligrams of magnesium (36%)\n- 0.33 milligrams of vitamin b1 thiamine (36%)\n- 0.6 milligrams of manganese (33%)\n- 7 milligrams of zinc (24%)\n- 0.8 milligrams of vitamin B5 pantothenic acid (8%)\n- 0.13 milligrams of vitamin B6 (11%)\n- 55 milligrams of calcium (5%)\nIf you choose to sprout mung beans and eat them raw, each cup will only have about 31 calories and will provide about three grams of protein and two grams of fiber.\nHealth Benefits of Mung Beans\n1. Can Help Lower High Cholesterol Levels and Protect Against Heart Disease\nOne 2011 study published in the Journal of Human and Experimental Toxicology found that mung beans are highly effective at inhibiting LDL “bad” cholesterol oxidation. Mung beans have the ability to regulate cholesterol levels because their antioxidants act like potent free-radical scavengers, reversing damage done to blood vessels and lowering inflammation. (3)\nOxidized LDL cholesterol is one of the biggest risks of deadly cardiovascular events, such as heart attacks or stroke. LDL cholesterol can accumulate within the inner lining of blood vessels, called the endothelium, and block blood flow, triggering cardiac arrest. Mung beans are a great addition to any anti-inflammatory diet thanks to their ability to keep arteries clear and to improve circulation.\n2. Helps Lower High Blood Pressure\nMung beans nutrition include the ability to fight another significant cardiovascular disease risk factor: high blood pressure. In a 2014 study published in the Chemistry Central Journal, rats that were given mung bean sprout extracts for one month experienced significant reductions in systolic blood pressure levels.\nThe researchers believed that mung beans’ anti-hypertensive effects might be due to their high concentration of protein fragments known as peptides. These help to decrease constricting of blood vessels that raises blood pressure. (4)\n3. Contains Antioxidants That Fight Cancer Development\nHigh levels of amino acids — oligosaccharides and polyphenols — in mung beans are thought to be the main contributors to their antioxidant power that can fight cancer development. In clinical studies, mung beans show anti-tumor activity and are able to protect DNA damage and dangerous cell mutation.\nA 2012 study done by the College of Food Science and Nutritional Engineering at the China Agricultural University showed that mung beans’ antioxidant capacities are mainly derived from vitexin and isovitexin, two types of protective flavonoids that have high free-radical scavenging abilities. These flavanoids lower oxidative stress that can contribute to cancer formation. (5)\n4. Can Help Prevent or Treat Type 2 Diabetes\nStrong evidence exists that mung beans nutrition has a significant anti-diabetic effect and can naturally help prevent or treat cases of type 2 diabetes. A 2008 study done by the Institute of Crop Sciences at the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences found that when rats were given mung bean supplements, they experienced lowered blood glucose, plasma C-peptide, glucagon, total cholesterol and triglyceride levels. At the same time, the rats significantly improved glucose tolerance and increased insulin responsiveness. (6)\n5. Provide a High Source of Protein\nMung beans nutrition includes a very impressive amount of protein for a plant, with about 20–24 percent of their chemical structure being amino acids (protein), according to the Department of Chemistry at the Harbin Institute of Technology China. Globulin and albumin are the main storage proteins found in mung bean seeds and make up over 85 percent of the total amino acids found in mung beans. (7)\nMung beans nutrition is also rich in other essential amino acids, including leucine, isoleucine and valine, which can be combined with other plant sources (like whole grains or some vegetables) to make a “complete protein.” Their highly absorbable protein content makes them a smart choice for vegans or vegetarians, especially considering how many other nutrients they add to someone’s diet.\n6. Boosts Immunity and Protects Against Infections and Viruses\nMung beans nutrition contains a range of phytonutrients that are considered anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory, helping them to increase immunity and fight harmful bacteria, viruses, colds, rashes, irritations and more. Mung beans promote a healthy balance of bacteria within the digestive tract, which helps with nutrient absorption and immune defense.\n7. High Source of Vitamins and Minerals, Like Folate and Magnesium\nMung beans nutrition provides a whopping 100 percent of your daily value of folate in every one cup serving! Folate (also known as vitamin B9) is an important vitamin for DNA synthesis, cell and tissue growth, hormonal balance, cognitive function, and even reproduction. In fact, consuming enough folate is especially important during pregnancy because it’s essential for preventing early births, neural tube defects and even termination.\nMung beans also provide about 36 percent of daily magnesium needs for the average adult woman. Many adults are actually deficient in magnesium, which is unfortunate because most people really need a substantial amount in their diet in order to control stress levels and manage pain. Magnesium is important for digestive health, proper heart beat functioning, neurotransmitter release and for repairing muscle tissue in people who are very active.\n8. Fights Obesity and Helps with Weight Loss\nBecause mung beans nutrition contains high levels of fiber and protein, they are one of the most filling foods there is. In a study published in the Journal of Nutrition, researchers observed that a single meal with high-fiber beans produced a two-fold greater increase in the satiety hormone called cholecystokinin when compared to meals that didn’t contain beans. (8)\nMany other studies have found similar results: Namely, that satiety significantly increases after eating beans. Therefore, regularly eating mung beans can help with reducing food intake and boosting weight loss. (9)\n9. Can Help Decrease PMS Symptoms\nMung beans nutrition provides B vitamins, including vitamin B6 and folate, which are both important for controlling hormone fluctuations that can lead to PMS symptoms. B vitamins, folate and magnesium are useful for lowering the severity and pain associated with PMS cramps, headaches, mood swings, fatigue and muscle pains.\n10. Easy to Digest Compared to Many Other Beans\nWhile some people experience gas or bloating from eating beans, mung beans are considered one of the easiest beans to digest and can actually help with detoxification in some cases. Mung beans have many benefits for digestion due to their high fiber content — for example, they can help prevent IBS symptoms like constipation.\nIn order to add mung beans into your diet without experiencing unwanted digestive effects, try first soaking and sprouting dried beans overnight and then cooking them with traditional Ayurvedic spices that can help increase digestibility. In India, they are commonly cooked with such spices as ginger, cumin, coriander and turmeric in order to help make them taste great while also helping to avoid any stomach pains.\nSoaking and sprouting mung beans can also help reduce “antinutrients” that are naturally present within all legumes and beans, making them easier to digest and also releasing more of their nutrients. Types of carbohydrates called oligosaccharides, raffinose, stachyose and verbascose are present in raw (unsprouted) or poorly processed legumes, which can cause uncomfortable flatulence.\nSome of these antinutrients are present in mung beans, but to a lesser degree than many other beans. In addition, antinutrients found in mung beans are soluble in water and can be eliminated by soaking, sprouting (germinating) or fermenting before eating them.\nHistory of Mung Beans\nMung beans were first domesticated in India, where they grew as wild plants. Archaeological evidence shows that mung beans were growing in the Harappan civilization in the Punjab and Haryana areas of Indian about 4,500 years ago!\nScholars separate domestication of mung beans into two different species: the kind that grew in southern India (which was a larger-seeded mung bean that began being harvested about 3,000–3,500 years ago) and the even older kind of mung bean that has smaller seeds and grew in northern India. Cultivated mung beans later spread from India to China and other parts of Southeast Asia.\nRecords show that in Thailand, mung beans have been eaten for at least 2,200 years. Around the 9th or 10th century, mung beans also came to be cultivated in Africa since they grow easily in warm climates and helped feed undernourished populations.\nMung beans are most popular and widely grown today in India, China, Southeast Asia and also somewhat in parts of southern Europe and the U.S. In the U.S., mung beans have been cultivated since around the 1830s, although they’ve really only picked up a following over the past decade or two. Today about 75 percent of the 15–20 million pounds of mung beans consumed in the U.S every year are imported and grown in India and China.\nHow to Use Mung Beans in Recipes\nSprouting, or germination, is thought to improve the nutritional and medicinal qualities of mung beans nutrition — making them easier to digest and tolerate — so always try to consume sprouted mung beans if you can.\nIn recent years, as researchers learn more about the importance of sprouting legumes, nuts and grains, studies show that the sprouts of mung beans – meaning the type that is edible after germination – have more obvious biological activities and more plentiful beneficial metabolites than unsprouted mung beans do. Sprouting helps biosynthetic enzymes to become activated during the stages of germination, which means mung beans nutrition become more absorbable by the human body.\nMung beans, which have the scientific species name Vigna radiate, appear in cuisines around the world, mostly in India, China, the Philippines and Korea. In India, split and peeled mung beans are traditionally used in the dish called dahl, which is a thick stew that is high in fiber and protein, yet low in calories. It’s a filling meal and is considered a staple in Indian cooking that is eaten multiple times per week for most families.\nIn Chinese cuisine, mung beans are also used to make pancakes or dumplings, combined with rice in stir- fries as a staple dish and even used in desserts. Whole mung beans are used to make tángshuǐ, a type of Chinese dessert which literally translates to “sugar water” because the beans are cooked with sugar, coconut milk and a little bit of ginger. They are also ground into a paste to form a popular type of ice cream and sorbet in Hong Kong.\nMung bean sprouts are made into a processed version of starch noodles that are most common in Asian cuisine. Mung beans have a much greater carbohydrate content (about 50–60 percent) than soybeans do, so they work well as flour and noodle products. Mung beans’ starch is the predominant carbohydrate in the legume and is why they are typically used for the production of starchy noodles, such as the kind called muk in Korea.\nHow To Cook Mung Beans\nWhen buying mung beans, check for discolored or damaged mung beans and discard them before cooking since these can contain harmful bacteria. You can buy mung beans uncooked and choose to sprout them or to soak and cook them.\nIn sprouted form, try adding them to salads or sandwiches. Soaked and cooked mung beans will become tender and taste “al dente,” similar to a firm pasta. They are considered complexly flavored and hearty, making them a great addition to many comfort meals in order to add bulk and more nutrients. After cooking them, you can use mung beans to create hummus or dips, or puree them to thicken soups.\nInstructions to cook dried mung beans:\n- Rinse the mung beans under cool running water, then add them to three cups of salted boiling water for every one cup of dried means (so a ratio of three parts water to one part beans).\n- Once boiling, bring the water back down to a low simmer and cover the beans.\n- Cook the mung beans until tender, about 45 minutes, if they are whole dried beans. Split or peeled mung beans take about 20 to 30 minutes to fully cook, so they are good option if you’re short on time.\nMung Bean Recipes\nMung beans are easy to add to recipes you’re probably already making, including adding them to soups, stews, salads, veggie burgers and stir-fries. Mung beans can also be made into porridges, confections, curries and even fermented to make alcoholic beverages.\nThis recipe below for Thai Spring Rolls is different and fun to try.

{"question":"I'm curious about energy conservation. How does the conservation of angular momentum in rotating objects compare to energy conservation in pulley systems?","answer":"In pulley systems, mechanical energy is conserved as it changes between potential and kinetic energy - the energy cannot be created or destroyed, only converted between forms. Similarly, angular momentum is conserved in rotating systems when there is no external net torque. For example, when a child jumps onto a merry-go-round, the total angular momentum before and after remains constant, or when a figure skater pulls in her arms, her angular velocity increases as her moment of inertia decreases to maintain constant angular momentum. In both cases, the key principle is conservation - whether it's mechanical energy in pulleys or angular momentum in rotating objects - neither can be created or destroyed in isolated systems.","context":["Mechanical energy is the energy which is applied to an object due to its motion or due to its position. Mechanical energy can be either kinetic energy (energy of motion) or potential energy (stored energy of position).\nConservation of Energy\nAs with momentum, energy is conserved in all interactions. The Conservation law of energy said that energy can’t be created and can’t be demolished, but only can be changed into other form of energy. In the 20th centuries, this definition has been expanded to include mass because they both are in a same form.\nIn this page, we will only deal with mechanical energy. While the potential energy decrease, the kinetic energy increases, means the total energy (mechanical energy) remains same before and after.\nTEbefore = TE after\nFor there, an object is not conserving the entire energy, but there is some energy loss. This energy is not destroyed, but changed into other form or absorbed by another object.\nWhen you pull the weight at a constant velocity, approximately how much pulling force do you have to supply? (Here we can say only approximately, because there is some friction force involved in the pulleys. If the pulleys have weight then the pulling force will have an extra weight of the lower set of pulleys where the actual weight is attached.)\nIf you assume frictionless and weightless pulleys , when you pull with constant velocity, you can answer the question by counting the number of ropes on the lower pulley that support the weight. For instance, in Figure 2 there are four ropes that are holding up the weight, so the pull force that you have to supply is only 1/4 as much as the weight. However, if the rope is wound around only one set of reels as in activity 3, then the pulling force is only 1/2 as much as the weight.\nNow if you attach the rope on the lower reel to start with as in Figure 4, then the pulling force is only 1/3 as much as the weight because only three ropes are supporting the weight. If you have more than two sets of reels, for example, use six reels arranged into three reels on each set as in Figure 5, then the pulling force is only 1/6 as much as the weight.\nIf you attach the top pulley to the ceiling, the ceiling will be pulled by the weight and the force you supply plus the weight of all the pulleys. Again you can count the number of ropes that are attached to the top pulley assembly plus the weight of all the pulleys, including both sets. For instance, in Figure 2 the ceiling is pulled with the weight plus 1/4 of the weight and the pulleys. In figure 3 the ceiling is pulled by the weight and 1/2 of the weight that you pull with and the weight of the pulleys.\nHow far is the weight lifted compared to how far down the pulling force has to travel? This question can be answered by the law of Conservation of Energy. In an ideal case, the pulleys are weightless and there is no friction between the rope and the reels, and the reels are completely free to turn, the work done to lift the weight equals the potential energy gained by the weight. The work done is the force you pull with multiplied by the distance you pull. So if you pull with 1/4 as much as the weight, the distance you pull down will be 4 times longer than the distance the weight is lifted up. (You can also reach the same conclusion by conservation of rope length. Just add up the lengths before lifting and after.)\nYou cannot save energy by using simple machines but you can save some force! In reality there is always friction, so you actually would do more work than the potential energy gained by the weight. The additional energy supplied by you will turn into heat through friction and also turns into the potential energy gained by the lower pulley assembly if it is not weightless.\nIf we consider the weight of the pulley assembly, the pulling force will now include pulling the attached weight and the bottom assembly pulley weight. Suppose the attached weight is W and the bottom pulley assembly weighs B, then the total weight that I have to pull is W + B. If again I use four pulleys, two in each set, as in Figure 2, then there are 4 ropes supporting the weight, my pull is 1/4 of the total weight of (W+B). The ceiling now has to support both the pull from the five attached ropes, 5/4 of the sum of the attached weight and the weight of the bottom pulley assembly, and the top pulley assembly weight. This is to say the ceiling supports 5/4 of (W+B) + Top pulley assembly. Similarly for the case of 6 pulleys as in Figure 5: there are six ropes supporting the attached weight, so my pulling force is 1/6 of the total weight of (W+B). The ceiling has to support 7/6 of (W+B) + the weight of the top pulley assembly. How far down the pulling force has to travel versus how far up the weight is lifted? Same answer as in the case for weighless pulley.\n|Levers are mechanisms that can swivel or tip on a fixed point called a fulcrum. A see-saw is a lever. The fulcrum is in the middle of the see-saw and the people at each end can go up and down. |\nIn some levers the fulcrum is not in the centre but close to the end. A wheelbarrow has its fulcrum at the wheel which is at one end of the wheelbarrow.\nFor all levers, the force that makes it tip is called the effort. The thing that is being tipped is called the load.\nThere are three types of levers that are different in the order and direction of the load (L), effort (E) and fulcrum (F). The load is the weight we are trying to lift and the effort is the force we need to lift it. Whether we lift up or push down will depend on what we are trying to do. In the drawing opposite","It is easier to open a door by pushing on the edge farthest from the hinges than by pushing in the middle. It is intuitive that the magnitude of the force applied and the distance from the point of application to the hinge affect the tendency of the door to rotate. This physical quantity, torque, is t = r × F sin θ, where F is the force applied, r is the distance from the point of application to the center of the rotation, and θ is the angle from r to F.\nSubstitute Newton's second law into the definition for torque with θ of 90 degrees (a right angle between F and r) and use the relationship between linear acceleration and tangential angular acceleration to obtain t = r F = rma = mr 2 ( a/ r) = mr 2α. The quantity mr 2 is defined as moment of inertia of a point mass about the center of rotation.\nImagine two objects of the same mass with different distribution of that mass. The first object might be a heavy ring supported by struts on an axle like a flywheel. The second object could have its mass close to the central axis. Even though the masses of the two objects are equal, it is intuitive that the flywheel will be more difficult to push to a high number of revolutions per second because not only the amount of mass but also the distribution of the mass affects the ease in initiating rotation for a rigid body. The general definition of moment of inertia, also called rotational inertia, for a rigid body is I = ∑ m i r i 2 and is measured in SI units of kilogram‐meters 2.\nThe moments of inertia for different regular shapes are shown in Figure 2.\nMoments of inertia for various regular shapes.\nMechanics problems frequently include both linear and rotation motions.\nExample 1: Consider Figure 3, where a mass is hanging from a rope wrapped around a pulley. The falling mass (m) causes the pulley to rotate, and it is no longer necessary to require the pulley to be massless. Assign mass ( M) to the pulley and treat it as a rotating disc with radius (R). What is the acceleration of the falling mass, and what is the tension of the rope?\nA hanging mass spins a pulley.\nThe force equation for the falling mass is T − mg = − ma. The tension of the rope is the applied force to the edge of the pulley that is causing it to rotate. Thus, t = Iα, or TR = (1/2) MR 2( a/R), which reduces to T = (1/2) Ma, where angular acceleration has been replaced by a/R because the cord does not slip and the linear acceleration of the block is equal to the linear acceleration of the rim of the disk. Combining the first and last equation in this example leads to\nAngular momentum is rotational momentum that is conserved in the same way that linear momentum is conserved. For a rigid body, the angular momentum (L) is the product of the moment of inertia and the angular velocity: L = Iω. For a point of mass, angular momentum can be expressed as the product of linear momentum and the radius ( r): L = mvr. L is measured in units of kilograms‐meters 2 per second or more commonly joule‐seconds. The law of conservation of angular momentum can be stated that the angular momentum of a system of objects is conserved if there is not external net torque acting on the system.\nAnalogous to Newton's law (F = Δ( mv)/Δ t) there is a rotational counterpart for rotational motion: t = Δ L/Δ t, or torque is the rate of change of angular momentum.\nConsider the example of a child who runs tangential to the edge of a playground merry‐go‐round with a velocity v o and jumps on while the merry‐go‐round is at rest. The only external forces are that of gravity and the contact forces provided by the support bearings, neither of which causes a torque because they are not applied to cause a horizontal rotation. Treat the child's mass as a point of mass and the merry‐go‐round as a disc with a radius R and mass M. From the conservation law, the total angular momentum of the child before the interaction is equal to the total angular momentum of the child and merry‐go‐round after the collision: mrv o = mrv′ + Iω, where r is the radial distance from the center of the merry‐go‐round to the place where the child hits. If the child jumps on the edge, (r = R) and the angular velocity for the child after the collision can be substituted for the linear velocity, mRv o = mR( Rω)+(1/2) MR 2. If the values for the masses and the initial velocity of the child are given, the final velocity of the child and merry‐go‐round can be calculated.\nA single object may have a change in angular velocity due to the conservation of angular momentum if the distribution of the mass of the rigid body is altered. For example, when a figure skater pulls in her extended arms, her moment of inertia will decrease, causing an increase in angular velocity. According to the conservation of angular momentum, I o (ω o ) = I f (ω f ) where I o is the moment of inertia of the skater with arms extended, I f is her moment of inertia with her arms close to her body, ω o is her original angular velocity, and ω f is her final angular velocity.\nRotational kinetic energy, work, and power. Kinetic energy, work, and power are defined in rotational terms as K. E=(1/2) Iω 2, W= tθ, P= tω.\nComparison of dynamics equation for linear and rotational motion. The dynamic relations are given to compare the equation for linear and rotational motion (see Table )."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:2c5b16bd-fc61-4971-ac32-a77fb164e0f3>","<urn:uuid:808b4968-bd49-4788-80eb-a05b5fd9a11f>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I have keloids and want treatment - how long does keloid treatment usually take?","answer":"A proper treatment program for keloids requires sustained, repeated visits to your doctor for several treatments over six or more months. Without this sustained approach, success in treating keloids will be minimal at best. The treatment involves stopping fibroblasts from producing keloid-causing collagen and helping enzymes break down the tightly packed collagen to make it softer and flatter.","context":["Keloids are a very common type of scar that can be unsightly, painful and itchy. Anyone can develop keloids, but people of color develop them 15 times more frequently than others. Keloids may also run in families. They commonly occur on the ears but are also seen on the upper chest, back and arms. These scars are often a result of an injury or acne scaring, and can be very difficult to treat.\nWhat causes keloids?\nThroughout evolution, our body has developed an exquisite system to repair injured skin. If you think about it, our skin is all that protects our tissues and organs from injuries, and our immune systems from bacteria and infections. As a result, any time the integrity of the skin is interrupted, a rapid and elegant system springs into action to repair the defect (hole/cut/injury).\nSpecial cells called fibroblasts start producing collagen and other substances to fill in the defect. This process essentially “patches the hole.”\nUnfortunately, for some people, the fibroblasts don’t get the message that their work is done, so they keep making more and more collagen. This excess collagen turns into a scar that can become very large, and may even spread to normal skin outside of the injury area, making it very unsightly. The collagen can also get packed so tightly that it presses on nerves, causing extreme pain and itching.\nSome patients mistakenly think that the keloid formation (in a surgical scar) is the result of something the doctor did wrong, but a keloid is really a result of a person’s genetics and their body’s healing response.\nHow are keloids diagnosed?\nKeloids can be diagnosed by a physician or dermatologist. They occur in areas of injury or from acne scars on the chest, shoulders, upper arms and back. Scars called hypertrophic scars can be confused with keloids, but they generally stay at the site of the injury, and their collagen is parallel to the surface of the skin.\nKeloids, on the other hand, spread to normal skin around the injury and the collagen is deposited in a very random manner. Thus, a biopsy may be required for the precise diagnosis.\nCan keloids be prevented?\nIf you have a history of keloids, take careful measures to avoid getting injured or cut. Also be sure to have a plan with your dermatologist to treat any cuts or injuries right away to prevent them from turning into large, unsightly, painful keloids.\nHow are keloids treated?\nIt is important to realize that a scar can never be changed back into normal skin. With the correct treatment, however, keloids can be minimized and managed. When I treat keloids, my goal is to reduce the symptoms of pain and itching, flatten the scar, and even out the dark skin color.\nThe treatment of keloids involves two processes: 1) Stop the fibroblasts from producing keloid-causing collagen and other substances; and 2) Help enzymes in the skin break down the tightly packed collagen in the keloid to make it softer and flatter.\nI use a combination of anti-inflammatory injections, topical silicone preparations, pressure ear-rings, laser treatments and, if needed, surgical excision to effectively manage and treat keloids. I design a specific program for every patient that will serve them best.\nAction steps for anyone with unwanted keloids\nIf you have a keloid, you do not have to suffer through the pain and itching. Although difficult to treat, keloids can be managed effectively by an experienced physician or dermatologist.\nIt is very easy to surgically remove keloids, but it is hard to keep them from coming back. Keloids on the ears, however, are an exception — they are the only area on the body that is not a certain predictor of developing keloids elsewhere.\nA proper treatment program for keloids means sustained, repeated visits to your doctor for several treatments over six or more months. Without this sustained approach, success in treating keloids will be minimal at best.

{"question":"How do researchers track olfactory neuron survival after odor exposure?","answer":"Researchers track olfactory neuron survival by using a novel method involving a noninvasive adenovirus technique to label the olfactory sensory neurons. This allows them to monitor the survival of these neurons after they are exposed to odorants and to examine the signaling pathways involved in cell survival. Using this technique, they can observe how exposure to odorants enhances the survival of certain neuron subpopulations.","context":["A new study finds that the olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) exhibit activity-dependent survival, a property that may be critical for an animals ability to maximize and retain responsiveness to crucial odorants in its environment. The research, published in the March 25 issue of Neuron, finds that a molecular signaling pathway linked to neuronal survival in the central nervous system plays a significant role in odor-induced enhancement of olfactory cell survival.\nIt is well known that the olfactory epithelium can adapt in the very short term to odorant stimulation by receptor desensitization and habituation. However, the ability of odorants to stimulate long-lasting changes in OSNs has been suggested but not clearly elucidated. Dr. Daniel R. Storm and colleagues from The University of Washington in Seattle developed a novel method to monitor the survival of OSNs after stimulation with odorants and to examine the signaling pathways required for cell survival. OSNs were labeled using a sophisticated noninvasive adenovirus technique. Exposure to odorants enhanced the survival of subpopulations of unperturbed neurons and neurons that were exposed to a stimulus that normally causes cell death. Further investigation revealed that the ERK/MAP kinase/CREB pathway is directly involved in odorant-stimulated rescue of OSNs.\nThe researchers conclude that OSNs are capable of dynamic long-term adjustment to sensory information in the environment. This is significant for animals because the persistence of odorant-detecting cells would be dictated by odorants encountered in the environment, some of which might be critical for survival. These results are also important for humans. \"The identification of a chemical pathway that protects olfactory sensory neurons from cell death has important medical implications since olfactory sensory neurons die during a number of conditions including sinusitis and head injury. In addition, we lose about 1% of our sense of smell per year as we age, and olfaction loss is associated with several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimers and Parkinsons disease. The data in this paper suggests that drugs that activate the Erk/MAP kinase pathway may be used to protect olfactory sensory neurons from cell death associated with sinusitis, head injury, aging, and neurodegenerative diseases,\" explains Dr. Storm.\nHeidi Hardman | EurekAlert!\nOne step closer to reality\n20.04.2018 | Max-Planck-Institut für Entwicklungsbiologie\nThe dark side of cichlid fish: from cannibal to caregiver\n20.04.2018 | Veterinärmedizinische Universität Wien\nUniversity of Connecticut researchers have created a biodegradable composite made of silk fibers that can be used to repair broken load-bearing bones without the complications sometimes presented by other materials.\nRepairing major load-bearing bones such as those in the leg can be a long and uncomfortable process.\nStudy published in the journal ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces is the outcome of an international effort that included teams from Dresden and Berlin in Germany, and the US.\nScientists at the Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf (HZDR) together with colleagues from the Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin (HZB) and the University of Virginia...\nNovel highly efficient and brilliant gamma-ray source: Based on model calculations, physicists of the Max PIanck Institute for Nuclear Physics in Heidelberg propose a novel method for an efficient high-brilliance gamma-ray source.

{"question":"As someone who works in construction, I'm wondering how the noise limits for construction sites compare to the general nighttime noise regulations in cities?","answer":"Construction sites and urban areas have different noise regulations. For urban areas, the nighttime noise limit (10 PM to 6 AM) is 75 decibels measured up to one metre from the sound source, with violations potentially resulting in fines of Rs one lakh or five years' jail under the Environmental Protection Act. For construction sites, while specific decibel limits aren't mentioned, noise monitoring is required and workers often need personal sound exposure meters (PSEMs) to monitor noise levels throughout their shifts. Construction sites also use noise warning signs that light up at preset trigger levels to indicate when hearing protection is needed, though continuous use of hearing protection isn't recommended as workers might miss important alarm systems or warnings.","context":["Noise pollution has become a major problem of modern times. Due to increasing urbanization, transportation (rail, air, and road) and mining, the problem of noise pollution is assuming serious dimensions. Virtually, noise has become an inevitable evil of growth and development.\nRoad congestion, the noise of vehicles, maddening sounds of horn all create such chaos that it seems that your ears will burst. Moreover, factory sirens, jarring sound of the running of machines and film songs ringing loud on loudspeakers too contribute in the increase in noise pollution. For the last some decades, the rise and pollution has drawn the attention of governments all over the world. Industrialization, modern means of transportation, population growth, urbanization and increasing human activities are taking their toll on the human and animal habitat.\nToday, man is living amongst deafening noises. The noise produced by motor vehicles, trains, jet aircraft, and sound amplifier devices installed at temple-mosque, synagogue and housing societies is having an adverse effects on human health. Hoarse voices emanate from factories; various businesses hit our ears and make our mind turbulent. Modern means of transport such as bus, car, truck, motorcycle, train, aircraft, etc fill the air with all kinds of sounds. Nowadays homes are very close to one another in cities, increasing the amount of domestic noise. The noise of radio, television and other sound-broadcasting devices is also growing day by day. Different kinds of sounds are occurring around us, giving rise to mental stress, deafness and health problems. This issue requires urgent attention now.\nFollowing are the major sources of noise pollution:\nAlmost all industrial areas are affected by noise pollution and a major reason for this is the sound generated by machines. Boilers and turbines installed in thermal power plants generate considerable noise in their surroundings. Most industries are established in urban areas, where there is higher intensity of noise pollution.\n- Means of transport\nVarious forms of transport are also a major cause of noise pollution. All these means produce sound in extremely high volumes. The pollution by these modes spreads across a large area. The total number of vehicles in India in 1950 was 30 million, whereas the total number of registered motor vehicles reached approx. 210 million in March 2015. In Lucknow alone, more than one lakh vehicles are registered and their number is increasing by 5 to 10 percent annually. Considering the above facts, one can only imagine the enormity of rising air pollution along with noise pollution.\nMan uses various means for his entertainment such as TV, radio, music systems, etc but these instruments cause unbridled noise. Loudspeakers and DJs used in wedding engagement programs, religious events, etc, greatly contribute towards noise pollution.\nUse of different machines and tools in various construction works leads to increased noise pollution with adverse effects on the health of construction workers as well as people living in the surroundings.\nThe firework at display on various occasions in our country is also a source of noise. Firework is a common item during various fairs, festivals, and cultural/marriage ceremonies. Crackers are burst to express the joy of India winning a cricket match. But apart from air pollution due to these fireworks, the intensity of their sound is so high that it gives rise to problems such as noise pollution.\nDuring Diwali, noise pollution levels due to fireworks increase many times in cities. As crackers are burst over fixed standard hearing limits, many people suffer damage in their ears and some also develop allergy. In cities, generally, bursting crackers of more than 125 decibels of sound is banned but despite various measures adopted by the Pollution Control Board, the level of noise is increased every time during festivals.\nExchange of words held among populations gathered at various social, religious functions, political rallies, and meetings of trade unions produce a deafening din. Similarly, intolerable noise is generated at market places, schools, colleges, bus stands, and railway stations due to the huge population present there. Similarly, several other smaller causes give rise to noise pollution. For instance, less wide roads, the lack of alternative arrangements for those who sell goods on the street, traffic in the peak hour traffic, etc.\nDue to growing population of cities and towns, lack of proper congregation sites as well great cost entailed in booking them on rent, people often occupy public road or pathway in front of the house and turn it in the venue of their event. This does not only block but even shuts the whole passage. Whereas under the Article 19 (1) (d) of the Constitution, citizens have the right to walk on uninterrupted barrier-free road. Obviously, organising such events also leads to noise pollution. As events take place late at night, the sleep of the residents of that area is bound to get disturbed. The situation becomes even more difficult for those who are mentally or physically unable to bear loud sounds. During night-long Jagrans, week-long religious programmes and all kinds of other entertainment events, standard sound limits are not followed. Students, in particular, suffer the consequences most as their studies are interrupted. Noise at the time of examination poses a serious threat to their future. Often such programs are patronized by local MLA/MP, so, the local authorities do not take any action despite complaints.\nNoise Pollution and Law\nAccording to rules, any kind of noise pollution is prohibited that emanates from scooter, car, bus horns, DJ, loudspeaker, marriage band, or musical instruments played during religious functions held in open space from ten at night until six in the morning. During this period, no one is allowed to produce any kind of noise that exceeds more than 75 decibels (up to one metre from the source of sound).\nBut law enforcement agencies have often been found to be grossly wanting in enforcing the law of the land. Parties and religious functions go at high pitch throughout the night, causing restlessness in the community. But if the people are determined they can force police action in such violations of the prescribed limits of sound and the time beyond which no noise is allowed to take place. In fact, the violators of these rules can be imposed a fine of Rs one lakh or five years’ jail, or both, may be sentenced together under the Environmental Protection Act, 1986 , besides Section 290 and 291 of the IPC. Thus, the problem of noise pollution needs to be dealt with in right earnest.","Noise monitoring for Building sites\nAll construction sites are likely to produce noise which cannot be completely prevented. This noise, however, can be a danger to construction workers and a nuisance to people who live in the vicinity. Control methods exist to minimise noise exposure levels and prevent loss of hearing to workers on building sites.\nWork patterns in the construction industry vary greatly and can last from days to years depending on the project. As such, a noise monitoring solution that can measure noise on a short-term or a long term basis is often obligatory in this type of environment and industry.\nConstruction noise combines both the type of long-term noise exposure that falls under the category of Noise at Work and, also, environmental noise issues which can cause a nuisance from a distance, such as construction or demolition work taking place close to private housing.\nConstruction Noise Levels\nEmployees working on a construction site often need to make quick decisions on a daily basis. The nature of their jobs may require them to move from one location to another, use moving or mobile machinery and operate in difficult to reach areas. Therefore the availability of a noise measurement device that is rugged, easy to use and portable may be the answer to checking on their noise exposure, especially in multi-site scenarios.\nRegular noise ‘spot checks’ using a sound level meter at different locations on a construction site help to determine quickly if there is a possibility of a problem by showing a reading in decibels. Some noise meters can be mounted on a tripod at a boundary position and left to measure noise over a specific period of time or over a number of ‘fixed duration’ measurements.\nThere are also a number of instruments that can help identify whether workers are potentially at risk from excessive noise and determine whether hearing protection is needed. It is worth noting that, for safety reasons, it is not always advisable for workers on sites to wear hearing protection continuously as alarm systems or warnings for example could be missed.\nOther tools to carry out professional noise surveys on sites and measure personal noise exposure can be used. These are better known as PSEM or Personal Sound Exposure meters. These are tiny units that can be mounted on the worker’s body such as the shoulder and monitor the hearing second by second over a working shift. The data is stored internally and can be simply read at the end of each shift or transferred to a PC to both provide a record and allow the company to do an analysis of the noise.

{"question":"What is the significance of Troy both as a legendary city in Greek mythology and as a real archaeological site in modern-day Turkey, and how has this dual identity been preserved through history?","answer":"In Greek mythology, Troy was the setting of the legendary Trojan War, immortalized in Homer's Iliad, which describes a decade-long siege following Paris's abduction of Helen. The war involved major heroes like Achilles and Hector, and ended with the famous Trojan Horse strategy. As a real archaeological site, Troy is located at Hisarlik in northwest Turkey, near the Dardanelles. The site's historical connection has been recognized for at least 2,700 years, since ancient Greeks colonized the area. The city flourished through multiple periods, with at least 10 different cities built on top of each other, creating a tell (human-made mound). A new city called Ilium was even founded there during Roman Emperor Augustus's reign and continued through the Byzantine era. Today, the archaeological site at Hisarlik continues to attract tourists and maintains its connection to the legendary city through the nearby village of Troia.","context":["Warfare > Trojan War\nIn Greek mythology, the Trojan War was waged against the city of Troy by the Achaeans (Greeks) after Paris of Troy took Helen from her husband Menelaus, king of Sparta. The war is one of the most important events in Greek mythology and has been narrated through many works of Greek literature, most notably through Homer's Iliad. The Iliad relates four days in the tenth year of the decade-long siege of Troy; the Odyssey describes the journey home of Odysseus, one of the war's heroes. Other parts of the war are described in a cycle of epic poems, which have survived through fragments. Episodes from the war provided material for Greek tragedy and other works of Greek literature, and for Roman poets including Virgil and Ovid.The war originated from a quarrel between the goddesses Athena, Hera, and Aphrodite, after Eris, the goddess of strife and discord, gave them a golden apple, sometimes known as the Apple of Discord, marked \"for the fairest\". Zeus sent the goddesses to Paris, who judged that Aphrodite, as the \"fairest\", should receive the apple. In exchange, Aphrodite made Helen, the most beautiful of all women and wife of Menelaus, fall in love with Paris, who took her to Troy. Agamemnon, king of Mycenae and the brother of Helen's husband Menelaus, led an expedition of Achaean troops to Troy and besieged the city for ten years because of Paris' insult. After the deaths of many heroes, including the Achaeans Achilles and Ajax, and the Trojans Hector and Paris, the city fell to the ruse of the Trojan Horse. The Achaeans slaughtered the Trojans (except for some of the women and children whom they kept or sold as slaves) and desecrated the temples, thus earning the gods' wrath. Few of the Achaeans returned safely to their homes and many founded colonies in distant shores. The Romans later traced their origin to Aeneas, one of the Trojans, who was said to have led the surviving Trojans to modern-day Italy.The ancient Greeks believed that Troy was located near the Dardanelles and that the Trojan War was a historical event of the 13th or 12th century BC, but by the mid-19th century, both the war and the city were widely seen as mythological. In 1868, however, the German archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann met Frank Calvert, who convinced Schliemann that Troy was a real city at what is now Hissarlik in Turkey. On the basis of excavations conducted by Schliemann and others, this claim is now accepted by most scholars.Whether there is any historical reality behind the Trojan War remains an open question. Many scholars believe that there is a historical core to the tale, though this may simply mean that the Homeric stories are a fusion of various tales of sieges and expeditions by Mycenaean Greeks during the Bronze Age. Those who believe that the stories of the Trojan War are derived from a specific historical conflict usually date it to the 12th or 11th centuries BC, often preferring the dates given by Eratosthenes, 1194–1184 BC, which roughly corresponds with archaeological evidence of a catastrophic burning of Troy VIIa.","This video says about itself:\nMarch 1, 2013\nTroy (Ancient Greek: Ἴλιον, Ilion, or Ἴλιος, Ilios; and Τροία, Troia; Latin: Trōia and Īlium; Hittite: Wilusa or Truwisa; Turkish: Truva) was a city, both factual and legendary, in northwest Anatolia in what is now Turkey, south of the southwest end of the Dardanelles / Hellespont and northwest of Mount Ida. It is best known for being the setting of the Trojan War described in the Greek Epic Cycle and especially in the Iliad, one of the two epic poems attributed to Homer. Metrical evidence from the Iliad and the Odyssey seems to show that the name Ἴλιον (Ilion) formerly began with a digamma: Ϝίλιον (Wilion). This was later supported by the Hittite form Wilusa.\nA new city called Ilium was founded on the site in the reign of the Roman Emperor Augustus. It flourished until the establishment of Constantinople and declined gradually during the Byzantine era.\nIn 1865, English archaeologist Frank Calvert excavated trial trenches in a field he had bought from a local farmer at Hisarlık, and in 1868, Heinrich Schliemann, wealthy German businessman and archaeologist, also began excavating in the area after a chance meeting with Calvert in Çanakkale. These excavations revealed several cities built in succession. Schliemann was at first skeptical about the identification of Hissarlik with Troy, but was persuaded by Calvert and took over Calvert’s excavations on the eastern half of the Hissarlik site, which was on Calvert’s property. Troy VII has been identified with the Hittite Wilusa, the probable origin of the Greek Ἴλιον, and is generally (but not conclusively) identified with Homeric Troy.\nToday, the hill at Hisarlik has given its name to a small village near the ruins, supporting the tourist trade visiting the Troia archaeological site. It lies within the province of Çanakkale, some 30 km south-west of the provincial capital, also called Çanakkale. The nearest village is Tevfikiye. The map here shows the adapted Scamander estuary with Ilium a little way inland across the Homeric plain.\nBy Owen Jarus, Live Science Contributor:\nAncient Troy: The City & the Legend\nThe name Troy refers both to a place in legend and a real-life archaeological site. In legend, Troy is a city that was besieged for 10 years and eventually conquered by a Greek army led by King Agamemnon. The reason for this “Trojan War” was, according to Homer’s “Iliad,” the abduction of Helen, a queen from Sparta. This abduction was done by Paris, the son of Troy’s King Priam. Throughout the “Iliad” the gods constantly intervene in support of characters on both sides of the conflict.\nTroy also refers to a real-life ancient city located on the northwest coast of Turkey which, since antiquity, has been identified by many as being the Troy discussed in the legend. Whether the Trojan War actually took place, and whether the site in northwest Turkey is the same Troy, is a matter of debate. The modern-day Turkish name for the site is Hisarlik.\nThe idea that the city was Troy goes back at least 2,700 years, when the ancient Greeks were colonizing northwest Turkey. In the 19th century, the idea again came to popular attention when a German businessman and early archaeologist, Heinrich Schliemann, conducted a series of excavations at Hisarlik and discovered treasures he claimed to be from King Priam.\nTroy the legend\nThe Trojan War is believed to have taken place near the end of the Bronze Age. That is around or before 1200 B.C. It took place around the time that a civilization that we call Mycenaean flourished in Greece. They built great palaces and developed a system of writing.\nThe earliest accounts of this war come from Homer, who lived around the eighth century B.C., several centuries after the events took place. They do not appear to have been written down until even later, likely during the sixth century B.C., when a tyrant named Peisistratus ruled Athens.\nHomer’s “Iliad” is set in the 10th year of the siege against Troy and tells of a series of events that appear to have taken place over a few weeks. The story makes clear that the siege had taken its toll on the Greek force sent to recover Helen. The “timbers of our ships have rotted away and the cables are broken and far away are our wives and our young children,” the poem reads (translation by Richmond Lattimore).\nThe war had essentially become a stalemate with the Greeks unable to take the city and the Trojans unable to drive them back into the sea. We “sons of the Achaians [Greeks] outnumber the Trojans — those who live in the city; but there are companions from other cities in their numbers, wielders of the spear to help them,” the “Iliad” reads.\nA number of key events happen in the poem, including a duel between Menelaos or Menelaus), the king of Sparta and husband of Helen, against Paris. The winner is supposed to receive Helen as a prize, ending the war. However, the gods intervene to break up the duel before it is finished and the war continues.\nAnother important duel occurs nears the end of the poem between Achilleus (or Achilles) and a great Trojan warrior named Hektor (or Hector). The Trojan knows that he’s no match for the Greek warrior and initially runs three laps around Troy, with Achilleus chasing him. Finally, the gods force him to face the Greek warrior and he is in turn killed.\nContrary to popular belief, the “Iliad” does not end with the destruction of Troy but with a temporary truce after which the fighting presumably continues. Another Homeric work called the “Odyssey” is set after the destruction of the city and features the Greek hero Odysseus trying to get home. That poem briefly references how the Greeks took Troy using the famous “Trojan Horse,” a gift concealing warriors within.\n“What a thing was this, too, which that mighty man wrought and endured in the carven horse, wherein all we chiefs of the Argives were sitting, bearing to the Trojans death and fate!” reads part of the poem (Translation by A.T. Murray through Perseus Digital Library).\nThe city’s origin\nThe site of Hisarlik, in northwest Turkey, has been identified as being Troy since ancient times. Archaeological research shows that it was inhabited for almost 4,000 years starting around 3000 B.C. After one city was destroyed, a new city would be built on top of it, creating a human-made mound called a “tell.”\n“There is no one single Troy; there are at least 10, lying in layers on top of each other,” writes University of Amsterdam researcher Gert Jan van Wijngaarden in a chapter of the book “Troy: City, Homer and Turkey” (University of Amsterdam, 2013).\nVan Wijngaarden notes that archaeologists have to dig deep to find remains of the first settlement and from what they can tell it was a “small city surrounded by a defensive wall of unworked stone.” Outside the largest gate was a stone with an image of a face, perhaps a deity welcoming visitors to the new city.\nTroy took off in the period after 2550 B.C., “the city was considerably enlarged and furnished with a massive defensive wall made of cut blocks of stone and rectangular clay bricks,” van Wijngaarden writes. He notes that on the settlement’s citadel were houses of the “megaron” type, which contained “an elongated room with a hearth and open forecourt.”\nWhen Heinrich Schliemann excavated this level of Troy in 1873, he discovered a cache of treasure, which he believed belonged to King Priam. “The collection of weapons, gold, silver, electrum, copper and bronze vessels, gold jewellery, including thousands of gold rings, and a range of other objects made of precious materials apparently came to light close to the outer side of the city wall near the building which Schliemann designated as the royal palace,” writes University of Queensland researcher Trevor Bryce in his book “The Trojans and their Neighbours” (Routledge, 2006).\nSome researchers have speculated that these treasures were not found all in one hoard but were rather precious objects, from across the site, which Schliemann gathered over a number of weeks. While Schliemann believed he had found Priam’s treasures it became clear in the following decades that these were a millennium too early for Priam.\n- Earth: The ruins of Troy. Yes, that Troy.

{"question":"As someone who wants to understand traditional crops better, how do landrace chiles in New Mexico contribute to agricultural resilience, and what global efforts exist to preserve such crop diversity?","answer":"New Mexican landrace chiles have adapted over 400 years to cope with specific local conditions like diseases, pests, and drought patterns in their respective valleys. They possess a broader genetic spectrum than modern hybrids, making them remarkably resilient and valuable for facing climate change and unpredictable weather. However, these varieties are being lost as farmers shift to modern hybrids. Globally, since the 1900s, about 75% of plant genetic diversity has been lost as farmers switched to uniform high-yielding varieties. Organizations like Bioversity International are working to preserve agricultural biodiversity through various initiatives, including developing an Agrobiodiversity Index to track diversity in plates, markets, fields, and genebanks. They also promote mechanisms like Payments for Agrobiodiversity Conservation Services, where farmers receive non-monetary rewards for conserving disappearing varieties.","context":["A Passion for Peppers: The Movement to Save New Mexico’s Treasured Chiles\nNew Mexico's traditional landrace chile varieties have adapted to hot days, cold nights, and long dry spells. But can they survive modern agribusiness?\nHere in New Mexico, autumn starts with the smell of roasting chile. In parking lots and on roadsides, aproned vendors turn the cranks on rotating gas-fueled drums filled with fragrant chile peppers. Even as a young child, before I could get through a whole plate of my aunt’s spicy enchiladas, before I enjoyed my father’s piquant chile caribe, before undergoing the New Mexican rite of passage from tender-tongued child to ardent chile-eater, I savored the wafting smell of chile that enveloped my hometown every harvest season. It was then, and always will be, the smell I associate with shorter days, returning to school, wood-gathering time, and most of all, home. For New Mexicans, chile is more than just a food: it is an icon, a passion, a tradition.\nWorldwide, we are losing traditional, local varieties of domesticated plants at an alarming rate.\nBut New Mexico is losing its traditional landrace varieties of chile, due largely to modern agribusiness and the societal shift away from small farms. “Landrace” is a term for domesticated plants and animals that have been raised in a specific area for long periods of time and have adapted to a particular region. They have a much broader genetic spectrum than modern hybrids, which are bred for a narrow range of specific traits. These older landrace varieties are remarkably resilient and their DNA is a valuable genetic resource, especially as we face climate change and increasingly unpredictable weather.\nWorldwide, we are losing traditional, local varieties of domesticated plants at an alarming rate. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations reports that “Since the 1900s, some 75 percent of plant genetic diversity has been lost as farmers worldwide have left their multiple local varieties and landraces for genetically uniform, high-yielding varieties.”\nChile was first cultivated in Central and South America—the word chilli is from the Aztec language, Nahuatl. Spanish Captain General Don Juan de Oñate, who colonized the Rio Grande, is generally credited for bringing chile seed from Mexico in 1597. Since Oñate’s arrival, successive generations of Native and Hispanic farmers in New Mexico have been selecting and planting chile that exhibit characteristics favorable to their particular locale. Dozens of distinct chile landraces have developed along the Rio Grande Valley, each named for the place it has been cultivated: Cochiti, Escondida, Jemez, Puerto de Luna, and so on. And in the higher altitudes of northern New Mexico—where summer afternoons that soar to the 90s are often followed by nights that cool to the 50s—local varieties cope much better with the temperature range than lowland varieties.\nIt’s not just about survival. “The cool nights and hot days are what give our chile its incredible flavor,” claims farmer Matt Romero, dangling a specimen of his family’s Alcalde chile variety between his thumb and forefinger. He adds, “This chile is ready to harvest in 70 days.” I met with Romero at his farm in the village of Alcalde on a hot late-August morning. The Rio Grande rumbled just a couple hundred yards away, beyond an impressive stand of cottonwood and locust trees. Romero’s lush fields of cauliflower, eggplant, squash, and chile contrasted with the dry, naked bluffs rising across the river.\nHigh-desert mountains, like the Sangre de Cristos that surround my hometown of Santa Fe and the Romero family farm in Alcalde, offer conditions that can augment greater levels of genetic diversity. I learned this one fall afternoon while I sat underneath a narrow-leafed cottonwood tree. I had taken my two daughters to Little Tesuque Creek so they could play on their favorite swing, a tire suspended by a thick rope from a large limb of the cottonwood. The creek is dry in early October, and autumn leaves filled the narrow creek bed. The girls shrieked in delight as they swung over the silent stream of leaves, golden in the glow of late afternoon, while I sat nearby in the sun and read.\nI had taken along Gary Paul Nabhan’s book, Where Our Food Comes From: Retracing Nikolay Vavilov’s Quest to End Famine. Nabhan, a farmer, seed conservationist, and ethnobiologist, expands on the pioneering studies of Nikolay Vavilov, a Russian botanist and geneticist renowned for identifying the centers of origin of domesticated plants. In his global travels from 1917 to 1933, Vavilov discovered that semiarid, mountainous regions were ideal for fostering reticulate evolution, a process that requires a delicate balance between isolation and hybridization.\nNabhan explains that when seeds are dispersed into distinct watersheds, they become isolated from others of their own species by the harsher, non-arable terrain surrounding the watershed. This microclimate, with its various “bugs, birds, and microbes, places new selection pressures on the plant population, and it sooner or later diverges from its source population.” Seeds and pollen from other locations make their way into each isolated valley either by human hands or carried by animals, floods, fires, and high winds, providing a limited, but crucial, source of novel genes.\nThat golden afternoon, I put my book down and looked across the dry creek. I realized my girls and I were playing and reading in the very kind of watershed Nabhan describes. His description of reticulate evolution gave me a new understanding of the relationship between food and place. When Hispanic and Native farmers began planting the Aztecs’ chile seed, each watershed and valley was isolated enough that in the ensuing four hundred years, under the influences of both natural selection pressures and human cultivation, each landrace diverged from the original seed stock and each valley developed a slightly different landrace from the next.\nChimayó chile has adapted to cope with the diseases, pests, and drought patterns specific to the Chimayó valley; Jemez chile has the genetic information to survive conditions in Jemez, and so on. This diversity is valuable for sustaining our future food supply. Paul Bosland, Regents Professor of Horticulture at New Mexico State University (NMSU) and director of the Chile Pepper Institute, emphasizes that “the genetic diversity found in these [landrace] varieties will be very useful as the climate changes,” especially as we experience drier, more volatile weather.\nTraditional New Mexican farmers are aging, and younger generations are abandoning farming. Those who do still farm find it hard to resist the higher-yield crop varieties that can bring in more revenue. But because modern hybrids like Big Jim or New Mexico No. 9 are selected for specific traits like thicker, straighter fruit or higher yield, they lose the complex genetic makeup of their progenitors. Homogeneity provides a more consistent crop, but increases a crop’s vulnerability to disease and difficult growing conditions.\nBut landrace crop varieties are going extinct, too, and just like the Dodo, once lost they’re gone forever.\nLandraces are “fading fast,” explains Kraig Kraft, co-author (with Nabhan and Kurt Michael Friese) of Chasing Chiles: Hot Spots Along the Pepper Trail. “The problem is that, with the declining number of growers for each of these types, each population or variety of chile has fewer and fewer plants out in the field, reducing the genetic diversity in each.”\nWhen modern hybrids cross-pollinate with landraces, the resulting seed is contaminated with some of the genes of the hybrid. A study by Bosland and his colleagues at NMSU explains that the landraces that made the newer New Mexico chile cultivars a commercial success have already been lost. Farmers either stopped growing them in favor of the new varieties or crops were “genetically ‘swamped’ through uncontrolled outcrossing” with hybrids in neighboring fields.\nExtinction is often associated with undomesticated species—frogs from the Andes, birds from the Solomon Islands, medicinal plants from the Amazon. But landrace crop varieties are going extinct, too, and just like the Dodo, once lost they’re gone forever.\nNew demand for heirloom chiles\nThere are probably more landrace chiles growing in Chuck Havlick’s little experimental plot than in any other single location in New Mexico. As we walked along ridges and furrows, Havlik, an NMSU graduate student, pointed out the subtle differences between varieties with the tenderness of a loving parent. He hopes his studies will eventually help chile farmers “find more economic value” in their local varieties and that awareness of the landraces will help communities protect them for future generations. Havlik is hopeful; he believes there is a burgeoning market for place-specific food.\n“These varieties have become cultural markers for small communities within the state,” he says. “There is passion in these communities for the chile they grow. There is pride.”\nEven conventional farmers are slowly beginning to respond to the consumer trend toward local varieties. John Bunker, owner of Fedco Seeds in Maine, has made a name for himself in the last forty years saving old apple varieties and has developed a large and diverse following. He has even, as he puts it, “wormed his way into the hearts” of nearby conventional orchardists, even though they initially thought his obsession with old local varieties was crazy: “I got to know a few commercial apple growers over the years. They would frequently say that the old varieties were just yuck and that we should just get rid of them. Now my commercial orchardist friends say, ‘Hey, I sold all the heirloom varieties I had today. I could have sold twice as many!'”\nWhen we support farmers by buying their local varieties, they have more economic leverage to continue their work.\nThis is the good news about preserving heirloom and landrace varieties—we have power as consumers and eaters. Whether we’re chile-eaters, apple-eaters, endive-eaters, or all of the above, we can seek out varieties specific to our region. Farmers markets and CSAs are gaining ground, and any eater should be able to be part of the Slow Food movement.\nMatt Romero is proud of the Santa Fe Farmers Market’s robust food stamp program. He feels that many of the folks shopping at his stand know they could make their penny or food stamp go farther in a big box grocery store, but they choose his food because it’s local, fresh, tastier, and more nutritious. When we support farmers by buying their local varieties, they have more economic leverage to continue their work and plant the crops that can help carry us to a safer, more sustainable, more stable, more satiating food future.\nAn uncertain future\nIt’s an especially cold, wet December. I trudge through ten inches of snow to the extra freezer we keep out in our shed for a bag of Romero’s Alcalde chile. The smell of it defrosting in the sink brings warm October afternoons into my kitchen.\nAs I watch my husband chop green chile with garlic and then add salt, much the way his mother did and his grandmother before her, I think of the stories behind this ancient food: how it was first cultivated alongside avocado and beans, how the Aztecs perfected the art of chile domestication and had markets filled with dizzying arrays of different varieties, how the Spaniards, not wanting to live without this new, adored food source, brought seed north with them to New Mexico, and how it has been shaped both by the people who have grown it and by the high-desert-mountain valleys that have sheltered it for the last 400 years.\nThis food has traveled thousands of miles, endured tens of thousands of fall harvests, and fed generations. This is one of the many ancient stories that accompany the food on our table. As my daughters, my husband, and I sit down to eat, I wonder: Will we continue to plant, eat, and save these old varieties? Will we honor their stories?","Bioversity International released a new report analyzing how agrobiodiversity, or the biological diversity of food, can improve food system resilience, sustainability, and nutrition. Titled “Mainstreaming Agrobiodiversity in Sustainable Food Systems,” the 200-page report outlines how biodiversity can help us produce foods that are both nutritious and sustainable.\n“Agrobiodiversity—the edible plant and animal species that feed each and every one of us—holds the key to future food security,” said Ann Tutwiler, Director General of Bioversity International, “But we are failing to protect it, and tap into its potential to transform our food system for the better.”\nBioversity International is a research-for-development organization focused on preserving agricultural and tree biodiversity as a means of improving nutrition security, promoting sustainable agriculture, and adapting to climate change. They are a CGIAR Research Center, part of a global food security research partnership. Bioversity works with partners in low-income countries to disseminate scientific evidence, management practices, and policies that protect biodiversity. The report focuses on healthy diets (nutrition), production (sustainability), seed systems (food security), and conservation (resilience).\nFood Tank had the opportunity to discuss the report and agrobiodiversity with Ann Tutwiler, Director General of Bioversity International.\nFood Tank (FT): What has led to a global decrease in agrobiodiversity?\nAnn Tutwiler (AT): Many factors. From the production side, a focus on ‘feeding the world’ rather than ‘nourishing the world’ has led to a focus on a handful of starchy staples that has contributed to an increase in land planted with maize, wheat, and rice from 66 percent to 79 percent of all cereal area between 1961 and 2013.\nOn the consumption side, there is a growing global tendency towards Western diets and processed convenience foods. Diets are based more and more on major cereals, plus sugar and oil. So these now dominate our agricultural production. Of the 30,000-ish plant species that can be used as food, today only three—rice, wheat, and maize—provide half the world’s plant-derived calories and intakes of pulses, fruits, and vegetables are low.\nAt the same time, the same pressures that are driving the sixth mass extinction of wild biodiversity are also affecting agricultural biodiversity—habitat transformation, deforestation, invasive species, and climate change. They also lead to disruption in pollinators and natural pest control. Loss of wild biodiversity can lead to erosion of genetic diversity (like the wild relatives of crops, which are a valuable source of traits for breeding), which reduces options for breeding new plant varieties better adapted to climate change.\nFactor in the policy environment in some countries. When farmers are not allowed to trade local seeds, it also suppresses demand for these seeds. And when farmers and other natural resource managers stop using local materials, we also lose the local knowledge about those species and varieties. Once that knowledge is lost, a vicious cycle of loss is started as the seeds and breeds cannot be optimally used.\nPolicies for conserving seeds in genebanks and making them available for breeding programmes have tended to focus on staple cereals. Only two percent of global collections are of crop wild relatives and less well-known species.\nWe should point out though that there is no way yet to accurately measure the decrease in agricultural biodiversity. It is notoriously difficult to measure the exact status of crop and animal genetic diversity. A study in 2014 classified 58 percent of domesticated animal breeds as of unknown risk status. Also for crops, there are huge data gaps—number and distribution of species and their genetic diversity—so it is difficult to determine genetic erosion. One challenge is the richness of the diversity—even if we consider only the 150 to 200 crops commercially cultivated, it is hard to identify, monitor, and conserve it all.\nThis is one reason why Bioversity is working on an Agrobiodiversity Index and suggests ways to measure the agricultural biodiversity on plates and in markets, in fields, the wild, and genebanks worldwide and track changes in it.\nFT: There is a global paradox, where millions go hungry while billions are obese and both groups can suffer from micronutrient deficiencies. What has led to this paradox and how can agrobiodiversity address it?\nAT: One of the main drivers of malnutrition is poor diet. Diet-related factors are now the number-one risk factor of morbidity and mortality globally, more than tobacco smoke and air pollution. If people ate more plants, in line with standard dietary guidelines, it would have a positive effect on diets and on the environment, reducing global mortality by 6 to 10 percent and food-related greenhouse gas emissions by 29 to 70 percent.\nTapping into the planetary wealth of diverse fruits, vegetables, pulses, and grains, particularly nutrient-dense varieties, can address both overweight and micronutrient deficiencies. We eat food, not micronutrients! For example:\n- More healthy options within food groups—expanding the range of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, seeds, pulses. Biodiversity is recognized as a fundamental principle in recent dietary guidelines like the Mediterranean Diet Pyramid, the Nordic guidelines, and the Brazilian guidelines.\n- Important and significant nutritional differences between species. For example, in Bangladesh, although people started eating more fish, their nutritional intake decreased from eating exotic farmed fish rather than nutrient-dense local fish. Then there are species many people have never heard of—Gac, for example, is a fruit from South East Asia with extremely high levels of beta-carotene, which the body converts to vitamin A.\n- Important and significant nutritional differences within species. For example, some bananas are orange and contain very high levels of beta-carotene; others are white and contain none. Different varieties of potato can contain between 6 mg and 37 mg of vitamin C.\n- Since many less well-known plants, fish, animal, and trees are well adapted to local environments, they can be more tolerant to low inputs or climate fluctuations and so can be selected to provide a portfolio of nutritious foods all year round, integrating small animals, green vegetables, and fruit trees.\n- Food has to be accessible, affordable, acceptable, and available. Food biodiversity is often all four.\nTo address it, food, health, and agriculture policies need to be linked to one another. Policies for food and seeds need to expand the focus on maximizing yield and profit to also include considerations of diets and nutrition. Brazil is a great example of this. Brazil has recently targeted several policies to promote local and indigenous biodiversity for food and nutrition as part of its Zero Hunger campaign. Actions taken in Brazil include promoting diverse, healthy native foods in dietary guidelines, supporting production of food biodiversity through public procurement strategies (e.g. for food in schools), and prioritizing food biodiversity in relevant national strategies, action plans, agriculture, and nutrition policies.\nFT: Increasing agrobiodiversity, for instance growing more varieties of wheat, would seem difficult to implement in places like the United States that rely on mass agricultural production and distribution. What can be done to encourage agrobiodiversity in these types of systems?\nAT: The general rule is that larger farms are more specialist and this is consistent with the way that intensified, industrial farming has gone over the last 50 years in much of the Western world. There will always be a need for large-scale farms that produce commodities for massive consumption, this is also a part of food security. But there is a risk that using a single variety across vast areas leaves such crops open to attacks by pests and diseases. To counter this, the industry and farmer response is often to use large quantities of pesticides, fungicides, and so on, which is expensive as an input, has a negative impact on environmental factors such as water quality and (wild) biodiversity, and has high fossil fuel inputs. Moving to a more diverse system (and this could be different crops in different seasons, not necessarily different crops in different physical areas) can reduce risks of total loss and reduce risk of pest and disease damage. This can then lead to reduced input costs, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, and reduced environmental impacts.\nNow, how does this happen in these kinds of systems? A great deal would need to happen in order to allow this to happen, not least in the increase in extension services (agroecology tends to be knowledge-intensive). To do so would potentially kick-start a revolution in agricultural employment in rich countries. What might drive this? A demand for greater diversity in diets from the public, increased concern over food safety and environmental health, and a general rise in what is being termed ‘sustainable intensification’ (increasing production whilst reducing environmental impacts, in its most simplistic definition). Such approaches might be ideal for incentivization through farmer payments, preferential markets, and tax incentives, for instance.\nTwenty or so years ago, approaches like organic agriculture were considered a bit whacky, but now supermarkets are embracing organic, and consumers are asking for more diversity in supermarkets, school lunches, and retail outlets. People want to know more about where their food comes from, lowering food miles, local farmers’ markets, heritage varieties, and so on.\nFor businesses, diversity makes sense as a strategy to reduce risk. Left unchecked, degraded agrobiodiversity can cause direct production losses that might even be catastrophic. The Irish potato blight, which decimated the two dominant potato varieties in the mid-1800s, is one example. In the 1970s, U.S. maize crop was severely threatened by corn blight, which destroyed almost US$1 billion worth of maize and reduced yields by up to 50 percent in 1978. The crisis was addressed by using blight-resistant genes from wild types of Mexican maize.\nEven in and around mass agricultural production, there are many ways to encourage agrobiodiversity, such as encouraging pollinators, natural pest predators, soil biodiversity, and green manure. In Californian rice production near Sacromento, a change to flooding stubble instead of burning it ended up doubling winter wetland habitat at the peak of waterfowl migration. These fields now provide habitat resources for 203 species of wildlife and 9 million migratory waterfowl, with no drop in rice yields.\nThe USDA Conservation Reserve Program is an example of practices that can work with mass agricultural production. For example, using buffer strips to encourage wild–cultivated interactions on farms, or adding copses of trees within cropping systems.\nFT: You bring up quinoa in one of your examples. According to the Whole Grains Council, there are more than 100 types of quinoa, but only three have been commercialized, leading to a loss of biodiversity. In a global market, how can this type of trend be reversed? How can all strains be commercialized and preserved?\nAT: Actually, there are thousands, not hundreds! Those that have been commercialized so far tend to satisfy a market for pearly white grains (Quinoa Real). And there are perhaps 15 to 20 varieties that one finds in the national and international markets (not three).\nHow can the trend be reversed? In Bioversity’s research we use a kind of triage—categorizing grains as marketable, potentially marketable, and non-marketable. The first category takes care of itself. The second category needs market development, and we can explore other product options besides just grains, like the experience we have had making and marketing a milk from a hardy quinoa variety called ‘chullpi.’ For the third category, we have had success with an approach called Payments for Agrobiodiversity Conservation Services (PACS), which is based on the Payments for Ecosystem Services approach. Farmers receive a non-monetary reward for conserving varieties that are disappearing from farms. Rewards can be things like agricultural inputs, machinery, school buildings, and materials. The communities themselves decide which priority species or varieties they are interested in, the conditions for their participation, and how they will share the rewards within the group and among other community members.\nCertainly not all kinds can be commercialized, which is why other mechanisms (like PACS) are needed to preserve them. In order to decide which varieties to invite communities to preserve, we use prioritization methodologies, based on genetic analyses and mathematical models, so as to make sure that for a given budget the widest possible genetic diversity is conserved.\nA complementary way to preserve species and varieties that don’t have a clear commercial value in the present, is to collect them in genebanks, some of which can be seedbanks managed at the community level or community seedbanks.\nFT: How does intercropping, growing multiple types of crops in close proximity, effect harvest efficiency? Can it be implemented at a large scale and how?\nAT: The first thing to be aware of is that intercropping is a pretty broad church. It can take many forms and occurs in a multitude of production systems. For instance, systems can include annual cropping, perennial crops, agroforestry, and aquaculture. Approaches to intercropping can be very diverse, from legumes and green manure (offering a very direct nitrogen application to the soil and other crops, as well as nutrition through the intercropped species, to pollination through habitat provision for pollinators), to mixed polycultures such as rice-fish systems (increased nutrition, natural pest control, organic fertilizer).\nIn terms of harvesting, if we are talking about different crops in different seasons, then this is unlikely to present a physical or technological obstacle. If they are in the same field, then you have to have a different structure, tall plants and short plants for example. Or they can be in adjacent fields. Bioversity’s research into using bean diversity to reduce pest damage found that having different varieties of bean in adjacent fields reduced pest damage, and of course would be easy to harvest.\nSo, yes it can be implemented at scale. It’s a question of choosing the right intercropping form that works for what you need.\nFT: What is the Agrobiodiversity Index and how do you hope it will make a difference?\nAT: World hunger is on the rise again. There is likely to be an understandable push towards increasing food production, but we cannot afford a ‘produce at all costs’ mentality. We need to grow food in ways that are sustainable—lower pesticide and fertilizer use, rebuilding soils, providing habitat for pollinators and pest predators. Also we need to make sure that the ‘Produce More’ mentality doesn’t just churn out more empty carbs. We are already in the midst of a malnutrition epidemic.\nSolutions are needed that combine consideration of producing more nutritious foods, while reducing environmental impacts, and conserving our natural resources. Food is the connector. Current food systems drive environmental degradation and obesity, so changes in them could drive environmental good health and human health.\nThe Index is unique because it looks across consumption and production and conservation. The book pulls together the science behind the index, not looking at diets or production or conservation but diets and production and conservation, which is why we refer to the triple win. Many indicators have been developed in each of the domains of agrobiodiversity—measuring diet diversity, on-farm diversity, supply diversity, and so on—but they usually remain separate and so the potential synergies and trade-offs are invisible.\nStarting from the scientific evidence base in the four dimensions described in this book, the Agrobiodiversity Index will bring together agrobiodiversity data in innovative ways to give novel insights, which can help countries and companies identify policy and business levers, and guide public and private investments. It will be launched in mid-2018."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:b7a433ec-45a5-40a2-9c10-550f84f06f58>","<urn:uuid:c64c2159-550f-45d0-bce6-93c3e0846d71>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the key design elements and technical specifications that distinguish the TAG Heuer Targa Florio watch, particularly in relation to its historical inspiration?","answer":"The TAG Heuer Targa Florio, released in 2001, was actually inspired by the Heuer Flieger chronographs of the 1930s rather than the Italian road race it was named after. The watch features several distinctive elements including a coin-edge bezel, bold white numerals at each hour (with chronograph sub-dials overlapping the '10' and '2'), an over-sized crown, and specific chrono re-set buttons. The first model (Ref. CX2110) was powered by a Calibre 17 (ETA 2894-2) movement and initially featured a plexi-glass crystal, which was later replaced with sapphire crystal in subsequent models (Ref. CX2112).","context":["The TAG Heuer Targa Florio was released in 2001 and marketed as tribute to the famous Italian road race, despite actually drawing its inspiration from the Heuer Flieger (German for “Pilot”) watches of the 1930s.\nThe early 2000s were a renaissance period for lovers of the TAG Heuer re-edition series, with TAG releasing a steady stream of watches that drew their looks from the old Heuer catalogue.\nThe Targa Florio was one of three new re-edition watches announced as part of the classics series. The highest profile of these 2001 releases was the blue TAG Heuer Monaco in the Steve McQueen colours- up until that point, the Monaco that had been available from the late 1990s had only been available in black and silver. Alongside the new blue Monaco was the Calibre 36 version of the TAG Heuer Monza (the El Primero movement) and the Targa Florio.\nThe official press release at the time described the Targa Florio as follows:\n“In a complete revival of the timepiece worn by the F1 world champion Juan-Manuel Fangio, the new generation Targa Florio is faithful to its predecessor in its contemporary feel. It’s clean, black dial and seconds and minute counters make for a subtle, yet striking timepiece. The Targa Florio chronograph is available with a brown or black leather strap for a sporty look or an alligator strap for sophisticated chic”\nThe Targa Florio Road Race\nThe Targa Florio was an endurance road race that was first held in the mountains of Southern Italy in 1906. Created by wealthy enthusiast Vincenzo Florio, the Targa (meaning “Plate” or”Shield”) was the most prestigious motor race in the world in its early years, pre-dating the F1 World Championship by almost 50 years. The race itself was held over a course that varied in size, but was usually more than 70 kilometers long and wound its way through the villages of Palermo. Winners of the race included Stirling Moss, Nuvolari and in 1970, the Heuer-sponsored Jo Siffert. Ironically, while TAG Heuer promoted the Targa Florio with the image of Juan Manuel Fangio, he would never win the race, finishing second to his team-mate Moss in 1955.\nEventually the cars out-grew the circuit and safety concerns (led by Austrian Helmut Marko who today is a prominent member of the Red Bull Racing F1 team) led to the race losing its Sports Car World Championship status in 1973 and its cancellation all-together in 1977.\nThe inspiration for the design of the TAG Heuer Targa Florio were the Heuer Flieger chronographs of the 1930s, such as the watch pictured on the left which shows the later model featuring two chronograph buttons. There are many similarities between the Flieger and the Targa Florio- the coin-edge bezel, the bold white numerals at each hour (including the chrono sub-dial overlapping the “10” and the “2”), the over-sized crown and the shape of the two chrono re-set buttons are all a close match.\nDespite this, there was no connection between the original Heuer Flieger and motor racing.\nAn interesting side-story to the Flieger watches was the mysterious appearance of the over-sized Heuer Flieger watches beginning around the time that the Targa Florio was released. These fakes first emerged from Eastern Europe and took on several design cues from the TAG Heuer re-edition.\nTarga Florio Re-edition\nThe first Targa Florio (Ref. CX2110), pictured above, was powered by a Calibre 17 (ETA 2894-2) movement and featured a plexi-glass crystal. Later in the model-life, this plexi-glass was replaced by sapphire crystal, as it would also be on the 1957 Limited edition model.\nThe standard model with the sapphire crystal model has the reference CX2112.\nLimited Edition Targa Florio\nAround 2003 TAG Heuer released a limited edition Juan Manuel Fangio Targa Florio that was limited to 1957 watches- the year that Fangio won the last of his five F1 World Championships, this time driving for Maserati.\n- Sapphire crystal instead of plexi-glass\n- Fangio’s signature below the TAG Heuer shield\n- Number of each watch engraved on the back\nArgentina Special Targa Florio\nNot to be confused with the limited edition of 1957 watches, TAG Heuer also released a second Juan Manuel Fangio limited edition- this time of just 200 watches that were available only in Argentina (Ref. CX2111).\nPerhaps confusingly, this Fangio edition did not have his signature on the front of the watch, and so is basically identical to the original CX2110. It did come with a specially engraved case-back and a special tribute book. The price? USD20,000.\nI’ve seen two of these sets offered second-hand- one where the seller was seeking USD16,000 (not sure if it ever sold) and the second that did sell for almost USD8000- which still seems like a large premium over the standard model for a nice book and a personal letter from TAG Heuer.\nThe Targa Florio disappeared from the TAG Heuer catalogue around 2005, and I suspect that it was never a huge seller. However, it was a well-executed niche watch that is distinct from any other watch that TAG Heuer offer then- or now. Both the standard version of the watch and the 1957 limited edition are reasonably easy to find today and some retailers still have new stock watches.\nThe Targa Florio is a worthy part of the TAG Heuer re-edition series and one hopes that TAG Heuer will continue to produce niche watches like this that pay homage to the designs of some of the lesser known Heuer’s of the past.\nTAG Heuer; Mercedes Benz; OnTheDash; http://articulo.mercadolibre.com.ar/MLA-64760769-excepcional-tag-heuer-targa-florio-edicion-limitada-200-unid-_JM"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:12390388-40d0-4b30-90d6-3a23d0a29b5a>"],"error":null}

{"question":"What are the nutritional roles of simple carbohydrates in horses' diets, and how can these sugars contribute to the development of laminitis?","answer":"Simple carbohydrates serve as energy sources for horses, primarily derived from cereals, molasses, and spring grass. They are normally digested by enzymes in the small intestine and broken down to form glucose, which is transported via the bloodstream to muscle and other body cells for energy. Excess simple carbohydrates can be converted to glycogen and stored in muscles and liver for future use, or stored as body fat. However, these sugars, particularly Fructan (a complex sugar in grass), can cause laminitis when consumed in high quantities. When there is an overload of carbohydrates in the large intestines, bacteria multiply rapidly and produce lactic acid, reducing the pH from 7 to around 6. This kills beneficial bacteria, producing endotoxins that damage gut walls and allow lactic acid into the bloodstream, leading to systemic acidosis and inflammation of the hoof lamina, ultimately causing painful rotation of the pedal bone.","context":["Protein is important for body building and tissue repair. Protein is needed for the formation of muscles, bones, blood cells, enzymes, hormones, tendons, hooves, skin, the internal organs such as heart and liver, and indeed almost all body tissues. Proteins are made from chains of building blocks, called amino acids. There are 22 amino acids recognised as important in the horse’s diet. Approximately 12 of these amino acids are known as ‘essential amino acids’ as they have to be provided in the diet. The other amino acids can be synthesised by the horse as long as adequate protein is provided. Two of the essential amino acids most commonly in short supply or limiting to performance are lysine and methionine.\n|HIGH PROTEIN |\nFeedstuffs in the\n|Alfalfa Hay or |\n|LOW PROTEIN: |\nFeedstuffs in the\nAll cereals are particulary low in essential amino acids.\n|PASTURE has a very variable protein content depending upon the season. |\nTypical levels are as follows:\n|Winter||10%||(100 g/kg DM)|\nEnergy and Fibre\nEnergy is needed for maintenance of health and normal body functioning, eg breathing, temperature control etc. Additional energy over and above these MAINTENANCE requirements are needed for PRODUCTION which may take the form of growth, lactation or athletic performance.\nEnergy can be derived from several sources in the diet:\n1. ‘Simple’ Carbohydrates (sugars and starch)\n‘Simple’ Carbohydrates (sugars and starch) derived from cereals, molasses and of course there are very high levels of simple carbohydrates in Spring grass, and again in the Autumn flush of pasture.\nThe following are typical sugar levels in common horse feeds:\nTypical Sugar Level on DM Basis g/kg\n|Cubes:||12.5 – 25 g/kg|\n|Mixes:||37.5 – 50 g/kg|\n|Molassed Chaff:||225 – 250 g/kg|\n|Alfalfa Chaff:||85 – 100 g/kg|\n|Sugar Beet Pulp:||Up to 28% (280g/kg)|\n|Spring Grass:||Up to 250g/kg|\n|Molasses:||39 – 49%|\nThus the horse in the wild would receive quite a high sugar intake for some months in the year and a reduced level during the rest of the year, so he does receive ’sugar’ in his ‘natural’ diet. Simple carbohydrates should be digested by chemicals (enzymes) primarily in the small intestine but in cases of overload, such as access to an abundance of Spring grass, the small intestine becomes overwhelmed, and the sugars and starch pass undigested into the hindgut. The microbial fermentation of these simple carbohydrates can lead to many disorders ranging from laminitis to rhabdomyolysis (tying up). Simple CHOs are broken down to form predominantly glucose, which is transported via the bloodstream from the gut to the muscle and other body cells to act as an energy source at a cellular level. The simple CHOs not immediately required as an energy source are converted to a compound called glycogen and primarily stored in the muscles and liver for future use. If there is a significant over-supply of energy it will be stored as adipose tissue (body fat). The major forage sources fed to the modern horse include pasture, hay, wilted bagged forages and straw. Other feedstuffs providing high levels of complex CHOs include Sugar Beet and Chaff.\n2. Complex Carbohydrates (CHO)\nThese are often collectively known as fibre sources or forage and include cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin and other compounds. Fibre may be:\nINDIGESTIBLE (often referred to as roughage) and is an important dietary component, as it helps maintain gut motility and provide ‘scratch factor’ and the feeling of satiation, or:\nDIGESTIBLE from which the horse can derive nutrients.\nIndigestible fibre or roughage is the woody or lignified fraction of the plant which is not affected by the microbial fermentation and passes undigested through the gut. It plays an important role in keeping the gut contents moving.\nDigestible Fibre comprises those complex CHOs which cannot be digested enzymetically but which can only be broken down by the millions of beneficial micro-organisms (bacteria, yeasts, protozoa) which colonise the hindgut of the horse. These complex CHOs are broken down to produce compounds called volatile fatty acids (VFA’s) which are utilised by body cells to produce energy. The energy produced from the fermentation of digestible fibre should be sufficient to meet energy requirements for maintenance and light work as long as the forage is of high quality and has a suitable ratio of digestible to indigestible fibre.\nHorses have evolved as fibre eaters and their digestive system is designed to process large amounts of relatively poor quality fibre. However, the demands made upon modern horses mean that they would not be able to meet these demands on poor quality fibre sources alone. Using higher quality forage with a greater proportion of digestible fibre is necessary to help meet the nutrient requirements of the modern horse.\nAs a general rule the more mature the plant, the greater the proportion of stalk to leaf, and the more indigestible the overall plant becomes. All plant material contains fibre, but the seeds, eg cereals, provide much lower levels of fibre than the stalk and leaves.\nMost horses require at least 50% by weight of their diet to comprise complex CH0 fibre sources (hay, wilted bagged forage, pasture) or if long fibre is in short supply chaff can replace a proportion of the long fibre. Many horses and ponies in light work can derive most of their nutrient requirements from long fibre and indeed pasture can contain high sugar levels and very digestible fibre, in the Spring and Autumn, and it often exceeds the horse and pony’s requirements leading to overload disorders such as laminitis.\n3. Oils and Fats\nThese are made up from chains of fatty acids. As with the amino acids some of the fatty acids are more important than others. Soya oil, corn oil, wheatgerm oil and cod liver oil are all good sources of essential fatty acids. Oils and Fats provide more than twice the energy of CHOs and may be added to the diet of performance horses up to 8% of the horse’s total ration. (As with all feedstuffs oil should be introduced gradually. High dietary oil levels should only be used under expert advice as the requirements for other nutrients may be affected by high oil levels).\n4. Minerals and Vitamins\nAlmost every body process depends for correct functioning on the adequate presence of various minerals and vitamins. Minerals and vitamins rarely act in isolation but interact extensively with each other and with other nutrients. Thus a deficiency imbalance or excess of one mineral or vitamin can affect many body processes. In the wild the horse fulfilled his mineral and vitamin requirements through selective grazing of herbage from various types of soil encountered whilst he wandered over many thousand of miles. The modern horse, even when grass kept, does not have access to this density of plants or soils, and thus must rely upon concentrate feeding to complement and supplement the minerals and vitamins naturally present in the pasture or preserved forage.\n(required in larger amounts in the diet)\n|Macromineral||Specific areas |\n|Signs of deficiency|\n|Calcium and phosphorous||Bone and tooth growth and development.

Some vitamins from both groups can be manufactured by the horse. For example, B complex and K can be synthesised by the microbrial population in the hind gut, providing certain conditions of diet and environment are met. Furthermore, vitamin D can be manufactured by the action of sunlight on sterols present in the skin, and vitamin C by the liver. Almost every body process requires the presence of one or more vitamins for correct functioning. They may act in isolation, in combination with other vitamins, or interact with minerals. Vitamin activity is sensitive to light, heat, moulds and oxidising agents and will deteriorate with time, especially if exposed to these conditions. Thus, feed storage should be closely controlled.\nFAT SOLUBLE VITAMINS\n|Fat-soluble vitamin||Specific areas |\n|Signs of deficiency|\n|Vitamin A(may be referred to as beta-carotene, a precursor of vitamin A which is converted by specialist cells in the gut to the active form retinol).||Normal eye function.

Until these are known and their roles determined it is essential that a consistent, balanced ration is fed to all types of horse and pony.\nWater is an essential nutrient involved in almost all metabolic reactions. The body tissues of a mature horse contain about 60% water, whilst those of a young horse contain 70-80% water indicating the extra requirement for water during growth. The horse can lose almost all its body fat or over half its body protein without major ill effects, but a 10% water loss can cause disorders and a 20% loss can be fatal. The average horse requires approximately 12 gallons of water per day depending on workload, dietary constituents, relative humidity and stage of life-cycle. Water quality is also important. Level of nitrates, heavy metal contamination and degree of microbial contamination may all affect the horse.\nOur HorseHage range comes in four different varieties offering different energy values, allowing you to choose the variety most suitable for your horse.View Range","Advice article filter\nSugar causes laminitis\n‘The sweet seducer’\nThe nightmare of many horse owners in the turning out season is laminitis. The fear of too much protein in the feed determines the behaviour a great deal. But protein is not the cause of laminitis at all. This is the result of the research carried out by the Australian professor Christopher Pollitt (University of Queensland):”sugar is the main cause of laminitis”.\n“The assumed relationship between laminitis and protein is easy to explain as the disease appears most of the time in the spring when the new grass grows and the grass contains a lot of protein”, states veterinary surgeon Leendert Jan Hofland, member of the Pavo GroomingTeam. This is a team of experts who provide free advice to horse owners on www.pavo.net. “According to the latest findings, the main cause of laminitis during the turning out season is a complex sugar, called Fructan, which is produced by grass”, states Vincent Hinnen, who is also a member of the Pavo GroomingTeam. He refers to the investigations of the Australian professor Christopher Pollitt.\nFructan causes laminitis\nThe complex sugar Fructan, a polysaccharide, is produced in grass through the influence of sunlight during the photosynthesis (the metabolism of grass). It is a building stone and is used as a temporary store of energy, produced by the photosynthesis and not directly used for the growth of the grass. The amount of energy produced and used depends on many factors. Among them, the intensity of the sunlight, the temperature and the type of grass: A lot of sunlight and warmth means strong growth, resulting in low levels of Fructan. Sunlight and cold cause a high level of photosynthesis and little growth, resulting in a high proportion (90%) of the energy stored as Fructan and carbohydrates (starch).\nThe horse as diabetic\nThe Fructan content in grass changes a lot: When cold and sunny the content is 200 times higher as when warm, overcast or rainy days. Vincent Hinnen warns: “You can expect the highest levels of Fructan when sunny and freezing, when the temperature at night is below 5 degrees Celsius, when the fields have not been fertilised or when it is extremely dry. In contrast, a lot of protein intake during the turn out season is no problem”. Veterinary surgeon Drs. Hofland states: ”The horse can deal with a temporarily too high intake of protein. Especially when the horse can get used to that gradually”.\nA returning sugar-high is bad for the horse as it is for human diabetics. “The blood sugar level increases sharply when the horse eats a lot of sugar rich grass in spring. The body of the horse can’t cope with that”, states Vincent Hinnen. “Also the gut flora in the large intestines can’t process such high concentrations of Fructan”. Vet Hofland adds: “Hard feeds containing a lot of carbohydrates and sugar, or feeds with a lot of barley and maze, can’t be digested properly in the small intestines. As a result they are digested in the large intestines”. Vincent Hinnen continues: “ The process is as follows: the hardly or undigested food mass ends up in the large intestines, which are populated by bacteria who can digest roughage cells and carbohydrates.\nBecause of the surplus of carbohydrates, the relevant bacteria multiply explosively and produce lactic acid as a by-product. This lactic acid reduces the pH value in the large intestines from 7 (neutral) to a more acidic value like 6. This kills the bacteria, which digest the roughage cells and this dying produces poisons, called endotoxins. These damage the lining and walls of the guts and lactic acid gets into the bloodstream. That causes the whole organism to become acidic, including the hooves, resulting in the inflammation of the hoof lamina, which causes the irreversible and extremely painful relocation and rotation of the pedal bone. In other words: the horse or pony has laminitis”.\nThe right grass\n“Fields sown with English rye grass is not ideal for horses, because this grass produces a lot of leaves and therefore, could produce a lot of Fructan. In areas where horses have always lived, the situation is different. In the wild, horses eat a different type of grass, their eating is spread over the whole day and there is less grass per square meter. In modern equestrian centres, the horses eat more in less time”, says Vincent Hinnen.\n“Horse owners should sow types of grass with low Fructan levels”, he advices. The nutritional expert declares the idea that rich fields are more dangerous than topped fields as nonsense. The stems can store big amounts of Fructan. On the other hand, there is less grass in topped fields, so the horse will eat less grass, which reduces the chance of getting laminitis. His basic advice is: “In spring, limit the time the horses are turned out or reduce the size of their field or turn them out in a small paddock with little or no grass. In those cases, remember that you have to feed the horses hay with long stems. You also have to be extra careful with horses who have had laminitis before. They are ultra sensitive and hay can also contain Fructan.\nRoughage has to be the essential ingredient of a horse’s overall diet. The only way to play safe with hard feed, is to feed expanded cubes or roasted mixes (muesli’s). That way the treated carbohydrates can de digested properly. Vincent Hinnen adds: “horses who are prone to get laminitis are not allowed grains like barley or maze, because only 30% of their carbohydrates can be digested. If you insist on feeding grain, then use oats, as their carbohydrates are 80% digestible”.\nHis advice is, that after a cold night, you should only turn the horses out in the afternoon. Also, fertilise the fields early in the year with 10 to 15 cubic meter of composted manure. The manure contains phosphorus, potassium and nitrogen, which reduce the sugars. The most important reason to fertilise is to keep the grass growing. No growth means that the Fructan is not changed into energy and stays in the grass."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:1d634ad5-8b98-44f1-b77f-4d066176b796>","<urn:uuid:1bd83430-7f72-4c1a-a6b8-44a0b145e1f7>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Why do modern flat rooftops use membrane systems instead of traditional asphalt, and how can these spaces be designed for outdoor living?","answer":"Modern flat rooftops use membrane systems instead of traditional asphalt because they provide better sealing at connection points, are easier to repair, resist UV damage without requiring gravel, and handle expansion/contraction better.

It is used on flat or nearly flat roofs to prevent leaks and move water off the roof. Membrane roofs are most commonly made from synthetic rubber, thermoplastic (PVC or similar material), or modified bitumen (“torch down”). These types of materials have become the replacement for asphalt roof systems, which is an older, less effective type of flat roofing system. Membrane roofs are most commonly used in commercial application, though they are becoming increasingly more common in residential application.\nContractors and engineers will choose a type of membrane roofing based on the requirements of the job and the attributes of the material. Costs for membrane roofing can range from as little as $125 per square (100 square foot area), to $350 per square or more. Membrane roofing systems consist of not only the membrane itself, but also any insulation, flashing, roof accessories and sealants.\nBuilt-up Roofing (BUR)\nBuilt-up roofing, or BUR for short, consists of layers of organic/inorganic felts saturated with liquid asphalt or coal tar. BUR has been providing reliable protection against the elements for many years.\nThe layers are installed in an overlapping fashion; each layer is referred to as a ply. Applications can consist of 2 plies, or as many as 5 plies or more. Commonly referred to as a Tar & Gravel roof, the uppermost surface is often topped with small stones to provide additional protection from damage and UV degradation.\nModified Bitumen, Mopped & Torch Downs\nModified bitumen membrane roofing is essentially a pre-manufactured, built-up roofing system. Thick layers of reinforcing felts and liquid bitumen are bound together in the manufacturing facility and shipped to the job site in roll form. Chemical modifiers enhance the attributes of the liquid bitumen to make it suitable for job conditions.\nModified bitumen roofing can be applied in a method similar to built-up roofing, by using hot liquid bitumen that is mopped in place, or it can be installed by torching it down. As the roof membrane is being unrolled, a worker uses a torch to melt the leading edge of the roll into a liquid that acts as a binder to hold the material down.\nThermoplastic Olefin (TPO)\nThermoplastic Olefin, commonly called TPO, are plastic sheets welded together with hot air creating one continuous membrane. These components can be re-welded, with the exception of CSPE, making repairs easy to administer. These traits lend themselves well to both large and small roof applications because of the hot air versus torch down welding.\nTPO is a single-ply roofing system consisting of a Thermoplastic Polyolefin membrane. The TPO membrane is typically comprised of three layers: a polymer base, a strong, polyester-reinforced fabric center (scrim) and a tough thermoplastic polyolefin compounded top ply.\nOther Types of Membranes\nOther types of membrane roofing such as chlorosulfonated polyethylene (CSPE), ethylene-propylene-diene-monomer (EPDM), polyisobutylene (PIB), and polyvinyl-chloride (PVC) consist of large sheets of material that are joined together using various chemical or thermal methods.\nPrimers and adhesives can be used along overlapping edges to form an impervious joint between sheets, or heat welding can also be utilized to turn all the pieces into one large roof covering.\nThe large sheets are then applied to the roof surface by using one of several methods. A ballasted roof uses the weight of stones or blocks of concrete, similar to pavers, to hold the roofing in place. Strips of metal fastened to the structure at all edges and seams can also be used. Another popular method is to use an adhesive that is similar to contact cement to hold the sheets down.\nAdvantages Over Asphalt Flat Roofing Systems\nThe application types of membrane roofing listed above have distinct advantages over the previous flat roofing method of asphalt and gravel. In asphalt and gravel applications, it can be very difficult to create a proper seal at all seams and connection points. This can cause many roofs to leak early in a lifespan , and require more intensive maintenance.\nWhen installed correctly, newer materials are either totally seamless, or have seams as strong as the roof body. The primary concern people have with flat roofing is leakage, and the newer systems should eliminate many of those issues\nRepairs for asphalt and gravel roofs can be difficult, mainly because it can be hard to locate the exact point of a leak. Newer systems can be patched relatively easily, and cracks and leaks are easier to locate.\nOriginally asphalt roofing required a layer of gravel as the top layer for two reasons. First, asphalt with direct exposure to sunlight degrades faster, due to the expansion and contraction and the damage created by UV rays. Second, asphalt needs the gravel weight on it to hold down the roof because it “sits” on the top of a building, instead of being attached to it.\nEach of the three newer types of membrane roofing systems contain materials that resist expansion and contraction, and have advantages against UV rays. Also, because these membranes have strong seams, when normal expansion and contraction does occur, its damage to these seams is exponentially reduced. Best of all these newer roofing systems are also attached directly to the top of a building, which eliminates the need for excess weight, and greatly reduces stress on your structure."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:dcf1238b-623a-477c-b37f-e93f78b67c43>","<urn:uuid:a6670357-907d-4bc8-817c-b78e0438bcc2>"],"error":null}

And the testing can be done at a closer distance, without the patient leaving the exam chair,” says Michael Fischer, O.D., chief of optometry service at the Northport Veterans Affairs Medical Center, in Northport, N.Y., and a consulting low vision clinician at Lighthouse International.\n“Additionally, it can make the initial testing a more positive experience for low vision patients with significantly reduced acuity—they might only see the big E on your projector chart, but they will be able to read many more targets on a low vision chart,” he says.\n• Mars contrast sensitivity test. “Contrast sensitivity function can be a much better predictor of visual function than high-contrast letter charts,” says Kevin Houston, O.D., a low vision expert who works in the vision rehabilitation laboratory at the Schepens Eye Research Institute at Massachusetts Eye and Ear. “I use the Mars test, which is held by hand at near and can easily be administered by a technician.”\n• Minnesota reading card. “A continuous text reading card, such as the MN Read, will often pick up problems not evident with traditional single letter testing,” Dr. Houston says.\nSimple Suggestions for Patients\nLow vision rehabilitation involves more than providing a few low vision devices. Encourage patients to join a support group, says Kevin Houston, O.D.\n• Tactile stickers. “Adding tactile stickers to appliances and devices can assist low vision patients in using their washing machine or microwave with ease by feeling the markers,” Dr. Protosow says. Touch Dots are an example of these stickers, and can be purchased online.\n• Improve lighting and contrast in the home. “Good lighting that is specific to the task is important,” Dr. Protosow says. “Many people like the new LED lights on the handheld magnifiers and full-spectrum lights for reading because they are bright and give even illumination.”\nEven simple, direct lighting with a gooseneck lamp will help patients with low vision, Dr. Houston says.\n• Talking watches and clocks. “Even when patients really want to use their vision as much as possible, when they are tired or have a bad day, it can be too taxing. Sometimes the simplest device, like a talking watch, can really help,” Dr. Protosow says.\n• Enhance contrast at the dinner table. “Different color plates, cups, placemats, etc., can provide a lot of help to a low vision patient,” Dr. Fischer says. For example, “don’t put the coffee in a brown mug—put it in a white mug so you can see the level as you pour. Have your white meat chicken with rice on a dark plate so you can see it, and put it on a white placemat so you see the edges of the plate,” he says.\n• Recommend large-print devices. “Encourage patients to use large-number clocks and watches, big-button phones, large-print checks, and the like,” Dr. Fischer says.\nPrescribe Helpful Devices\nCriteria for Low Vision Referral\nRefer to a low vision specialist if:\n• The patient complains about visual function and it is not likely to improve in the next three months.\n• The patient’s best-corrected acuity is worse than 20/30 in the better eye and is not likely to improve in the next three months.\n• The patient’s visual field in the better eye is 50º or less.\n• The patient has any visual impairment and asks you to fill out a driver’s form, or asks you if driving is OK.\n“I have traditionally asked my referring docs to refer using these criteria, while giving special attention to referring patients with mildly reduced best-corrected acuity (20/30 to 20/50),” Dr. Houston says. “These patients have the most urgent need because they are typically in the early stages of vision loss and are in danger of losing function and independence.”\nHe prefers that the primary care optometrist continues to do the routine exam with dilation but sends the patient to him annually for a low vision device update. “In this way, we’re working as a team, each delivering the service we are best equipped to provide,” he says.\n“If you have a vision rehab clinic nearby, I suggest referring patients if they have complaints, or if their better eye has best-corrected vision less than 20/30 or has visual field constriction beyond 50º,” Dr. Houston says. (See “Criteria for Low Vision Referral,” at left.)\nBut if you don’t have a low vision clinic nearby—or even if you do—all optometrists should be comfortable providing “entry level” low vision rehabilitation care. This includes:\n• Adds greater than +2.50. “The combination of a gooseneck lamp and a +3.50 add can solve many problems,” Dr. Houston says.\nDr. Fischer advises, “In reality, you don’t necessarily need anything special in your office to test patients with higher adds. You can use your trial lens set. Just don’t be afraid to test higher adds—that may be all some patients need. Don’t forget to calculate the proper working distance for the add you are testing and make sure the patient holds the print at that distance.”\n• Handheld magnifiers. “If your patient has very reduced acuity and needs a lot of magnification, you might feel more comfortable referring to a low vision practitioner. But for patients with acuities better than 20/200, you can test hand magnifiers that are not that difficult for the patient to use and help them quite a bit,” Dr. Fischer says. “Have some magnifiers with lights—they can be a big help in restaurants and other places where the lighting is not the best.”\n• Telescopes. “Again, you don’t have to do anything sophisticated to help some of your patients with low vision,” Dr. Fischer says. “A simple telescope to see signs in the supermarket or on the street can be a big help. Shoot for an acuity in the 20/40 to 20/50 range through the telescope. It won’t always be the answer, especially if the patient has poor contrast, but it might help.”\n• Filters/tints. “Sunglasses in a contrast-enhancing tint, such as brown or amber, are useful as long as the patient’s green color perception is not desaturated beyond what is needed for driving,” Dr. Houston says.\nCutting-edge Technologies and Gadgets\nLow vision patients don’t necessarily need sophisticated, high-tech equipment. For example, a simple telescope can be a big help to see street signs, says optometrist Michael Fischer (on right) with a low vision resident and patient.\nRecent advances in technology can enhance the lives of low vision patients.\n• E-readers (Kindle) and Tablets (iPad).“The Kindle and the iPad have been great tools for my patients because of their relatively large screen size and reading- and contrast-enhancing functions,” Dr. Houston says.\nThe iPad (as well as the latest iPhone and other Apple products) incorporates a number of accessibility features for visually impaired users, including Zoom and VoiceOver, Dr. Fischer adds.\nSmartphones, on the other hand, are visually demanding and require a visual acuity of 20/20 to 20/40 to be fully operational, even with magnification tools, Dr. Houston says. “So, ask your visually-impaired patients if their vision prevents them from using or purchasing a smartphone. Handheld magnifiers are cumbersome to use with a phone or tablet and something spec-mounted, such as a loupe or high add, is typically needed,” he says.\n• GPS with voice commands. “For driving and mobility, the voice-guided GPS systems have helped to improve patients’ safety. My bioptic drivers who have GPS are less dependent on their telescope for reading signs, which frees them up to concentrate more on vehicle control and braking,” Dr. Houston says.\nFind a Low Vision Specialist\nTo find a low vision specialist in your area, contact:\n• American Academy of Optometry Fellows and Diplomates in Low Vision, www.aaopt.org/section/lv/diplomates.\n• American Optometric Association Vision Rehabilitation Section. Or use the AOA’s Dr. Locator search, www.aoa.org/x5428.xml, and choose “low vision rehabilitation” under the “Practice Emphasis” pull-down option.\nAlso, a retina specialist in your area is often able to give a recommendation for low vision rehabilitation.\nAlso, O.D.s should “become familiar with some of the accessibility features incorporated into the operating systems of PCs and Macs, as well as the options built into web browsers,” Dr. Fischer says. “Most browsers allow the user to magnify a web page simply by holding down the control key and hitting the plus key repeatedly until the page is large enough to see.”\nSeek the assistance and expertise of a true low vision specialist early on, say Drs. Protosow, Fischer and Houston. Low vision specialists are often very willing to comanage with the referring optometrist, they say. (See “Find a Low Vision Specialist.”)\nIn short, providing low vision doesn’t have to be complicated, tedious or time consuming. Do what is best for these patients to provide them with optimal visual function in their everyday lives, and the sooner the better.","By Mohammad Bajwa, PhD, CPHIMS, CPHI, RHIA, MCSE\nWhile it has only just emerged this century, the use of mobile health technology (mHealth) in the delivery and management of healthcare is gaining traction due to the global implementation of health information technology. This is exemplified mostly by electronic health record (EHR) systems, wherein patients’ health information resides on computers and travels on computer networks. Normally, the information stored on computers is accessed through wires and is limited to places where such infrastructure exists. With the advent of wireless technology, electronic health information can be accessed by anybody, anytime from anywhere and on any mobile device as long as wireless connectivity is available. Despite this advantage, the security of health information stored on and accessed through mobile devices is cause for public concern. Wireless communication is prone to hacking, and mobile devices, given their size and value, increase the chance they will be lost or stolen.\nmHealth is defined as the use of mobile devices (mDevices) in the practice of medicine. These include mobile/cellphones, iPads, tablets, personal and notebook (laptop) computers, personal digital assistants (PDAs), and similar other devices that use wireless technology to access health information networks. Such devices often use radio waves for communication either through central access points (hot spots) or satellites. Of these, mobile phones have emerged as the greatest mobile technology gadgets.\nSince wireless signals travel through the atmosphere, diffuse in all directions, and can pass through most physical barriers, they are liable be intercepted. The intent of this article is to review wireless technology, its use in healthcare, its security issues, and best practices to make safe use of this novel technology for the delivery and management of healthcare.\nTypes of mHealth Security\nBefore discussing the security of mHealth, it is appropriate to enumerate four types of information security requirements: physical, network, application, and user security.\nPhysical security implies the security of computers, network hardware, and storage media against intruders and natural disasters. The most common mitigative security measures for this purpose includes using ID badges and biometric authentication for entry to premises, locking computers with desks, and regular backups for data restoration in case of any human-made or natural disasters.\nNetwork security denotes the protection of data and information residing on computers and in transit over the network/internet through techniques like encryption (encodes data, rendering it unreadable by unauthorized persons) and technologies such as firewalls (controls both inbound and outbound data based on the nature of traffic and source); virtual private networks (makes private data communication channel in the public network such as internet); network intrusion detection (notifies the network administrator of any intrusion by email, text message, alert); and intrusion detection and prevention systems (blocks intruder and reports to network administrator).\nApplication security requires validation of services accessing the information, level of information access and use permissions, software patches and updates, software logs, and input validation techniques (best defense against malware/spyware injection).\nUser security is a three-step process that entails user identification through user ID, authentication through password, biometric or two-factor authentication (verifies user), and authorization through permissions (what the user can access and do).\nData Transmission Media\nData and information on the network travels either on wires (wireline transmission media)—the most common being the copper cables (network and coaxial or TV cables) and fiber optic (FO) cables—or wirelessly through the atmosphere. For the discussion of data security, it is pertinent to examine how data travels on these two types of transmission media and their security vulnerabilities.\nWireline Transmission Media\nThe two types of wireline transmission media are copper cables and fiber optic (FO) cables. Copper cables transmit data through voltages (electrical signals), called electromagnetic (EM) waves, as pulses (5 volts representing 1) or no pulses (representing 0). The data from these cables can be stolen by placing a device close to the cable, which can sense pulses and covert them back to 1s and 0s. To avoid this, some copper cables are shielded (covered with aluminum foil) to stop pulses from being detected externally. One typical example of this type of cable is TV (coaxial) cable that not only shields data being braided but can also transmit it at multiple voltage levels, thus catering to the needs of TV, internet, and digital phone requirements simultaneously. Contrary to the copper cables, FO cables are made of glass or highly transparent plastic and transmit data as light pulses. Its twofold benefits include data transmission at almost the speed of light (several times faster than copper cables) and data security, as light pulses cannot be detected externally. Besides being fast and secure, FO cables transmit data in multiple frequencies, enabling several data channels in one cable (video, internet, phone). Verizon FiOS is one such example.\nWireless signals are also EM waves, but unlike the wireline media, they travel through the air or atmosphere at different frequencies (amplitudes). They are advantageous in areas where wired networks cannot be set up (old and historical buildings) or are required temporarily (training or classroom setup). Because the wireless signals radiate in all directions and can pass most physical barriers, they are very valuable in hospital environments or healthcare organizations with mobile workforces. However, they are the least secure, as they can easily be intercepted by monitoring devices, and data can be interrupted, interjected, modified, stolen, rendered unusable, or even destroyed.\nMobile Technology (mTechnology)\nmTechnology is based on wireless technology that moves with the user. It is a portable two-way communication network and includes internet-enabled devices like smartphones, tablets, notebook computers, and navigation devices. mTechnology touches all aspects of our daily lives from starting the day with the alarm clock in your phone; managing the day through your calendar, reminders, and notes; communicating through emails, texts, social media; and accessing online information like maps, books, magazines, files, photos, and videos. The common four types of mTechnologies are:\n- Cellular or radio networks: Use distributed cell towers that enable mobile devices (cellphones) to switch frequencies automatically and communicate without interruption across large geographic areas.\n- Packet switching technology (5G network): Organizes data into packets for transmission and reassembles packets into information at destination.\n- Wi-Fi: Radio waves that connect devices to internet through localized routers.\n- Bluetooth: Connects devices over short distances using short-wavelength radio waves.\nMobile Health (mHealth)\nmHealth is the use of mTechnology in healthcare. The World Health organization (WHO) defines mHealth as the “use of mobile and wireless technologies to support the achievement of health objectives,”1 while the National Institutes of Health (NIH) describes it as “use of mobile and wireless devices to improve health outcomes, healthcare services, and healthcare research.”2\nThus, mHealth is the practice of medicine and healthcare over mobile devices, like smartphones, tablets, and iPads, such as eVisit (only mode of remote healthcare delivery service during COVID-19 pandemic). Although traditionally used for wellness management, their use for healthcare both by patients and providers has increased exponentially.3\nCurrently, mHealth technologies are being used for patient monitoring, patient-provider communication, telehealth, and e-health. Although the lines between telehealth (also referred to as telemedicine) and e-health are blurred, they are two different technologies. E-health is the electronic communication of information for improving patient’s health, while telehealth uses video, smartphones, or any wireless tools or telecommunications technology (network/internet) for specific healthcare delivery and is named after the type of healthcare service: telenursing, telepharmacy, telerehabilitation, teleradiology, teletrauma care, telepsychiatry, telepathology, and teledermatology. Telehealth requires license and an infrastructure to practice, while e-health has no such requirements. Both became routine during COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe global health data breaches in 2020 increased to 24.5 percent against financial services breaches (7.3 percent), once being the reverse.4 Thus, it is pertinent to elaborate on some mHealth security issues to understand their specific security vulnerabilities.\nMobile devices use air interface to communicate and transmit data through the atmosphere. The wireless medium is broadcast (signals diffuse in all directions), and signals can pass through physical barriers (e.g., walls, roofs, and concrete). They are vulnerable to active (through injecting, deleting, altering the message) or passive (redirecting the information) attacks. The signals traveling through the atmosphere can be intercepted, modified, destroyed, hacked, and rendered unusable through ransomware. Being portable, mobile devices are small and lucrative and can be lost or stolen along with data, have low processing power to handle encryption, and can use public unsecure Wi-Fi. Bring your own device (BYOD) policies poses additional risks of healthcare cybersecurity, as healthcare workers can use their own devices to access organizational network, access patient data, and enter medical orders. BYOD policies are advantageous because of higher productivity, as the providers can access health information from anywhere and anytime; they increase job satisfaction by supporting flexible work arrangements; and they increase effectiveness due to more comfort and speed with the use of people’s own devices. However, they suffer from several disadvantages, like data breaches due to lost or stolen personal devices, lack of firewall and anti-virus software, dearth of encryption power, and increased IT costs for supporting personal devices.\nHIPAA and mHealth\nHIPAA requires security of the protected health information (PHI) through its Security Rule that mandates the security of health information through a three-pronged approach: administrative (policy-based), physical (physical access to facility, workstation, and storage devices), and technical (technological requirements to control access to information).5 mHealth devices have potential HIPAA Security Rule compliance issues such as physical loss or theft of devices, data transmission over unsecured Wi-Fi, unencrypted text messages/emails, inadequate or lack of authentication protocols, and poor adherence to BYOD policies and procedures.\nBeside the potential to have HIPAA security compliance issues, other specific mHealth device issues include interference with implanted medical devices (pacemakers) and their use in monitoring vital signs and supporting life-threatening and critical care situations that use a part of electromagnetic spectrum, like mobile devices. They also suffer from diagnostic interpretations due to small screen size, which may conceal some crucial details in EKG, ultrasound, MRI, and X-rays.\nBest Security Practices for Securing mHealth Devices\nAlthough no technique or technology can provide fool-proof security for the data contained in mHealth devices or accessed through them, some measures can minimize the security risks. These include implementation of strong user authentication (biometric or two-factor authentication), automatic lock after excessive number of incorrect logins, remote wiping when a device is lost or stolen, employing encryption for conversations (emails, text messages), developing an application policy for BOYD devices, regular updating to keep vulnerabilities mitigated, and installing security programs/antivirus, as being networked they are apt to all sorts of malware attacks.\nInternet of Things in Healthcare (IoHT)\nYet another breed of mHealth devices are Internet of Healthcare Things (IoHT) or Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) devices, which is the use of Internet of Things (IoT) in healthcare. IoHT devices are sensor-based interconnected devices used for tracking assets and resources. In hospitals, they can be used for locating patients, medical staff, and visitors (called smart hospitals), and collection and integration of health data (generation, collection, and communication of health data through wearable devices).6 Other benefits of IoHT devices include savings in medical cost, reduction in medical errors, improved patient experience, manageability of medical drugs and adherence, better control over wastage in healthcare sector, and better outcomes of medical treatments.\nSecurity Mitigation of IoHT Devices\nMitigation of security for IoHT devices include both technological and administrative measures. The technological mitigation measures comprises use of blockchain technology to protect data in IoHT devices, enable IoHT devices to use authentication to validate user identity and access privileges, enable IoHT devices to use encryption for all health-related communication, enable integrity on IoHT devices to verify devices to ensure that they are unaltered and uninterrupted, and ensure IoHT devices are patched and updated to avert any vulnerability.\nThe administrative mitigation measures comprise using the principle of least privilege for required actions and types of communication, logging all user activities and events and monitoring them regularly for unusual activities (duplicate device ID or elevation in privileges), reviewing device data regularly to identify unusual trends or patterns, implementing security best practices associated with protecting and securing sensitive data, and conducting formal education, training workshops, certifications, and participation in mobile security conferences.\nFuture of IoHT\nIoHT devices have a great future in healthcare applications, especially through the integration of artificial intelligence with IoHT in the form of ingestible sensors (ePills, which are pill-sized devices to monitor internal physiology and act as diagnostic devices sending medical information and images to outside connected devices); nano-devices to monitor human physiology and deliver drugs to targeted areas like cancer cells; connected lenses that would determine tear glucose and eyes diseases; and blood clot monitoring sensors to avert heart attacks. Their potential healthcare implications include smart hospitals, virtual clinics, microsurgery, vital sign monitoring systems (which can analyze real-time data inputs from critically ill intensive care unit patients), activity trackers for heart patients to collect lifestyle information, and fitness wearables, to name a few.\nIn view of the significance of mTechnology in healthcare, the Journal of Mobile Technology in Medicine is published to disseminate the mHealth research results.\n- World Health Organization. https://www.who.int/goe/publications/goe_mhealth_web.pdf\n- National Institutes of Health. https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-14-028.html\n- Phaneuf, A. “How mHealth apps are providing solutions to the healthcare market’s problems” (2019).

{"question":"What are required story elements for making choose-your-own-adventure game in Scratch?","answer":"The required story elements for a choose-your-own-adventure game in Scratch include: 1) Multiple choice points where players can make decisions to control what the character does. 2) Different story outcomes based on player choices. 3) Multiple options for players to choose from at decision points. 4) A main character for players to control through the story. 5) Side characters for interaction. 6) Different locations or backdrops for the story to take place in. 7) A clear beginning and ending to the story. 8) A minigame element within the story to maintain player interest.","context":["In this lesson, we are going to be creating a simple choose your own adventure game using Scratch. This is a great project for those who already have some Scratch experience and want to challenge themselves by trying something new. It will allow players to make choices to control what a character does, but be careful, because each choice affects the outcome of the story!\nWho is this Project For?\nThis is a beginner-level project for those who are new to Scratch. Before beginning, you should already know how to use sprite costumes and broadcasting. These will be the core concepts used in this project.\nWhat Will We Learn?\nThis project focuses on using knowledge of Scratch components like broadcasting and changing costumes and backdrops. By the end of the project, you will be able to use these concepts to create a simple story game.\nFeatures to Consider:\n- Players can make choices to control what the character does\n- Each choice will affect the outcome of the game\n- The player will have multiple choices to choose from\n- There will be a minigame within the story to keep players interested\nThis project has 5 main steps:\n- Plan out the story\n- Create the sprites and backdrop\n- Code the button sprites and backdrop\n- Code the side characters\n- Code the player sprite\nStep 1: Plan out the story\nBecause this game includes creating a story for players to interact with, it is important to begin by planning out what the story will be about. This will give you an idea of what types of sprites you will need to create, as well as how you will create the game. For this example, we will be creating a story about a girl named Avery and the crazy day she experiences. She will be able to go to the beach or hike in the woods, and along the way will meet her friend Jack, as well as a bear in the woods. Her reaction to these problems will control how the story goes. For your story, feel free to come up with your own creative idea, and adjust the sprites and backdrops that you use accordingly.\nStep 2: Create the sprites and backdrop\nOnce you have an idea of what you want the story to be like, it’s time to begin creating the sprites.\nHint: For this game, I will need 9 sprites: One to act as the main character, one for Avery’s friend Jack, a bear sprite, and 6 buttons that the player will use to make decisions.\nFor Avery and her friend Jack, we will use some people sprites from the Scratch sprite library, and for the bear, we will use the bear sprite.\nThe buttons will make use of more of the button sprites from the sprite library, although any sprite would work as a button if needed. On each button, we will write the options the player has to pick from. For this example, we will have buttons for:\n- Go to the beach\n- Go hiking\n- Run away from the bear\n- Freeze next to the bear\n- Go home\nHint: We will be duplicating the beach button because it is needed twice, so there will only be 5 different messages to type.\nNow that the sprites have been chosen, it’s time to choose the backdrops. We will need backdrops for Avery’s room, the beach, the forest, a hayfield, and the end-of-game screen. The first four backdrops can be found in Scratch’s backdrop library. Alternatively, if you want to upload your own backdrop you can do that as well by uploading an image from your computer.\nFor the end-of-game screen, we will need to create a backdrop. You can do this by going to backdrop costumes and using the paint tool to create a backdrop and add text. For this example, we have created a black backdrop that says “Game Over! Click the green flag button to play again!”. In the end, the backdrop should look like this:\nStep 3: Code the button sprites and backdrop\nNext, it’s time to code the button sprites and the backdrop. For the buttons, we will code them so that when clicked they trigger the next section of the story. Todo this, we will start by choosing a “When this sprite clicked” block, and underneath we will change the costume to costume 2.\nHint: The buttons have 2 costumes each so that when they are clicked they change colour for a very short amount of time before changing back\nNext, the code will wait 0.3seconds before changing back to costume 1. Next, we will create a new message for whatever button we create (In this case it was the beach option so we have created a message called “beach”). Finally, we will create another message to hide the buttons, and then we’ll hide the sprite. For the next part, we will make sure that the button hides when the green flag is clicked and when it receives the “hide buttons” message. You can do this using the yellow event blocks from the events category as well as the purple hide block. The last thing you will need to add for the buttons is to make them show when it’s time to make a choice. Start by creating a message called “Choice 1”. This will be broadcasted when it’s time to make the first decision. When this message is broadcasted, the sprite will go to the front layer and show itself. Once these steps are complete, the code should look like this:\nThe same code can be duplicated for the run and freeze buttons, as well as the second beach button. However, for the run and freeze buttons, it is important to make sure that you change the message they broadcast, as well as when they show themselves. For example, the freeze button would look something like this:\nNow, it’s time to create the hiking and go home buttons. The hiking button is the same as the other buttons, except we will create another sequence of code to make itself show when it’s time for choice 4 as well as choice 1. Other than that change, the code is the same. The go home button, however, is slightly different. The “when sprite clicked” code is the same, but it will show itself when it receives the messages for choices 3, 4, and 5. Additionally, when the green flag is pressed, it will go to (-149, -134) before showing itself, and when it receives choice 5, it will go to (0, -134).\nHint: This makes it so that the button is to one side when there are two options, but when going home is the only option the button will be centered on the screen.\nOnce the code for this section is complete, it should look like this and it’s time to code the backdrop:\nNow, the code for the backdrop is very simple. We will need three event blocks: one ‘when green flag clicked”, and 2 “when I receive” blocks. When the green flag is clicked, the backdrop should be set to the bedroom, and when the hike and beach messages are received, the backdrop should switch to forest and beach scenes respectively. Once the backdrop code is complete, it should look like this:\nStep 4: Code the side characters\nNow that the buttons and backdrop have been coded, it’s time to create the code for the bear and Jack’s sprite. The code for the bear is very simple. Start by taking a “When green flag clicked” block, and dragging it into the workspace. Underneath, set the sprite to the back layer and hide it. Then, make it go to(350, -98) so that it is in a position to show itself later. This position could be different, it depends on where you want the bear to come from. Then, grab two “when I receive” blocks. When the sprite receives the hike message, it should wait 4 seconds, show itself, then run towards Avery. To do this, we can use a repeat loop to repeat the same blocks of code 15 times.\nInside the loop, make the bear change to the next costume and change x by -10. This will make the bear appear to run at the other character. When the freeze message is received, the bear should wait 1 second, before repeating the same running loop 40 times and then hiding. Finally, the last code section to make should hide the sprite when the backdrop is switched to the hayfield. Once the bear’s code is complete, the code should look like this:\nNext, it’s time to move on and code Jack’s sprite. This spite will be a bit more complex as it has the code for a mini-game. To begin, we’ll bring out event blocks to hide the sprite when the green flag is pressed, or when the backdrop changes to the forest or the bedroom. This will ensure that the sprite is only visible when necessary. Next, it’s time to code a small game- a riddle guesser. The sprite will ask a question and wait for the player to guess the answer. To do this, we will start by having the character show itself when it receives the beach message. Next, it will wait 4.5 seconds before greeting the character and explaining the game. After another 4.5 second pause, the character will ask a question. Use the “ask and wait” block from the sensing section to ask the riddle question. Hint: In this case, the question is “what has hands but can’t clap” and the answer will be “a clock”. Next, we need to add an if-statement to check if the answer is correct. Take an if-statement from the control section, and inside use the equals operator to compare the player’s answer to the correct answer. If they are the same, use a say block to make Jack say “You’re right!”. If the player is wrong, Jack will say “Sorry, it was a clock!”. Finally, after this is done, use a broadcast block to create a new message called Next Activity. This will run and signal to the other sprites that it’s time to move on. Once this is complete, the code for this sprite is complete, and it should look like this:\nStep 5: Code the player sprite\nFinally, it’s time to code the last sprite– the player sprite. This sprite has 7 large sections of code, but they all use very similar concepts. This will make it much easier than you expect, so let’s get started! You’ll want to start by dragging out a “when green flag clicked” block, and underneath, show the sprite and send it to the back. This will make sure that she does not overlap with the buttons later on. Next, switch the costume to the one titled “Avery-a” This is a pose where the character stands and talks to the player. Next, the Character will introduce herself as Avery, and ask the player’s name. To do this, you can use a say block, and then an ask block from the sensing category to ask the player’s name.\nHint: When using a say block, make sure to use a time of 2-5 seconds to give players time to read the sentence!\nNext, we will create a new variable called “name” and set it equal to the player’s input. This name can later be used in sentences throughout the game. Now that that’s done, we will use the name in a sentence by joining “Hello” and name inside of a say block.\nHint: Make sure to add a space after the message so that the name and last word of the sentence aren’t simply squished together.\nFinally, use a say block to ask the player what they want to do, then broadcast the Choice 1 message to show the player’s options. After you’ve finished this section, the code should look something like this:\nNow it’s time to move on to do the code for when the player chooses to go hiking. In this case, Avery (the character) will say “Wow! I love hiking”, wait for a second, and then change costumes for the new scenario she’s in. At this time, the bear sprite will appear on the screen, so we will need to code Avery’s reaction. To do this, she will think “Is that a bear? Quick! What should I do?”. After the character thinks these messages, we will need to broadcast the Choice 2 message to bring up the options of freeze or run. At this point, this code block is finished and it’s time to move on. Start by bringing out a “when I receive” block and select the run message. Underneath, make the character think “Good choice”, then change the costume to a walking costume. Next, we’ll create the walking animation by changing the costume and changing x by -10. This sequence will be repeated 30 times to make the character walk until they’re almost off-screen. Now, we will change the backdrop to the hayfield and repeat the same walking animation 5 more times. Finally, we will change the costume to a walking costume, and make the character say “Well (name), what do you want to do now?” before broadcasting Choice 3 to bring up the decision buttons. After this code is complete, it should look like this:\nNow it’s time to write the code for when the player chooses to freeze. In this case, when the player receives the freeze message, the costume should shift to a talking pose before thinking “Okay, I need to stay really still”. Then, use a “wait 5seconds” block from the control category to make the character freeze for 5seconds. Finally, use the same join method we used earlier to say “He’s gone. Good choice (name)”. After this, you will broadcast the Choice 5 message to show the next option buttons. And with that, the code for the hiking choice is done, now it’s time to code the beach options. Start by using a “When backdrop changes to” block and select the beach option.\nUnderneath, set Avery’s location to (-123, -39)to place her in the right spot on the screen. Then, use the say blocks to make the character speak about how much they love the beach. After this is done, Jack’s code should be running and he will ask whether the player wants to try to solve a riddle, so we will wait 5.5 seconds in order to answer at the right time. After this wait, add the code to make Avery say “Sure that would be fun! “Can you help me (name)?”.\nHint: Make sure the timing of these talking blocks is well-timed, otherwise it will look like the characters are talking over and interrupting one another!\nNow it’s time to write the code for after the game is complete and it’s time to make the next choice. To do this, simply grab a code block that says “when I receive” and select the Next Activity message. Then, make Avery say “Thanks Jack, that was lots of fun” before asking what the player wants to do next. To make the buttons show, make sure to broadcast the Choice 4 message at the end. Once you’re done, the code will look like this:\nFinally, we’re onto creating the final code block. Start by checking whether the sprite has received the “Go Home” message. When it receives the message, we want the backdrop to change to the bedroom, and the character to go back to their starting position at (-139, -43). Change the costume back to a talking costume, and make the character say “That was a crazy day! Thank you for coming with me!”. This will signify the end of the game, so use a wait block to delay the next actions for 3 seconds before switching the backdrop to the game over message, hiding the sprite, and stopping all of the code.\nHint: The stop all block can be found under the control category and is used to stop all code that is running anywhere in the project.\nOnce this code is done, the entire project is complete! If you need to double-check the code for this section, it should look like this:\nAnd now we’re done! Feel free to test your game and see how it works. If you’re stuck with any steps or have any issues with your code, try reviewing it using the code shown throughout the article to see if you’ve made any mistakes."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:b1c784c4-b022-4fbf-a99b-0913bd1b0d50>"],"error":null}
{"question":"As someone interested in anatomy and medical procedures, I'd like to know: how do the injection sites and associated risks compare between intramuscular gluteal injections and trigger point treatments in the gluteal region, such as those used for pain management?","answer":"For intramuscular gluteal injections, the upper lateral quadrant of the gluteal region is the safest location to avoid injury to the sciatic nerve, which runs approximately midway between the greater trochanter and ischial tuberosity. The common fibular nerve is particularly vulnerable if injections are positioned too far inferiorly. For trigger point treatments, the locations vary depending on the specific muscle involved. Trigger points in the gluteus minimus are found deep in the muscle and form due to various factors including direct trauma, intermuscular injections, postural distortions, and sporting activities. Treatment locations must account for the fact that the gluteus minimus is the deepest of the three gluteal muscles, lying underneath both gluteus maximus and medius. Both procedures require careful attention to anatomy to avoid nerve injury, particularly the superior gluteal nerve (arising from L4 through S1) and sciatic nerve structures.","context":["resourcesABOUT MT AUTHOR GUIDELINES CLASSIFIEDS EDITORIAL CALENDAR MEDIA GUIDE MASSAGE MART SCHOOLS & EDUCATION FEEDBACK\nSyncretism: Acupuncture and Public Health in Cuba\n\"Syncretism\" is defined as a union of diverse tenets or practices.

This knowledge allows you to efficiently assess, educate and design treatment plans tailored to your patient's complaints.\nThe gluteus minimus can be easily overlooked since the referred pain from this muscle is felt so deep and remotely from the location of the trigger points. Let's examine the gluteus minimus muscle, its anatomy and trigger point pain referral patterns and ways to help build your practice.\nThe gluteus minimus is the deepest of the three gluteal muscles, is also the smallest in length and lightest in weight. It attaches proximally to the external surface of the ilium and distally to the anterior surface of the greater trochanter of the femur. (Image 1A). The muscle fibers of gluteus minimus and gluteus medius run in the same direction and produce the same action.\nWhen the lower extremity is free to move and all fibers of the gluteus medius contract they produce abduction of the thigh. When just the anterior fibers of gluteus minimus contract, and the lower extremity is free to move, they produce medial rotation of the thigh. When the lower extremity is in a fixed position, as during the weight bearing phase of gait or when balancing on one leg, the gluteus minimus, along with the gluteus medius, and tensor fascia lata, keep the pelvis level when the opposite limb is raised off the ground.\nThe superior gluteal nerve arises from L4 through S1 and innervates the gluteus minimus, gluteus medius and tensor fascia lata. When the nerve is compromised due to trauma, disc involvement or other factors, the supporting action of these muscles are diminished. When the patient tries to balance on one limb, the pelvis falls on the side of the raised limb indicating a positive Trendelenburg sign. The referred pain from trigger points in the gluteus minimus may be constant in duration, severe in intensity and may cause the patient to limp when they walk. The discomfort may also interrupt their sleep if they roll onto the effected side.\nWhen active trigger points are present in the anterior fibers of gluteus minimus, patients will have pain and difficulty getting up out of a chair or standing up straight, following periods of hip flexion, as when seating in a car, watching TV, working at a computer or sleeping in a fetal position. Intake forms will help you ask the right questions to uncover all of the patient's symptoms.\nZones and Trigger Points\nIn images 1 - 3, \"X\" indicates the common location of trigger points. Solid red indicate Essential Pain Zones or the regions of referred pain that is present in nearly every person with active trigger points. The dotted red regions indicate Spillover Pain Zones or the regions of referred pain on some, but not all, patients with active trigger points.\nTrigger Points (TrPs) in the anterior fibers of gluteus minimus refer into the lower buttock and down the lateral aspect of the thigh into the fibular region of the leg. Rarely do the referrals cross the ankle, but on occasion will refer into the dorsum of the foot. (Image 1B). Trigger points in the posterior fibers tend to refer more medial into the lower buttock (then the anterior trigger points) and into the posterior thigh and proximal calf (Image 1C).\nThese trigger points form for numerous reasons from direct trauma, inter muscular injections, postural distortions, running, swimming, walking too far and/or too fast over uneven terrain, and sporting activities such as tennis, handball or cycling.\nResolve & Distinguish\nFirst identify, then eliminate or modify the factors that perpetuate the existence of trigger points. These may include periods of prolonged immobility such as seating in a car, watching a movie, working at a desk, sleeping in a fetal position or sitting on a wallet.\nIt will be easy to distinguish gluteus minimus trigger points from others, like the piriformis or the overlying gluteus medius, based on their referral patterns and the location of the trigger points.\nPiriformis trigger points refer into the posterior thigh distally to the knee (Image 2), whereas the gluteus minimus trigger points also include the lateral thigh and calf (Images 1B,C).\nGluteus medius trigger points are less likely to involve the thigh (Image 3).\nRange of motion is another way to determine which muscles are involved. Trigger points in the gluteus maximus restrict hip flexion, while trigger points in the piriformis restrict medial rotation of the thigh.\nTrigger points in the gluteus minimus and gluteus medius will restrict adduction of the thigh.\nThe success of your practice is influenced by your ability to educate your patients. Set your self apart and reinforce a professional image by using visual aids like trigger point wall and flip charts to show patients their pain referral patterns. Postural analysis photos make it easy for you to assess, show patients imbalances in their musculoskeletal system and document postural improvement over a series of treatments. Read \"Getting Inside Your Patient's Head\" (MT, January, 2011).\nKnowing the specific pain patterns of each muscle gives you the knowledge to efficiently assess, educate and design treatment plans tailored to your patient's complaints.\nI wish great success in the treatment room.\nClick here for more information about David Kent, LMT, NCTMB.\nJoin the conversation\nComments are encouraged, but you must follow our User Agreementcomments powered by Disqus\nKeep it civil and stay on topic.

Identify the gluteus medius muscle and the iliotibial tract. Reflect the gluteus maximus muscle.\n- Locate the piriformis muscle deep to the gluteus maximus. Examine the relationships of the superior and inferior gluteal nerves and vessels and the sciatic nerve to the piriformis muscle as they exit the greater sciatic foramen.\n- Identify the gluteus medius muscle and transect the muscle to expose the underlying gluteus minimus muscle.\n- Locate the deep muscles of the gluteal region: obturator internus, gemellus superior, gemellus inferior, quadratus femoris, and obturator externus. Trace the path of the pudendal nerve and the internal pudendal artery.\n1. GLUTEAL REGION\n- Remove the skin from the buttocks.\n- Notice the cutaneous nerves you are cutting through as you skin the gluteal region.\n- Remove the fat overlying the gluteus maximus muscle and note the muscle's lower edge crossing the fold under the buttock obliquely.\n- Locate the specialized band of fascia of the thigh called the iliotibial tract. Its attachments are implied by its name.\nThe gluteus maximus muscle originates from 1) the back of the iliac crest, 2) the lower sacrum, and 3) all the dorsal ligaments binding the pelvis and sacrum together. It inserts into the iliotibial tract and the gluteal tuberosity of the femur. The gluteus maximus muscle lies directly behind the hip and acts primarily as an extensor of the hip joint. Notice that based on its attachments, it can also laterally rotate the thigh and tighten the iliotibial band. It is not active in walking since little active extension of the hip is involved but it comes into play in activities such as climbing stairs, rising from a squatting position, and running.\n- Verify that the superior and superficial fibers of the gluteus maximus muscle insert into the iliotibial tract.\n- The smaller tensor fasciae latae, like the gluteus maximus muscle, also attaches to the iliotibial tract.\n- Reflect the gluteus maximus muscle laterally by cutting along the border of the sacrum and the sacrotuberous ligament.\nNOTE: Cut the gluteus maximus carefully so that you don’t inadvertently take any fibers from the gluteus medius muscle below it. Also be careful for the blood vessels and nerves beneath the gluteus maximus. Attempt to keep all of these structures intact.\nThe head of the femur lies medial to the axis of the shaft. This produces bending stresses in the femur and tends to bow it outward laterally. This tendency is resisted by the functional importance of the iliotibial tract and the muscles pulling on it. The tract also improves the leverage of the gluteus maximus and tensor fasciae latae muscles in rotating the thigh medially and laterally.\n2. PIRIFORMIS MUSCLE\na. With the gluteus maximus reflected, examine the sciatic nerve and the inferior and superior gluteal nerves.\nb. Find the piriformis muscle emerging from the greater sciatic foramen to insert on the upper border of the greater trochanter of the femur. This is a major landmark in the gluteal region.\nc. Below the piriformis muscle, find the inferior gluteal nerve and artery exiting through the foramen to supply the gluteus maximus muscle. The sciatic nerve also exits the greater sciatic foramen below the piriformis muscle.\nNOTE: In 12-14 % o people, the sciatic nerve splits into the fibular nerve and tibial nerve at or near the piriformis muscle. When this happens, the fibular branch can run through the middle of the piriformis or exit the greater sciatic foramen above the piriformis muscle (see images about showing variation). See if your cadaver has one of these variations.\nd. Above the piriformis muscle, the superior gluteal nerve and artery exit through the foramen to supply the gluteus medius & minimus and tensor fasciae latae muscles.\nNOTE: Identification of the piriformis muscle will help to orient you in the gluteal region and find and identify the other rotators of the hip.\n3. GLUTEUS MEDIUS AND MINIMUS\n- Outline the gluteus medius muscle, noting its origin and insertion.\n- Transect the gluteus medius muscle along its origin near the iliac crest. Reflect the gluteus medius inferiorly to expose the gluteus minimus muscle immediately deep to it.\nNOTE: It is often difficult to separate the fibers of the gluteus medius from the gluteus minimus. Dissect carefully in this area.\n- Trace the superior gluteal vessels and nerves running between the two muscles, supplying them and ending in the tensor fasciae latae muscle.\n4. LATERAL ROTATORS\nA group of small muscles including both elevators and depressors cross the hip joint dorsally to act as lateral rotators of the femur:\n- Quadratus femoris\n- Obturator internus\n- Gemelli (L. =\"little twins,\" diminutive of gemini)\n- Obturator externus\n- Separate the lateral rotators, beginning with the piriformis muscle.\n- The piriformis muscle, which you located earlier, is just below the gluteus minimus muscle and exits the greater sciatic foramen.\n- The next three muscles (in order from superior to inferior) are: the superior gemellus, obturator internus, and inferior gemellus muscles.\nHint: You will not see obturator externus yet. That will be visible from this aspect shortly when you transect quadratus femoris in a few steps.\n- The quadratus femoris muscle is a square muscle that can be found inferior to the last three.\nHINT: It is sometimes hard to see these small deep muscles. Here we provide a description of where these small muscles originate and insert to help orient you to this complex region. The piriformis muscle originates from the anterior surface of the sacrum and exits through the greater sciatic foramen to the greater trochanter. The quadratus femoris muscle runs from the ischial tuberosity to the back of the femur. The obturator internus muscle originates from the deep surface of the obturator membrane covering the obturator foramen and forms part of the lateral wall of the ischioanal fossa. Its tendon exits dorsally through the lesser sciatic foramen, which is the \"door\" to the ischioanal fossa. The gemelli muscles originate from the margins of the lesser sciatic foramen. These four muscles have separate little motor nerves from the lumbar plexus.\n- Carefully transect the quadratus femoris muscle as shown by the dotted line in the diagram below to see the tendon of the obturator externus muscle wrapping around the hip joint posteriorly.\n- Follow the pudendal nerve and accompanying vessels around the dorsal edge of the sacrospinous ligament into the ischioanal fossa.\nThe five lateral rotators can be assisted in their task by the much larger gluteus maximus muscle.\nAn intramuscular injection is used to deliver medication deep into the muscles. At this level, the medication can be absorbed quickly into the bloodstream (depending on the chemical properties of the drug). One way to determine where to give an intragluteal injection is to use surface anatomy. The sciatic nerve is approximately midway between the greater trochanter and the ischial tuberosity. Hence, it is best to give intragluteal injections in the upper lateral quadrant of the gluteal region to avoid any injuries by intramuscular injection. Typically, the common fibular nerve is more superficial and lateral as it branches off the sciatic, so it is commonly affected by these injections if they are positioned too far inferiorly."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:eebbf5a2-37eb-47d4-bffa-6abc9a688a79>","<urn:uuid:81d535e4-7e00-417d-b42c-2ed09165d1a1>"],"error":null}

More than nine hundred Jews escaped in this way from the gas chambers, transported by paddle-wheel cruise-steamer down the Danube. The Captain of the Queen Elizabeth, Dr. Nándor Andrásovits, a passionate filmmaker, recorded 8mm cine-film on his boat, preserving the entire journey for posterity. Through the recordings shot over sixty days (from 3 July – 16 August 1939), we follow the journey of the Orthodox and Zionist Jews traveling by ship to the Black Sea, from where they transferred to the seafaring ship, the Noemi Julia, on which they traveled on to Palestine. Since the Captain is Lord – “the next, after God” – of the ship, he was able to shoot much more material with his camera, undisturbed, than the average tourist-filmmaker would have been able: among the unparalleled, rare footage, we are privy to portraits of the refugees, their prayer, a wedding, and their moments of rest.\nOne year later, Captain Andrásovits once again filmed an exciting journey. We see the port of Reni and Galati in Romania, where Volksdeutsch embark onto the ship in a long queue. They have lived for five generations in Bessarabia, but in the 1940’s, in fear of Soviet annexation, they have volunteered for the SS-organized repatriation to the Third Reich. On the stern of the Queen Elizabeth, the Resettlement Committee and the Nazi soldiers pose merrily before the Captain’s camera, while the mournful Swabian peasants, who have lost their homes, travel up the Danube. All this was one of the quiet events organized by the Nazis and the Soviets in the autumn of 1940, when ninety-three thousand Volksdeutsch were resettled from Bessarabia – disannexed from Romania, to Poland, occupied by the Third Reich.\nThe comparison of the incomparable, the opposing and parallel travel epics are set forth by Péter Forgács’ film, produced in 1997 by Lumen Film, for VPRO TV.\nTibor Szemző’s pieces of so-called film music are not truly music for film in the original sense of the word. Traditional film music generally represents music of lesser value in terms of autonomous musical composition, as its purpose is to support and reinforce the impact of the film; it should, in fact, remain practically unnoticeable. Szemző’s film music, on the other hand, does not play a subordinate role, but rather possesses significance of an equal rank with the images, and even provides for their reinterpretation. The Danube Exodus image series, with Szemző’s music, acquires the overwhelmingly tragic sense expressed by the images of Nándor Andrásovits, as composed in Péter Forgács’ mesmerizing film.\nThe listener may meet with Tibor Szemző’s film music in three situations: as autonomous musical composition (without the accompaniment of visuals); as accompaniment to a film (when we see only the images); or within the framework of a cinematographic concert (when the live performance is accompanied by a film projected onto the backdrop). The important image and its accompaniment compare and define the emphasis, i.e., the three types of performance methods – whereas the music, in essence, is identical in each case – carry three, markedly distinct meanings. Tibor Szemző’s film music also completely diverges from the accustomed music accompanying silent films. In the case of Szemző, it is not merely accompaniment; the music is perceptibly present in every moment of the film.

As well as rescuing a large number of British, Polish and Czechoslovakian troops, he also had the job of trying to stop the French Atlantic fleet from being surrendered to the Germans.\nAbout 85,000 Polish troops had been deployed to France, under the command of General Władysław Sikorski, and were still in the process of being established as fighting formations when the Battle of France erupted. This army was partially destroyed during the hostilities, but over 24,000 men would be evacuated to the United Kingdom where they would form a Polish Free Army.\nSimilarly, the Czech army in exile in France formed a division consisting of about 5,000 men, commanded by General Rudolf Viest. During the battle this unit was involved in heavy fighting, but most of its personnel were evacuated to reform in Britain as the 1st Czechoslovak Mixed Brigade Group.\nIn the first instance, it seems that Dunbar-Nasmith was not completely aware of the urgency of the situation and his first action was to send senior naval officers to Brest and Saint-Nazaire on 16 June to begin the process of evacuating stores and equipment. This he thought would take about a week to complete. In Britain the War Office had a clearer picture of what was happening, and he was ordered to begin the evacuation of troops immediately.\nThe evacuation from Brest occurred between 16 and 17 June, during which a total of 28,145 British and 4,439 Allied personnel were rescued. This included a large number from the RAF, mainly ground crews of the Advanced Air Striking Force. There was very little interference from the Luftwaffe, who carried out no heavy air raids against the port during the extraction process.\nChurchill was worried that the French Atlantic Fleet, which was anchored at Brest, would ultimately fall into enemy hands and had ordered Dunbar-Nasmith to do all he could to persuade the French naval commanders to sail to Britain. However, at 16:00 on 17 June most of this armada set sail for French North African ports such as Casablanca and Dakar, with only a small number steering a course for Britain.\nThe evacuation from Saint-Nazaire did not go as smoothly as at some of the other ports and certainly drew more attention from the Luftwaffe. Saint-Nazaire is situated at the mouth of the River Loire, which is subject to very strong currents so the larger ships had to wait along the shore at Quiberon Bay before moving to the port to pick up evacuees or otherwise have them ferried and boarded offshore. Fifty miles up the river is the port city of Nantes, from where Dunbar-Nasmith was led to believe that somewhere between 40,000 and 60,000 Allied troops were evacuating to Saint-Nazaire, hoping to be evacuated, but he had no idea of when they were expected to arrive.\nLifting this number of men would be a huge undertaking. Dunbar-Nasmith accordingly assembled an impressive rescue force consisting mainly of the destroyers HMS Havelock, HMS Wolverine and HMS Beagle; the passenger liners MV Georgic, SS Duchess of York, RMS Franconia and RMS Lancastria; the Polish ships MS Batory and MS Sobieski; and several commercial cargo ships. Waiting at anchor in Quiberon Bay these ships were very vulnerable to air attack, but British fighter aircraft managed to restrict the Luftwaffe to minelaying. However, this in itself caused delays because special ships fitted out as minesweepers would have to sweep and clear the channels of mines before the evacuation ships could move.\nThe evacuation started on 16 June when MV Georgic, HMS Duchess of York and the two Polish ships sailed to the port and lifted 16,000 troops before taking them to Plymouth. During the hours of darkness, ships continued to load equipment from the harbour, and two further destroyers, HMS Highlander and HMS Vanoc, arrived to lend a hand.\nHawker Hurricane fighter aircraft of No. 73 Squadron flew their last sorties from their base at Nantes before flying off to southern England. Unserviceable Hurricanes were burned by their ground crews, who then made their way towards Saint-Nazaire to be evacuated aboard the ill-fated liner RMS Lancastria.\nThe Lancastria was built on the River Clyde by William Beardmore and Company for Anchor Line, a subsidiary of Cunard. She was launched in 1920 and was originally called the RMS Tyrrhenia. Designed to carry 2,200 people, including three passenger classes and a crew of 375, she made her maiden voyage from Glasgow to Quebec City in June 1922. In 1924 she was refitted for two classes, renamed Lancastria and sailed scheduled routes between Liverpool and New York until 1932, after which she was employed as a cruise ship. She was requisitioned by the Ministry of War Transport as a troopship in October 1939 and became His Majesty’s Transport (HMT) Lancastria.\nOn 13 June 1940 she was in Liverpool in readiness for dry-docking and essential repairs, including the removal of 1,400 tons of surplus oil fuel. Her crew had been given shore leave although her chief officer, Harry Grattidge, remained with the ship for the initial stages of dry-docking. Around midday he went to the Cunard office, where he was instructed to recall the crew immediately because the ship had to set sail at midnight. Remarkably, all but three of the crew returned to the ship in time, although naturally the repairs had not been implemented.\nThe Lancastria first sailed to Plymouth under the command of Captain Rudolph Sharp and from there, accompanied by another of Cunard’s requisitioned ships, the RMS Franconia, set off for Brest with orders to proceed to Quiberon Bay. Approaching their final destination the Franconia was attacked by a single Junkers Ju88 bomber, which caused sufficient damage for her to be returned to Liverpool.\nLater that day the Lancastria was ordered to a spot roughly five nautical miles south of Chémoulin Point and nine nautical miles west of Saint-Nazaire, where she arrived early in the morning of 17 June. Here she was loaded with men while at anchorage, with the evacuees being ferried out to her in tugs, tenders and other small craft.\nNobody knows how many people were onboard the ship, but by mid-afternoon on 17 June, estimates vary from around 4,000 to an incredible 9,000; the general consensus is 6,000 plus. Captain Sharp had been instructed by the Admiralty to disregard the limits set down under international law and to load as many men as possible. For a ship that could only comfortably support 2,200, we can only imagine how cramped it must have been, particularly on the upper decks, where men would have occupied every available space.\nWhat is known is that there was a varied group of people on board. As well as RAF personnel there were many of Major-General de Fonblanque’s lines of communication troops and men of the Beauman Division. There were certainly Royal Army Service Corps and Auxiliary Military Pioneer Corps troops on board. There were also many civilians, such as embassy staff and employees of Fairey Aviation of Belgium (Avions Fairey), the Belgian-based subsidiary of the British Fairey Aviation company that built aircraft for the Belgian government. Its workers had been evacuated to France in order to relocate to British aircraft factories and had ended up at Saint-Nazaire, from where they were taken out to the Lancastria.\nThe Lancastria was only one of a number of ships in the area, which soon drew the attention of the Luftwaffe. At around 13:50 aircraft attacked and hit the nearby 20,000-ton Orient liner SS Oronsay. Although a bomb hit her bridge, destroying her compass and all her navigating equipment, she survived the attack and fortunately there were no fatalities.\nThe Lancastria was by now fully loaded and was given the all-clear to depart, but unfortunately the Royal Navy had no spare destroyers to provide her with an escort. Captain Sharp, concerned about the possibility of being a target for German submarines if she set sail alone, decided to wait for the Oronsay to accompany her along with the first available escort destroyer.\nWhile the ship waited a further air raid began, and consequently, at around 15:48, she received four direct hits from Junkers Ju88s belonging to Kampfgeschwader 30. This caused the ship to list, first to starboard and then to port, before she finally rolled over and sank, all within the space of twenty minutes.\nThe sea where the ship went down was covered with leaking oil including the 1,400 tons that had not been removed in Liverpool, much of which was now burning on the surface. Many of the survivors drowned or were choked by the smoke. The ship only carried 2,000 lifejackets and it is probable that some of these would not have been accessed in time. German aircraft also flew over the scene repeatedly, strafing the men in the water with machine guns and using tracer bullets to light up more of the oil slick.\nThe actual air raid finished at approximately 16:30 and a number of both French and British vessels came to pick up survivors. For instance, the trawler HMS Cambridgeshire, which was the first vessel to arrive, took on board around 900, most of which were then transferred to the steam merchant ship John Holt. There were 2,447 survivors in total but the number of those who died is unknown. Over the years The Lancastria Association, established to preserve the memory of those who perished, has researched a list of 1,738 people who were known to have been killed. However the real figure is unquestionably much higher than that: modern estimates range from between 3,000 and 5,800 fatalities, which would represent the biggest loss of life in British maritime history.\nThe seriously wounded were taken to Saint-Nazaire for medical treatment but most of those whom were rescued were ferried back to Plymouth. The destroyers HMS Beagle and HMS Havelock took 600 and 460 respectively; the John Holt carried 829; the tanker Cymbula another 252; and the liner RMS Oronsay 1,557. Lesser numbers were also evacuated in other ships.\nComing amidst the news of so many unfolding disasters, Winston Churchill initially forbade newspaper editors to publish the story, and consequently the sinking did not become common knowledge in Britain for a number of years. The families of those who were known to have perished were simply told that their loved ones died fighting with the BEF in France. Churchill intended to lift the ban after a few days but the disaster was quickly followed by the French surrender, the fear of invasion and the start of the Battle of Britain. Under the intense pressure of these momentous occasions Churchill forgot to lift the ban until he was reminded of it again later in the war.\nLater, on the night of 17 June, HMS Cambridgeshire was ordered to evacuate the commander-in-chief of the BEF, Alan Brooke and his staff. Because the ship had been involved in the rescue of men from the Lancastria, there were no rafts or lifejackets onboard and the decks were strewn with discarded clothing. The ship sailed from Saint-Nazaire at 15:00 on 18 June and arrived in Plymouth late on the afternoon of the following day, having acted as an escort to a convoy of evacuation ships en route.\nAfter the sinking of the Lancastria the evacuation from Saint-Nazaire continued, with a convoy of ten ships lifting 23,000 men just after dawn on 18 June; this left only 4,000 still to be evacuated. However, the next part of the operation became slightly frantic as Dunbar-Nasmith was informed that the Germans were about to storm the port. At 11:00 a.m. that same day, further ships picked up the last 4,000 men but failed to retrieve a large amount of military equipment and supplies in their haste to escape."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:314306c5-b4ae-4c19-878a-91b1ec9af3b4>","<urn:uuid:376b0bbe-f954-41cb-b5cb-45fd7727dbcb>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What environmental benefits do modern dairy and hog farm waste systems provide?","answer":"Modern waste systems in both dairy and hog farms offer significant environmental benefits. Straus Family Creamery's methane digester system is part of a Carbon Farm Plan that aims to reduce carbon dioxide equivalent by about 2,000 metric tonnes per year. At Storms Hog Farm, their anaerobic digestion system reduces greenhouse gas emissions from stored and land-distributed farm wastes by approximately 90%, while nearly eliminating pathogens like e-coli and salmonella. Both systems also significantly reduce odors and help maintain soil and water quality in their respective regions.","context":["Photo Credit: Janae Lloyd/The Farmers Guild\nBy Tara Redfield\nStraus Family Creamery, located in Northern California, was founded in 1994 and has now become one of the most well known organic creameries on the West Coast thanks to founder and CEO Albert Straus. Albert is the oldest son of Bill and Ellen Straus. Bill Straus began his dairy farm in the early 1940s with 23 cows, and Ellen Straus joined him in 1950. The vision of creating organic dairy products led Albert down a very interesting path. We know how amazing the products are because we serve them in our café and teach with them in our culinary and baking programs. To really understand the relevance of Straus, we got to host our own Q & A with Albert. We hope you learn as much as we did!\nQ: What was the inspiration behind Straus Creamery?\nA: In the 1970s, when I returned home to my family’s dairy farm after college, the landscape of small, family dairy farming was shifting. The number of family dairy farms was in sharp decline, having dropped from 4.6 million in 1940 to 650,000 in 1970. I realized we needed innovative solutions to secure the future of family farming in California and maintain good stewardship of the land. I founded Straus Family Creamery in 1994 to create a viable business model for farming that would secure the future of my own family’s farm, create a market for local, organic milk, and revitalize the community of organic dairy farmers in the region.\nQ: What is something that people don’t know about the dairy industry?\nA: More and more dairies are converting to organic production. When our dairy got its organic certification in 1994, we were the first dairy west of the Mississippi to do so. Now, nearly 80% of the dairies in Marin and Sonoma Counties are organic.\nQ: How has the dairy industry changed in the last 10 years?\nA: Although the total number of dairies continues to decline each year, we’ve been able to maintain and even grow the number of organic dairies in the U.S.\nQ: What role will your business be playing five years from now?\nA: Our mission is to help sustain family farms in Marin and Sonoma Counties by providing high quality, minimally processed organic dairy products, and to support family farming and revitalize rural communities everywhere through advocacy and education. We hope to continue on our path of building a healthy regional food system, and supporting education and succession plans for next generation farmers.\nQ: How do you come up with your ice cream flavors?\nA: I gravitate towards flavors I like—and hope other people like, as well.\nQ: What is your best-selling product? Why do you think it’s so popular?\nA: Our cream-top milk is a perennial favorite. Customers love it because it’s not homogenized, leaving the milk as close as possible to its natural state. It’s also pasteurized at a lower temperature than ultra-pasteurized milk, which means you can really taste the sweet, well-rounded flavor of the milk.\nQ: What would you like your legacy to be?\nA: I would love to see a thriving, sustainable, organic dairy system that secures the vitality of rural communities.\nQ: What does your typical day “at the office” look like?\nA: My day starts very early on the farm, then I check in at the creamery, and then I head into the office for meetings. On any given day, I’m dealing with issues at the creamery or on the farm, evaluating sales data, meeting with customers, or helping design products.\nQ: What is the most fulfilling part of this business?\nA: I love coming up with new ways of conserving natural resources and making things more efficient in order to minimize our impact on the land. It’s particularly satisfying when we can use technology in a proactive way to improve our farming system; for example, I’m working on an electric feed truck that will be powered by the electricity we produce with our methane digester. Making and eating great-tasting products is a bonus, too!\nQ: What are some sustainable practices you use?\nA: Sustainability is a core value of Straus Family Creamery. At the creamery, we use practices like reusable packaging and water conservation to be more sustainable. On the farm, we use renewable energy generation and carbon farming to affect positive environmental change.\nI’m particularly proud of the methane digester at my dairy, which converts methane from the cows’ manure into electricity, creating enough energy to power the entire dairy, charge my electric vehicle, and feed some electricity back to the grid.\nCarbon farming is an exciting new area we’re exploring. We’re working with the Marin Carbon Project on a 20-year Carbon Farm Plan, designed to measure and optimize carbon capture. The Straus Dairy is projected to reduce carbon dioxide equivalent by about 2,000 metric tonnes per year through the program.\nQ: What do your customers love the most about your products?\nA: They trust Straus Family Creamery to create products with minimal processing, no GMOs, and farming and processing practices that follow the both spirt and the letter of organic regulations.\nQ: How do you know when a recipe for a product is perfect?\nA: I follow my taste buds—it’s perfect when I like it! Beyond that, we evaluate and occasionally reformulate products to make sure they meet our intent of requiring minimal processing and no additives.\nQ: Do you think it’s important that culinary students have an understanding of farms and the dairy industry?\nA: Absolutely. It’s very important that everyone in the food business understands the value farmers bring to our food system, and also the obstacles that they face. Farmers are incredibly resilient, but they increasingly face challenges like GMO contamination in their organic crops, lack of affordable housing, vulnerability to extreme weather events, and population loss in rural communities. Family farming is vital to our economy and our food security. That’s why we seek to use the voice of Straus Family Creamery to advocate on behalf the family farms we work with.\nQ: What is the importance of an organic product?\nOrganic production is designed to promote ecological balance, foster the cycling of resources, and conserve biodiversity. Producers and handlers are required to maintain or improve soil and water quality. Organic dairy products are made without the use of GMOs, synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, or herbicides. The cows are raised without antibiotics or growth hormones, and are given regular access to pasture and freedom to behave naturally. Ideally, the organic model also promotes economic viability for farmers, in part, by setting the price of milk to cover the true cost of production. That’s why more and more farmers are converting to organic. When you use organic products, you can feel confident you are helping to sustain farms, food, people, and the earth.\nFor more information, please visit www.strausfamilycreamery.com","The largest swine waste-to-energy system operating at full capacity, located at the Storms Hog Farm near Bladenboro, North Carolina, celebrated its opening last week.\nThe 600 kW plant has been in near constant operation since it came on line October 4, 2013, and has sustained peak or near peak output for the past 90 days.\nThe 600 kW facility, operated by Storms Hog Power, evolved from a grant for four swine farm renewable energy pilot projects administered by the NC Department of Energy, applied for in May of 2010 by Sam Ravenel, of Withers & Ravenel, and Dr. Garth Boyd, of The Prasino Group.\nThe facility is the combined efforts of Dr. Boyd who formed AgPower Partners LLC (APP) to develop the Storms project and enlisted DVO Inc. for its patented Two-Stage Mixed Plug Flow anaerobic digester and Martin Machinery/GenTec for its biogas engine/generator turn-key services. William R. Storms is the farm owner and operator.\nStorms Hog Power anaerobic digester and renewable energy generating system, in tandem with an enhanced animal waste extraction and collection system that uses scrapers instead of flush water to remove manure from the houses, greatly reduces the negative environmental impacts of the current lagoon and spray field manure management systems, while profitably generating renewable energy and other valuable byproducts.\nManure collected daily from nearly 30,000 hogs, formerly treated in open air lagoons, mixed with off-site agricultural wastes which were previously either land applied or destined for a landfill, is biologically decomposed in an oxygen-free, 1.2 million gallon reinforced concrete vessel. The bacteria in the digester metabolically break down the organic waste streams and generate energy-rich biogas, while destroying nearly all of the pathogens and odor. The biogas is combusted in an engine/generator, sending enough clean renewable electricity to the local utility to offset the electricity consumption of nearly 300 average size homes in the area.\n“What is really amazing is what you don’t see or actually, smell,” said Jeff Smerko, managing principal of AgPower Partners said. “Spending the better part of the past two and a half years down here, I thought that I had just grown accustomed to it. But that’s not it. The odor now is virtually gone.”\n“Anaerobic digestion presents many benefits far beyond power generation,” said Steve Dvorak, owner and founder of DVO, Inc. “For progressive hog farmers, it’s also about being a good steward of the land. Our digesters reduce greenhouse gas emissions from stored and land-distributed farm wastes by roughly 90%. Pathogens in farm waste, including e-coli and salmonella, are reduced so much that they are almost undetectable, and our new nutrient recovery technologies allow for the practical removal of additional phosphorus and ammonia nitrogen. We’re excited to have been a part of this project and look forward to helping more farmers like Billy and their communities benefit from anaerobic digestion.”\nThe govenrment provided legislative assisance. \"The North Carolina Senate Bill 3, mandating that utilities have swine generated electricity as a small part of their total portfolio, enabled farmers like Storms to try something that would have been untenable without the incentive,” commented Jonathan Gross, partner at CohnReznick LLP. “The team that developed Storms Hog Power has overcome bureaucratic and modeling challenges to make the project bankable. The end result is a model that makes sense, that works – and that can be repeated.”\nNorth Carolina Electric Membership Corp. purchases all of the electricity under a long-term contract. This revenue, combined with tipping fees for processing the off-site agricultural waste, the sale of the carbon credits and Renewable Energy Certificates, and the sale of other valuable byproducts, support the sustained operation and maintenance of the facility."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"content_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:28a60801-079b-413b-9d00-ece1db1e3f3a>","<urn:uuid:1832d124-6b3b-499a-9716-310328130e77>"],"error":null}
{"question":"When was the third GPS III satellite launched and from where?","answer":"The GPS III Space Vehicle 03 (SV03) was launched on June 30 from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida. It joined the SV01 and SV02 satellites, which were declared operational in January and April.","context":["Space Force Sends Additional GPS Capability into Space\nThe third launch of the GPS III system adds performance and protection.\nWith industry partners, the Space and Missile Systems Center of the U.S. Space Force launched the GPS III Space Vehicle 03, or SV03, on June 30 from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida. The launch sets the third GPS III satellite into space to join the SV01 and SV02 satellites, which were declared operational in January and April.\nThe GPS III system is the space portion of the Space Force’s effort to modernize the entire GPS capability, offered Tonya Ladwig, acting vice president, Navigation Systems, Lockheed Martin Space.\nSome of the military and industry leaders involved with the launch briefed the media on a call last week, including: Ladwig; Brig. Gen. Doug Schiess, USAF, commander, 45th Space Wing, U.S. Space Force; Col. Ed Byrne, USAF, senior materiel leader, Medium-Earth Orbit Space Systems Division, Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC), U.S. Space Force; Walter Lauderdale, mission director, SMC Launch Enterprise, U.S. Space Force; and Lee Rosen, vice president of customer operations and integration, Space X.\n“I'm proud to be a part of an incredible team with Space X, SMC and our satellite contractor to put this asset on orbit for our nation, for our Space Force and for the warfighters that need this capability,” Gen. Schiess said.\nCol. Byrne explained that the system will achieve three times better navigational accuracy and eight times more power, which helps with the anti-jam capability of the spacecraft. “And I know for the GPS III program, we are expecting an accuracy of 0.63 meters or better,” the colonel stated.\nAccording to Ladwig, GPS III adds that new technology and much greater capability to 29 of the 31 current satellites in the GPS constellation. The system supports M-code, “a more-secure, harder-to-jam or spoof signal for our military forces,” she said. It also adds a new L1C Civil signal. “Significantly, this satellite, GPS III SV03, will be the 22nd M-Code enabled satellite in the constellation—just two short now of global coverage,” Ladwig offered.\nThe greater GPS III team is delivering the capability to over 4 billion military and civilian users around the world.\nEarlier this year, the U.S. military celebrated the 25th anniversary of the GPS system reaching full operational capability, a fitting coincidence, Col. Byrne observed. “The launch of the GPS III SVO3 spacecraft is significant and marks another major milestone for the program, for SMC and the U.S. Space Force as we continue our journey to modernize and deliver new capabilities to the GPS Constellation,” he stated.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic interrupted the launch originally scheduled for April 29 and the parties put the mission on a 60-day hold to implement new health and safety measures, an SMC spokesperson said. “The men and women at 45th Space Wing are just doing an incredible job during unprecedented times with this coronavirus situation,” Gen. Schiess added.\nThe effort also marks the first launch of a GPS III production satellite and National Security Space Launch (NSSL) where the launch service provider attempted to recover the rocket booster, Col. Byrne noted.\nThe booster successfully landed back on SpaceX’s autonomous spaceport drone ship named, Just Read the Instructions II, positioned in the Atlantic Ocean. The 10-year old Falcon 9, with 88 missions completed, has flown the most operational missions in the United States, SpaceX said.\n“Approximately nine minutes after [liftoff] the first stage will land on the newly refurbished drone ship, Just Read the Instructions,” Rosen described. “It is fresh off its trip across the Panama Canal into the Atlantic Ocean a couple hundred miles offshore. We're excited to have that capability here to be able to land two vehicles here. That additional landing capability [will enable] quicker turn times between missions. This is our first U.S. Space Force mission and we're really excited about it and hope that this is the first of many, many of those launches in the future.”\nThe model of relying on industry for launch services is an evolving relationship, Lauderdale confirmed. For the current launch campaign, the team completed 362 verification tasks and evaluated more than 230 risks. “This combination of activity, encompassing nonrecurring design, process and manufacturing verification tasks, when taken together, culminate in the Space Force's flight worthiness assessment,” he said.\nAnd at first, the idea of recovering the booster seemed implausible, given the “insufficient performance given the mission trajectory and peel-away combined with the uncertainties associated with this demanding mission,” Lauderdale acknowledged.\n“But when we approached Space X to revise some spacecraft requirements for this mission, the GPS III mission, they responded with an opportunity to recover the booster in exchange for adding these requirements as well as other considerations,” he explained. “Our evaluation of that mission’s performance combined with additional work with Space X reduced uncertainty in many areas. And given our technical insight and the support from our GPS teammates from a mission design perspective, we're able to reach an arrangement in the best interests of the government.”\nLauderdale estimates significant savings from bartering with Space X and the reuse of the booster. “When we came in with the revised requirements, it was an opportunity for us to look at what we could do together,” the mission director explained. “And we were able to knock several million off, in addition to getting the requirements that we had added to the mission.”\nLastly, the team dedicated the launch of GPS III SV03 to Col. Thomas Falzarano, USAF, commander, 21st Space Wing, a rising leader in the service who passed away suddenly last month, Gen. Schiess noted."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:4b27d0cb-eabb-4232-8e1d-6a382a7df440>"],"error":null}
{"question":"As an audio engineer comparing conductor materials, is silver or gold better for XLR cable contacts in terms of electrical conductivity?","answer":"Silver has better electrical conductivity than gold for XLR cable contacts. According to conductivity measurements, silver has a conductivity of 6.30x107 S/m while gold has a lower conductivity of 4.52x107 S/m at 20°C. However, it's worth noting that while gold is less conductive, it offers better resistance to corrosion than silver, which can be an important factor for long-term reliability of XLR connectors.","context":["XLR cables are important pieces of equipment for those in the professional audio field. These specialized cables provide a means of transit for an audio signal between hardware. While they may look simple on the outside, there is a lot going on behind the scenes that must be in place to ensure that the audio signal is transmitted flawlessly from one spot to another. In this article, you’ll learn all about XLR cables!\nXLR Cable History\nThe first XLR connector was invented in the 1940s by a man named James H. Cannon. Back then, they were commonly called Cannon plugs or Cannon connectors after their original inventor. The formal connector name was the Cannon X series. After 1950, Cannon’s company added a locking mechanism, and the new connector was called the Cannon XL. With the addition of neoprene around the female parts of the connector, Cannon finalized the name to XLR, the “R” standing for “resilient” which is still used to this day.\nXLR Cable Uses\nXLR cables are manufactured with up to 10 pins! Each pin has a specific function. These special connectors have all kinds of applications, but mainly the XLR cables with higher pins are used for power and balancing. For example, on a 4-pin XLR cable, pins 1 and four are used for DC power. Some HD camcorders used to use 5-pin XLR cables, with extra pins for stereo audio. Neutrik, an industry leader in XLR connectors, recently released a 10-pin XLR connector. These can transmit four pairs of data along with 16 Amps at 50 V for high-performance audio applications.\n- XLR3 is the most common design and is used worldwide in professional audio. They are almost always used to connect microphones to audio interfaces in professional recording studios. They can also be used for stage lighting equipment.\n- XLR4 is used to connect intercom headsets as well as professional video equipment. These find their way into stage lighting as well.\n- XLR5 is very commonly used for DMX stage lighting, and also for stereo audio applications like we mentioned earlier.\n- XLR6 is used to achieve a balanced microphone signal in some headsets\n- XLR7 is used to connect specialized microphones to their power sources. They’re also used for fog machines.\nDesigning the Best XLR Cable\nAccording to synapticsound.com, the best XLR cable will have several design features that ensure they transmit the signal from point A to point B with as little distortion and added noise as possible. They are listed below.\nYou may have heard the term “balanced” in the paragraphs above and wondered what that means. Balancing is a method that electrical engineers use to eliminate or reduce added noise caused by radio-frequency (RF) interference.\nHow It Works\nA balanced cable usually has 3 or more conductors. In 3-pin balanced XLR cables, the cable contains two signal wires and one ground wire. The two signal wires carry the same signal waveform, except one of them that has its polarity reversed as it’s transmitted from point A to point B. While in transit, both signals will pick up the same levels and frequencies of added noise due to RF interference. Then, at point B, the inverted signal along with its additional noise is inverted once again and added to the other signal. What this then does is it cancels out the added noise while keeping the original audio signal intact!\nImage Source: Aviom.com\nThe best XLR cables will always utilize this special design technique. Some cables, such as the Mogami Gold series, actually use two pairs of conductors for even more effective noise cancellation. For professional audio, balanced XLR cables are mandatory.\nThe best XLR cable will always be shielded. Shielding is another technique used by electrical design engineers to reduce added noise from RF interference.\nHow It Works\nA shield is usually a braided mat or spiral of many smaller-gauge copper wires that wrap around the conductors. Some shields are also made of aluminum Mylar foil, and some cables contain both a braid and a foil shield for maximum effectiveness\nRadiation in all forms, including RF radiation that adds noise to our audio signals, is made up of coupled magnetic and electric fields. An electric field will create forces on the electrons of the atoms in the shield. When the shield is exposed to an electric field at the surface, it moves the charged electrons to create an electrical current. This movement, in turn, generates its own electric field which then cancels out the applied electric field and stops it from reaching the signal conductors. The induced current in the shield is then grounded. In this way, the shield absorbs the RF interference and diverts the energy away from the signal conductor.\nThe XLR cable’s connectors are very important for long term reliability. That is because many low-quality cables will break at the connectors. The best XLR cable will always utilize a connector design that eliminates stress on the soldiers that connect the conductors to the pins. Neutrik makes one of the best strain-relief connectors, called the Neutrik XX.\nJacket & Contact Material\nThe best XLR cable will use a jacket material that is durable and resistant to abrasion and cuts. The jacket material will also be flexible to allow the cable to be oriented in many positions during live performances. For this application, PVC (polyvinyl chloride) is a great choice for the jacket material. Here is a rundown of common cable jacket materials:\n- PVC (polyvinyl chloride) – very common, low-cost, flexible and resists mild chemicals like oil and water. Also has flame-retardant properties\n- PE (polyethylene) – also common, but can be more rigid unless it is the low-density (LDPE) variant\n- PUR (polyurethane) – usually found in coiled cables, and is very flexible\n- TPE (thermoplastic elastomer) – flexible, abrasion resistant, and chemical resistant\nThe contacts (pins) are the parts of the XLR cable connector that connects directly to the hardware. They must be very conductive to effectively transfer the signal through the connector. They must also be able to resist corrosion. As the contact material corrodes, the signal transferring ability of the contacts degrades. This can lead to distortion of the audio signal. Gold and silver or silver-nickel alloy are the best choices for contact materials.\n- Gold – less conductive than silver or silver nickel-alloy, but more resistant to corrosion\n- Silver or silver-nickel – more conductive than gold, but less resistant to corrosion\nWe covered a lot of information here on modern day XLR cables. They’ve come a long way since their distant relatives were invented by James H. Cannon in the 1940s. Some of the more important features of these specialized cables are shielding, jacket and contact material, balancing, and connector design. The best XLR cable manufacturers will always keep these in mind to best serve the consumers and professions that use them.","Science, Tech, Math › Science Electrical Conductivity of Metals Share Flipboard Email Print ThoughtCo / Colleen Tighe Science Chemistry Chemistry In Everyday Life Basics Chemical Laws Molecules Periodic Table Projects & Experiments Scientific Method Biochemistry Physical Chemistry Medical Chemistry Famous Chemists Activities for Kids Abbreviations & Acronyms Biology Physics Geology Astronomy Weather & Climate By Terence Bell University of British Columbia Carleton University Terence Bell wrote about commodities investing for The Balance, and has over 10 years experience in the rare earth and minor metal industries. our editorial process Twitter Twitter LinkedIn LinkedIn Terence Bell Updated March 02, 2020 Electrical conductivity in metals is a result of the movement of electrically charged particles. The atoms of metal elements are characterized by the presence of valence electrons, which are electrons in the outer shell of an atom that are free to move about. It is these \"free electrons\" that allow metals to conduct an electric current. Because valence electrons are free to move, they can travel through the lattice that forms the physical structure of a metal. Under an electric field, free electrons move through the metal much like billiard balls knocking against each other, passing an electric charge as they move. Transfer of Energy The transfer of energy is strongest when there is little resistance. On a billiard table, this occurs when a ball strikes against another single ball, passing most of its energy onto the next ball. If a single ball strikes multiple other balls, each of those will carry only a fraction of the energy. By the same token, the most effective conductors of electricity are metals that have a single valence electron that is free to move and causes a strong repelling reaction in other electrons. This is the case in the most conductive metals, such as silver, gold, and copper. Each has a single valence electron that moves with little resistance and causes a strong repelling reaction. Semiconductor metals (or metalloids) have a higher number of valence electrons (usually four or more). So, although they can conduct electricity, they are inefficient at the task. However, when heated or doped with other elements, semiconductors like silicon and germanium can become extremely efficient conductors of electricity. Metal Conductivity Conduction in metals must follow Ohm's Law, which states that the current is directly proportional to the electric field applied to the metal. The law, named after German physicist Georg Ohm, appeared in 1827 in a published paper laying out how current and voltage are measured via electrical circuits. The key variable in applying Ohm's Law is a metal's resistivity. Resistivity is the opposite of electrical conductivity, evaluating how strongly a metal opposes the flow of electric current. This is commonly measured across the opposite faces of a one-meter cube of material and described as an ohm meter (Ω⋅m). Resistivity is often represented by the Greek letter rho (ρ). Electrical conductivity, on the other hand, is commonly measured by siemens per meter (S⋅m−1) and represented by the Greek letter sigma (σ). One siemens is equal to the reciprocal of one ohm.

Safety culture is the “way of operating” within the organisation that influences safe behaviours and consists of shared beliefs, practices and attitudes. The ultimate ambition is for everyone in the organisation to feel responsible for helping to avoid unsafe practices, and to consider the impact on safety of their own activities. Instructors, introductory flight pilots, inspectors, and others in key positions need to ensure their decisions are made with an awareness of the safety implications.\nBy changing a way of operating, it may be possible to avoid a hazard becoming an accident. A positive safety culture is generated from the “top down”and relies on a high degree of trust, respect and communication between all elements of the organisation. Everyone involved must believe without doubt that they will be supported in any reasonable decisions made in the interests of safety.\nSafety Management System\nBy adopting a holistic Safety Management System that meets the needs of the sport, clubs, pilots and aircraft operators, the BGA aims to move beyond the traditional reactive systems to try to anticipate areas of exposure and change ways of working to reduce the frequency of particular kinds of accident. The ‘BGA Safety Management System Manual’ is available here.\nPilot training is carried out by trained and monitored instructors to a common syllabus that has been and continues to be developed by the BGA Training Standards Manager and Instructing and Examining Committee. Instructors are supported by club Chief Flying Instructors and Regional Examiners and Coaches. Recognition of risk and how to manage it are key elements of ‘Threat and Error Management’ that is taught during gliding training.\nAirworthiness is the responsibility of owners and achieved through compliance and support by the BGA airworthiness system which includes BGA inspectors who are guided and supported by the BGA Chief Technical Officer and Technical Committee. Inspectors certify maintenance and repairs beyond that which a pilot/owner is permitted to carry out.\nPilots under training are supervised and supported by instructors. Qualified pilots, ie pilots who hold a valid licence or BGA Bronze Endorsement with Cross Country Endorsement, are responsible for managing their own exposure to risk, subject to club requirements. If the pilot is carrying a passenger, the pilot’s responsibility extends to the passenger.\nPilots are encouraged to seek advice from their CFI or another senior instructor. Periodic refresher training is an excellent method of confirming that appropriate skills remain in place, for example “spinning”, or “field landing” refresher training in a motor glider. Pilots should note that two instructional flights in 24 months form part of the SPL recency requirement.\nThere are very few new hazards in gliding. It is possible to suggest a prescription for a safe glider pilot:\n- prepares carefully before flight\n- never endangers others\n- keeps an effective lookout\n- can cope with winch emergencies\n- does not cause tug upsets\n- does not inadvertently stall/spin\n- can land in the chosen place\n- picks a field early\n- takes care on the ground\n- and, if an instructor, takes control promptly when the student makes a potentially dangerous error"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"content_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:379a970b-97f1-4c60-83a8-c08fb7ec1955>","<urn:uuid:661811b8-5f82-4e01-b993-3972524c38c7>"],"error":null}

We feature the Evergreeen String Quartet among other ensembles and musicians.\nAbout William Robert Scott\nWilliam Robert Scott began Scott Violins in 1985 and joined Scott Studios, Inc. in2005, founded by his wife, Susan Scott. His interest in violin-making began in 1970 when he met Martin Bielke, a well-known bow-maker and repairman in the ‘60s and ‘70s. Bill Scott completed his first violin through book knowledge (You Can Make a Stradivarius by Joseph Reid) and worked at Dahl Violin Shop in Minneapolis from 1977–1983. Attending his first VSA (Violin Society of America) Competition in 1980 at Hofstra University, New York he met Mr. Hans Weisshaar and in 1984 began working at the shop of Hans Weisshaar, Inc. in Los Angeles. Bill quickly gained access to great instruments of the classic masters and this apprenticeship helped him develop an eye for the important nuances of quality seen in these works. Repairing and studying these fine instruments for the next couple years opened a new world of great beauty and craft which he has tried to capture since.\nGaining membership in the American Federation of Violin and Bow Makers in 1988 provided regular opportunities to study and learn more about these great instruments. Sharing and gaining a wealth of insight from colleagues at the VSA Oberlin Workshops (Violin-making and Acoustics) over the past 18 years in no small way has profoundly impacted his work and understanding of this craft.\nIn recent years, Bill Scott has contributed on a regular basis to Strad Magazine, VSA Conventions with presentations and Forum discussions and as a workmanship judge. The VSA Conventions and Competitions have been part of his violin-making experience from the beginning and he feels he owes a lot to what this organization has brought to our craft. It is with the sharing of ideas and techniques that today’s musician can realistically own a great concert instrument at an affordable price.\nRecent research is showing that when age and origin of an instrument are unknown, tonal quality and playability are not defined by old vs new but plain and simple-quality. In fact the newer instruments on whole are out performing the classics! See article below.\nSusan Scott, violist, holds a Bachelor of Music from the University of Wisconsin, and Master of Music, Viola Performance, from Ohio University. She is a free-lance performer in the Twin Cities, performing at various venues throughout the area. Currently, Susan is the violist with the Evergreen String Quartet and the String Studio Specialist for the Minnesota Youth Symphonies. Susan has performed with many orchestras including the Charleston Symphony, Springfield Symphony, Duluth-Superior Symphony, Traverse City Symphony, Interlochen Chamber Orchestra and as principal violist of the Civic Orchestra of Minneapolis. From 1982-2012, Susan was an Orchestra Instructor for grades 4-12 in the Roseville Area Schools and Co-Coordinator of Elementary Instrumental Music for 11 years.","Antonín Dvořák: String Quartet in F Major, Op. 96 “American”\nPaul Hindemith: String Quartet No. 4, Op. 22\nWolfgang Amadeus Mozart: Clarinet Quintet in A Major, K.581, with guest clarinetist Alan Kay\nJeffrey Myers, violin\nRyan Meehan, violin\nJeremy Berry, viola\nEstelle Choi, cello\nAlan Kay, guest clarinetist\n“In short, the Calidores balanced intellect and expression in such a way as to make them a pleasure to hear all afternoon.

{"question":"Black glaze vs early Minoan pottery colors?","answer":"Black glazed pottery is generally excluded from CVA publications (except pieces with added decoration), with only profiles being acceptable when included. In contrast, early Minoan pottery showed evolving use of color, with artisans using iron-enhanced clays to create red pottery in Agyios Onouphrios Ware, and later developing more sophisticated color work as seen in Vasiliki Ware.","context":["CVA remains an expensive form of publication and has naturally come to concentrate on those wares best presented in this fashion. Thus, over the years the content of CVA has been virtually confined to the decorated pottery of the Greek and Etruscan world, and certainly eliminated any decorated pottery from east of Cyprus, Egypt or the western Phoenician world. CVA serves essentially the art historical aspect of classical archaeology, but there are areas of uncertainty:\nExcavation pottery is generally omitted unless it is art-historically interesting, especially from early excavations, such as Naucratis. However, where there is an assemblage of whole vases of appropriate type from any excavation there may seem good reason to include it – e.g. the recent volume from Salonika.\nThe following are generally excluded since CVA does not seem now to be the appropriate or natural source for those professionally interested in these classes:\n- Cypriot pottery, including the Figured Style\n- Greek Bronze Age pottery\n- Black glazed pottery, with the possible exception of pieces with added decoration\n- Etruscan bucchero (a recent exception from France devoted wholly to the class)\n- Roman decorated pottery – Arretine etc.\n- All plain and striped wares, including any excessive number of types such as ‘football aryballoi’\nExceptions to 2 and 3 may be admissible where a whole collection is presented which includes a small proportion of such wares. This recognizes the fact that CVA also serves as publication of museum collections and it is reasonable for a museum to wish the contents to be comprehensive. They should never, however, amount to as much as 10% of the whole. The determining factor should normally be whether the material is likely to be of interest and importance to a classical art historian. Outside these exceptional classes the material presented should be complete, and not selected according to criteria of assumed interest of editor or reader.\nThe pottery should be cleaned before photography. Restorations should be removed, but where they need to be retained for the purposes of museum display care must be taken to see that they are fully described, and ideally indicated in some way on the photograph (dotted outlines, etc.).\nPhotography should include all the decoration, back and sides if need be, and oblique views of angled shoulders, etc.\nInscriptions, graffiti and significant details of colour which are not clear on the photographs should be drawn.\nDrawn profiles of sensitive shapes or details of shapes are desirable. If black glaze is included, profiles only are acceptable.\nThe size of photographs on the plate should be such as to make clear all detail, including plastic as well as painted detail, and as uniform as possible. Excessive enlargement of vases to fill space is inappropriate. Sizing should be done by the author, not a publisher.\nThere should be a full description of all painted decoration and colour.\nThere should be a full bibliography; or in the case of notorious pieces, references to a full bibliographical source for early publication.\nComment need not be as detailed as a catalogue raisonné, nor is CVA an appropriate place for detailed studies best presented in articles or monographs. Attention should be drawn to any unusual features. However, where the material is rich in certain areas (e.g., groups of figure-vases, the work of single painters or workshops), not much discussed elsewhere, the opportunity may be taken to explain it more fully.\nThe introduction should explain the history and sources of the collection resented, where they are of interest, and if need be illustrate this with early drawings, etc.\nThe traditional format of CVA should be maintained – the size is appropriate and economical. There should be hard covers.\nThe UAI Committee accepted the recommendation that plates should be bound in, and this is common practice now in many countries. This is for the convenience of libraries and users, it is considerably cheaper, and it offers the possibility of issuing quite modest volumes for the smaller collections or assemblages economically.\nThe material for publication should be kept in an electronic form to facilitate eventual inclusion on the CVA website, when the volumes are out of print. The UAI has reaffirmed its view that the printed volume is the best way to ensure that strict CVA standards continue to be observed by authors and museums; these could be eroded by direct publication on the web, but the opportunity will shortly exist for museums who for very good reason present their collections in this way to have it linked to the major CVA database, also for any other databases dealing with special classes of relevant pottery.","Learn something new every day More Info... by email\nMinoan pottery refers to the pottery found around the Aegean Sea that is attributed to the ancient Minoan civilization. The pottery is dated as far back as 3500 BCE and continues until 1070 BCE, the end of Minoan civilization. The earliest pottery from the Minoan civilization is rudimentary, concerned more with practicality and functionality. Later examples show a refined and sophisticated artistry that relies on more advanced formation techniques, along with colors, elaborate and complex designs, and polychromatic elements.\nAs the Minoans recorded very few events in writing, little is known of their civilization with absolute certainty. Archaeologists use the remnants of Minoan creations, like pottery, to gather information about life in Minoan Crete. The pottery is dated according to a number of factors, including the pottery's style, form, and corresponding geological data. This data is gathered by evaluating the stratum, or soil layer, from which the artifact was uncovered.\nThe three phases of Minoan pottery are Early, 3650-2160 BCE, Middle, 2160-1600 BCE, and Late, 1600-1070 BCE. Each phase coincides with a major cultural shift within the Minoan civilization. Some phases build on previously established styles, and others discontinue former trends in favor of new ones. As the Minoans continued to update their craft, pottery techniques became more refined, and they began to produce elaborate works of art for decorative purposes.\nEarly phase Minoan pottery is characteristic of a newly established society, in which artisans have yet to establish any definitive techniques. This phase of Minoan pottery includes Pyrgos Ware, which is characterized by a chalice design. The chalice is comprised of a cup that is fixed to a cone-shaped base to prevent spilling, a design associated with the Early Minoan civilization.\nAgyios Onouphrios Ware, from the Early Minoan phase, consists of two-handled drinking wares and larger containers such as jugs and bowls. The Minoans began using clays enhanced with iron to turn the pottery red, and in Agyios Onouphrios Ware, they perfected the linear patterns that were commonly applied to the pottery's surface. Vasiliki Ware reflects their continued work on color balance. These wares are distinguished by long neck spouts, which are also present in future Minoan pottery.\nMiddle Minoan witnessed the birth of the palace society and the rise of urban centers in Cretan society. The Kamares Ware, from the Middle Minoan phase, is considered the virtuoso work of Minoan pottery. These pieces are polychromatic, constructed from very fine clay, and usually designed with symmetrical floral motifs. Vibrant reds and whites are painted against a dark background, usually black.\nThe palace culture of the Middle Minoan period most likely led to the distribution of Minoan goods across the Mediterranean, and significant Minoan influence had spread along the Aegean coastline by the Late Minoan period. The pottery from this period is ornate and reflects the Minoan's experiments with a few new formation techniques. The Minoans typically attempted new designs, such as forming a vase into the shape of a bull's head. The Marine Style is thought to best characterize this era. Its pottery is marked by elaborate designs of various marine life that cover the entire surface of a piece.\nThe Minoan civilization was annihilated around 1450 BCE, and the Mycenaean Greeks from the mainland arrived to occupy Crete until about 1070 BCE. Minoan pottery was not eradicated, as the Mycenaeans combined their design elements with Minoan motifs. This style of pottery is known as the Palace Style, and has only been discovered in Knossos, Crete. Eventually, designs from Greece and Egypt, such as the geometric and lotus motifs, would become more prominent on Minoan pottery, all but eliminating much of the Minoan influence.\nOne of our editors will review your suggestion and make changes if warranted.

{"question":"What is the connection between digital economy indicators and environmental sustainability research, and how are both being measured and monitored in today's context?","answer":"The digital economy and environmental sustainability are being tracked through distinct but interconnected measurement systems. The digital economy uses Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to measure its impact on industries, organizations, and businesses, with specific tools being developed for monitoring and measuring these KPIs. These indicators help assess the impact of ICTs on primary economic variables like GDP, productivity, and competitiveness. On the environmental side, research is emerging on the environmental footprint of digital technologies, though there is currently a shortage of comprehensive research in this field. This information gap affects public policies, business decisions, and consumer choices. Environmental monitoring is increasingly supported by citizen science initiatives, where non-professionals gather data to assess environmental conditions such as river impairment and air quality at a hyperlocal scale.

People reporting a risky contact with a sick person can also access vaccination in the same way. So there is no need for a prescription. However, an appointment is required.\nAccording to the decree published in Official newspaper on May 26, two vaccines can be administered in France against monkeypox (same principle of action, similar efficacy): the vaccine IMVANEX (already authorized in Europe) and the vaccine JYNNEOS . These two vaccines are manufactured by the firm Bavarian Nordique located in Denmark. July 25, the European Commission has approved l'extension du vaccine IMVANEX (originally against smallpox) of the Bavarian Nordic group against spread of monkeypox virus , announced the Danish group in a communicated .\nTo know : the smallpox vaccine manufactured until the 1980s by Doctor Pourquier's Vaccine Institute was called 'Pourquier Vaccine'. The vaccine produced by Sanofi-Pasteur was the ' Aventis vaccine '.\nA single laboratory produces the vaccine currently administered against monkeypox (Imvanex® in Europe/Jynneos© in the United States): the Bavarian Nordic Danish laboratory based in Copenhagen. He owns a European Marketing Authorization (MA) since July 2013 for active immunization against smallpox in adults. His vaccine is a 3rd generation antivariolic vaccine . 'It presents a mode of administration and a much more favorable safety profile than those of 1st and 2nd generation vaccines, while ensuring comparable immunogenicity' explains the HAS. The smallpox virus belongs to the group of orthopoxvirus . This group includes, in addition to the smallpox virus, 3 viruses transmissible to humans, the vaccine virus (virus that affects cows) which is used in the vaccine (similar to smallpox but less harmful). Smallpox vaccine is a live, attenuated virus vaccine.\nThere have been three generations of smallpox vaccines:\n1st generation and 2nd generation vaccines against smallpox are not no longer used since 1984 due to the eradication of smallpox. “These vaccines required a particular injection technique (injection by bifurcated needle), showed reactogenicity and serious side effects (encephalitis, encephalopathy, eczema vaccinatum, progressive or general vaccinia, heart damage, etc.)' reminded the HAS in May 2022.\nThe monkeypox vaccination schedule includes 2 doses (or 1 single dose for people who have already been vaccinated against smallpox, and 3 doses for immunocompromised people). The Ministry of Health has lengthened the time between the two doses of vaccine (previously 28 days apart) for non-immunocompromised people. The Imvanex© and Jynneos© vaccines are interchangeable.\nThere is no vaccine directly targeting Monkeypox but the one against smallpox that is administered would be 85% effective according to' Pastor Institute . Several studies have demonstrated the persistence of the immune response in individuals vaccinated against human smallpox in childhood, three clinical trials have also shown that administration of a dose of Imvanex® in a person who has previously received a primary series with another type of smallpox vaccine confers a booster effect, even very far from this primary vaccination. 'Vaccination does not confer immediate protection, also it is important to continue to avoid any risky contact with a person infected with the Monkeypox virus or suspected of being so' recalled the DGS in July. According to estimates by the National Institute for Health Surveillance, the real vaccination coverage against smallpox is estimated at 50% for the French population born from 1972 to 1978 , 65% for those born between 1966 and 1971 and 90% for those born before 1966. People who have been vaccinated against smallpox during these years are normally protected against monkeypox.\nThe side effects of the monkeypox vaccine are the same as those of the smallpox vaccine. According to CPR you vaccine Imvanex , them most commonly observed adverse reactions in clinical trials were injection site reactions and systemic reactions commonly seen after vaccination: headache, myalgia, injection site pain, injection site erythema, injection site swelling, injection site induration, injection site pruritus, fatigue. These reactions were mild to moderate in intensity and resolved without treatment within seven days of vaccination. 'To notice that people with atopic dermatitis developed more local and systemic symptoms after vaccination' specifies the Medicines Agency in a May 26 briefing note. In a non-placebo-controlled clinical trial comparing the safety of Imvanex in people with atopic dermatitis and in healthy subjects, people with atopic dermatitis experienced erythema (61.2%) and swelling (52.2%) ) at the injection site at a higher frequency than in healthy subjects (49.3% and 40.8%, respectively). 7% of people with atopic dermatitis experienced a flare-up or worsening of their condition. The 1st and 2nd generation vaccines against smallpox - which are no longer authorized today - exhibited reactogenicity and serious side effects : encephalitis, encephalopathy, eczema vaccinatum, progressive or general vaccinia, heart attacks... They are contraindicated in many cases and in particular in pregnant women, immunocompromised subjects and children under one year old.\nThe English physician surgeon Edward Jenner (1749-1823) developed the first smallpox vaccine in 1796. Smallpox was the first vaccination in human history, long before Pasteur. The first smallpox vaccinations in France took place in 1799 (150,000 in 1806 to 750,000 in 1812).\nIn France, vaccination against smallpox was compulsory from 1901 to 1979 remind him Ministry of Health . On this date, it was decided to no longer impose primary vaccination against smallpox (Law 79-520 of July 2, 1979) before, finally, completely abolish vaccination reminders in 1984 (Law 84-404 of May 30, 1984) long after the occurrence of the last case of smallpox in the world (1977 in Somalia) and when all countries adhering to the WHO also decided to stop routinely vaccinating against this disease . However, the possibility of having recourse to it has been retained thanks to a regulatory text which states that: ' in the event of war, public calamity, epidemic or threat of an epidemic, vaccination or re-vaccination against smallpox may be made compulsory by decree or by prefectural orders for anyone, regardless of age '. Re vaccination against monkeypox, it is not mandatory but recommended for people at risk.\nAccording to CPR from Imvanex® vaccine authorized in Europe , it is contraindicated in case of hypersensitivity to the active ingredient or to any of the excipients (Trometamol / Sodium chloride / Water for injections) or to residues present in trace amounts ( chicken protein , benzonase, gentamicin and ciprofloxacin ).

{"question":"Can you explain difference between green hydrogen and blue hydrogen production methods, and what role do iron-based catalysts play in their development?","answer":"Green hydrogen is produced from renewable energy sources, while blue hydrogen is produced from natural gas with carbon capture and storage. The transition from gray hydrogen (from natural gas without carbon capture) to blue hydrogen is seen as a stepping stone toward green hydrogen development. Iron-based catalysts, as demonstrated in recent research, can contribute to hydrogen conversion efficiency with performance approaching commercial catalysts, splitting bi-hydrogen molecules at a rate of two molecules per second. This represents a potential cost-effective alternative to platinum catalysts, which are currently over a thousand times more expensive than iron.","context":["Roadmap for hydrogen society/economy supported by petroleum sector\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) special report on Global Warming of 1.5?C presents the assessment concerning accelerated deep decarbonization, which is at the core of global mitigation strategy. The same report also presents the high agreement and robust evidence of risks in faster and deeper mitigation strategies through possible threats to multiple social and economic dimensions of sustainable development for both countries with rich hydrocarbon resources and nations with high dependency on fossil fuels for revenue, economic development and employment generation. The same concerns are also presented in literature on just transition, which are representing the arguments concerning possible job loss, loss of investment flow despite new resource identification, high risks of stranded assets, lower revenue earning with fluctuating oil and gas prices, and dwindling resources. Another set of literature on policy instruments talk of need for diversification of economy and energy sector to ease these adverse consequences of transition and need for creating enabling conditions. The diversification discourse is mostly dominated by focus on new investment opportunities limited to wind and solar energy sectors. At the same time, the countries at risk discussion get dominated by GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) countries. On the other hand, all these discourses ignore multiple challenges and realities in many small but fast emerging developing country perspectives. Therefore, this paper presents and discusses a possible energy transition roadmap, where the existing infrastructures and resources are utilized as enablers for a faster and deeper cross-sectorial decarbonization. The research question of this paper is how can accelerated global transition address the 'trio': 'just, sustainable, and peaceful' transition through cooperation with oil and gas dependent emerging economies and what is the potential for leapfrog. We refer this 'trio' with reference to oil and gas based fossil fuel energy systems, which is caught up in a complex combination of problems due to likely uncertainty and redundancy of human resource currently engaged in the sector, stranded asset due to prospective early retirement of infrastructure and projected reduction in investment, and need for finding substitute of fossil based energy carrier to cleaner, renewable energy carrier. In this way, development of hydrogen society/economy have been pointed out as possible roadmap for accelerated decarbonization, by solving the problem of affordable large scale energy storage from intermittent renewables and enabling continuous use of combustion based technologies without carbon emission. Our hypothesis is that paving the way for and realization of the future hydrogen economy can be accelerated by utilization of natural gas and petroleum-related knowledge, technologies, experience, and infrastructure. Large scale hydrogen production via conversion of existing technologies for gray hydrogen (hydrogen from natural gas without carbon capture and storage) to blue hydrogen (hydrogen from natural gas with carbon capture and storage), will create a functioning hydrogen market and support development of hydrogen based energy conversion technologies to pave the way for green hydrogen (hydrogen from renewable energy sources). This paper includes an introduction part, and then, the issue are discussed from economical, environmental, societal, and technological points of view.

It’s the first iron-based catalyst that converts hydrogen directly to electricity. The development puts chemists and engineers one step closer to widely affordable fuel cells.\nChemist R. Morris Bullock, who leads the research at the Department of Energy’s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) begins the explanation, “A drawback with today’s fuel cells is that the platinum they use is more than a thousand times more expensive than iron.” His team at the Center for Molecular Electrocatalysis has been developing catalysts that use cheaper metals such as nickel and iron.\nThe team has published its information online at Nature Chemistry showing they can split bi-hydrogen molecules (H2) as fast as two molecules per second with an efficiency approaching those of commercial catalysts. The Center for Molecular Electrocatalysis is one of 46 Energy Frontier Research Centers established by the DOE Office of Science across the nation in 2009 to accelerate basic research in energy.\nQuick background – Fuel cells generate electricity out of a chemical fuel, usually hydrogen. The bond within a bi-hydrogen molecule stores electricity, where two electrons connect two hydrogen atoms looking something like a barbell. Fuel cells use a platinum catalyst – laid out with the maximum exposed surface area – to crack a hydrogen molecule apart to its two atoms.\nThe electrons escape and form a current – that is the electricity. Because platinum’s chemical nature gives it the ability to do this, chemists can’t simply replace the expensive metal with the cheaper iron or nickel. However, a molecule that exists in nature called a hydrogenase that uses iron to split hydrogen.\nBullock and his PNNL colleagues, chemists Tianbiao “Leo” Liu and Dan DuBois, have taken inspiration for their iron-wielding catalyst from a hydrogenase. First, Liu created several potential molecules for the team to test. Then, with the best-working molecule up to that point, they determined and tweaked the shape and the internal electronic forces to make additional improvements.\nOne of the effects they needed the catalyst to do was to split hydrogen atoms into all of their parts. If a hydrogen atom is an egg, the positively charged proton that serves as the nucleus of the atom would be the yolk. And the electron, which orbits around the proton in a cloud, would be the white. The catalyst moves both the proton-yolks and electron-whites around in a controlled series of steps, sending the protons in one direction and the electrons to an electrode, where the electricity can be used to power things.\nTo do this, they need to split hydrogen molecules unevenly in an early step of the process. One hydrogen molecule is made up of two protons and two electrons, but the team needed the catalyst to tug away one proton first and send it away, where it is caught by a kind of molecule called a proton acceptor. In a real fuel cell, the acceptor would be oxygen. That’s where the water as exhaust comes from.\nOnce the first proton with its electron-wooing force is gone, the electrode easily catches the first electron. Then another proton and electron are similarly removed, with both of the electrons being shuttled off to the electrode.\nThe team determined the shape and size of the catalyst and also tested different proton acceptors. With the iron in the middle, arms hanging like pendants around the edges draw out the protons. The best acceptors stole these drawn-off protons away quickly.\nWith their design down, the team measured how fast the catalyst split molecular hydrogen. It peaked at about two molecules per second, thousands of times faster than the closest, non-electricity making iron-based competitor. In addition, they determined its overpotential, which is a measure of how efficient the catalyst is. Coming in at 160 to 220 millivolts, the catalyst revealed itself to be similar in efficiency to most commercially available catalysts.\nNow the team is figuring out the slow steps so they can make them faster, as well as determining the best conditions under which this catalyst performs.\nThe past few yeas have seen a sprinkling of news with progress on replacing platinum. Some may even be market ready and this one looks close as well. But fuel cells have other issues that need refined and the supply of hydrogen for consumers isn’t ready yet.\nStill, the market as small as it is exists. Drive fuel cell prices driven low enough and the hydrogen will be there.\nNow if the membrane between the cathode and anodes sides can be cheap, efficient and robust we could see fuel cells come on the market pretty fast."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:8dbde5f7-41e9-4e1e-bfba-f7a1a11b2c95>","<urn:uuid:e751d4af-8bd6-4428-ac2a-1f20a64fbbf4>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How soon after installation can hair extensions be washed?","answer":"Hair extensions should not be washed for at least 2-3 days after installation. This allows the bonds to fully harden. The longer you wait, the better it is for the longevity of the bonds (specifically for Hot Fusion Bonding).","context":["Hair Extensions used are Luxury Double drawn Remy Human Hair with a life span of 10 months plus with correct aftercare and maintenance. All Prices include Consultation, Hair, Fitting, cut prior to fitting, Blending and Styling on completion of fitting.\nA Consultation is required prior to fitting and a non refundable deposit of £50 is required on consultation to secure fitting appointment.\nThe first thing that you may notice is that immediately after the installation of the extensions, and for the next day or two your scalp may feel tender. This is normal and will go away by the third day at the most. Rest assured that this is not a sign of a problem but just because of the added weight of the hair extensions.\nAfter you have had extensions put in do not wash your hair for at least 2-3 days. This allows the bonds to fully harden. The longer you wait, the better it is for the longevity of the bonds (This part is for Hot Fusion Bonding).\nTie your hair back in a loose ponytail or plait using a soft scrunchie for bed.\nIt is not advised to wear your extensions for longer than 3 months. In the 3 months of wearing your extensions your hair will have grown by approx 1.5 inches, the roots of your hair often start to tangle together if you have not separated the bonds correctly and therefore it is not healthy for the hair if left.\nMAINTENANCE - MICRO-RINGS\nMaintenance is advised every 6-8 weeks. The exact amount of time will depend on how the extensions have been cared for and your own hair growth. The maintenance will consist of moving all strands back up to the root, putting back in your lost strands, replacing any micro rings where necessary and general tidying up of all bonds.\nBRUSHING YOUR EXTENSIONS\nRemember your extensions are attached to your own natural hair, pulling too hard or mistreating your extensions can result in your own hair being pulled out.\nThe only brush you should use near to your extension bonds is an extension brush ? this brush has soft bristles and a cushioned bristle base, meaning the brush gently glides over the bonds.\nWhen brushing the extensions always hold the bonds, making sure no additional stress is put on the hair.\nWASHING YOUR EXTENSIONS\nYour extension hair should only be washed between 2-3 times per week (maximum) top washes are advised for clients who wish to wash their hair more often.\nBefore washing it is advised to detangle your extension hair with a wide tooth comb and separate the bonds.\nIt is essential you only use shampoo and conditioner that is designed for hair extension use (sulphate free).\nWhen washing your hair, do not tip your head over the bath as this could cause tangling - always wash with your head upright ? in the shower is ideal.\nSmooth the shampoo down the extension hair ? do not rub vigorously!\nOnly condition from the mid lengths to the end of the hair. Do not apply any conditioner to the bonds as this will cause slippage. You can pick the top section of your own hair up and apply condition to this section.\nPat hair gently when washed ? do not rub.\nDRYING YOUR EXTENSIONS\nBefore detangling I advise you to use a leave in conditioning spray/oil. Follow by detangling with a wide tooth comb, making sure you avoid the bonds. Make sure all bonds are dried completely.\nBe very careful when brushing the hair when wet, make sure you support the extensions hair by holding the bonds.\nFor a sleek finish, section your hair off and blow dry using a round brush with soft bristles. Be very careful that you do not snag the bonds.\nFinish by using a good quality straightening iron.\nHeat Rollers, Straightening Irons, crimpers and tongs can all be used on the extension hair although it is advisable to use a Heat Protection Spray to protect the both your hair and the extension hair.\nSerums, gels, hairsprays, etc may all be used but avoid the bonded areas as this may cause slippage.\nCOLOURING YOUR EXTENSIONS\nAll hair I use is 100% Human Hair and can be coloured. Please consult a professional if you want to colour the hair, especially to lighten the hair. We recommend a strand test at all times before colouring the hair. Do not get any dyes or bleaches on the bonded areas. Any colouring of the extensions is done so at your own risk.\nAll of the hair can be permed, but once again we recommend that a professional carries out the perming and make sure a strand test is completed first. Any perming of the extensions are done so at your own risk.\nYou may get your roots touched up after your hair starts to grow out without any problems, once again avoid the bonds.\nDAY TO DAY ACTIVITIES AND HOW THEY EFFECT YOUR EXTENSIONS\nIf you use a sun bed it is advisable to wrap the hair in a towel first. Sun beds can dry out the hair and melt the bonds.\nIf you work out regularly or have regular use of a sauna or steam room make sure the bonds are completely dried as soon as possible after your session - leaving the bonds in a constant damp environment could cause them to weaken.\nYou may swim as usual but remember that prolonged water exposure may weaken the bonds. Wash your hair as quickly as possible after swimming.\nYou may wear your extensions abroad but be aware that a combination of the sun, chlorine in the swimming pool and salt in the sea water may make them a little dryer then normal. They will return back to their normal condition once you return home. Try to wear a hat when the sun is beaming down on your head ? this protects the bonds.\nSummary Do's and Don'ts\nDo - Brush your hair on a regular basis to prevent matting\nDo - Ensure you thoroughly wash all traces of shampoo and conditioner after washing your hair\nDo - Use a good hair extension brush\nDo - Be extremely gentle with your hair extensions at all times\nDo - Keep extensions tied up during swimming (both pool and sea) , if you do get your hair wet you must ensure you rinse out any chlorine or sea water as soon as possible as they can cause your extensions to dry out, in the same way they dry out your own natural hair\nDo - Tie your extensions back at night, prefferbly a loose plait or pony tails to minimise any tangles in the morning\nDont - tie your hair back to tightly, this can pull on the bonds causing them to weaken\nDont - put conditioner onto the roots of your hair\nDont - use any of the following:- TRESEMME, ANTI-DANDRUFF SHAMPOOS, HEAD AND SHOULDERS, VOSEINE, HOT OILS or HEAD LICE TREATMENTS, these are extremely harsh and can cause damage to the bonds of your extensions causing them to loosen."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"content_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:9d64c70d-9436-4d1f-9bbd-1b807b3b8bd3>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What role does technology play in vehicle maintenance decisions for both military and civilian fleet operations?","answer":"In military operations, the Army is testing AI technology through Uptake's software to predict maintenance needs for Bradley Fighting Vehicles, analyzing onboard diagnostic data and maintenance history to determine component performance. For civilian fleet operations, managers consider new model year technological improvements, particularly in connectivity and driver-assist features, to impact operating costs and provide vital information on vehicle health. Both sectors use technology to reduce maintenance costs, but military focuses on battlefield readiness while commercial fleets also consider driver safety and collision mitigation technologies.","context":["Going into combat is difficult enough as it is and the last thing you want on the battlefield is to have your equipment break down, especially something as critical as the vehicle that’s getting you around.\nThat’s why the U.S. Army spends millions of dollars every year making sure its infantry vehicles are ready for action. And officials think artificial intelligence could make maintenance more effective by lowering costs and giving commanders a better understanding of their fleets.\nLast month the Army kicked off a pilot program with Uptake, a Chicago-based industrial technology startup, to test whether the company’s AI-powered platform can predict when components on the M2A3 Bradley Fighting Vehicle will break down. If the program is successful, the Army could ultimately scale the technology to the thousands of Bradleys it operates across the globe.\n“Maintenance costs are one of our biggest concerns in the military in regards to sustaining the fleet,” said Chief Warrant Officer Jason Sibley, who serves as a maintenance technical adviser for armored fighting vehicles. “We’re doing all that we can to ensure the military is being supported as best as possible … so given the opportunity we have to be able to save costs in regards to sustaining the fleet, [artificial intelligence] is definitely an opportunity we want to look at.”\nUptake in July won the $1 million contract through the Defense Innovation Unit, a Pentagon startup outreach program that was rebranded Thursday. Under the agreement, Uptake will deploy its software on 32 Bradleys stationed at Fort Hood in Texas and work to predict when future repairs are needed and optimize the timing of general maintenance.\nThe company’s software, which is already used by industrial giants like Caterpillar and Berkshire Hathaway Energy, crunches data from diagnostic computers onboard the Bradleys as well as information about prior maintenance to determine how specific parts perform over time, said Uptake Federal and Defense Director Trey Clark in a conversation with Nextgov.\nThe program can then compare that information with a trove of historic machine data and estimate how long a specific component will last and alert Army technicians when maintenance is needed.\nIt could also prevent the Army from doing unnecessary preventative maintenance work, saving time and money.\nToday, the Army annually spends $58.6 million to operate and maintain its fleet of M2A3 Bradleys, according to data provided by Sibley. That breaks down to roughly $47,000 per vehicle, or about $160 for every mile driven.\nMuch of that cost stems from the rigorous maintenance standards the Army upholds. Every Bradley is subject to weekly maintenance checks, as well as more intrusive quarterly, semi-annual and annual inspections, Sibley told Nextgov. But using Uptake’s software, technicians could get a better idea of which components need changing out and which ones have more life left in them.\n“What we don’t want to do is we don’t want to preemptively spend a lot of money changing out parts that could withhold [more use]” Sibley said. “We’re always looking at opportunities to determine and validate whether the amount of maintenance that we perform currently is what’s needed for the platform itself. Can [maintenance standards] be safely pushed out a little bit further?”\nDuring the pilot, Uptake will only analyze a handful of the Bradley’s components, Sibley said. While he declined to estimate the potential savings Uptake’s AI would bring, he said the Army is particularly interested in its uses for “sophisticated electronics” and other high-cost items.\nBeyond general maintenance, the software could also give commanders in the field an in-depth understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the vehicles at their disposal.\nImagine a commander is planning a dangerous mission that requires three Bradleys, but they have 10 to choose from. Right now they would select vehicles based on intuition and potentially outdated information, Clark said, but with real-time diagnostic data, that commander could pick the ones that are truly the most prepared for battle.\n“To be able to project [diagnostics] straight back to the commander and give him an operational view to make choices regarding his fleet, that’s definitely something that’s going to be new that we’re looking forward to,” Sibley said.\nThe pilot will conclude roughly one year from now, at which point the Army will assess whether to scale the program to cover more components or vehicles, he added.","The list of factors fleet managers must consider when determining their replacement cycling strategy can be miles long. What it boils down to, however, is defining what is right for your particular fleet.\nAs previously reported in Work Truck, the industry-standard guideline is a four- to seven-year lifecycle on a light-duty vehicle and a 10- to 14-year lifecycle on a medium-/heavy-duty unit.\nHere’s a collection of replacement cycling tactics fleet managers should keep in mind depending on their desired outcome: whether it’s saving money, increasing safety, or attracting and retaining new drivers:\nTactic 1: Buying for Improved Technology\nWhen looking to save money, fleet managers should consider the benefits they might reap by upgrading trucks for the technology they harness. It is not wise to let the “we’ve always done it this way” mentality take the reins when determining when and how to replace trucks; technology changes rapidly and can quickly prove this course of thinking wrong.\nWith each new model year comes more innovative features that can benefit both driver and manager.Implementing connectivity and driver-assist technology impacts operating costs by providing vital information on vehicle health and driver behaviors that can be curbed to help lengthen the truck’s lifespan.\nSlowly lowering avoidable accidents with the addition of new collision mitigation technologies is another factor that will save money in the long run and have the bonus of keeping your drivers safe.\nThese are the kind of upgrades that make sense and are easily justifiable because they can reduce expenses in the long run and help you convince decision-makers to make a move to shorter replacement cycles.\nTactic 2: Investing in Data\nData is a buzzword fleet managers see often but comes with many questions. How much data is too much? Where should you collect this data, and how do you use what you collect to improve your replacement cycling process?\nFor fleet managers to dig through the mountains of data that come at them at a break-neck pace, they need to develop a reporting and analytics process.\nKeep a list of questions regarding such factors as frequency of maintenance needs, makes and models that tend to be more difficult and costly to work with, and fuel consumption, and then use those to inform decisions on what data to keep and dig deeper into.It’s a daunting task, but breaking these important factors down into specific queries will assist you in parsing through what you have to produce answers that will better inform buying decisions.\nThe best replacement calls will be made when a fleet manager takes the time to balance data and instinct. Blending cold, hard facts with lessons from experience will always produce the best outcome.\nTactic 3: Listening to Drivers\nAttempting to build a strategy alone will leave you with blind spots that need filling — but you won’t know it until it’s too late. It’s essential to tap into the expertise that can only come from those who drive the trucks you spec and purchase.\nDrivers know better than anyone where trucks are being run (e.g., the type of terrain they encounter) and the type of jobs they are being used for. Every driver operates each truck differently, which can also impact the frequency with which said truck needs to be replaced.\nOn top of this, your current drivers, especially ones that have been with your company for an extended time, will be able to describe to you what features benefit them and help them do their job to the best of their ability. Ask them how their truck performs and what aftermarket equipment would be helpful to have that isn’t already present.When looking to purchase new trucks, be sure to consider safety and ergonomic features that focus on driver safety, comfort, and productivity.\nAttracting and retaining drivers is a complication many fleets face; replacing trucks sooner and providing newer, more desirable trucks to drive can help.\nRemember, company/brand image can be affected by the age and condition of trucks. They are moving billboards and can either help or hurt your advertising prospects.\nTactic 4: Collaborating with OEMs\nSome factors that impact truck replacement include the OEM’s track record for service availability, upfit process support, support after the asset goes into service, and safety recall frequency and response.\nOrder-to-delivery (OTD) times can have a major impact on a fleet’s replacement cycle, so be sure to keep a watch on build times with both OEMs and upfitters.\nFleet managers should be looking toward the next two years of replacements and ordering ahead of the needed time to keep on their replacement schedule. You never know what kind of events could throw a wrench into timing, especially now that the pandemic has proven anything can happen.\nParts shortages and backlogs can occur at any given time, so even once a truck is ordered, it isn’t guaranteed you’ll receive it on time.\nCollaborating with OEMs to decide if technicians should have PM work guided by the OEM’s instrument panel readout and if it should be conducted on a set schedule or up to the driver will help lengthen truck lives as well.\nMaintaining a strong, consistent maintenance strategy informed by the vehicle manufacturer, upfitter, and end-user helps control operating costs, enhances reliability, and reduces the likelihood of an event occurring that will put a dent in the truck’s operating condition.\nTactic 5: Assessing Pros, Cons, and Costs\nThe key to creating a replacement cycle strategy that works best for your fleet is striking a balance between vehicle age and related maintenance costs. While it is heavily dependent on the type of truck a fleet manager is looking to replace, it’s important to assess the dangers and expenses that might come with extending a truck’s lifespan.\nWhile continuing to use a truck that seems to be getting the job done regardless of its age may prevent you from spending more than you’ve budgeted, what will it ultimately cost you down the road?\nDowntime is detrimental because it prevents drivers from getting their work done. Unexpected repairs mean lost revenue and become more prevalent the longer a truck is kept on the road. Is keeping a truck in service worth the cost of tying technicians up with older trucks and drivers struggling to make it to appointments on time?\nFuel consumption and the increasing cost of fuel are other factors to consider. Fuel economy typically improves with each new model-year, and with ever-evolving emissions regulations, it may be wise to think about costs that will come down the road.Look into the resale value of the trucks you plan to purchase.

You can grow corn anywhere in the continental United States, and it’s easy for any household to harvest, store, and process it into flour and cornmeal. Grain corn is much easier to process than wheat is, and, in many ways, cornmeal is a more versatile grain staple than wheat flour.\nA New World of Corn\nCornmeal is a culinary world in itself: cornbread, muffins, pancakes, waffles, polenta, grits, scrapple, cornmeal crusts for fried chicken or vegetable fritters, and, if you boil whole kernels with culinary lime, you enter the world of hominy, hominy grits, and Mexican tortillas and tamales. Yet it’s ironic that despite 88 million acres of corn growing in the United States (the estimate for 2010), there are few choices of grain corn in the grocery store. Cornmeal is such a commodity product that it’s rarely fresh in stores, packages don’t tell you which corn variety was ground to make it, and it’s nearly impossible to buy whole kernels for grinding. But there’s hope.\nFloriani Red Flint corn is a rare, open-pollinated corn variety from Italy with unforgettable flavor — and the possibilities for cooking with it are endless. If you’re hoping to become self-sufficient in grain, or if you’re looking for a cornmeal with a rich, distinct taste and texture, then you’ll love Floriani. This heirloom corn is an old variety from the Italian Alps that was originally selected for qualities that make great polenta. This particular variety is a landrace (a locally adapted variety that has more variation than a variety bred for specific qualities) from the Valsugana Valley, where subsistence farmers grew it as the staple food until the mid-20th century. The Alpine farmers dried their crop, shucked the ears, and ground the corn into a coarse meal that they boiled and served as polenta.\nWhile the hulls are red, the meal is a deep yellow with a hint of pink. It is physically beautiful and has a rich, complex flavor to match. ‘Floriani Red Flint’ is the ideal grain corn crop for homesteading: productive, rewarding, and not the usual industrial fare.\nFedco, a Maine-based seed company, had this to say about Floriani in its 2010 catalog: “Stop the presses! Fabulous flavor is why we stuck Floriani into the catalog at the last possible moment. Its medium-to-deep red, pointed kernels are easy to shell. They grind into a fine, pinkish meal that bakes with an appealing spongy texture. Floriani’s richly sweet, delicious, corny taste beat the competition silly in our pancake and cornbread muffin bake-off.”\nGrowing Floriani and Selecting Seed\n‘Floriani Red Flint’ is new to the United States. I first encountered it in Italy while visiting a friend whose family grew the corn for their nightly polenta. I admired the flavor of the corn and was given a kilo of it to bring home. With the help of MOTHER EARTH NEWS, growers have now tested the corn in Kansas, Maine, Nebraska, South Carolina, and Northern California.\nFloriani seems well-adapted to a wide range of North American growing conditions. Like all corn, it’s a heavy feeder. With enough feeding, expect to harvest ears that are at least 8.5 inches long with 15 or 16 rows of kernels. However, I’ve seen crops with 6-inch ears, so be sure to plant in rich soil and, if you can, side-dress with nitrogen-rich compost or apply an organic fertilizer.\nHomesteaders can easily grow enough Floriani for many servings of grits, polenta, pancakes, and cornbread. For self-sufficiency, and to grow enough to have a genetically stable crop to save seed from, plant at least 2,000 seeds (about 19 ounces). You can expect one ear per plant, roughly 100 ears per 100-foot row, and, if you’ve done well with your husbandry, this 100 feet will yield at least 10 pounds of grain. On a larger scale, a California farmer growing about 25,000 plants to the acre is getting yields in the range of 1 to 1 1⁄2 tons per acre, using organic methods.\nWe tend to speak of “seed saving.” Yes, historically, farmers “saved seed,” but it would be more accurate to say they selected seed for the next harvest. They selected for traits they wanted to encourage and, in so doing, created variants of known varieties (landraces), and sometimes variants that were different enough to be classified as entirely new varieties. ‘Floriani Red Flint’ is an example of this. Its name in the Alpine Italian dialect is spina rossa della Valsugana (red-spined of Valsugana).\nThe pioneering group of North American growers named it ‘Floriani Red Flint’ to recognize the generosity of the Floriani family in sharing their seed. This corn is the result of many farmers over a long period of time selecting for at least four traits: early ripening, large cobs, red color, and a markedly pointy or spiny kernel. Fortunately, attached to one or more of these traits is exceptional flavor. For the goal of repopulating our grain trade with grains that have terrific flavor and not just good growing qualities, ‘Floriani Red Flint’ is perfect. Alpine farmers already selected it for a short growing season, thus making it one of the earliest flint corns — an ideal trait for a country the size of ours that has such varied growing conditions. Fedco rates Floriani at about 100 days to maturity based on organic trials in Maine.\nKeeping this grain corn variety true will take some extra work. In a large field, while most of the ears will be deep red, you can expect to see ears ranging in color from red to yellow. This is typical of this type of open-pollinated corn. If you harvest acreage mechanically, be sure to harvest for seed separately, by hand. To keep ‘Floriani Red Flint’ true to its landrace, select for replanting the reddest corn with the most pointy kernels from the healthiest ears.\nWe can’t all grow our own corn. Fortunately, farmers and millers are so excited about this variety that more sources are becoming available for people who want to buy Floriani corn flour. One source is a new company, Community Grains in Northern California. ‘Floriani Red Flint’ is one of the reasons Community Grains was created, and the company specializes in milling it.\nIn Italy, Floriani’s reason for existence was polenta. In their more rustic forms, Italian polenta and American grits are basically the same thing: boiled whole-grain cornmeal. Whether you serve it as polenta or grits, this is a dense corn that benefits from long cooking. I suggest simmering it for three hours, or cooking it in a pressure cooker for 20 minutes. I usually prefer a ratio of 1 part cornmeal to 3½ to 4 parts water, but there’s no right amount of water to use — go by your personal taste. Adding water is usually easier than evaporating it, so start on the conservative side.\nWhether cooking in an open pot or in a pressure cooker, pour the coarsely ground ‘Floriani Red Flint’ into lightly salted, boiling water. Whisk to eliminate lumps, then, if using a pressure cooker, cover, pressurize and cook for 20 minutes. Otherwise, simmer for about three hours, adding water if the polenta gets too stiff. Polenta doesn’t require constant stirring. It does stick, however, so check on it from time to time to ensure it doesn’t burn. Polenta is done when it’s creamy and tender.\nYou can enrich your polenta with butter or cheese. Stirring in grated, hard sheep cheese would be authentic to the corn’s Alpine origins, as would making it with goat or sheep milk. My preference, though, is to keep the polenta as light and clean-tasting as possible because its intrinsic flavor is so good.\nOne of the great qualities of this corn is that it tends to blend well with deep flavors. It’s especially good served with strongly flavored greens, such as collards, kales, and chicories, or wild greens such as dandelion and nettles. Polenta topped with a sauce of wild mushrooms is a classic, as is serving it with any toppings made of grilled sausage or game birds. Floriani also goes well with farmhouse stews, especially those made with meat from older farm animals that requires long cooking to tenderize. Rabbit, an old laying hen, or a surplus rooster are traditional accompaniments to rustic-style polenta.\nAmple Scrapple Options\nScrapple is a rare American dish regional to Pennsylvania. As a Californian, I’d heard of it, but only recently tasted it for the first time. I have to say my first encounter with scrapple shocked me — in a good way. Why hadn’t I made this before? It’s terrific!\nAt the center of scrapple’s American history is a dish associated with pig butchering among the Pennsylvania Dutch. Historically, scrapple was essentially polenta boiled in a broth made from bits of pig that couldn’t be used in sausage making. Cooks chopped up that same meat and stirred it back into the polenta, then poured the polenta out to cool and solidify, at which point it was sliced and fried.\nUsing ‘Floriani Red Flint’ brings to scrapple the type of cornmeal the Pennsylvania Dutch traditionally cooked with. I make the broth with pork shoulder, but you can substitute the meat you like. I also add a little thyme and rosemary to the polenta during cooking. Dip the slices in flour before frying them to golden brown.\nCheryl Long, editor in chief of MOTHER EARTH NEWS and a scrapple devotee, has a slightly different take on scrapple. She combines Floriani polenta with raw, ground, grass-fed pork to make a premium scrapple. As Cheryl puts it, “Everyone who has tasted our Floriani sausage scrapple is astonished by how good it tastes. We use a premium pork sausage made from pastured heritage hogs, and have our local butcher mix 2 to 3 parts cooked polenta into each pound of sausage. We form patties and freeze them on cookie sheets. This way, the patties are ready to cook — no defrosting needed. Just be sure to dredge the frozen patties in wheat flour to reduce sticking. This is a great way to reduce the per-serving cost of premium, grass-fed meat.”\nA Food Revolution\nAn aspect of growing ‘Floriani Red Flint’ or buying Floriani cornmeal goes beyond its suitability for the homestead or the kitchen: It’s not a commodity crop. The shelves and bins of 21st-century grocery stores are packed with inexpensive foods, but have limited variety in many areas. Corn, of course, is a classic commodity crop. But things change. From the kilo of seed the Florianis gave me, actual acreage is now being grown in the United States. Seed is already available through two seed companies and flour is available through a miller. All are small beginnings helping re-establish some of the variety we’ve lost — but beginnings nonetheless. MOTHER EARTH NEWS promotes Floriani with the dual intention of providing homesteaders with the best possible staple grain corn, and, on an even larger scale, of helping to reverse some of the terrible trends in agriculture of the previous century.\nThe revolution is us. In many ways, this introduction of ‘Floriani Red Flint’ is a test. Can we compete with commodity grain agriculture? Can we bring real diversity back to the grain trade? Right now, in most parts of the country, the grain-processing system is unable to handle non-commodity products. The system isn’t set up for cleaning, storing, and keeping separate small batches of grain that may be from different varieties or grown by different farmers. Companies would need to purchase new machinery and construct new buildings to store grain in a new way.\nAmazingly, in Northern California, interest in ‘Floriani Red Flint’ has been significant enough to begin the process of making this kind of fundamental change to the grain-processing infrastructure. By demanding a great product such as ‘Floriani Red Flint,’ you actually cause the agricultural system to change in some exciting ways. You help create the demand for excellence that creates the infrastructure for the processing of heirloom grains — a precondition for farmers to grow them on a larger scale.\nWhether you are a homesteader, home gardener, or urban cook or baker, join with MOTHER EARTH NEWS and do what you can to grow and use this fabulous, hardy and time-tested Italian heirloom corn.\nFloriani Red Corn Recipes\nSo now you must be inspired to try Floriani red.

{"question":"How did the Japanese occupation impact Hong Kong and the Philippines during World War II?","answer":"Both Hong Kong and the Philippines fell to Japanese forces in 1941. In the Philippines, the Japanese invasion led to the worst defeat ever suffered by an American Army, including the surrender of Bataan and Corregidor and the infamous Death March. U.S. civilians were held in internment camps until their liberation by GIs in a daring rescue mission in Manila. Hong Kong was seized by the Japanese in 1941 and remained under occupation until 1945 when it was liberated. The impact on Hong Kong's population was severe - it dropped from 840,000 in 1941 to 610,000 by 1945 after liberation.","context":["In these heady days of incipient empire, Rudyard Kipling's 1899 poem \"The White Man's Burden\"—written as advice to Americans following our seizure of the Philippines—is enjoying an unlikely revival. In Empire,Niall Ferguson quotes from it at length while urging Americans to accept their long-prophesied destiny in Iraq and elsewhere. But in last Sunday's New York Times Magazine, Ferguson notes a problem with American empire: Too few Americans are willing to make imperialism a full-time career. \"Send forth the best ye breed,\" wrote Kipling, \"in patience to abide.\" That's how the Brits managed to run much of the world for more than a century. The Yanks? No staying power, says Ferguson.\nIt's true: Americans today have little interest in running the world, except by remote control. But that may be because we've already learned our lesson. Speaking as the son, grandson, and great-grandson of Americans who answered Kipling's original call, I'm obliged to point out that we've already tried the British Empire approach at least once before, in the Philippines—not for days or weeks but for half a century. Thousands of Yanks eagerly donned pith helmets and ventured east of Suez, hoping to remake the world and perhaps to make a buck or two in the process. Recalling the results of this grand experiment might give pause to some of today's empire enthusiasts.\nOn May 1, 1898, my great-grandfather Charles \"Bud\" Tomlinson signed up with the 1st Montana Volunteer Infantry, eager to avenge the USS Maine and fight for Cuba libre. On the same day, Commodore George Dewey steamed into Manila Bay, annihilated a Spanish squadron, and established the United States as a world power, to the astonished delight of the folks back home. As a result, Bud never made it to Cuba; he was shipped off to Manila to help plant the Stars and Stripes in Asia. A brief but intense vogue for empire swept the nation: Congress annexed the Philippines, and Bud helped subjugate the Filipinos in a nasty but successful war.\nBud soon went home to Montana. But many ex-soldiers remained in the islands, hoping to strike it rich. They were joined by thousands of idealistic nation-builders from America who came out by the boatload to teach school, build roads, and preach the democracy-and-capitalism gospel. For the Filipinos the results were mixed, but the impact on both nations was considerable.\nThe first U.S. governor-general was William Howard Taft, whose success in Manila diverted him from a judicial career and put him on the fast track to the White House. The governor-generalship was a high-profile job: Among Taft's successors were such political heavyweights as Leonard Wood and Henry Stimson. For the U.S. military, the Philippines functioned as a proving ground for the future commanders of World Wars I (John J. Pershing, Peyton March) and II (George Marshall, Chester Nimitz, and Douglas MacArthur, among many others).\nOur Philippines colony consciously emulated the British Empire, complete with sepoys (the Philippine Scouts), a Hill Station (at Baguio, laid out by no less than Daniel Burnham), and a tame maharajah (the Sultan of Sulu). For awhile, the American Raj stuff played well back home. Bud Tomlinson's daughter Thelma (my grandmother) was reared on stirring tales of his \"Road to Mandalay\" adventures. Decades later, she (along with her husband, Bryan Kerns, and their young daughter Karen) fled Depression-era America for the Philippines. Bryan found work as a mining company accountant, while Thelma happily took up the life of a pukka memsahib.\nAlas, by then America's enthusiasm for empire had faded. As it turned out, there was relatively little money to be made in the Philippines, and the Filipinos seemed less than entirely grateful for the decades of tutelage. So Congress voted to cut the islands loose, after a suitable period of transition. Full independence was scheduled for 1946. Still, my grandparents loved their life in the islands—so much so that they ignored the war clouds and were still there on Dec. 7, 1941. As a result, they and my mother spent the war in a very unpleasant internment camp, just like the one in Empire of the Sun.\nThat was the biggest problem with America's Philippines empire: Its acquisition put us on a collision course with Japan that led directly to Pearl Harbor. Hawaii was merely raided; the Philippines were invaded and conquered, the worst defeat ever suffered by an American Army. The surrender of Bataan and Corregidor was a searing national humiliation. Then came the infamous Death March, and MacArthur's \"I shall return\" vow. In due course he waded ashore at Leyte, as pictured in the famous photograph. What followed was the biggest U.S. land campaign of the Pacific war. Thousands of GIs died to recapture an empire Congress already had decided to abandon.\nThe surviving Bataan POWs were rescued in the commando raid celebrated by Hampton Sides in Ghost Soldiers. Less well-remembered are the thousands of U.S. civilian captives who were on the verge of starvation when they, too, were rescued by GIs, in a daring mission into the heart of occupied Manila. A photograph in the Time-Life book Return to the Philippines shows my grandfather among a crowd of liberated internees, all gazing adoringly at MacArthur.\nThat was pretty much the end of America's grand colonial experiment. Manila was destroyed in the battle to retake it from the Japanese. There was little to stay for, so the Kernses and their fellow internees were shipped home to San Francisco on troop transports. They got a nice welcome but nothing spectacular. Ex-colonials were old news in 1945—especially in San Francisco, then getting ready to host the conference that would establish the United Nations, set up by the United States to lead the world into a post-colonial future. (Unilateralists in those days were almost as scarce as imperialists.) The Philippines got their independence right on schedule in 1946. We kept some military bases, but the notion of formal empire was abandoned, and the American Raj in the Philippines was dismantled. Then it was forgotten.","|(1841) British flag raised.\n(1842) Hong Kong Island ceded by China under Treaty of Nanking.\n(1843) Governor, Sir Henry Pottinger.\n(1844) Governor, Sir John Davis.\n(1848) Governor, Sir George Bonham;

{"question":"How do Breakout Expert Advisors compare to Bollinger Bands in tracking market volatility and price movements?","answer":"Breakout Expert Advisors and Bollinger Bands track market volatility and price movements through different methodologies. Breakout EAs are automated systems that open trades when price breaks through predetermined support and resistance levels. Meanwhile, Bollinger Bands are lagging indicators that plot bands two standard deviations away from a simple moving average, creating a channel that moves with the average. While Breakout EAs execute trades automatically based on price breakouts, Bollinger Bands help analysts identify overbought conditions when price moves closer to the upper band and oversold conditions when price approaches the lower band.","context":["Expert Advisors (EAs) are mechanical trading systems that are specifically designed to enable trades to be executed automatically on the MetaTrader 4 and MetaTrader 5 platforms. EAs can be programmed to alert you of a potential trading opportunity and execute trades automatically on your behalf, including automatically adjusting take profit levels, trailing stops and stop loss orders.\nEach Expert Advisor is unique in that it follows different rules to enter and exit the market. One of the primary advantages of an EA is that it never trades on emotion, which is one of the easiest ways to damage your forex trading account during live currency trading. Forex Expert Advisors consistently follow a trading system within pre-programmed parameters. This is one of the many factors that make these programs so appealing to investors.\nThere are several different types of MT4 and MT5 Expert Advisors. Some are specifically designed to stay active on a 24-hour basis while others are designed to only trade news events. The goal of EAs is to automate trading operations and generate a profit at the same time.\nExpert Advisors use technical indicators in order to evaluate current market conditions and place trades. For an EA to work effectively it must be attached to an individual chart on the MT4 or MT5 trading platform. EAs can analyze countless price influencing factors simultaneously in order to make a trading decision. This coupled with a complete lack of emotion ultimately leads to a highly successful trading combination.\nHow do Expert Advisors Work?\nThe Expert Advisor program works by calculating the various indicators that it was designed to use. When the market conditions meet the precise criteria as outlined in the EA’s source code, the EA takes action. Numerous conditions can be assigned to an EA for entering and exiting the market. Further still, conditions can be assigned to manage trades for multiple take profit levels and trailing stops.\nHow to Use Expert Advisors\nTo use an Expert Advisor you will need to install it on the MetaTrader 4 or MetaTrader 5 platforms, which is a fairly simple procedure. If your EA comes with any instructions read them thoroughly before proceeding.\nTo install an EA on MT4 or MT5 you will need to follow these steps:\n- Put the EA in a place where the platform will be able to use it. In most installations of MetaTrader the location is C:\\Program Files\\MetaTrader4-5\\experts. The actual EA is a file that ends with .EX4.\n- When the EA is in the correct location on your PC you will need to restart the MT4/MT5 platform.\n- The EA will appear on the navigation menu on the left once MT4/MT5 starts up again.\nOnce you have installed the EA you will need to attach it to the appropriate chart on MT4 or MT5.\nWhat Types of Expert Advisors are Available?\nThere are many different types of Expert Advisors available. Some of the more common types of EAs are outlined below:\n- Breakout Expert Advisor: A breakout EA opens a trade once the price breaks through predetermined resistance and support levels.\n- News Expert Advisor: News EAs take advantage of news, events, announcements and large price shifts that often occur when financial news is released.\n- Hedge Expert Advisor: An EA that trades two opposing and separate positions, and minimizes losses on one position while it facilitates maximum returns on the good trade.\n- Scalper Expert Advisor: A scalper EA aims to secure small profits once they become available.\nCan More than One Expert Advisor Run on the Same Client Terminal?\nYou can run more than one Expert Advisor on the same MT4/MT5 client terminal, provided the EAs are compatible with one another on the same terminal. However, there are some platform limitations. Only one EA can communicate with the trading server at a given time. If you have multiple EAs actively running on one client terminal and more than one EA tries to communicate with the trading server you will receive the message “Trade context busy” in the logs.","Top Technical Indicators for Stock Investors\nAn indicator is a mathematical calculation that can be used with the stock’s price and/or volume to help make investment choices. The end result is a value that’s used to anticipate future changes in price. There are two types of indicators: leading and lagging.\nLeading indicators help you profit by attempting to forecast what prices will do next. Leading indicators provide greater rewards at the expense of increased risk. They perform best in sideways or trading markets. They work by measuring how overbought or oversold a stock is.\nLagging (or trend-following) indicators are best suited to price movements in relatively long trends. They don’t warn you of any potential changes in price. Lagging indicators have you buy and sell in a mature trend, when the risk is reduced.\nThe Relative Strength Index\nThe technical conditions of overbought and oversold are important to be aware of. They’re good warning flags to help you time a trade, whether that means getting in or getting out of a position. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a convenient metric for measuring the overbought/oversold condition.\nGenerally, the RSI quantifies the condition and gives you a number that acts like a barometer. On a reading of 0 to 100, the RSI becomes oversold at about the 30 level and overbought at about the 70 level.\nThe RSI is a metric usually calculated and quoted by most charting sources and technical analysis websites. It’s generally considered a leading indicator because it forewarns potential price movements.\nFor stock investors, the RSI is particularly useful for timing the purchase or sale of a particular stock. When you are looking at a favorite stock that you like and notice that its RSI is below 30, check to see whether anything is wrong with the stock (did the fundamentals change?).\nIf nothing is wrong and it’s merely a temporary, market-driven event, consider buying more of the stock. After all, if you loved a great stock at $40 and it’s now cheaper at $35, all things being equal, you have a great buying opportunity.\nConversely, if you’re not crazy about a stock and you see that it’s overbought, consider either selling it outright or at least putting a stop-loss order on the stock.\nThe moving average convergence/divergence (MACD) is a lagging indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of prices. The MACD is calculated by subtracting the 26-day exponential moving average (EMA) from the 12-day EMA. A nine-day EMA of the MACD, called the signal line, is then plotted on top of the MACD, which acts as a trigger for making buy and sell orders.\nThat’s the technical definition of the MACD but don’t worry if you didn’t understand it on the first go-round. Fortunately, it’s not something that you have to calculate on your own; the MACD indicator is usually provided by the technical analysis software or trading service that you may use.\nCrossovers and divergence\nA crossover is the point when the stock’s price and an indicator intersect (or cross over). It’s used as a signal to make a buy or sell order. Say that a stock, for example, falls past $20 per share to $19, and the 20-day moving average is $19.50. That would be a bearish crossover, and it would indicate a good time to sell or risk further downward movement.\nThe opposite is true as well; some crossovers indicate a good time to buy.\nDivergence occurs when the price of a stock and an indicator (or index or other related security) part company and head off in opposite directions. Divergence is considered either positive or negative, both of which are signals of changes in the price trend.\nPositive divergence occurs when the price of a stock makes a new low while a bullish indicator starts to climb upward.\nNegative divergence happens when the price of a stock makes a new high, but bearish indicators signal the opposite, and instead the closing price at the end of the trading day is lower than the previous high.\nCrossovers and divergence are usually leading indicators.\nOscillators are indicators that are used when you’re analyzing charts that have no clear trend. Moving averages and other indicators are certainly important when the trend is clear, but oscillators are more beneficial under either of the following circumstances:\nWhen the stock is in a horizontal or sideways trading pattern\nWhen a definite trend can’t be established because the market is volatile and the price action is very uneven\nOscillators may be either leading or lagging indicators, depending on what type they are. Momentum oscillators, for example, are considered leading indicators because they’re used to track the momentum of price and volume.\nBollinger bands have nothing to do with musical groups. A band is plotted two standard deviations away from a simple moving average. The bollinger band (a lagging indicator) works like a channel and moves along with the simple moving average.\nBollinger bands help the technical analyst watch out for overbought and oversold conditions. Basically, if the price moves closer to the upper band, it indicates an overbought condition. If the price moves closer to the lower band, it indicates an oversold condition."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:3f9b1123-6ed8-4564-8ef6-6dc02bdd5f3c>","<urn:uuid:32c9501a-563e-4c9d-bb86-18ffaf07547d>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do cardiovascular training in physiotherapy compare to treatment approaches for diabetic retinopathy in terms of their focus on blood vessels?","answer":"Cardiovascular training in physiotherapy and diabetic retinopathy treatment approach blood vessel health differently. Cardiovascular training focuses on pre- and post-operative rehabilitation of heart, blood vessels, and lungs through individual training programs that improve heart function and increase effort capacity for better physical condition. In contrast, diabetic retinopathy treatment addresses changes in retinal blood vessels that have weakened due to diabetes, which can lead to severe vision loss or blindness, requiring specific interventions like laser treatments to seal off leaky blood vessels.","context":["Our practice stands for a professional rehabilitation geared to the patient and his problem. Complaints are treated with manual techniques, a guided exercise therapy, massage or physical therapy. Moreover, an exercising programme and tips are given for at home, for a faster recovery\nIn addition to general physiotherapy rehabilitation, in our practice we offer different specific treatments, such as:\n- Sports rehabilitation and Medical taping\n- Respiratory physiotherapy\n- Manual therapy\n- Corestability training\n- Cardiovascular training\n- General physiotherapy\nSports rehabilitation and Medical taping\nSport rehabilitation is used to let the body function again at the previous level after having incurred a sports injury. It may concern an acute trauma, but also a strain injury.\nIndividual appropriate treatment, guidance and testing of the sportsman makes sure that he can resume sports activities as soon and as safe as possible. Gradually building up the load is an important factor here.\nMedical taping can offer a functional support for the manual and remedial therapy within the sport rehabilitation by applying a classic tape or kinesiotape. As such we seek to get the patient moving again as quickly as possible, which also favours the intrinsic healing without the adverse consequences of a too long immobilisation.\nThe use of elastic tape provides a comfortable feeling, a long lasting support, even after showering, and the natural movements are not prevented, just supported.\nThe aim of respiratory physiotherapy is to clear the mucus (slime) from the lungs of the patient as fast as possible and to enable quiet breathing. To pursue a normal breathing pattern and to teach the patient to control his breath is also one of the goals.\nAcute, chronic, post-operative lung disorders, such as bronchitis, pneumonia, COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease), ABPA (Allergic Bronchopulmomary Aspergillosis), mucoviscidosis, bronchiectasis, asthma, hyperventilation … are treated by means of specific breathing techniques:\n- Autogenic drainage\n- Thoracic and vertebral mobilisations\n- Guidance/supervision on using aerosol therapy, puffer or dry powder inhaler\n- Effort exercises and/or relaxation.\nManual therapy is used for persons with problems of the locomotor system (the spinal column and the joints of the arms and legs). Overloading the joint is often the cause of the complaint. Moving then becomes difficult and painful. Muscles may also cramp and the pain may radiate to other parts of the body.\nThe manual therapist remedies the functional disturbance by applying specific passive mobilising movements. By moving the parts of the body in a certain way around the joint, it is possible to quickly increase the mobility of the joints. The pain lessens and the movement of the joints can be improved.\nCorestability training or trunk stabilization training can not be ignored at various sport training courses. The goal of this stabilization training is to strengthen the trunk muscles (mainly the abdominal and back muscles). In stabilization training, attention is paid to the posture, learning to address a good postural control and a muscle tone for a better body awareness.\nGood body awareness is necessary during daily life, but certainly also during sports.\nSitting in a chair or at a desk for a long time and standing tall are not to be underestimated for the joints. Especially when the muscle corset is not working properly.\nStrengthening the trunk muscles provides an increase in performance and reduces the risk of injuries.\nIt is impossible to imagine certain sport trainings without core stability training or torso stabilisation training. The aim of this stabilisation training is the reinforcement of the core muscles (especially the abdominal and dorsal muscles). During the stabilisation training emphasis is put on the posture, on learning to apply a good postural control and on muscle tension for a better body awareness.\nA good body awareness is necessary during daily life, but certainly so when practising sports.\nSitting on a couch or at a desk for a long time and standing up for long periods are loads on the joints not to be underestimated. Even more so when the muscle corset doesn’t function well.\nReinforcing the core muscles ensures an increased performance and reduces the risk of injury.\nCardiovascular training concerns the pre- and post-operative rehabilitation of the heart, blood vessels and lungs. By means of an individual training programme, on the one hand attention is paid to breathing and on the other hand the optimisation of the physical condition is pursued.\nThe exercises and efforts improve the heart function and increase the effort capacity. This leads to a better physical condition and a higher endurance.\nMost of the treatments for physiotherapy concern disorders of the locomotor system. This varies from tendonitis, rehabilitation after fractures, sprains or operations, to tension pains in the neck and shoulders, dorsal pains, stiff muscles and joints.

It is responsible for capturing the light rays that enter the eyes, and along with the optic nerve, converting them to light impulses and sending them to the brain for processing.\nRetinal Detachment. Separation of the retina from the tissue beneath it, known as Retinal Pigmented Epithelium (RPE). There are three types of retinal detachments. Rhegmatogenous detachment occurs when fluid seeps underneath and causes the retina to separate from the RPE. Traction retinal detachment occurs when strands of scar tissue create traction on the retina, pulling it loose. The least common form of retinal detachment is called exudative retinal detachment and occurs when fluid collects between the retina and RPE, usually due to inflammation or tumor.\nRetinal Pigmented Epithelium.

Smith Corp Quarterly Data","By combining fraudulent theft with cyber tactics, Synthetic Identity Fraud (SIF) has emerged as the fastest-growing financial crime.\nHow big is the problem? Based on insights from our Cyber Fraud Network, FiVerity estimates losses among U.S. banks grew to $20 billion last year.\nA key factor in SIF’s growth is its ability to evade traditional fraud detection systems. According to ID Analytics, more than 85% of likely SIF attacks are undetected by legacy solutions. This failure is largely due to a rule-based, top-down approach that\npresumes to know what a fraudulent application looks like. Static rules determine how well each application matches this assumption, and the more boxes that are checked – for instance too many credit inquiries over a short time period – the higher the fraud\nThis approach served the industry well during the decades that bank fraud was a largely manual process – a single criminal could only steal so many identities, and enough of these would be detected by static rules and other safeguards. Today’s global criminal\norganizations however, leverage sophisticated technology that continuously change tactics as they create SIF identities, confounding rule-based systems.\nWith over 1.3 billion identities compromised via data breaches over the past five years alone, cyber fraudsters have extensive source data to work with. Their process starts with bots that mine the dark web for personally identifiable information, then stitches\nelements together to create a synthetic identity. This isn’t just a time-saver, however. It’s the engine that allows them to create tens of thousands of loan applications that go on to inform machine learning algorithms.\nEach rejected and approved application then serves as a feedback loop for the machine learning system. The process is essentially figuring out thresholds for each of the rules used by legacy systems and creating new applications that are increasingly difficult\nBy their very nature, synthetic identities also evade the basic safeguards that alert banks to identity theft and other forms of fraud. As there’s no actual customer, there’s unlikely to be any abnormal spending that would trigger a double-check on a purchase.\nSimilarly, there’s no customer that might notice a fraudulent purchase and call their bank.\nThe cost of SIF goes well beyond financial losses to banks as SIF accounts provide criminals with thousands of “aliases” to perpetrate all sorts of serious crimes. The\nFederal Reserve notes SIF has been tied to global crime rings active in smuggling weapons and drugs, as well as human trafficking.\nCyber Fraud Defense\nHow do we respond to threats that are virtually undetectable by the industry’s standard defenses?\nBottom Up Approach\nAdopting the machine learning approaches used by fraudsters is the most effective way to counter their attacks. Instead of assuming what a fraudulent account looks like, machine learning takes a “bottom up” approach, searching profiles for patterns similar\nto those of recently confirmed fraudsters. Instead of checking against a set of static rules, these new systems learn what the fraudsters are up to and adapt as tactics evolve.\nHuman in the Loop\nYou may not be surprised to hear that AI is required to fight AI – but implementing an effective program might be easier than you’d think. Not all cyber fraud defenses require the massive amounts of data needed for most AI systems. Instead, they scale the\nwork being done by the bank’s team of fraud analysts. The software analyzes applications, presents its findings to the human in the loop, and learns from the confirmations or corrections they provide – getting smarter over time.\nAn Existential Requirement\nThere’s no silver bullet to fighting fraud, and there’s still value in legacy systems – they can work alongside AI-driven systems to catch a wider range of fraudulent activity. Financial institutions do however need to modernize their approach to detecting\nnew threats like SIF. Successfully taking on new and evolving crimes that combine fraudulent theft with cyber tactics is an existential requirement for every consumer lending institution."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:b855cb2b-02f8-4034-a6d6-1fafb7ab78b7>","<urn:uuid:56c8fd2e-5058-4846-9c83-e5d0a414911b>"],"error":null}
