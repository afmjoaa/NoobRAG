{"question":"How do paper products and methane emissions differ in their contribution to environmental problems?","answer":"Paper products and methane have different environmental impacts. Paper, cardboard, and organic materials, despite being biodegradable, tend to remain intact in airless landfill conditions, taking up significant landfill space. Meanwhile, methane emissions from decomposing food waste are a major climate change contributor, being up to 30 times more potent than CO2 and responsible for 30-50% of current temperature increases. Experts suggest that reducing methane emissions by 40-45% over the next decade could reduce global temperature increase by 0.3C by 2040.","context":["Rathje located that paper, cardboard and other organic supplies — while technically biodegradable — tend to remain intact in the airless confines of a landfill. These mummified materials in fact use significantly a lot more landfill space than plastic packaging, which has steadily been acquiring smaller sized as suppliers develop stronger, thinner materials.

Re-connect with meals by realizing the approach that goes into generating it. Move older products to the front of your cupboard or fridge and new ones to the back. Use airtight containers to keep open food fresh in the fridge and make sure packets are closed to stop insects from getting in.\nRechargeable batteries – Stop by or take to household hazardous waste collection sites. We hope that this weblog helped you know about forms of waste management. Meals waste is a critical problem and desires severe consideration. According to the United States Department of Agriculture, among 30 and 40 % of all food made by the United States is spent on meals by retailers and buyers.\nIn addition, needles and sharps that have been incorrectly disposed of might result in an injury that could be significant.

Few of which can be recycled and handful of can’t, in addition to this there are some waste which are hazardous in nature. Many residential recycling applications in Maine gather several types of paper such as paperboard, magazines, or junk mail in a single category. This is the lowest high quality of recycled paper in the paper stream. The majority of residential mixed paper is paperboard and associated products, a very thin gray board applied to make containers such as cereal boxes, shoe boxes, pasta boxes and the like.\nBeginning in 2025, food service organizations will not be allowed to place substantial amounts of food in the garbage.

For the first time, the latest report (released this month) included a chapter dedicated to weather extremes as well as a statement that human activities are causing climate change.\nBelow are a few topics that the report touched on, and why they matter.\nExtreme Weather Events\nHuman-caused greenhouse gas emissions have led to extreme weather events, which are linked to rising temperatures. We’ve seen this from the recent heavy flooding across Europe, China, Nigeria, and South Sudan – to the wildfires on the West Coast, Greece, Turkey, and Canada – which just had a record heatwave.\nWith our planet heating up, more warm air is trapped in our atmosphere causing the moisture level to increase and rainfall to become more extreme – leading to catastrophic flooding. Around the world we are also seeing warmer and drier conditions making forests more susceptible to wildfires – wildfire seasons getting longer and more severe.\nThe Impact on Our Planet\nWe’re seeing “widespread and rapid” changes in the oceans, ice and land surfaces of every inhabited region on earth. Though there is still time for us to create change, we are getting closer to crossing more of Earth’s tipping points.\nAll About Methane\nMethane is a greenhouse gas that’s up to 30 times more potent than CO2. As a Waste Warrior, you may know that when food gets sent to the landfill, this dangerous gas is emitted as the food waste rots.\nEmissions of methane have made a huge contribution to the current warming of our planet (30-50% of the current rise in temperatures). Experts believe that if methane emissions were cut by 40-45% over the next decade, we could reduce the increase in global temperatures by 0.3C by the year 2040.\nFIGHTING FOOD WASTE MATTERS!\nThe good news is that being in the fight against food waste means we’re in the fight against climate change as well. Reducing food waste is a key solution to cutting down on methane, which is responsible for so much of the findings in this latest report.\nBy reducing food waste, we actively ensure that food does not end up in landfills, and that it wasn’t produced in vain. Wasting food means wasting resources, and also all the emissions that it took to produce it in the first place.\nEach and every one of us can make a difference in the fight against food waste, and therefore the fight against climate change. “\nCEOforLIFE – We promote life.

{"question":"Could you explain the landscaping benefits of butterfly bush and its potential environmental risks as an invasive species?","answer":"Butterfly bush offers several landscaping benefits: it's a deciduous shrub with large, showy, fragrant flower panicles up to 12 inches long that attract butterflies. It's available in many color varieties, including striking deep purple, and makes an attractive accent plant growing 6-10 feet tall and up to 10 feet wide. It's also low maintenance and drought tolerant. However, it poses significant environmental risks as an invasive species. It spreads profusely by seed into disturbed and natural areas, with a single flower spike producing 40,000 seeds with an 80% germination rate. It can significantly impact riparian habitat, impede forest regeneration, and form dense thickets that crowd out native vegetation along riversides. The plant colonizes disturbed areas such as riversides, roadsides, railroads, pastures, and recently logged or burned forests, disrupting natural succession patterns.","context":["It’s summertime, and the livin’ is easy…\n...at least, it’s easy when you’ve made smart plant selection choices for your landscape!\nNo one wants to spend their summer doing more chores than necessary. So unless you really enjoy spending time coddling finicky plants, it makes sense to choose low maintenance and drought tolerant species and varieties.\nThey’ll allow you to enjoy your landscape with minimal fuss. And they’ll save you a ton on your summer water bill as well.\nThe following five perennial plant species are ones that we have found to be especially suited to thrive in Tennessee’s climate and soil conditions with a minimum of input on your part. They are our top picks for an easy-breezy summer landscape.\nOur top 5 drought tolerant, low maintenance landscape plants for the Memphis area.\nDaylilies (Hemerocallis spp.)\nBlooming from May through August, these ever-popular landscape plants come in a huge variety of colors and sizes, ranging from under 6” to over three feet in height.\nThey are especially prized for their vibrant displays of color in the first part of the summer.\nDaylilies are extremely versatile. Use short varieties for borders, and taller ones as accent plants or in large beds for a wide swath of color in the landscape.\nSome varieties, such as the golden yellow Stella D'oro, will provide multiple bloom opportunities throughout the season.\nPlant these low maintenance plants in full sun to partial shade — they’re not picky!\nPurple Coneflower (Echinacea purpurea)\nWell known as an immune boosting herb, Echinacea is also a beautiful and hardy bedding plant. Because it is native to our area, it thrives in the garden with very little maintenance.\nThe original wildflower has purple petals with a gold center, and this is still the most common cultivar.\nHowever, a whole rainbow of other color varieties are now also available, some with exotic-looking double blooms. Plant them in full sun to light shade.\nPurple coneflowers grow up to 47” tall.\nEnjoy these low maintenance plants in your Tennessee landscape from June through August. They make great cut flowers, too!\nRudbeckia (Rudbeckia spp.)\nPerhaps better known by its common name, Black-Eyed Susan, the classic Rudbeckia sports deep golden orange-yellow petals that contrast strikingly with a deep black center.\nLike Echinacea, the plant has since been bred into many colorful varieties, some with striking multi-colored petals.\nWe especially love the sunny yellow variety called ‘Goldstrum’ for landscaping purposes.\nGoldstrum grows about 23”-29” with a spread of one to two feet.\nThis drought tolerant plant in full sun to partial shade and blooms mid summer through August.\nButterfly bush (Buddleia davidii)\nAnother colorful addition to your Memphis summer landscape, the Butterfly Bush is a deciduous shrub with very large (up to 12” long), showy, fragrant flower panicles that of course attract butterflies.\nIt also is available in many color varieties. One of our favorites, 'Black Knight,' is a striking deep purple that contrasts beautifully with the flowers listed above.\nThe Butterfly Bush makes an attractive accent plant, growing 6-10 feet tall and up to 10 feet wide. One caution: this low maintenance plant can become invasive, so take care to plant it where it can’t escape!\nButterfly bush blooms from June through September in Memphis.\nChaste Tree (Vitex angus castus)\nThis native of central Asia can be grown as a small tree or pruned to a large shrub. Left to its own devices it will grow up to 20 feet tall with a spread of 10-15 feet.\nIts multiple trunks give it a spreading habit and lend interest to the winter landscape.\nWith its showy purple panicle blooms, Vitex is a real showstopper in the landscape, as well as an excellent food source for butterflies and bees.\nPlant it in full sun, and make sure the soil is well-drained — this little drought tolerant plant hates wet feet! (That’s one reason it’s so easy to take care of - it thrives on very little water.)\nThe chaste tree blooms from July through August.\nFind More Drought Tolerant Plants For Your Memphis Property\nOf course, this is just a small sampling of the many easy-care plants that do well in Tennessee and the mid-south.\nIf you are looking for more low maintenance plants, you can’t go wrong to explore the many wonderful native varieties that are now available in nurseries. Not only are native plants typically low-maintenance, but they also are important food sources for our native pollinators and other wildlife.\nHowever, if you don’t find native plants you like, don’t despair. Remember that one of the keys for successful Xeriscaping (landscaping with minimal or no irrigation) is not as much a plant’s place of origin but the type of climate that it is native to in the wild.\nIf its native climate is similar to ours, or slightly drier, it will probably do well here.\nIf you have any questions about planting an easy-care landscape, or would like suggestions for additional species that we have found are well suited to Memphis growing conditions, feel free to give us a call at 901-755-3207","Butterfly bush is an introduced shrub from China that has been widely planted as an ornamental and butterfly plant throughout North America. Unfortunately, this popular garden plant is also highly invasive and spreads profusely by seed into disturbed and natural areas. Butterfly bush can now be found commonly along riversides and roads and in cleared forests throughout western Washington and Oregon, at times significantly impacting riparian habitat and riverside conditions and impeding forest regeneration.\nLegal status in King County, Washington\nButterfly bush is a Class B noxious weed on the Washington State Noxious Weed List. It is on the Non-Regulated Noxious Weed List for King County, Washington. Control of butterfly bush in King County is recommended but not required. Butterfly bush is not on the prohibited plants list administered by the Washington State Department of Agriculture, but some nurseries have volunteered to stop selling it due to its danger to natural resources.\nThe King County Noxious Weed Control Board encourages property owners to remove butterfly bush where possible and to avoid introducing it to new landscapes. Ornamental plantings can be contained by removing flower stalks before they form seeds.\nIdentification (see below for more photos)\n- Deciduous shrub up to 15 feet tall with arching branches\n- Showy flower spikes grow at the branch ends, either upright or often nodding, 4 to 10 inches long\n- Flowers typically light purple with orange centers (hence the common name \"orange eye\"), four-petaled, bell-shaped, and in dense clusters\n- Cultivars have been developed with a range of colors including red, magenta, blue, orange, yellow, white and dark purple\n- Young stems are green, older stems have peeling, gray-brown bark\n- Leaves are long and narrow or somewhat egg-shaped and arranged oppositely on the branches\n- Leaves are usually 4 to 10 inches long and 1 to 3 inches wide\n- Edges of the leaves are toothed\n- Upper leaf surface is deep green to blue-gray, while the undersides seem whitish due to dense covering or short, fuzzy hair\n- Flowers bloom between mid-summer and the first frost in Washington State\n- Seed capsules split in two to release small, winged seeds\nHabitat and impact\nButterfly bush is most vigorous in well-drained soil and full sun. It can tolerate drought and low-nutient soil and can grow in very challenging conditions, such as cracks in the pavement and along railroads. Seeds require exposed soil to gerninate successfully and seedlings are not often seen in improved garden soils or well-maintained landscapes.\nButterfly bush colonizes disturbed areas such as riversides, roadsides, railroads, pastures, and recently logged or burned forests. Invasion of butterfly bush along riversides is especially problematic, because it forms dense thickets, crowds out native vegetation, and disrupts natural succession patterns. Initial densities of seedlings along open areas of riverbanks and sandbars can be very high and mature butterfly bush stands keep out native willows and other woody vegetation that would normally re-vegetate riverbanks after floods.\nGrowth and reproduction\nButterfly bush spreads by producing abundant amounts of very lightweight, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind and water over many miles. A study at Longwood Gardens in Pennsylvania found that a single flower spike produced 40,000 seeds. The germination rate of several cultivars was 80 percent or higher. This species is quick to mature, often producing seeds during its first year of growth. Also, butterfly bush is adapted to surviving along riversides and can develop roots on branches that have been buried or broken off.\nOnce established, butterfly bush is tough to eliminate. Seeds remain viable in the soil for 3 to 5 years. Butterfly bush can re-sprout from the rootstock after it can been damaged or cut down to its base, and the cut stems can grow into new plants if not disposed of properly.\nPrevention: Don't let butterfly bush go to seed. Remove spent flowerheads in the fall before they disperse seeds (don't wait until spring) and discard these in the garbage to avoid spreading seeds. Consider using other species in your landscape (see the garden wise publication for suggestions). For existing plantings, consider removing the butterfly bush to prevent its spread.\nManual control: Seedlings can be easily hand-pulled and larger bushes can be dug out (with some effort). Weed wrenches can work, but trunks are often too brittle and break off. Watch for new seedlings where the soil was disturbed and consider planting grass or a ground cover to suppress future seedling germination of the butterfly bush seeds remaining in the soil.\nDisposal: Branches should not be left on the bare ground because they can form roots and re-grow. Do not discard branches or root balls in natural areas or on roadsides because they can re-grow and spread. Branches can be burned, put in your yard waste container, or taken to a landfill or yard waste composting facility. Seedheads should be discarded in the garbage. If you cut seedheads after the fall, place a bag around them before cutting off to minimize dispersal of the seeds.\nChemical control: Controlling butterfly bush by spraying with a brush-control herbicide is somewhat effective, but for better results, cut the trunk off at the base and apply concentrated glyphosate (such as in Roundup) or triclopyr (such as in Garlon or Brush B Gon) to the freshly cut surface. For more detailed information on the cut stump treatment method and more information on using herbicides to control weeds in different crops and locations, please see the Pacific Northwest Weed Management Handbook. Always follow the label directions on any herbicide product you use to minimize any potential risks to you and the environment, and follow all applicable laws and regulations regarding herbicide use on your site. Contact the Noxious Weed Program if you are unsure about what to do.\nBiological control: There are currently no biocontrol agents available for managing butterfly bush. See the biological control page for more information.\nCultural/grazing: Although goats will eat butterfly bush and can cause damage to the plants, they will not kill or eradicate this plant. Consider using goat grazing as part of an integrated program with other methods, perhaps followed up by manual or chemical treatment.\nAdditional information on butterfly bush\nWhat to do if you find this plant in King County, Washington\nBecause butterfly bush is so widespread, property owners in King County are not required to control it and we are not generally tracking infestations. We can provide advice on how to control butterfly bush, but there is generally no legal requirement to do so. We are tracking locations of butterfly bush in some wilderness areas as part of the Upper Snoqualmie Invasive Weed Control Project and could always use more Weed Watchers for this effort.\nButterfly bush photos - please click on a thumbnail for larger image\nPlease Note: Photos on this page were provided courtesy of the Thurston County Noxious Weed Board, the Washington State Noxious Weed Board, Tim Miller, Jennifer E.

{"question":"How did political reforms affect Middle Eastern countries in the 1980s versus recent years, and what role does social isolation play in mental health outcomes for immigrant populations?","answer":"In the 1980s, Middle Eastern political reforms kept autocrats in power while shifting support from popular bases to economic elites, leading to inefficient crony capitalism and increased state repression. In recent years, while some countries like Tunisia have attempted political liberalization, others maintain autocratic control with upgraded repression tools and better social media control. Regarding social isolation's impact on immigrant mental health, research has shown that immigrant groups are more susceptible to social isolation and loneliness, which negatively affects mental wellbeing. Studies have demonstrated that peer-based interventions, including home visits and telephone support, can help reduce loneliness and increase resilience among immigrant populations, while also decreasing depressive symptoms and improving life satisfaction.","context":["How Economic Policies Affect Political Regimes? Comparing the 2020s to the 1980s in the Middle East and North Africa\nIn the past decade, economic performance has been low in most countries of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), as they were hit first by the chaos that followed the uprisings of 2011, then by the subsequent fall in international oil prices in 2015, and more recently, by the Covid-19 crisis since 2020. To appease the concerns of restless citizens, fiscal and external deficits have been allowed to rise. This unsustainable and fragile situation today resembles that which came out of the 1980s: on average, growth was close to zero for the region during the 1980s, and it was not much larger in the decade of the 2010s (see Table 1). Similar to the debt crisis that forced a number of reforms at the end of the 1980s, fiscal space has disappeared as fast as public debt has ballooned. At the same time, poverty and unemployment have been on the rise in many countries.\nIn the 1980s, the economic policies that ended up being implemented kept autocrats in power even as they rearranged political settlements away from their popular base, and towards economic elites, such as owners of capital, and politically connected entrepreneurs (Heydemann 2004). The countries that made such reforms got generous external support that was not conditional on political opening (Schlumberger 2007). They stabilised their economies gradually, and ended up with lower state expenditures—this is exemplified by Egypt, where public expenditures fell from around 60% to 30% GDP between 1980 and 2010 (Cammett et al 2013). In parallel, however, the rise of markets was carefully controlled, leading to an inefficient form of crony capitalism, which did not create the types of jobs to which increasingly educated youth aspired (Diwan, Malik, and Atiyas 2019). This inheritance looms large: on average, only about 12% of workers are in relatively good formal private sector jobs, in a sea of informal, unprotected, and low productivity/low pay jobs, and with a shrinking pool of public sector jobs (see Table). Regimes had to increasingly rely on state repression to stay in power (Hinnebusch 2006). The combination of lower social mobility, non-inclusive growth, and rising repression ultimately led to the social explosion of the Arab Spring in 2011 (Kienle and Sika 2015).\nHaving managed to survive the major economic challenge in the 1980s, autocratic regimes are now back to square one because none of the structural problems of the past that gave rise to social contestation have been resolved. Again, they face the challenges of macro-instability, low growth and job creation, and high levels of popular contestation. Both stabilisation and structural reforms are however unpopular and create risks regimes seeking political survival. Reducing deficits remains, as in the past, a first challenge to overcome: austerity is unpopular, but the alternative of falling into a financial crisis threatens to bring down entire political regimes. Engaging in structural reforms to boost growth can create more jobs in the distant future, but this requires opening up to private sector competition, which also creates political risk both by weakening a regime's cronies, and by empowering more autonomous actors that can support the opposition. These policy dilemmas resemble those of the 1980s.\nBut an economic rebound is even harder to engineer now than it was four decades ago. The decline in oil price after 2015, coming on the heels of a long oil boom, represents a new normal for oil-exporting countries, even as oil prices continue to fluctuate. Over time, there has been further de-industrialisation (especially in Algeria, Lebanon, Egypt, and Iraq). Private investment is at a historical low in many countries. Export growth is more challenging in a more fiercely competitive global economy. Tourism is not resilient to security and health shocks. And remittances, a lifeline for millions around the region, are on the decline as the GCC Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) replaces migrants with nationals. At the same time, external financing is now more sensitive to performance: bilateral creditors are budget-constrained at a time when geo-political rents are eroding and some countries that were too large to fail are becoming too large to bail. Moreover, a good portion of external debt is now owed to uncooperative financial markets. In some cases, the domestic banking sector is also vulnerable (for example, in Egypt and Tunisia), raising the risk of immisirizing triple financial crises (external, fiscal, and banking), such as in Lebanon.\nIn contrast to the 1980s, countries are confronting the challenges they face by placing their bets in a more varied way. Three categories of bets, all risky, have been placed so far by embattled regimes, the resolution of which will determine where these countries end up in the medium term:\n- Back to the 80s: Egypt’s current stance towards adjustment resembles what it did in the 1980s: a gradual fiscal adjustment, with little progress on structural change, and a reversal on political opening. It is hard to see how such a policy mix can be sustainable. Private investment has fallen to around 7% GDP, lower than during Nasser’s socialist period (Diwan et al 2020, Adly 2020). Jordan too is more focused on stabilisation than on structural change. In both countries, lack of progress on growth creates high risks for macro, social, and possibly political sustainability.\n- Economic voluntarists: Morocco has managed to retain very high investment rates, even as consumption stagnates and rural poverty remains high. In this, it follows, albeit in less ambitious ways, Saudi Arabia’s strategy of moderating consumption while at the same time increasing investment (Diwan 2021). In both countries, this is a dual bet modelled on the recipe of the Asian miracle and its two basic assumptions: first, that the public sector can create a private one; and, second, that partial rights (a new constitution in Morocco, a social opening in Saudi Arabia) will be sufficient to placate opposition, especially by the youth, in the face of less consumption and more effort.\n- Political reformists: Tunisia was the first country to choose to bet on political liberalisation. Conceptually, a competitive political system could absorb grievances and lead over time to better economic policies. So far, however, fragile coalitions have been unable to take decisive action to address the existing economic challenges (Diwan 2019). Will the recent presidential “coup” shake up the political system enough to lead it to action, or will it instead accelerate the decent into a financial crisis? In Sudan, a fragile deal between the army and protesters also led to progress in terms of political openness. International support is now easing the country’s budget constraint, but there is strong opposition to structural reforms, including from the military and the protesters themselves. Iraq is trying to move on a similar track. In all three of these three countries, the political bets are risky, suggesting that democratic rule is not in itself the answer.\nOther countries have not been able to muster the stamina to move away from a collapsing status quo. Fragile regimes that still have foreign currency reserves left are doing little—this is the case in Lebanon and Algeria. Both will need to choose their bet as reserves evaporate. Syria, Yemen, Libya, and Palestine remain stuck in a trap of violence.\nA lot has been written on how and why countries in the MENA region were resistant to democratisation in the 1980s, unlike the cases of Latin America and Africa, where economic and political liberalisation went hand-in-hand. Will the 2020s prove to be similar? Several things seem to have changed, including both that repressive tools have been upgraded and that contestation has become more widespread. Thus, there is support for the argument that this time things will be different, but there is also support for the argument that the situation will unfold similar to how it did before.\nConceptually, a combination of economic pressures and social mobilisation could—more so than in the 1980s—create incentives for regimes to bet on an opening up of the political space that allows reforms to proceed while diffusing social tensions. In the 1980s, those who lost out as a result of the reforms—public sector workers in particular—provided strong support for the political and economic status-quo, while would-be-winners among the private sector barely existed and consequently had little voice to support political change. This has since changed profoundly because much of the youth (including the educated) now find themselves in competitive markets. Moreover, social revolts have become more embedded in the political repertoire of the region; and fuelled by rising social grievances, they are unlikely to disappear—as witnessed by the flurry of revolts in Sudan, Algeria, Iraq, and Lebanon in 2019. If social movements can start laying out a broad vision for the future (and this is admittedly a big if), it would become more realistic to imagine a gradual political opening-cum economic reform path ahead.\nBut on the other side of the ledger, the autocrats’ toolbox has also been upgraded. Unlike during the 1980s, the success of China, and the chaos following the Arab Spring itself, have reduced the appeal of competitive systems, including in Tunisia (Cammett et al 2019). Methods of state repression have become more effective, including better control of both social and traditional media In Algeria, Egypt, and Sudan, armies are now openly involved in governing. As in the 1980s, the voice of the middle class remains fragmented as a result of divide-and-rule tactics—even though political Islam has taken a serious beating. Clientelism and cronyism have gotten upgraded, and autocrats are still trying to create new jobs without giving up political control—this now includes experiments in occupying the heights of the economy through new actors such as the military and friendly foreign investors from the GCC, China, and Turkey. These autocrats also seek to create jobs in small- to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which are politically voiceless. With growth stagnant, whether any of these innovations will work remains to be seen.\nThe future of political regimes thus seems to be on a knife-edge. How political and economic elites react to these more charged circumstances will depend on history, events on the ground, and what influential external actors do. Some regimes will resist opening up, fearing popular retribution, while others may try to selectively broaden their support base. All that we can say is that five years on, the region will be dominated by divergence. But only those who manage to improve trust among their citizens will be able to pave a road towards longer-term progress.\nTable 1.

Image in the Public Domain","The World Federation for Mental Health’s World Mental Health Day 2021 falls on October 10th and researchers are being encouraged to share what they know about mental health inequality and ideas about how to tackle this. Many research studies into the treatment and prevention of mental health conditions are taking place, such that ‘Mental and behavioural disorders’ is the most commonly applied condition category for research registered in the ISRCTN registry.\nThe theme of ‘Mental Health in an Unequal World’ aims to raise awareness of the inequality in access to mental health care, both locally and globally, for marginalised people, particularly for people living in poverty. According to UN 2016 data, “nearly 800,000 persons died every year by suicide, and 79 per cent of global suicides occurred in low- and middle-income countries”.\nThe United Nations has set ensuring healthy lives and promoting mental health and well-being for people as one of its sustainable development goals. The UN sustainable development target 3.4 is to reduce premature mortality from non-communicable diseases, such as mental health conditions, by one-third by 2030 through prevention and treatment and the promotion of mental health and well-being.\nOne such study that is investigating methods to tackle mental health inequality is the ongoing ReSHaPe trial. This study aims to develop an online program that will improve recognition, self-help, and help-seeking for depressive and anxiety symptoms among low-socioeconomic households in Malaysia. The intervention was designed in response to the National Health and Morbidity Survey in Malaysia which showed a high level of mental health issues among the low-income population compared to those with higher incomes.\nSimilarly, a National Mental Health Study in Colombia found high levels of mental distress and illness and poor access to treatment in Colombia’s children and adolescents, including high levels of post-traumatic stress symptoms, following a period of armed conflict. A research study has adapted the DIALOG+ mental health intervention for use in Colombian schools to improve the mental health, resilience, and quality of life of adolescents in post-conflict Colombia during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nPeople living in challenged humanitarian settings such as displaced people, refugees, and those living in conflict/post-conflict situations are at greater risk of mental health difficulties. For children in these settings, their caregivers act as their main protective factors.\nThe Strong Families program was developed specifically for use in low resource settings and was piloted in families living in Afghanistan. The results suggested that this program was effective and feasible in a resource-limited setting and improved child mental health, parenting practices, and family adjustment skills. The effectiveness and acceptability of the Strong Families intervention is now also being evaluated in families living in Iran.\nDue to ongoing political and social conflicts, the number of international refugees has been increasing. Refugees are exposed to severe mental challenges and potentially subject to traumatic experiences so the risk of psychiatric disorders is increased. The REMEX study is investigating the effects of an exercise and sport intervention among refugees living in a Greek refugee camp on mental health.\nOlder people and immigrant groups are both thought to be more likely to experience social isolation and loneliness which can cause worse mental wellbeing. A peer-based intervention using home visits and telephone calls from volunteers to provide emotional support, problem-solving support, and community resource sharing was developed to reduce the social isolation of older Chinese immigrants in Canada.\nThe results of this trial suggested a decrease in loneliness and an increase in resilience in the older people who received the intervention as well as fewer barriers to social participation, fewer depressive symptoms, increased life satisfaction, and happiness.\nSocietal discrimination is likely to have an impact on mental health. Interventions that take into account the specific mental health risks that marginalised communities face, and are designed to meet the needs of these groups, are therefore needed. The Rainbow Mind study uses one such intervention of mindfulness and compassion-based self-care which has been designed for the LGBTQIA+ community in the UK. Additionally, cultural background may play a role in a person’s beliefs about mental illness, their experience of mental illness, and the efficacy of treatment. Researchers are investigating approaches that address this, for example in the ECAT-D trial which aims to evaluate a culturally adapted faith-based treatment approach for Muslim clients with depression in Bradford.\nSimilarly, there are significant mental health related inequalities for the UK Black community as people from Black African and Caribbean backgrounds are four times more likely to be detained under the Mental Health Act, and experience poorer treatment and recovery outcomes in comparison to other ethnic groups. The ON TRAC project aims to address this by developing a mental health awareness and stigma reduction intervention for Black faith communities.\nAccess to mental health care and support is as crucial as ever during the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the effects of inequality on health outcomes and has brought additional mental health challenges through infection and illness, bereavement, job loss and insecurity, and social isolation due to physical distancing measures. The COVID-19 pandemic has also led to an increase in using remote methods to deliver care which could allow patients greater access to information and additional support between appointments, but in some resource-limited settings may not be accessible to participants.\nA collection of research compiled by Springer Nature to commemorate World Mental Health Day 2021 can be found on our landing page.

{"question":"Which has a higher maximum rotational speed: a dental drill used in modern dentistry or the turntable guide system found in typical microwave ovens? Could you elaborate on what can cause rotation issues in each?","answer":"Modern dental drills have a dramatically higher maximum rotational speed, capable of reaching up to 500,000 RPM (8 kHz). In contrast, microwave turntables rotate much more slowly and can experience rotation issues due to two main factors: the turntable slipping off its guide (especially when heavy items are placed on it) or the guide rollers becoming blocked by food debris and spills. When this happens with a microwave turntable, it's important to either reposition the turntable on the guide or clean the rollers to restore proper rotation.","context":["You do not currently have any recently viewed products\nMost microwave turntables are made of glass and can easily be removed from the microwave for cleaning. However, this also means that it is not uncommon for turntables to become damaged or broken.\nReplacing a broken microwave turntable is a very simple repair. Most turntables simply slot into position. Our quick finder is the easiest way to find the replacement turntable that's right for your microwave. Simply enter the brand of microwave you have and the model number.\nIf you don't know your model number it will usually be printed on the appliance in one of the following places; on the inside of the door, behind the door on the main unit or on the back of the microwave.\nOnce you have entered the above information a list of suitable turntables will be displayed along with specifications for each, including the diameter of the turntable.\nThe below steps will help you get your microwave looking as good as new\nIf you use your microwave regularly then the odd spill is inevitable. The microwave can be tricky to clean, especially if you have allowed the spill to cool and it has baked on the microwave walls. Fortunately there is an easy way to loosen microwave grime that makes cleaning a breeze.\nRemove the build up of splatter in your microwave the easy way:\nStep 1: Squeeze the juice of half a lemon into a microwavable dish.\nStep 2: Add roughly 300ml of water and microwave on full power for 5 - 10 minutes until the steam condenses on the microwave walls.\nStep 3: Step 3: Simply, wipe clean using a dry cloth.\nAlternatively there are a wide range of microwave cleaning products available.\nIf the turntable in your microwave oven has stopped rotating then it could be due to a number of things.\nHere are a few things to check:\n1. Ensure the turntable is resting on the guide correctly. If you have placed something heavy on top of the turntable it can cause it to slip off the guide. This is a very simple problem to correct, simply lift up the turntable and reposition on the guide.\n2. Check that the rollers for the guide have not become blocked. Occasionally bits of food or spills within the microwave can become jammed in the guide rollers which stop them from turning. If this is the case, you simply need to clean the rollers.\nMicrowave turntables are important as the design of microwave ovens means they do not cook uniformly. To understand why the turntable is needed, first you need to know how microwaves work.\nDuring the cooking process microwaves bounce of the inside walls to set up complex wave patterns. Microwaves have peaks and troughs, much like any wave, and the intensity is greatest at these points. Food near the peaks and troughs get most of the microwaves energy while the parts of food in between get very little - leading to uneven cooking.\nThe turntable helps to combat this problem by rotating the food to ensure that it comes into contact with different points of the wave. For this reason, the turntable is an essential component of safe microwave cooking and if it breaks or stops turning it is important you get it repaired or replaced before continuing to use the microwave.","Revolutions per minute\nRevolutions per minute (abbreviated rpm, RPM, r/min, or r·min−1) is a unit of frequency: the number of full rotations completed in one minute around a fixed axis. It is most commonly used as a measure of rotational speed or angular velocity of some mechanical component.\nStandards organizations generally recommend the symbol r/min, which is more consistent with the general use of unit symbols. This is not enforced as an international standard; in French, for example, tr/mn (tours par minute) is commonly used.\n- 3600 r/min = 60 revolutions per second = 60 Hz\nIn the SI one often uses the unit for angular velocity which is radians per second (rad·s−1):\n- 1 r/min = 2π rad·min−1 = 2π/60 rad·s−1 ≈ 0.10471976 rad·s−1\nTo convert revolutions per minute to revolutions per second (hertz), simply divide by 60.\n- On some kinds of disc or tape-like recording media, the rotational speed of the medium under the read head is a standard given in r/min. Gramophone (phonograph) records, for example, typically rotate steadily at 16, 33⅓, 45 or 78 r/min (⁴⁄₁₅, ⁵⁄₉, ³⁄₄, or 1.3 Hz).\n- Modern dental drills can rotate at up to 500,000 r/min (8 kHz).\n- The second hand of a conventional analogue clock rotates at 1 r/min.\n- Audio CD players read their discs at a constant 150 kB/s and thus must vary the disc's rotational speed from around 500 r/min (actually 8 Hz), when reading at the innermost edge, to 200 r/min (actually 3.5 Hz) at the outer edge. CD-ROM drives’ maximum rotational speeds are rated in multiples of this figure, even though they do not hold to constant read speeds when reading from most disc formats.\n- DVD players also usually read discs at a constant linear rate. The disc's rotational speed varies from 1530 r/min (actually 25.5 Hz), when reading at the innermost edge, and 630 r/min (actually 10.5 Hz) at the outer edge. DVD drives’ speeds are are usually given in multiples of this figure.\n- A washing machine's drum may rotate at 500 to 2000 r/min (8–33 Hz) during the spin cycles.\n- An automobile's engine typically varies between 700 and 7000 r/min (12–120 Hz) though some cars’ engines can spin as quickly as 11,000 r/min (180 Hz).\n- A piston aircraft engine typically rotates at a rate between 2000 and 3000 r/min (30–50 Hz).\n- Computers’ hard drives typically rotate at 5400 or 7200 r/min (90 or 120 Hz)—most commonly with ATA or SATA interfaces—and some high-performance drives rotate at 10,000 or 15,000 r/min (160 or 250 Hz)—usually with SATA, SCSI or Fibre Channel interfaces.\n- The engine of a Formula One racing car can reach 19,000 r/min (320 Hz) under some circumstances.\n- A Zippe-type centrifuge for enriching uranium spins at 90,000 r/min (1,500 Hz) or faster.\n- Gas turbine engines rotate at tens of thousands of r/min. JetCat model aircraft turbines are capable of over 100,000 r/min (1,700 Hz) with the fastest reaching 165,000 r/min (2,750 Hz).\n- An electromechanical battery (EMB) works at 60,000–200,000 r/min (1–3 kHz) range using a passively magnetic levitated flywheel in vacuum. The choice of the flywheel material is not the most dense, but the one that pulverises the most safely, at surface speeds about 7 times the speed of sound.\n- A turbocharger can reach 290,000 r/min (4,800 Hz), while 80,000–200,000 r/min (1–3 kHz) is common.\n- Orders of magnitude (angular velocity)\n- Constant linear velocity, or CLV, used when referring to the speed of audio CDs\n- Constant angular velocity, or CAV, used when referring to the speed of gramophone (phonograph) records\n- Turn (geometry)\n- Physical parameters of DVD.

{"question":"What color variations exist naturally in killifish versus blood parrot cichlids?","answer":"Killifish display natural color variations, such as the Aphyosemion australe which comes in a dark form with white-edged fins and a natural lyre-shaped tail, and Fundulopanchax nigerianum which has metallic blue body with red to carmine markings. Blood parrot cichlids naturally come in orange, yellow, or red colors, with gray being rare. Any other colors in blood parrots like purple, green, or blue are artificial dyes that can negatively affect their health and lifespan.","context":["Killifish are a diverse group of small fish with a worldwide distribution being found on all continents except Australia and Antarctica. There are both egglaying and livebearing killifish, but we will only concern ourselves with the egglaying types. One of the interesting aspects of killifish biology is the ability of some species of killifish to lay resting eggs that are resistant to desication. This has opened up several habitats that only these interesting fish can live in and has led to these species being called annual killifish. The common mode of reproduction is the laying of eggs that normally hatch in about a week or so that need to be water incubated. There are several types who’s eggs can be either water or dry incubated.\nHere I will cover both modes of reproduction and list several killifish of each mode that are both colorful and easy to keep and breed. We will begin with what are commonly called the plant spawners. The peat spawners require a little more effort and some patience when dealing with their eggs as a few weeks are required for their developement. I will also mention two of my favorite switch spawners that I have both water and peat incubated.\nThe basic plant spawning setup can be of several ways. Probably one of the easiest is a bare tank with a small corner or sponge filter and a place for the females to spawn. Water type would depend upon the species as some killifish such as the Aphyosemion of west Africa take soft slighty acid water whereas Aphanius from the Middle East live in akaline and sometimes salt water. Size of the aquaria for most plant spawning killifish can be small, from two to ten gallons. A permanent setup can be used with lots of live plants such as water sprite or hornwort. Size of these aquaria can and should be larger than a setup for a single pair although I have had some species live with their fry in a 2 gallon tank. My favorite size permanent setup is a 30 gallon, but a ten works fine for many Aphyosemion species. Most killifish breeders use an artificail spawning medium for their plant spawners. I use an acrylic type yarn that I turn into mops. This is accomplished by winding a green or other natural shade of yarn around a book, tying off one side and cutting the other, and there you have a new place for the fish to spawn. Boil the mops several times and rinse well to remove any oils or dyes from the yarn. The fish will use the mops to spawn in and the eggs can be collected daily. Place them in a small covered container and you can watch the embryos develope. Fry are born predators and many can eat newly hatched brine shrimp at hatching. Growth of fry in many cases is quite rapid and many can be sexed at 6 months. Regular water changes aid in rapid growth of the fry as well. Temperatures most killies can be kept at are 68-72 F.\nKillies I recommend for the new killifish keeper wanting to keep plant spawners are both handsome and easy to keep.\nAplocheilus lineatus is a handsome plant spawner from India. These fish grow to 10 cm and males can be aggressive. Males have green to blue irredescent scales and markings in the fins. Fins are yellow with red. They are prolific spawners laying large eggs. Eggs are easy to collect by gently lifting them with the finger tips. Place them in water from the parents tank. They reqire about a week to ten days to hatch. Fry are large at hatching and if well fed grow fast. The adults should be well fed with a variety of live and frozen foods. And these fish are jumpers, so a tank cover is essential. Due to their larger size and aggressive nature I recommend a ten gallon aquarium or larger. These killies can stand a range of pH from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nAphyosemion australe is a very colorful killifish that comes from the coast of west Africa especially Cameroon. It does very well in a five gallon tank. The males come in a natural dark form with the fins being edged in white, The males tail has a distinct lyre shape giving this killie one of it’s common names, the lyretail panchax. There is also an aquarium variety called the gold lyretail which lacks the dark pigment and is more orange than it’s normal wild types. These fish require a soft slightly acid water as they come from the rain forest of equitorial Africa. Eggs and corresponding fry are smaller than Apl. lineatus, and they require a smaller starter food such as newly hatched brine shrimp nauplii. Fry growth is good and males start showing their colors early. Feed the adults a wide variety of live and frozen foods. They are especially fond of mosquito larvae. These killies do well in a five gallon aquarium set up as described above. Lyretails also do well in a planted permanent setup.\nFundulopanchax nigerianum is a beautiful killifish that comes from Nigeria and west Cameroon. These beautiful killifish grow to 7.5 cm and males can be stunning. Basic color is a metallic blue in the body and fins with many red to carmine markings. Fins are very distinct with a red submargin band and yellow to orange marginally. There are many locations available to the hobbiest. These killies are prolific spawners that also use a mop. They like the mop to be lying on the bottom. Eggs can be collected with the finger method and they can be stored either in water or in damp peat. Developement time is about the same, three to four weeks. Eggs in peat are rewet in a shallow container with about 3 cm of aged water. Fry growth is rapid and males start showing themselves several weeks old. Use newly hatched brine shrimp as a first food. These fish can be very aggressive, so hiding places are needed for the females. I like larger size aquaria for these fish, from ten to thirty gallon. Water should be soft with a neutral to slightly acid pH. These fish need a variety of live a frozen foods to be tip top in color and egg production. Water changes also stimulate spawning, especially fresh rainwater.","Blood parrot cichlids are famous with aquarists due to their vivid color and distinct look but there is also controversy regarding how they are produced. In this blood parrot cichlid care guide we’ll be discussing all you need to know about them.\nLet’s find out if the blood parrot cichlid is the right breed for you.\nBlood Parrot Cichlid Species Overview\n|Scientific name:||Amphilophus citrinellus x Heros severus, Amphilophus citrinellus x Paraneetroplus synspilus|\n|Common names:||Parrot Cichlid, Blood parrot cichlid, Blood-red parrot cichlid|\n|Color:||Bright orange, yellow, red (gray is rare)|\n|Minimum tank size:||30 Gallons or More|\n|Place in the tank:||Middle|\n|Life expectancy||10 to 15 years|\nBlood parrot cichlids are a hybrid species that are thought to be created by mating a pair of midas cichlids (Amphilophus citrinellus) and redhead cichlids (Paraneetroplus synspilus) or a pair of midas cichlids and banded cichlids. These cichlid parents are freshwater fish that can be found on freshwater basins and rivers.\nThere is controversy regarding the creation of these hybrid fish. Because of the physical deformities that are caused by breeding them. These defects cause blood red parrot cichlids to have small mouths and or the inability to fully close their mouths, causing them to have difficulties with feeding which affects their ability to thrive.\nBlood parrots can be hard to find at local pet stores but you can try and find them at online stores. Blood cichlids can cost 10$ up to 60$ depending on the size and quality.\nWhat do blood parrot cichlids look like?\nBlood parrot cichlids have a beautiful orange colored body with wide translucent fins. They also have big eyes and small mouths. They are easily recognizable due to their bright orange color and distinct beak shaped mouth which is where their names come from.\nWhy do blood cichlids have open mouths?\nA blood cichlid’s open mouth can be considered as a deformity caused by the breeding process. This deformity can make it hard for them to eat which can pose a danger to their health.\nIf you get a blood cichlid with this condition, you should check if it could eat properly during feeding. It might require food that is smaller in size due its inability to keep its food in its mouth.\nHow big do blood parrot cichlids get?\nBlood parrot cichlids can reach lengths of 6 to 7 inches for females and 7 to 8 inches for male blood parrot cichlids. But there are instances where it can grow up to 10 inches.\nThe most common color of blood parrot cichlids are orange but there are other colors such as red, yellow, or even gray which is rare. There are some instances where breeders dye blood parrots to give them other colors such as purple, green or blue.\nThese are called “Jellybean parrots”. I recommend avoiding these artificially dyed cichlids as the color modification process has a negative effect on their health and lifespan. Another thing is these “jellybean parrots” might not be blood parrots but another type of cichlid.\nHere’s an example of how fish are artificially colored.\nWhy is my blood parrot cichlid turning black?\nBlood parrots can turn black due to several reasons such as aging, disease, parasite, stress, or injury. If you notice this happening, try to monitor your fish for signs of distress or disease. You might need to administer treatment if it turns out that they are sick.\nAre blood parrot cichlids aggressive fish?\nBlood red parrot cichlids are typically calm and peaceful fish, unlike the flowerhorn cichlid. They can be great community fish if provided with enough space and the right tank mates.\nOn the other hand, improper tank conditions and aggressive tank mates can cause them to get stressed. The stress can cause them to become sick or heighten their aggression, so make sure to provide them with the proper tank conditions.\nHow many blood parrot cichlids should you keep together?\nBlood parrots do very well in groups, depending on your tank size. Keeping them in pairs might make them susceptible to fighting if they are not mates. I suggest getting three or more blood parrots if you can provide their needs.\nOne blood parrot cichlid needs at least 30 gallons. If you’re planning to have two blood parrot cichlids or more, you should add at least 10 gallons for each extra blood parrot.\nCan blood parrots cichlids live alone?\nBlood red parrot cichlids can thrive alone, but if you have the resources for a bigger fish tank, you should consider getting them tankmates.\nWhat fish can live with blood parrot cichlids?\nThe ideal tankmates for blood red parrot cichlids are other blood parrot cichlids or peaceful cichlids that are the same size as them. But other species like angelfish, rainbow fish, clown loaches, corydoras catfish can work as well. Make sure to pick proper tankmates for you to have a peaceful community tank.\nWhy is my blood parrot fish digging?\nBlood parrots are known to dig around substrate. A reason why they do this is because they are building or preparing a nest. Another reason they do this is just because they enjoy it. So if you see this behavior, you don’t have to worry. It is a normal thing for blood red parrot cichlids to dig.\nCompatible tank mates\nThe main qualities you should consider when choosing potential blood red parrot tank mates are aggressiveness, size, and compatibility with water conditions.\nBlood red parrot cichlids should not be placed with other aggressive fish. Also avoid fish that are too small as they have the tendency to eat them.\nHere’s a list of compatible tankmates...\n1. Firemouth Cichlid\nFiremouths are known for the orange coloring at the bottom of their mouths. Aside from cool appearance, they are peaceful cichlids that can get along well with blood parrots. They also possess small mouths which prevent them from too much fighting or lip locking.\nSimilar to other cichlids, they are a relatively peaceful species. As long as they are given enough space, they won’t be overly aggressive. But being a tropical cichlid, you must provide them with the appropriate water temperature ranging from 75°F to 86°F which is in range of what the blood parrots can tolerate. If you’re interested in angelfish care, we have guides on how to breed angelfish and choosing tankmates for angelfish.\nThese bottom dwellers are good companions to blood parrots. They typically avoid interactions with other fish and spend their time at the bottom of the tank. Before introducing them to the tank, you need to ensure that the corydora is already big enough for it not to be considered as prey by the blood cichlid.\nEven though they don’t grow too big in size, they are protected from possible attacks due to their spikes. But you should still provide them with hiding spaces like rocks, tunnels, or caves that will help them avoid being attacked.\n4. Ram Cichlids\nRam cichlids are generally more peaceful when compared to other cichlids. They like being housed with the other ram cichlids but they can also tolerate other species well. Like the corydora catfish they tend to stay at the bottom of the tank, providing them with hiding spaces will help avoid uncomfortable interactions.\nKribensis are peaceful cichlids that thrive in large groups. They prefer to avoid conflict and they are very adaptable to water conditions. But they can become aggressive when breeding or when raising their young. You must have a large community tank if you want to keep them with blood red parrot cichlids.\n|Tank Size||30 gallons minimum|\n|Water Temperature||76°F to 80°F|\n|Water pH||6.5 pH to 7.4 pH|\n|Water hardness:||3.3 to 6.6 dGH|\n|Tank setup:||Spacious tank, Soft substrate, Hiding Spaces|\n|Substrate||Fine sand or Fine Gravel that is safe to dig in.|\n|Filter:||Yes, because these fish produce a lot of waste|\n|Lighting:||Soft standard lighting|\nWhat do blood parrot fish like in their tank?\nThe blood red parrot cichlids don’t have a natural habitat since they are a cross breed between two species. But we can base their preferred environment from their parent breed.\nThe natural habitat of their parent breed are freshwater basins and rivers. So having a planted tank with the right water conditions and plenty of space would be ideal for them.\nBlood red parrot cichlids should be provided with plenty of space, at least 30 gallons for each blood parrot is necessary.\nDo blood parrot cichlids need a filter?\nBlood parrots fish definitely require a filter in their tank to maintain the water quality. They are considerable in terms of size and are voracious eaters which means that they produce a lot of waste. They are also usually kept in medium to large tanks which is why a canister filter that is powerful enough for your tank size is recommended.\nDo blood parrot cichlids need a heater?\nYes, blood red parrot cichlids need a heater. They require water temperatures of 76°F to 80°F.\nPlants for blood parrot cichlids\nWhen choosing plants for your blood red parrot cichlid tank, you should keep in mind that they like to dig around. You should make sure that you can anchor or root your plant to something stable.\nFor options, you can try java ferns, hornworts, duckweed, anubias, or duckweeds. Here’s a floating aquarium plants guide that might help.\nBlood parrots have a habit of digging. A suitable substrate for them is a soft substrate that won’t injure them when they dig.\nBlood red parrot cichlids don’t really have specific lighting requirements. You can choose lighting that best accentuates their color and the tank.\nWhat to feed a blood parrot cichlid?\nWhat should you feed blood parrots? Being an omnivore, it’s okay to provide them with both vegetables and meat. When feeding them with pellets, try to use sinking pellets as they can’t eat from the water surface.\nBlood Parrot Cichlid Mouth\nAnother thing to consider when feeding is their mouth size. Aside from not being able to eat food from the water surface, blood parrots cichlids also have very small mouths that makes it difficult for them to eat regular size pellets or fish food. To address these issues, you should use mini sinking pellets or food that are specific to blood parrots.\nHow much to feed a blood parrot cichlid?\nA blood red parrot cichlid should be fed two to three times a day. Feed them what they can eat for two minutes.\nIf you want to maintain their color or make them more vibrant, feeding them food that is rich in carotenoids can help.\nCommon diseases of blood parrot cichlid?\nFreshwater ich or ick is a common disease that affects freshwater fish. It is caused by a protozoan parasite called Ichthyophthirius multifiliis. The most common symptom is the appearance of white spots that are spread out through your fish’s body.\nAnother symptom is them trying to scratch their body by rubbing themselves to the tank or other objects in the tank.\nFreshwater ich can be treated by using ich medication and utilizing the tank temperature. This freshwater ich treatment guide can help you if you need more specific instructions.\nSwim Bladder Disease\nThe Blood red parrot fish can develop swim bladder disease. The swim bladder is an organ which allows you to control buoyancy and swim. Common signs of swim bladder disease are being unable to swim properly, floating to the top of the tank, sinking to the bottom, or just staying at one side of the tank.\nThis disease is commonly caused by constipation. You can try feeding them green peas to cure their constipation. Make sure to remove the shell of the peas before feeding them to the fish.\nBacterial infections can be caused by injuries or wounds getting infected. These injuries typically come from course substrates, sharp rocks, decorations, or fighting with other fish. This can be prevented by keeping not aggressive fish in the community tank and by keeping water quality optimal.\nIf it occurs you might notice physical symptoms such as change of color, wounds, and swelling. They can also exhibit a change of behavior like being lethargic and having no appetite. This condition can be treated by using anti-bacterial medication for fish. Make sure to follow the instructions provided with the medicine properly.\nHow long do blood parrot cichlids live?\nBlood red parrot fish can live up to 10 to 15 years. They are popular due to their longevity and resilience.\nMake sure to pick blood parrot fish that are orange, don’t pick blood parrot cichlids with odd colors like purple, pink, and green. Artificially dyed blood red parrot cichlids tend to have shorter lifespans.\nCan you breed a blood parrot cichlid?\nBlood parrot cichlids cannot breed or reproduce because they are sterile. This is the result of being a cross breed of two different cichlid species. Most hybrid animals are infertile due to not having viable sex cells.\nAlthough blood parrots are mostly sterile, these hybrid fish species still occasionally mate and spawn. Females occasionally lay eggs but the males can’t fertilize them. There are cases of female blood parrot cichlids successfully breeding with another cichlid species.\nHow to breed a blood parrot cichlid?\nBreeding blood parrot cichlids can be difficult. But if you want to breed these hybrid fish. You can try getting a pair of their parent breed or breeding a female blood parrot cichlid with another cichlid species.\nIs the blood red parrot cichlid for you?\nBlood red parrot cichlids are unique, beautiful, and peaceful fish that can be great alone or in a community setting. They are also known for their resilience and long lifespans.\nIf you can meet the tank requirements and take care of their feeding needs, this can be a good fish for you.\nThanks for reading! I hope that this blood red parrot cichlid care was helpful.

{"question":"What are the key differences between assessing mental capacity for safeguarding concerns versus determining best interests in medical decisions?","answer":"For mental capacity assessment in safeguarding concerns, the focus is on a 4-part test where the person must: understand relevant information, retain it, weigh it up, and communicate their decision. For best interests in medical decisions, the assessment involves a broader checklist including: having the person participate as much as possible, identifying relevant circumstances, considering their past/present views and beliefs, consulting others like carers and relatives, and choosing the least restrictive option. While capacity assessment is specific to a particular decision at a specific time, best interests determination requires weighing multiple factors and consulting various stakeholders.","context":["Making an adult social care referral as a professional\nSafeguarding concerns should be reported in line with our decision-making framework.

{"question":"What is the anatomical structure of the placenta's fetal surface?","answer":"The fetal surface (chorionic plate) of the placenta is covered by the amnion, which gives it a shiny appearance and secretes amniotic fluid. Beneath the amnion lies the chorion, containing chorionic vessels that connect to the umbilical cord. The umbilical cord inserts slightly off-center into the chorionic plate and contains one umbilical vein carrying nutrients and oxygen to the fetus, and two umbilical arteries carrying waste products back to the placenta.","context":["The placenta is a temporary organ of pregnancy situated in the uterus. It is formed from fetal and maternal components. The fetal portion is formed by the chorion frondosum, while the maternal portion is formed by the decidua basalis. Moreover, the placenta is the meeting point of two circulatory systems: fetal circulation and maternal circulation.\nThe main function of the placenta is the interchange between the mother and the fetus. More specifically, it provides nutrition and oxygen to the fetus and removes waste material and carbon dioxide.\nIn this article, we will explore the anatomy and function of the placenta.\n|Definition||Circular, discoid-shaped organ that develops in the uterus during pregnancy and allows metabolic exchange between mother and fetus|\nFetal portion: chorion frondosum\nMaternal portion: basal decidua\nFetal surface (chorionic plate) with umbilical cord\nMaternal surface (basal plate)\nFetal respiration, nutrition and excretion\nFetal protection and immunity\nEndocrine (hormone production)\n- Gross anatomy\n- Clinical notes\nThe placenta is a discoid-shaped organ weighing about 450-500g at full term. The placental thickness is usually proportional to the gestational age. The placenta is normally located along the anterior or posterior wall of the uterus and may expand to the lateral wall with the course of the pregnancy.\nThe placenta is composed of two different surfaces, the fetal surface (or chorionic plate) and the maternal surface (or basal plate).\nFetal surface of the placenta\nThe fetal surface of the placenta (or chorionic plate) is covered by the amnion, or amniotic membrane, which gives this surface a shiny appearance. The amniotic membrane secretes amniotic fluid which serves as a protection and cushion for the fetus, while also facilitating exchanges between the mother and fetus.\nUnderlying the amnion is the chorion, a thicker membrane continuous with the lining of the uterine wall. The chorion contains the chorionic vessels which are continuous with the vessels of the umbilical cord. Originally, early in the development of the placenta, the entire chorionic plate is covered with chorionic villi. The villi located adjacent to the decidua capsularis (portion of the decidua that overlies the embryo) degenerate to produce the smooth (nonvillous) chorion laeve. The villi adjacent to the decidua basalis persist, increase in size and produce the chorion frondosum or fetal portion of the placenta. The chorionic villi of the fully developed placenta contain a network of fetal capillaries, allowing a maximal contact area with the maternal blood. The exchanges between the fetal and maternal circulation occurs in the intervillous space.\nThe umbilical cord, which is the connection between the placenta and the fetus, inserts in a slightly eccentric position into the chorionic plate. The umbilical cord contains one vein (the umbilical vein) that carries nutrients and oxygen from the placenta to the fetus and two arteries (the umbilical arteries) that carry waste products from the fetus back to the placenta.\nMaternal surface of the placenta\nThe maternal surface of the placenta, or basal plate, is an artificial surface, which emerges from the separation of the placenta from the uterine wall during delivery. This surface is composed of the decidua, the modified or specialized endometrium (or mucosal lining of the uterus) that forms in preparation for pregnancy. The decidua has several parts:\n- Decidua basalis - forms the portion of placenta;\n- Decidua capsularis - overlies the embryo;\n- Parietal decidua - the rest of the decidual tissue.\nAlso visible on the maternal surface of the placenta are slightly elevated regions called lobes or cotyledons (approximately 10 to 40), which are separated by grooves or sulci. Inside the placenta, the grooves correspond to the placental septa. Each lobe visible on the maternal surface corresponds to the position of the vilous trees arising from the chorionic plate.\nThe placenta is a highly-specialized organ that plays an essential role during pregnancy. It is responsible for providing nutrition and oxygen to the fetus as well as removing waste material and carbon dioxide. It is also responsible for creating a separation between the maternal and fetal circulation (known as placental barrier). Besides that, the placenta protects the fetus from infections and other maternal disorders, while also helping in the development of the fetal immune system. Additionally, this organ has an endocrine function as it secretes hormones (such as human chorionic gonadotropin) that affect the pregnancy, metabolism, fetal growth, and parturition.\nVariant morphologies of the placenta are frequently encountered, such as is the case of a bilobed placenta where this organ is separated into two near equal-sized lobes. The estimated incidence of this specific variation is at up to ~4% of pregnancies. It can be associated with some complications such as first-trimester bleeding.\nBesides the developmental abnormalities referred above, the placenta may also be affected by a number of medical conditions. An example of these disorders is a condition known as placenta previa, which is the implantation of the placenta over the cervical os. This condition usually presents as painless vaginal bleeding in the third trimester. In these cases, mother and fetus need careful monitoring and delivery is often by cesarean section.\nPlacenta: want to learn more about it?\nOur engaging videos, interactive quizzes, in-depth articles and HD atlas are here to get you top results faster.\nWhat do you prefer to learn with?\n“I would honestly say that Kenhub cut my study time in half.”\nKim Bengochea, Regis University, Denver"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:def3b259-6010-4def-88dd-baec5bb17b63>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Hey folks! I'm setting up a research site looking at wood ash treatment on forest soils, but I'm worried about safety. How can wood ash improve forest health, and what safety precautions should I take when handling treated wood materials?","answer":"Wood ash application can improve the nutrient status of trees and increase their drought resistance to adapt to Climate Change. Specifically, experimental treatments using 4.5 Mg/ha or 1.5 Mg/ha of wood ash, sometimes combined with ammonium nitrate, can be applied to improve tree vitality. As for safety precautions when handling treated materials, you should wear long-sleeved shirts, long pants, and chemical-impervious gloves. Additionally, when sawing wood, work outdoors, wear a dust mask and goggles, and wash exposed areas thoroughly after handling, especially before eating or drinking. Work clothes should be laundered separately from other clothing.","context":["Site code DS20\nRegion Basque Country\nLocal name Huerto semillero\nOrientation: NW, Slope:20.0°, Soil :CAMBISOLS, Bedrock : clayey sandstone\nShort History of the site\nThe sylvicultural option to be demonstrated is the application of wood ash to forest soils to improve the nutrient status of trees and increase tree drought resistance in order to adapt to Climate Change. A randomized complete block design was used to establish the experiment (3 blocks and 3 replicates per block) and the experimental treatments consist of 4.5 Mg/ha of wood ash, 1.5 Mg/ha of wood ash, 4.5 Mg/ha of wood ash + 200kg ammonium nitrate. Each plot covered 64 m2 with 4 trees inside. The demonstration site is in the radiata pine seed orchard established in 1996 owned by the municipality and managed by the forestry service of the Provincial Council of Bizkaia (BFA). The climate data comes from WORLDCLIM- Global Climate data for the reference period 1950-2000 except for the frost days figure that has been recorded from the closest point in the CRU_CL_2.0 gridded datasets. It has to be pointed out that WORLDCLIM underestimates precipitation for the region and that CRU overestimates the number of frost days. Monitoring planned for the future: TEMPERATURE, PRECIPITATION AND THROUGHFALL: A weather station is established in the demonstration site and several rain gauges under the canopy. SOIL WATER CONTENT: Soil moisture will continuously be monitored using soil moisture sensors. SOIL WATER HOLDING CAPACITY: Low and erratic rainfall could be a major constraint for forestry in any Climate Change scenario. Besides, big amount of this rainfall disappears as runoff. Addition of biochar to soils could improve the ability of the soil to absorb and store water and therefore avoid this surface runoff. One of the most important soil physical characteristics is the capacity to store the acquired moisture in the root zone and release it to plant roots, referred to as soil water holding capacity. TOXICITY: The potential of biochar to be a source of soil contamination needs to be evaluated, not only with concern to the biochar product itself, but also to soil type and environmental conditions. GROWTH: One of the best documented consequences of water stress is stomatal closure as a results of loss of turgor in leaf cells: this leads to reduction in photosynthesis and hence reduced growth. aggregate stability: The aggregate stability of a soil is the resistance of soil structure against mechanical or physicochemical destructive forces. Among the mechanical destructive forces is the raindrop splash that could gain importance as extreme events due to Climate Change would increase. Soil structure is one of the main factors controlling plant growth by its influence on root penetration, soil temperature and gas diffusion, water transport and seedling emergence and therefore it is an important soil characteristic for foresters. NUTRIENTS STATUS: Nutrients and their relative proportions to each others in trees are important for tree vitality. Trees subjected to nutrient imbalances continue to grow, but the plant must divert more resources in translocation of critical nutrients and may become more sensitive to environmental stress, for instance frost and drought. Environmental stress changes physiological and chemical conditions within the trees which predisposes the trees to lethal attacks by opportunistic pathogenic organisms.","With some common-sense precautions, it is safe to handle preserved wood products during your project.\nPreserved wood may contain materials which cause skin irritation. Avoid frequent or prolonged skin contact with preserved wood. When handling the wood, wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants and use gloves impervious to chemicals (for example, gloves that are vinyl coated).\nFollow good personal hygiene after handling preserved wood. Wash hands and any exposed areas thoroughly after handling preserved wood, especially before eating, drinking or using tobacco products.\nAvoid inhalation of sawdust from preserved wood products. When sawing the wood, wear a dust mask. Sawing operations should only be performed outdoors. When power-sawing, wear goggles to protect eyes from flying particles.\nIf preservative or sawdust from preserved wood accumulates on clothes, launder before reuse. Launder work clothes separately from other clothing.\nWhen the life of your preserved wood is done, either because it has become obsolete with new development or because it has fulfilled its life expectancy, it should be disposed of properly.\nTry to recycle preserved wood if possible. Parks, farms and residential landscaping often can utilize recycled preserved wood for projects that are exposed in the outdoors.\nPreserved wood should not be burned in open fires or in stoves, fireplaces or residential boilers because hazardous chemicals may be produced as part of the smoke and ashes. Preserved wood from commercial or industrial use (i.e. construction sites) may be burned only in commercial or industrial incinerators or boilers in accordance with state and federal regulations.\nPreserved wood can be used in an industrial biofuel burner, if it is a permitted facility that can meet state and federal air quality standards. It is considered biomass in several states and may be eligible for renewable energy credits.\nAs a last resort, send it to a landfill. Preserved wood is not considered hazardous waste and can be disposed of normally into an approved landfill.\nSpecific regulations in disposing preserved wood are detailed in the publication Management of Used Treated Wood Products in the Western U.S.\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom signed Assembly Bill 332 into law on Aug. 31 after it was approved unanimously by the California Legislature. The bill had an urgency clause, permitting it to go into effect immediately. AB 332 statutorily incorporates the former Alternative Management Standards (AMS) for Treated Wood Waste, which allowed preservative treated wood waste to be disposed in the composite lined portion of an approved solid waste landfill.\nThe AMS had been in effect for nearly 15 years before the program expired on Jan. 1, 2021, creating significant difficulties for everyone needing to dispose of preserved wood. As a result, for the first three months of 2021, the disposal of treated wood was only authorized at a hazardous waste landfill. In March, the California Dept. of Toxic Substance Control (DTSC) created a variance program where those disposing of treated wood could purchase variances allowing disposal in approved composite-lined landfills per the provisions of the AMS.\nWith the adoption of AB 332, all treated wood waste variances become inoperative and are no longer in effect.

{"question":"What are the environmental impacts of transportation infrastructure development, and how can green building methods help mitigate these effects?","answer":"Transportation infrastructure development poses significant threats to biodiversity through ecosystem fragmentation, which is one of the biggest threats to biodiversity. While transportation networks are necessary for economic and societal needs, they can severely impact natural ecosystems. However, green building methods can help mitigate these impacts by promoting environmentally sound and resource-efficient approaches. These methods can reduce CO2 emissions (buildings currently account for 30% of global emissions), achieve 20-30% energy savings, and 30-50% water savings. Additionally, green infrastructure can be integrated to create ecological corridors, improve landscape permeability, and enhance ecosystem resilience while providing multiple ecosystem services like clean air and water.","context":["The development and expansion of transportation infrastructure networks (i.e. roads, rails, waterways) constitutes a fundamental prerequisite for the economic growth of local/ regional and national communities ensuring the movement of people and goods.\nStill the benefits that such networks offer to modern societies are often coupled with possible impacts upon ecosystems and their services.\nTherefore, while the growing transportation infrastructure is necessary for economies, markets and societal structures at a regional, national and international scales, there are two “opposite” trends: the increased demand for linear transportation infrastructure and the loss of biological diversity and thus the alteration of the ecosystems and their services. One of the most significant impact of infrastructure is fragmentation.\nNowadays it is widely accepted that fragmentation of natural environment is one of the biggest threat to biodiversity. Therefore fragmentation has to be avoided and ecological connectivity has to be ensured.\nIn Europe, different patterns of fragmentation are observed, depending on a variety of factors as population density and dynamics, landscape structure, land use, economic development and the level of the acceptance of the impacts of fragmentation.\nFollowing an increasing economic development trend in the South East European countries, over the last years many new large scale linear transportation infrastructure projects are in planning and construction process.\nAs many such infrastructure works are supported by the means and fund of the EU, target the interest of EU citizens and aim to raise sustainable and smart growth, it is extremely critical to ensure that the minimum possible impacts and ecological connectivity could be achieved.\nThe aim of our cooperation is to secure ecological connectivity while developing linear transportation infrastructures. Our cooperation will focus on ensuring continuity of green infrastructures and the creation of optimum conditions for the development of and coexistence with the so-called grey infrastructures, such as transportation infrastructures, in the wider framework of the sustainable use of the natural capital.\nThe harmonization of “grey”/linear transportation infrastructure and “green”/natural infrastructure in a developing world is of tremendous importance if we want to preserve the earth’s living environment for future generations and implement United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals.\nTowards the achievement of this co-existence, there are means to find measures for mitigating the impacts of transportation infrastructures on nature, reduce its pressure and decouple its adverse effects from the still growing demand for new infrastructure. Such measures can and should be implemented as well accepted standards in infrastructure development and maintenance toward to a safe, efficient and sustainable transportation system as a key to the modern way of life globally.\nIt therefore becomes obvious that there is a need for international collaboration in state-of-the-art research and best practice, for enhanced exchange of knowledge and good practices between disciplines, and for the development of harmonized standards and procedures on international, national, and regional level that can be referred to by stakeholders.\nTHE GREENWEB STATEMENT 1\nOn Harmonization of Green with Grey Infrastructure in South Eastern Europe\nThe GreenWeb is an open interdisciplinary Platform of experts and organizations of various fields focusing to cooperate and work on ecology and transportation in SE Europe.\nThe aim of the GreenWeb Platform is to secure ecological connectivity ensuring the coherence and ecological functionality of areas of high biodiversity value while developing linear transportation infrastructures at national and international levels in SE Europe.\nGreen and Grey demands: Two opposite trends\nWhile growing transportation networks, included in Grey Infrastructure, are necessary to meet economical and societal needs, Green Infrastructure is considered as fundamental natural capital providing important ecosystem services for human wellbeing and biodiversity.\nThese demands can be contradicted when the development of Grey Infrastructure intersects Green Infrastructure, increasing the level of fragmentation of natural ecosystems.\nFragmentation is one of the biggest threats to biodiversity, therefore to ensure ecological connectivity, it is important to understand the value of significant natural zones and ecological corridors as functional Green Infrastructure, when planning, building and operationalizing linear transportation infrastructure.\nOngoing economic development in the South-Eastern European countries, especially the growth of linear transportation infrastructure, generates additional pressure on nature and demands urgent actions to ensure that minimum possible negative impacts on the environment are achieved.\nFor Grey and Green infrastructures coexistence, proactive engagement and dialogue with all stakeholders is required in order to find the best solutions to meet the objectives of EU policies for economic development, biodiversity conservation and the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals.\nBy encouraging international collaboration in policy, research and practice, we will enhance the exchange of knowledge and develop harmonized standards and procedures for all actors involved.\nTHE MESSAGE TO BE SPREAD\nThe harmonization of “Grey” and “Green” Infrastructure in a dynamic world such as South-East Europe is of tremendous importance towards conserving the earth’s living environment for future generations and for achieving the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals.\n- Infrastructure planning / part of landscape planning\n- Biodiversity studies; Environmental assessment & measures/conditions\n- Technical / constructive solutions\n- Landscape management\n- Capacity building\n- Funding opportunities\nThe GreenWeb Platform was initiated by a group of Romanian and Greek organizations, with the support of IENE.\nAsociatia Zarand / Zarand Association (AZ).

Currently, 30% of global CO2 emissions and 40% of global resource consumption is a result of constructing buildings.\nOur main goal is to optimise the environmental performance of a building using a life cycle approach, in which the materials and products used in a building are compared and evaluated for best performance at the building level (life cycle assessment).\nOur expertise spans all phases of a project from conceptual design through construction to project hand-over; in addition to continuous operation and maintenance.\nThe built environment has a vast impact on the natural environment, human health, and the economy. By adopting green building strategies, we can maximize both economic and environmental performance. Green construction methods can be integrated into buildings at any stage, from design and construction, to renovation and deconstruction. However, the most significant benefits can be obtained if the design and construction team takes an integrated approach from the earliest stages of a building project.\nGreen infrastructure can be broadly defined as a strategically planned network of high quality natural and semi-natural areas with other environmental features, which is designed and managed to deliver a wide range of ecosystem services and protect biodiversity in both rural and urban settings.\nGreen infrastructure is effective, economical, and enhances community safety and quality of life.\nMore specifically green infrastructure, being a spatial structure providing benefits from nature to people, aims to enhance nature’s ability to deliver multiple valuable ecosystem goods and services, such as clean air or water.\nExperience has shown that investing in green infrastructure can contribute to the recovery of Europe’s economy by fostering innovative approaches and creating new green businesses. Green jobs already represent around 5% of the job market.\nGreen infrastructure and sustainability goals are our specialty, and achieving these goals requires technical knowledge and training in varied fields.\nPotential benefits of green infrastructure can include:\n- Provision of clean water\n- Removal of pollutants from air and water\n- Improved air and water quality\n- Protection against soil erosion\n- Improvement of land quality\n- Enhanced and protected biodiversity and ecosystems\n- Reducing waste streams\n- Conserved and restored natural resources\n- Creation of jobs\n- More energy solutions\n- greener cities\n- Better health and human well-being\n- Diversification of local economy\n- Minimized strain on local infrastructure\n- Improved overall quality of life\nClimate change adaptation and mitigation benefits\n- Disaster prevention\n- Flood alleviation\n- Strengthening ecosystems resilience\n- Ecological corridors\n- Landscape permeability\n- Improved habitats for wildlife\n- Reduced operating costs\n- Improved occupant productivity\n- Optimized life-cycle economic performance"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:731b78d2-44da-4f36-92db-67501d1640d6>","<urn:uuid:888f4a5f-235e-46c4-907a-3e8da92ff1d6>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What is the main function of a modem in home internet connections?","answer":"A modem converts the analog signals transmitted by the Internet Service Provider (ISP) to a digital signal that can be understood by electronic devices such as computers, smartphones, and tablets. It is responsible for converting the incoming Internet signal into a format that can be read and used by devices at home or in the office, and provides unique IP addresses to connected devices.","context":["In the digital age we live in, Internet access is crucial for most people, whether it’s for work, study, communication, shopping on Amazon, watching movies on Netflix, or simply browsing the web.\nTwo important components that allow access to Internet at home or in the office are the modem and the router (router). While both are related to the Internet connection, they are two different devices and it is important to know the differences between them.\nAnd although it seems that their differences are obvious after three decades having internet at home, today there are millions of people who still call their modem with the name of router, and your router with the name of the modem.\nIt is vital to know what each one does and what it is, since in the face of any breakdown at home we will need to have the concepts very clear. Otherwise the technician by phone will not be able to help us and we will be left without internet until they come home to solve a problem that surely had an easy solution.\nWhat is a modem?\nA modem is a device that converts the analog signals transmitted by the Internet Service Provider (ISP) to a digital signal that can be understood by electronic devices such as computers, smartphones, tablets, etc.\nIn simple terms, the modem converts the incoming Internet signal into a format that can be read and used by devices at home or in the office.\nThe modem is also responsible for providing a unique IP address to each device connected to the network. An IP address is a unique number used to identify a device on a network and is required for devices to communicate with each other and with other devices on the Internet.\nIn summary, The modem is the device that allows electronic devices to connect to the Internet and receive information.\nWhat is a router (router)?\nA router, on the other hand, is a device that allows various electronic devices to be connected to a network and provides a unique IP address to each connected device.\nIn addition, the router also provides network security by setting passwords, firewalls, and other security mechanisms.\nThe router is also responsible for directing Internet traffic efficiently. between devices on the network and between the network and other devices on the Internet.\nThe router receives information from the modem and distributes it to the devices on the network and also receives information from the devices on the network and sends it to the modem for transmission to the Internet.\nIn short, the router is the device that allows various devices to connect to the Internet and communicate with each other efficiently and securely.\nWhat are the main differences between the modem and the router?\nThe main difference between modem and router is their function. As I mentioned before, the modem is responsible for converting the incoming Internet signal into a digital format that can be used by electronic devices and providing a unique IP address to each connected device.\nThe router, on the other hand, is what takes that internet and splits it up so it can be shared by all the devices on your network. Without the first we would not have internet at home and without the second it would not reach our computers, televisions and mobile phones.\nBy the way, if you are looking for the two devices, the modem and the router in your house and you only see one, don’t worry. That is that your Internet provider has put you an all-in-one equipment that acts as a modem and router at the same time. This is the best way to avoid filling the TV table with gadgets."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:0d0360ec-e7b4-452f-956a-310817b17885>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Could you explain what is Shangri-La's origin as a mythical place, and how does it connect to the Bible's portrayal of paradise-like locations?","answer":"Shangri-La originates from James Hilton's 1933 novel 'Lost Horizon' and has roots in Tibetan terminology ('La' meaning mountain pass). It builds on a long history of legends about a paradise in the far east, dating back to Marco Polo. In Biblical studies, similar paradise-like locations are approached differently - they are studied through critical rational inquiry, examining their historical and cultural contexts rather than taking them literally. The Bible presents various paradisiacal locations, including the Garden of Eden, which is described as a place of innocence and idyllic peace, and is studied within its comparative historical, religious, and cultural contexts.","context":["Let's continue with toponyms, specializing with those from heavenly places.\ncockaigne – in peasant legand of middle ages: an imaginary country of abundent food and of idle luxury. fig: a place of overflowing abundance.

The old Iranian language Avestan had a noun pairidaēza-, “a wall enclosing a garden or orchard,” which is composed of pairi–, “around,” and daēza– “wall.” The adverb and preposition pairi is related to the equivalent Greek form peri, as in perimeter. Daēza– comes from the Indo-European root *dheigh–, “to mold, form, shape.” Zoroastrian religion encouraged maintaining arbors, orchards, and gardens, and even the kings of austere Sparta were edified by seeing the Great King of Persia planting and maintaining his own trees in his own garden. Xenophon, a Greek mercenary soldier who spent some time in the Persian army and later wrote histories, recorded the pairidaēza- surrounding the orchard as paradeisos, using it not to refer to the wall itself but to the huge parks that Persian nobles loved to build and hunt in.

Analysis revealed that the rocks contained, in addition to familiar matter, three minerals not known on earth. One of these was named armalcolite, for astronauts Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins.\nAnother was named for the Sea of Tranquillity. It was at first called tranquilite but soon became known as tranquillityite.

Bridge, Getting the Old Testament A Key Distinction • • Bible Studies = devotional or ritual use of the Bible from the standpoint of committed faith Biblical Studies = study of the socio-historical background to, and the oral/literary formation of, the Bible from the standpoint of critical rational inquiry Another Key Distinction • • In this course we’ll do our best to take the Bible seriously. However, this does not mean that we have to read the Bible literally. Instead, it does mean reading biblical texts by situating them within their comparative historical, religious, economic, political, cultural, literary, and archeological contexts. Bridge emphasizes that how we “overhear” the Bible affects the transmission of its meanings over time. Seven Key “Backstories” of the Hebrew Bible 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. God has subdued chaos, just barely. (The Backstory of Creation.) God has given humans an instruction manual for life on planet Earth so they can partner with God in the management of chaos. (The Backstory of Torah) God has enacted the tough love of moral cause and effect in order to reward fidelity to the instruction manual and to support management of the chaos. (The Backstory of the Former Prophets.) God enlists prophets to mediate this dynamic partnership upon which the health of creation depends. (The backstory of the Latter Prophets.) Through praise humans release energy that augments God’s management of chaos; through lament humans report on the quality of God’s management of chaos. (The Backstory of Psalms.) Here and there, humans catch glimpses of the divine design for chaos management; living according to these insights is another expression of the partnership. (The Backstory of Wisdom.) There are times when chaos gains the upper hand and humans in partnership with God can only hope that God is able, as in the beginning, to subdue chaos. (The Backstory of Apocalyptic.) (From Gregory Mobley, The Return of the Chaos Monsters—And Other Backstories of the Bible [Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co., 2012], pp. xi-xii.)

But by the time of the Exile, people had wrestled with YHWH, one another, and their neighbors for centuries. For many, Enuma Elish’s version of ‘creation’ was blasphemous. However, it was and remains one thing to criticize someone else’s worldview, and quite another to have a clear and coherent vision of one’s own. For many in Babylonian Exile, the first chapters of Genesis offered the beginning of that systematic alternative. At the heart of its stories of origins of the earth and humanity is the question: If the Babylonian story is wrong, how did things come to be? Put another way: What stories should we teach our children to keep them from being influenced by the power of Enuma Elish and the opulence and might of Babylon that, for now at least, is our home? Read from this perspective, the majestic and stately account of God’s creation ‘in the beginning’ can be heard for what it is: a counter-narrative to the Babylonian worldview. Each carefully worded detail expresses with power and beauty the ways of the true Creator. For instance, consider the contrast between the means of creating earth’s creatures. In Enuma Elish, Tiamet’s body is ripped open by the violence of her son, bringing forth the species. But in Genesis, it is God’s ‘word’ that brings things into being. But the Hebrew (‘amar) and Greek (lego) verbs for ‘to speak’ imply not simply the physical act of pronouncing words but also the deeper sense of bringing an intention into being. God’s creative word is not in reaction to anything else, as Marduk’s violence is. Creation does not arise as a response, but simply because God wills it into being” (Wes Howard-Brook, “Come Out, My People!”: God’s Call out of Empire in the Bible and Beyond [Maryknoll, NY: Orbis Books, 2010], pp. 18-19). Humans Created in the “Image” of God “Hebrew tselem generally refers to a statue or other physical representation, such as of a god or goddess. It seems likely that Genesis presents human beings serving a parallel function to Babylonian or other ‘idols.’ When you see a human being, you are seeing an ‘image’ of God.” (Wes Howard-Brook, “Come Out, My People!”: God’s Call out of Empire in the Bible and Beyond [Maryknoll, NY: Orbis Books, 2010], p. 21). The Dominion/Stewardship Model of Creation • • In her article “Common Ground: An Ecological Reading of Genesis 23” (Earth Story in Genesis, edited by Norman C. Habel and Shirley Wurst [Cleveland: The Pilgrim Press, 2000] Carol Newsom reminds us that there is a wordplay on the name for humankind in Hebrew (adam) and the name for Earth (adamah): “we share common ground with the Earth because we are common ground…so to call the creature adam is to recognize its solidarity with Earth” (p. 63). In his book The Bible and Ecology (Waco: Baylor University Press, 2010) Richard Bauckham likewise argues that “the earthiness of humans signifies a kinship with the Earth itself and with other earthly creatures, plants and animals. Human life is embedded in the physical world with all that that implies of dependence on the natural systems of life” (p. 21). An Alternative Model of Human Dominion “Does God’s mandate to humans at creation encourage us to become controllers and managers of the whole of creation on this planet? No. It ascribes to God’s gift the unique degree of power within creation that realistically our species has, and we should neither underestimate nor exaggerate that if we are to exercise it responsibly, as the mandate requires. Granted our limited place within the God-given order of creation, the power we do have is to be exercised with loving care for the rest of creation. Our right to use the Earth’s resources for human life and flourishing is strictly limited by the responsibility to conserve and by the rights of the other living creatures who share the Earth with us. A role of caring responsibility for other living creatures, our ‘dominion’, is not a role that sets us above creation but a specific role that humans have within creation. It is rightly practised only when we recognize it to be dominion over fellow-creatures” (Richard Bauckham, The Bible and Ecology, pp. 33-4). The Meaning of Sabbath The biblical scholar Walter Brueggemann has argued that God’s establishment of a day of rest or sabbath at the end of the six days of creation is an assertion that “life does not depend on our feverish activity of self-securing, but that there can be a pause in which life is given to us simply as a gift.” Brueggemann argues that the sabbath has four key aspects: • The sabbath discloses that “in contrast to the gods of Babylon, this God is not anxious about his creation but is at ease with the well-being of his rule.” • The sabbath announces that “the world is safely in God’s hands. The world will not disintegrate if we stop our efforts.” • The sabbath is “a sociological expression of a new humanity willed by God. Sabbath is the end of grasping and therefore the end of exploitation. Sabbath is a day of revolutionary equality in society. On that day all rest equally, regardless of wealth or power or need….Of course, the world is not now ordered according to the well-being and equality of sabbath rest. But the keeping of sabbath, in heaven and on earth, is a foretaste and anticipation of how the creation will be when God’s way is fully established.” • The sabbath is not just about the rest of God, but “because humankind is in the image of God, the rest of God is a promised rest for humankind. The rest is not a sleep which escapes history. It is the freedom and well-being of a new kind of history.” (From Walter Brueggemann, Genesis: A Bible Commentary for Preaching and Teaching [Philadelphia: John Knox Press, 1982], pp. 35-6.)

Paradoxical as it might seem, then, the God who created humans would now also be bent on destroying them” (p. 49) The Gilgamesh Epic The Story of Atrahasis The Flood Story as a Satire “The story is in many ways a satire of the Sumerian Gilgamesh Epic. In that narrative, a future king went off to seek the secret of immortality. After many harrowing experiences—including power acquired by defeating the embodied forces of the natural world and a great flood—he found that he must accept life ‘as it is.’ In other words, one can’t change the world but must adapt to it. In the Genesis Flood, not only is the hero no king, but the world is utterly transformed as a result of his collaboration with the divine will and power. God makes a ‘covenant’ with Noah and ‘all flesh’ never again to cause widespread destruction by flood (9:9-17). Noah’s reaction to this new development is not narrated, but once he is on dry land, Noah plants a vineyard. What a long time he must wait for that celebratory drink of wine! He, like Cain, is described as a “man of the soil” [’adamah] (9:20). He, too, is a child of agriculture. There was indeed no going back to Eden for Noah and his descendants. From his three sons, Genesis states, ‘the whole earth was peopled’ (9:19). This contrasts starkly with ‘empire religion,’ in which peoples are pitted against one another in the ongoing battle for honor and control of resources. But in the religion of creation, all humanity is one family, creatures of one God, even outside the Garden.” (Wes Howard-Brook, “Come Out, My People!”: God’s Call out of Empire in the Bible and Beyond [Maryknoll, NY: Orbis Books, 2010], pp. 44-5)."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:6e4f5c46-8f8d-4f44-a06e-326c279741ce>","<urn:uuid:50ffa05f-28fa-490f-a108-3d8b8f4bc545>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Looking to protect my animals - how do these viruses spread? Can Transmissible Gastroenteritis Virus in pigs and Feline Infectious Peritonitis be transmitted similarly?","answer":"The transmission routes share some similarities but have distinct characteristics. FIP is transmitted through contact with feces or oculonasal discharge from infected cats, with the virus able to survive in bodily secretions for weeks but vulnerable to disinfectants. TGEV infects pigs through the spike glycoprotein which interacts with porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN) to enter host cells. Both are coronaviruses but TGEV has become less prevalent since the late 80s due to immunity provided by porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV), while FIP remains a concern particularly in multicat households and for purebred cats.","context":["Transmissible gastroenteritis virus\nFrom Wikipedia the free encyclopedia\n|Transmissible gastroenteritis virus|\n|Electron micrograph of transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV)|\nTransmissible gastroenteritis virus\nTransmissible gastroenteritis virus or Transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) is a coronavirus which infects pigs. It is an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus which enters its host cell by binding to the APN receptor. The virus is a member of the genus Alphacoronavirus, subgenus Tegacovirus, species Alphacoronavirus 1.\nProteins that contribute to the overall structure of TGEV include the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N). The genomic size of coronaviruses ranges from approximately 28.6 kilobases. Other coronaviruses that belong to the species Alphacoronavirus 1 are Feline coronavirus, Canine coronavirus and Feline infectious peritonitis virus.\nTGEV belongs to the family Coronaviridae, genus Alphacoronavirus, species Alphacoronavirus 1. It is an enveloped virus with a positive single stranded RNA genome. TGEV has three major structural proteins, which are phosphoprotein (N), integral membrane protein (E1), and large glycoprotein (E2). The N protein encapsulates the genomic RNA, and the S protein forms viral projections.\nThe 3' segment of about 8000 nucleotides encodes subgenomic RNAs. The remaining part of the genome encodes viral replicase. The three largest gene sequence from 5' to 3' is in the order of E2 to E1 to N. There are about seven other open reading frames that are not structurally related. There are very little overlaps among the genes, and is densely packed. A negative strand is synthesized to serve as a template for transcribing RNAs of one genome size and several subgenome sized RNAs.\nThe E2 protein forms a petal-shaped 20 nm long projection from the virus's surface. The E2 protein is thought to be involved in pathogenesis by helping the virus enter the host cytoplasm. The E2 protein initially has 1447residues, and then a short hydrophobic sequence is cleaved. After glycosylation of the protein in the golgi, the protein is then incorporated into the new virus. There are several functional domains within the E2 protein. A 20 residue hydrophobic segment at the C-terminus anchors the protein in the lipid membrane. The rest of the protein is divided into two parts, a hydrophilic stretch that is inside the virus and a cysteine rich stretch that are possibly fatty acylation sites. The E1 protein is mostly embedded in the lipid envelop and hence plays an essential role in virus architecture. The E1 protein is postulated to interact with the lymphocyte membrane, which leads to the induction of IFN-coding genes.\nCoronaviruses enter the host by first attaching to the host cell using the spike glycoprotein. The S protein interacts with the porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN), a cellular receptor, to aide in its entry. The same cell receptor is also a point of contact for Human Coronaviruses. A domain in the S spike protein is recognized by pAPN, and transfection of pAPN occurs to nonpermissive cells and infects them with TGEV.\nThe morphology of TGEV was mostly determined by electron microscopy techniques. The morphology is similar to myxovirus and oncogenic virus in that they have surface projections and an envelop. The viruses are mainly circular in shape with a diameter ranging from 100 to 150 nm including the surface projections. The projections were mainly petal-shaped attached by a very narrow stalk. The projections seemed to be very easily detached from the virus and were only found on select areas.\nTGEV infects pigs. In piglets less than 1 week old, the mortality rate is close to 100%. The pathology of TGEV is similar to that of other coronaviruses. Once the virus infects the host, it multiplies in the cell lining of the small intestine resulting in the loss of absorptive cells that in turn leads to shortening of villi. The infected swine then have reduced capability for digesting food and die from dehydration.\nTGE was prevalent in the US when it was originally discovered in the early 20th century. It became more scarce in the late 80's with the rise of porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV). It is thought that PRCV provides some immunity to TGE.\nThe Transmissible Gastroenteritis Virus has been engineered as an expression vector. The vector was constructed by replacing the nonessential 3a and 3b ORF, which is driven by the transcription-regulating sequences (TRS) with green fluorescent protein. The resulting construct was still enteropathogenic, but with reduced growth. The infection of cells with this altered virus elicits a specific lactogenic immune response against the heterologous protein. The application of this vector is in the development of a vaccine or even gene therapy. The motivation for engineering the TGEV genome is that coronaviruses have large genomes, so they have room for insertion of foreign genes. Coronaviruses also infect the respiratory tract, and they can be used to target antigens to that area and generate some immune response.\n- Fehr AR, Perlman S (2015).

The virus is acquired through contact with feces or oculonasal discharge from infected cats. The virus can live in bodily secretions in the environment for weeks, but is labile to many disinfectants and cleaners. Most affected cats are less than five years or greater than 10 years of age and from multicat households. Pure-bred cats have an increased risk for FIP. Infection may be more likely in the presence of other viral infections, such as with feline leukemia (FeLV), immunodeficiency (FIV) and herpes viruses. The feline corona virus may stay localized within the gastro-intestinal tract and cause self-limiting fever, lethargy, vomiting and diarrhea. Very serious disease develops when the virus gains access to the blood stream and circulates, disseminating around the body. Two distinct forms of disease can develop in this situation- the exudative/effusion/wet form or the granulomatous/pyogranulomatous/non-effusive/dry form.\nThe effusive form develops from interaction of the virus and antibodies and consequent inflammation of blood vessels (vasculitis). The vasculitis can occur anywhere in the body, affecting any organ or system. Thick, protein-rich fluid oozes from the damaged blood vessels, filling various body cavities/spaces. The dry form develops when the virus incites a specific type of inflammatory reaction called granulomatous inflammation. Essentially, a ball of inflammation develops around the virus and damages the surrounding tissue. Any organ/system can be affected; however, the central nervous system and eye are most often involved.\nClinical signs and physical examination findings are referable to the organ(s)/system(s) affected and overlap is seen between the two forms of FIP. Commonly the only signs noted are vague, including lethargy, decreased appetite and weight loss. Many patients present with a substantial fever and jaundice/icterus. The effusive form often causes abdominal distension, respiratory distress and/or muffled heart/lung sounds. Animals affected by the dry form may present seizing, comatose and/or blind. Liver, kidney and/or splenic enlargement/irregularity can be palpated in a patient with either form. Overall, it is important to realize that any combination of signs can be seen due to the often diffuse nature of this disease.\nA presumptive diagnosis is made based on the clinical signs, signalment/age of the cat and fitting history. Supportive laboratory findings include anemia, increased neutrophil (a type of white blood cell) counts, increased blood proteins (especially immunoglobulins), chest or abdominal fluid very high in protein and relatively low in cells and a positive antibody titer. The antibody titer is unfortunately not specific to the FIP coronavirus because of cross-reaction with the enteric coronavirus and so, cannot be used for definitive diagnosis. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis that reveals increased protein and white blood cell numbers is also supportive, but not definitive. Radiographs/x-rays and ultrasound may show bodily effusions and enlarged organs. A definitive diagnosis requires a biopsy sample of affected tissue and more specific laboratory analyses; however, supportive data is often convincing enough to base critical decisions on.\nThe prognosis for FIP varies somewhat based on the form, but is overall not favorable. The effusive form carries a particularly grave prognosis and most cats are euthanized within days of presentation. Supportive and symptomatic treatments are the mainstay of therapy, if it is to be pursued. No specific anti-viral treatments have been shown to be successful against the FIP coronavirus. The dry form may be successfully treated when localized within the eye. Central nervous system involvement worsens the prognosis to poor although, palliation with immunosuppressive drugs for varying periods of time may be achievable.\nAn intranasal FIP vaccine exists and is variably successful. Whether it should be administered or not, is usually determined on a case-to-case basis. Cats in catteries or multicat households may make better candidates for receiving this vaccine."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:62a50485-6d16-4798-9fba-2d3ff64effa4>","<urn:uuid:97657c17-d084-4cbb-abc5-984a516c0f94>"],"error":null}

Despite the fact that the rings look like continuous hoops of matter encircling the giant planet, each ring is actually made of tiny individual particles. Saturn’s rings consist largely of water ice mixed with smaller amounts of dust and rocky matter. Data from the Cassini spacecraft indicate that the environment around the rings is like an atmosphere, composed principally of molecular oxygen.\nThe ring system is divided into 5 major components: the G, F, A, B, and C rings, listed from outside to inside (but in reality, these major divisions are subdivided into thousands of individual ringlets). The F and G rings are thin and difficult to see, while the A, B, and C rings are broad and easily visible. The large gap between the A ring and and the B ring is called the Cassini division. One of Saturn’s moons, namely; Enceladus is the source of Saturn’s E-ring. The moon’s geyser-like jets create a gigantic halo of ice, dust, and gas that helps feed Saturn’s E ring.\nEnceladus has a profound effect on Saturn and its environment. It’s the only moon in our solar system known to substantially influence the chemical composition of its parent planet. The whole magnetic environment of Saturn is weighed down by the material spewing from Enceladus, which becomes plasma — a gas of electrically charged particles. This plasma, which creates a donut-shaped cloud around Saturn, is then snatched by Saturn’s A-ring, which acts like a giant sponge where the plasma is absorbed.\nCredit: Bjorn Jonsson, NASA/JPL/SSI\nSeriously thinking of making some new characters based of these African Gods\nsomebody should make a sick movie with these guy\nI love this so deep and sexy at the same dam time\nLet’s face it - English is a crazy language.

{"question":"Looking at filming locations - what are the main composition challenges when shooting in dense tropical vegetation vs ocean scenes?","answer":"In dense tropical vegetation filming, as seen in 'Basic', the main composition challenge involved balancing road design with camera sight lines, requiring careful cutting into the vegetation without impacting filming angles. For ocean scenes, the composition challenges are quite different - the ocean appears limitless and out of context, requiring specific techniques like including shore or land mass as reference points, ensuring the horizon appears as a straight line across the frame, and potentially including boats or other floating masses to add weight to the shot and provide context.","context":["'Basic' crew takes extra steps to double Florida\n“When a film set is ‘doubled’ to look like another area of the country, or the world, for that matter, attention to detail is paramount,” said location manager Mitch Harbeson.\nWhen lensing on a film was skedded for within days of 9/11, the challenge was even greater.\n“Basic,” with John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson and Connie Nielsen, was set to film on location in Panama, where the story was set, but after the events of Sept. 11, 2001, Harbeson’s team had to immediately refocus its approach from an international to a domestic setting.\nThe plot demanded a location that provided a barrier from local residents that would, in effect, keep the “peace” during several months of filming machine gun firefight scenes amid a set-created hurricane.\nTo keep the search interesting, the crew also needed to duplicate an old Army military base in Panama City, Panama, for the new domestic location. Harbeson’s team found Cecil Field in Jacksonville, Fla., which boasted a closed military base surrounded by several thousand acres, including a large area of Water Oaks that would retain its greenery during the winter months.\nWorking the area, part of the Florida wetlands, efficiently and safely during night hours required building a road that would surround the set and was also strong enough to support production trucks during Florida’s heavy rainfall.\nThe crew had to be mindful of preserving the local environment and minimizing the impact of production.\n“We had to be very careful how this road was cut into the dense tropical vegetation and forest,” said Harbeson. “Prevention of senseless tree cutting and trimming had to balance with a road designed not to impact camera sight lines during filming.”\nFlorida’s flatter topography differs from Panama. To create the jungles, hills and valleys, the team placed 120 truckloads of dirt into the area forming the necessary undulation and added two truckloads of plant life.\n“This was only permitted by the (Florida Dept. of Environmental Protection) because of my guarantee that I would not introduce foreign soil or water into the area and that it would be brought back to its original condition, within an inch,” Harbeson explained.\nHis past experience working with the department bolstered their confidence all would go as planned.\nNext, the crew faced the daunting task of generating an on-demand hurricane. To do so required hiding numerous water hoses and large turbine wind fans, drilling well points around the set — and ordering soil and water tests to ensure the safety of the crew.\nWorking closely with the military was necessary as well because the film’s location was near an airstrip where pilots were being trained for deployment in the Middle East. Balloon lighting was employed to prevent dangerous distractions for military aircraft.\nHarbeson’s team had just two weeks to accomplish this task before the next mission: bringing the old military base back to life, which required restoring the sewage, water and power that had been severed for demolition purposes, among other things.\n“After that, we attached generators to all the buildings,” Harbeson recalled. “It was a beautiful thing that night when we did our first light test.”\nSeveral years later, Harbeson was once again navigating locations in his native Florida, this time for production of HBO telepic “Recount.”\nSecuring locations required the assistance of the supervisor of elections, committee leaders, the governor and mayor. Harbeson made certain he always got the political parties in front of the conversations while being careful to edit his personal opinions.\nFlorida’s fondness for college and pro football meant planning the film’s large public scenes around the games and acquiring permission to reroute the century-plus-old Florida A&M U. homecoming parade. In addition, Harbeson’s team was the first film production unit ever allowed into the Florida Supreme Court.\n“Regardless of what jersey people wore, Democrat or Republican, Floridians wanted to be a part of this film and represented the film well,” said Harbeson.","Digital video has democratized media in a way that allows most people the ability to capture beautiful images from the world they inhabit. The ocean has often been an inspirational part of our environment that sparks the creative imagination of artists in a whole range of mediums, and there are more than a few types of projects that may ask you to jump behind the camera and record images of the ocean. Here are a few tips for successfully filming this body of water for different types of digital video projects you may need it for.\nThe first thing you are going to have to remember is not only that direct contact with the ocean water will damage equipment, but the general salt air and spray that is going to characterize the environment is going to cause problems with your digital video equipment as well. You are going to need to stabilize your equipment in a way that will prevent them from actually hitting the water in any unmediated kind of way, but you will also need to protect it from the more silent risk of what is just floating in the air. Make sure to use protective coatings and covers on all equipment, especially your digital video camera. There can be internal problems, rust formation, and degenerative breakdown that can occur over multiple shoots.\nFraming the image can be difficult as the ocean itself can appears so limitless and out of context. You are going to want to rely on many of the classic composition elements used in wide shots or master shots, but you may want to focus on relevant objects to provide context. This means having part of the shore or land mass in the shot to give a reference point. You may want to maintain the open appearance, but would like to dial in to a boat or other floating mass in the water. Whatever it is, you are going to try to get another object in there to add to the shot and to make it appear as though it has real weight.\nImage balance can also be a critical issue when filming the ocean as it can be hard to stabilize an image in a weather dependent area like the beach. You may find that your normal ways of finding out whether or not an image is straight, such as the level on your tripod or monopod, are not going to be enough. The main point is that when you are pointing out at the ocean you want to make sure that the horizon appears straight in the image. If the horizon appears as a straight line across the entire frame then this will tell you if it is straight or not and will be very obvious when the image is actually viewed in the final project. The horizon should act as the permanent straight line in your project, and when it is viewed across the ocean it is going to be the only time that it is completely uninterrupted, and therefore the perfect natural manifestation of this straight line. If you have another land mass here this is also going to not only give you the audience reference point, as mentioned above, but also a compositional one for basic image construction.\nLight is difficult around all bodies of water, but of particular concern when filming the ocean. The ocean acquires its bluish tint through reflection and the light of the day really affects how it appears. You will not be able to affect the light around the ocean unless you are using the highest level professional equipment. Instead, you want to plan your shoot around the weather, and try to just light objects and subjects that will be filmed either in or near the water. The weather that you want is going to be dependent on what you are going to need, but you will want a relatively flat level of light if you want to film for a consistently long period of time. If you want a certain amount of light on the image, such as that which comes down straight in a “noon” fashion, then you will want cloud-free days to assert this. Remember, if you do not have a barrier like you do during an overcast day you will find that it is hard to match up shots that are taken at different times. Rain is always going to cause a problem unless you have the appropriate protective gear, and the light is usually going to have to be artificial."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:cba5fc09-50b7-4982-a0a6-d42358cc8371>","<urn:uuid:b3a96dd0-85bb-4f42-9bb0-103b19b6a4f4>"],"error":null}
{"question":"¿Cuál es más grande en tamaño - the Mona Lisa painting or the oak wood crucifix at St. Francis Chapel?","answer":"The Mona Lisa painting is smaller, measuring 30\"×21\" (77cm×53cm), while the oak wood crucifix at St. Francis Chapel is larger, measuring 50.5\" high x 42.5\" wide x 8\" deep, mounted on a wooden cross that reaches 10 feet high from roof to base.","context":["The Mona Lisa is considered by many to be the prototypical Renaissance portrait. Painted sometime between 1503 and 1517 by Leonardo da Vinci, La Gioconda (or La Joconde in French, but commonly known as the Mona Lisa) is perhaps the most widely known and recognised work of Western art. The painting was commissioned by Francesco di Bartolomeo di Zanobi del Giocondo, but da Vinci never fulfilled the contract. He was so pleased with it that he carried the painting around with him on his travels to show off his artistic talents. It depicts a woman, possibly Lisa del Gherardini (Francesco's wife) in typical early 16th Century Florentine dress, seated in a mountainous landscape, who wears a smile usually described as 'enigmatic'.\nThe perspective of the background is slightly off, the horizon is somewhat tilted, but that is the sort of thing that da Vinci liked to experiment with. Da Vinci made many innovations in the art of painting, and a lot of his notebooks are devoted to the effects you can get. He revolutionised the use of perspective, both of line (the way things converge towards a vanishing point on the horizon) and of colour (the aerial perspective, how colours fade with distance). Given his genius (nobody could draw with such intense observation) and the depth of study he had put into the subject it can only be concluded that this was done on purpose. He would have been fully aware of the imbalance between his point of view of the Mona Lisa's face (more or less full on) and the point of view (higher) that places the far hills and horizon below the viewer. What was revolutionary about the Mona Lisa is the shading of the face, the technique called sfumato1. Da Vinci put the paint on in many thin layers, building up a gentle image that your eyes can't quite focus on: hence the enigmatic nature of the smile.\nThe smile's captivating nature, often credited as the source of this painting's remarkable popularity, may be partly an accident of contemporary symbolism: slight opening of the sides of the mouth was considered to be a symbol of elegance at that time. In 16th Century Europe, teeth were not shown in paintings - even when they had their mouths open – unless the artist was painting the dead or a base person who had devoted their lives to carnal pleasures, a view that was still held in polite society in 1703, according to John Baptist de La Salle's Les Règles de la Bienséance et de la Civilité chrétienne, à l'usage des Écoles chrétiennes (The Rules of Christian Decorum and Civility):\nThere are some people who raise their upper lip so high or let the lower lip sag so much that their teeth are almost entirely visible. This is entirely contrary to decorum, which forbids you to allow your teeth to be uncovered, for nature gave us lips to conceal them...\nFollowing forensic and computer analysis there is speculation that da Vinci used his own face as a basis for his masterpiece. This theory is given weight by her thick brow ridge, which is common in 90% of males, but very rarely occurs in females. Although Sigmund Freud concluded that the Mona Lisa was based on da Vinci's memory of his mother and his suppressed incestuous sexual feelings for her - but we won't go into that here.\nWhere Art Thou?\nThe 30\"×21\" (77cm×53cm) painting has been kept in the Louvre Museum in Paris, France since the Restoration2. The picture was originally larger; they cut off a pillar on each side because the frame they wanted to use was too small. Despite the work's enduring popularity, the curators have sadly seen fit to ensure that a trip to see it is likely to prove disappointing. The relatively-low light levels, the thick throng of visitors making close access difficult, and the protective layers of glass3 in front of it all conspire to make it seem dull and uninspiring. Anyone wishing to study the picture in detail would be well advised to obtain a high-quality print. On the other hand, a trip to the Louvre to glimpse the Mona Lisa in person rates quite highly on some people's Bucket Lists.\nMona Lisa in Popular Culture\nSo why is the Mona Lisa still so popular? Perhaps it is the mystery which surrounds the subject which adds to the appeal, but who knows for sure? We know that beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and countless eyes have admired the Mona Lisa. The lady with the mystic gaze has inspired poets and writers, and art students have a never-ending fascination with her, especially some who recreated her image in seaweed on a beach in Florida in 2011. There are also some pictures created by modern artists with references to the Mona Lisa, including Marcel Duchamp and Eugène Bataillee.\nThe Mona Lisa painting has appeared in so many advertisements it would be impossible to list them all here. It has been photoshopped, repainted and her head replaced with different ones an unknown number of times, but there's a lot out there. For instance there is a Mr Bean version, Betty Boop, and Disney's Mona Lisa is Daisy Duck. Perhaps the most obvious imitation is of the animated Lisa Simpson recreating the famous pose in The Simpsons. Although some pop-culture references are parodies, others honour the subject, but some, like Monty Python, are not so kind. Then there are the parodies of the parodies, like Salvador Dalí's Self Portrait as Mona Lisa.\nThe Mona Ogg by Leonard da Quirm (Paul Kidby), grinning widely, features on the cover of Terry Pratchett's The Art of Discworld. You can find impressions of the Mona Lisa on playing cards, umbrellas, tea sets, jigsaw puzzles, luggage, postage stamps, embroidery patterns, t-shirts, handbags, wallpaper, fabric material, bedding and, rather sacrilegiously, flip-flops.\nThe Mona Lisa has been recreated using Rubik's Cubes, Lego, precious gemstones, jelly beans, cups of coffee (the 'Mocha Lisa'), and around 6,000 slices of bread were blowtorched to create her image in toast by Maurice 'Toastman' Bennet in 2010.\nMona Lisa Smile\nMona Lisa Smile is a 2003 film starring Julia Roberts, Kirsten Dunst and Maggie Gyllenhaal. Julia Roberts plays the part of a teacher at a women's art college, and the film charts how she affects the lives of her students. The various artists soundtrack includes 'Smile', which Charlie Chaplin had composed the music for in 1936. Lyrics were added by John Turner and Geoffrey Parsons in 1954, and the tune has been recorded by lots of wonderful singers since. These include Nat King Cole, Diana Ross, Misia (for charity), Westlife and Michael Jackson, who said it was his favourite song. His brother Jermaine Jackson sang it at Michael's memorial service in 2009. For the Mona Lisa Smile film, 'Smile' was sung by Oscar-winner Barbra Streisand.\nWithout the Smile\nA smile-less Mona Lisa, showing her with a black eye, bruised face and sad expression, appeared in a poster to campaign against violence on women. Entitled 'Could you live without her smile?', it was certainly a head-turner.\nFans of Dr Who will be aware of a question hanging over the picture's provenance. In the story 'City of Death4' written by none other than the late great Douglas Adams, it was revealed that in fact da Vinci painted six copies of the Mona Lisa. This was part of an evil alien's devious plan, the details of which are unimportant here, but the net result of which is that although the Fourth Doctor thwarted the plans, the canvas on which the painting now in the Louvre was painted has the words 'This is a fake' written on it in felt tip.\nTrekking Where no Portrait has Gone Before\nIn Star Trek - The Next Generation series three episode 'The Most Toys', sentient android Lt Commander Data (Brent Spiner) is kidnapped by a Zibalian trader called Kivas Fajo (Saul Rubinek) for his private collection of stolen rarities and one-offs. Imprisoned aboard Fajo's spaceship the Jovis, Data peruses the unique assemblance of ill-gotten gains, which includes the Ark of the Covenant and Leonardo da Vinci's painting of the Mona Lisa. Data is attempting to imitate her smile when he is interrupted by the return of his captor.\nSarah Jane Swaps Places\nIn Doctor Who spin-off The Sarah Jane Adventures, the episode 'Mona Lisa's Revenge' (2009) saw the Mona Lisa come to life and escape her confinement. She also has the ability to trap unfortunate people inside other paintings, including Sarah Jane herself.\nOdes, Flora, Outer Space, Shells and Spuds\n- Mona Lisa is an opera by Max von Schillings\n- Mona Lisa is a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles character\n- There are 'Mona Lisa' varieties of anemone and the Oriental lily\n- 'Mona Lisa' is an episode of The Outer Limits television show\n- Mona Lisa is an approx 80km-diameter crater on the planet Venus\n- The Monalisa is a variety of potato\n- Mona Lisa Smile is the name of a band from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania\nSave the Mona Lisa!\nThe Mona Lisa appears in the 2009 disaster film 2012. The priceless painting is secretly removed from the Louvre and replaced with a replica. The original is squirrelled away for safekeeping, but when the director of the Louvre announces he is going to hold a press conference he is branded a threat to national security and silenced, permanently, by the US Government.\nThe song 'Mona Lisa' was written by Ray Evans and Jay Livingston for the film Captain Carey, USA. Sung by Nat King Cole, it won the Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1950, and spent eight weeks at the top of the US singles chart. Almost two decades later, Cole stated in an interview that 'Mona Lisa' was among his favourite songs that he had ever sung.\nDo you smile to tempt a lover, Mona Lisa?\nOr is this your way to hide a broken heart?\n[...] Are you warm, are you real, Mona Lisa?\nOr just a cold and lonely, lovely work of art?","Direct carving in oak wood, ¾ life size figure\nAllen’s eldest daughter, Barbara, and her younger brother, Frederick, both have childhood memories of their family making a trip to see what she remembers as a life-sized crucifix that their father had made for the Kershaw Estate’s St. Francis Chapel in Marlborough, New Hampshire. Barbara remembers being very proud that her father had done that impressive work. Probably just eleven years old at the time, it must have looked huge seen hanging on the outside wall of the chapel overlooking the peaceful waters of Stone Pond.\nThe chapel and the crucifix have been well cared for on this picturesque country property. Weekly summer Episcopal services are still held on Sunday and weddings are frequent occurrences in the tiny Episcopal sanctuary by the water.\nThe crucifix is carved from two slabs of oak glued together to prevent cracking and warping, preserved in a dark finish. The arms have been carved separately, attached in vertical joints. It hangs on the exterior of the curved wall of the apse that houses the altar on the interior. It is presumed that it was detached in the winter and brought inside to protect it from the weather and vandals when the estate was closed up in the off-season. The figure is flat on the back side providing a secure surface where it is attached to the cross.\nOne account in an addendum from 2006 (p.166) to Stone Pond : A Personal History by William D. Eddy (1982) relates the comical story of how, while doing repairs, a short relative of Mrs. Kershaw had to stand on a Bible on the altar to “take the big Christ figure down” to remove a light fixture. Although it now hangs outside, it must have been inside the chapel at one time. Looking at the figure, you would never guess that this wooden work of art had been outside for 84 years! The grain of the wood is deep in places and birds have built their nests in the protected cross behind Christ’s head, but otherwise it is in excellent condition.\nThe figure hangs on a simple dark wooden cross under a small protective gabled roof, resting there regally and honorably. The base of the cross sits on a square-sided, bluestone-topped cube, the whole mounted on the outside of the white-painted curved wall of the apse of the tiny chapel reaching from just under the curved roofline to the base that rests on the ground. The face is peaceful, not a tortured rendition. Standing facing the carving on the outside, one sees to the left, the whitewashed sidewall of the chapel with its arched window frames painted a dark bright lapis blue. The woods are past and behind it with the pond and the open sky to the left.\nAs would be expected of Allen, the anatomy of the figure is beautifully portrayed. The hands are closed around the nails. The forearms are slim rather than muscular and without bulk or the appearance of contraction. The tendons of the wrist and biceps are pulled taut, showing the strain on the arms of hanging from the hands. The knees are slightly bent, the right one a bit in front of the left to match the right foot nailed to the left. The muscles of the thigh are anatomically defined, but not detailed. The position of the torso is facing straight forward, necessitated perhaps by the outstretched arms pinned with large square-headed nails at the palm. The head is lowered toward the right shoulder (and toward the waters of Stone Pond) so that the view of the figure, standing at the water’s edge is interesting and artistic. Looking upon the peaceful handsome face, there is much detail compared to the simple treatment given to the rest of the figure. There is calm and beauty in the form. The draping of the cloth around the hips is classical in style. The overall effect is of a slim, fit young man, finished with his work and sleeping peacefully.\nThe toes have been broken off and smoothed flat and the whole carving has been preserved with what looks like a thick dark glassy weatherproof stain. The wood grain is especially visible on the abdomen and face, the contours running with and accentuated by the grain of the wood. The torso runs with the vertical grain of the trunk wood and the forward knee appears to have been the collar of a branch.\nThis lovely natural scene would certainly please St. Francis, the Christ and the sculptor, a fitting setting for a surprisingly active little summer chapel up in the woods of Southern New Hampshire.\nSize: 50.5” h x 42.5” w x 8” d on a 5 ¾” w x 2.3/4” d wooden cross, 10’ h from roof to bluestone-topped square box\nFinish: Dark brown stain with a gloss finish sealer\nLiterature: Stone Pond: A Personal History by William D.

Today we are re-publishing the third installment with the white paper Protect your data at the front door with conditional access.\nThrough this blog series, we’ve taken a closer look at conditional access with Enterprise Mobility + Security and the innovations that can help you define and inform your policies with different layers of controls for user/location, applications, and devices. Most of the scenarios we’ve discussed have addressed user-based vulnerabilities, but it’s important to take into consideration the broader threat landscape and its complex risks.\nRisk-based conditional access\nAlthough attacks are increasingly sophisticated, each one leaves revealing traces, a calling card. This data can be used to find patterns that will help us protect against attacks. But processing such tremendous volume is no small task—so we got to work. Every month we update more than 1 billion PCs, service more than 450 billion authentications, and analyze more than 200 billion emails for malware and malicious websites. We see just about every kind of attack there is, and we push the data directly into our Microsoft Intelligent Security Graph.\nThe graph pulls together all of the telemetry and signals that come in from the hundreds of cloud services operated by Microsoft, extensive and ongoing research, and data from partnerships with industry leaders and law enforcement organizations. This graph is unique to Microsoft. We apply our machine learning and data analytics to identify suspicious and anomalous activities that characterize modern sophisticated attacks. The graph makes it possible for us to deliver recommendations and automated actions that protect, detect, and respond across different attack vectors.\nYou can use the Microsoft Intelligence Graph to inform your conditional access policies to protect against risk events by blocking access when risk is detected.\nMicrosoft security researchers search for credentials that have been posted on the dark web, which usually appear in plain text. Machine learning algorithms compare these credentials with Azure Active Directory credentials and report any match as “leaked credentials.”\nImpossible travel or atypical locations\nMachine intelligence detects when two sign-ins originate from different geographic locations within a window of time too short to accommodate travel from one to the other. This is a pretty good indicator that a bad actor succeeded in logging on.\nMachine intelligence also flags sign-ins at atypical locations by comparing them against past sign-ins of every user. Sign-ins from familiar devices or sign-ins from or near familiar locations will pass.\nSign-ins from potentially infected devices\nThe Microsoft Intelligent Security Graph maintains a list of IP addresses known to have been in contact with a bot server. Devices that attempt to contact resources from these IP addresses are possibly infected with malware and are therefore flagged.\nSign-ins from anonymous IP addresses\nPeople who want to hide their device’s IP address, often with malicious intent, frequently use anonymous proxy IP addresses. A successful sign-in from an anonymous IP address is flagged as a risky event. If the risk score is medium, a risk-based conditional access policy can require MFA as additional proof of identity.\nSign-ins from IP addresses with suspicious activity\nMultiple failed sign-in attempts that occur over a short period of time, across multiple user accounts, and that originate from a single IP address, also trigger a risk event. Traffic patterns that match those of IP addresses used by attackers are a strong indication that accounts are either already compromised or will be very soon, although the traffic pattern may also originate from an IP address shared with multiple devices via a router or similar device.\nBeyond access control\nMicrosoft Enterprise Mobility + Security (EMS) delivers innovative security technologies that provide a holistic, identity-driven approach to mobility, identity, and security in a mobile-first, cloud-first world.\nWhile our risk-based conditional access helps protect your data “at the front door,” EMS also gives you visibility into user, device, and data activity on-premises and in the cloud, and includes solutions that allow you to protect your corporate data from user mistakes with stronger controls and enforcement."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"language-ambiguous"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:dac9307c-57ff-4901-a6bc-2cd0320b89e4>","<urn:uuid:b438e75a-ac50-492c-8b9f-8f218528936c>"],"error":null}
{"question":"As a safety-conscious traveler, I'd like to know how medical emergencies are handled on Portugal kayaking trips versus Westwater Canyon rafting expeditions?","answer":"On Portugal kayaking trips, participants must have comprehensive travel insurance covering illness, accidents, and emergency medical evacuation. For Westwater Canyon rafting, guides are trained in first aid and carry basic supplies, but evacuation to modern medical care can be uncertain and protracted. In both cases, participants are responsible for bringing their own prescription medicines and must alert guides to any medical conditions. For Westwater Canyon, any costs of evacuation and medical treatment beyond first aid are the participant's responsibility.","context":["What can we expect on a typical day?\nOur expeditions are vigorous but not excessively rugged. However, they are not for totally inexperienced paddlers. We would like you to have done wet exits and if you haven't we can do that the first day. An advanced beginner would be fine. On our 9 night trips some days we will be covering rather long distances on the water so we expect all participants to be reasonably fit. Our 5 night trips are more relaxed.\nAge should not be a factor. Our groups often include paddlers in their seventies. We paddle together as a group and our speed is determined by the slowest paddler. Typically we average 4 km. per hour when headwinds are mild. This is flat water paddling with a very little current.\nWe get on the water early enough each day to avoid headwinds that usually pick up around noon. Early starts also get us to our daily destination early enough to stretch our legs and visit the area. The guides appreciate help getting boats and equipment on and off the water. Our kayaks are very stable, seaworthy expedition single and tandem models.\nWhere will we be staying and eating?\nWe stay in small family operated hotels and quintas where our neighbors are Portuguese. Breakfast will be in the hotels. Lunches will be prepared by our guides or eaten in local restaurants. We will enjoy regional Portuguese cuisine in restaurants for evening meals. All our meals will be from local grown products mostly bought at that days market. In several cases the meals will be prepared with products grown in fields right next to the restaurant. We will do our best to cater to dietary restrictions but we must be informed when you sign on for the expedition.\nClothing for our trip\nFoot wear: one pair of lightweight walking shoes and a pair of sandals and whatever you wear in the kayak which could be the same sandals.Flip flops are not acceptable as kayak footwear. There are more accidents getting into and out of kayaks than at any other kayaking moment. Flip flops tend to slip when wet and we can't risk slipping.\nKayaking wear; Some of these items you might not need but I prefer to err on the safe side. All this must be quick drying (i.e.) not cotton. Shorts or bathing suit suitable for wearing in any bar or restaurant, paddling jacket/rain and wind proof. Paddling pants if you tend to get cold easily. Long sleeved shirt, some sort of head protection from the sun, sunglasses with strap. A buff is something I find very practical for sun protection.\nOff water wear: Long pants, skirt, dress, t-shirts and other clothes you might like but do travel as light as possible.\nWhat can I read to prepare myself for this trip?\nCork Boat John Pollack 2004\nMr Pollack takes us on a dream fulfilling journey down the same route we\nfollow on the Douro River.

All our luggage is carried from accommodation to accommodation. You will not need to carry anything in the kayaks except a little money and your camera.\nA small dry bag for personal items needed while on the water.\nTransfers to the launch sites.\nAll meals from dinner on the first day to our farewell dinner on the last night. House wine or bottled water is included. You may select fine wines from the wine list.\nBed and breakfast or quinta accommodations in double bed rooms for the nights.\nBottled drinking mineral water.\nPersonal incidental purchases (souvenirs etc.)\nEntrance fees for museums\nTips other than meals and hotels\nTravel to the pick up sites (flights, trains etc.)\nTravel to train station on first day is not included but of course the train is included.\nWhat if I get sick or have an accident?\nKayaking has some inherent risks. Sickness and accidents can spoil an otherwise enjoyable time and really wreck a budget. Therefore, you must have a comprehensive travel insurance policy. You must be covered against loss of baggage, illness, accidents, trip cancellation and the very unlikely necessity, of emergency medical evacuation. Please revise the claim process and inform us of the contact information when you sign on this expedition.\nHow much money should I bring?\nRemember that you must pay the balance of your trip cost in cash. We are usually working in a cash economy where we must pay everything in cash or suffer much more elevated costs. This is the reason we need to be paid in cash. If you absolutely must pay by bank transfer we will provide our bank details and you will have to pay a 23% vat that will be added on your invoice.\nIf you are traveling from outside the Euro Zone it is usually best to buy Euros before you arrive in Europe. In our travel information links, you will find sites for ATM machines that accept VISA and Master Cards. Generally the ATM machines have a daily limit of 300 Euros. Most international airports have exchange banks. Traveler checks are not a good idea as they must be changed at banks and the process is very time consuming.\nAfter you pay the fees for the expedition in cash, that includes B&B and all regularly scheduled meals, you will only need money for personal purchases such as gifts and tips. Tips at restaurants are included. If you have enjoyed your tour the guides greatly appreciate your tips. When I'm asked about amount for tipping staff I say 10% of the tour price and this should be given to Rui and he will divide the total amount between the guides.\nWhat will the weather be like?\nDays in Portugal this time of year are usually sunny and comfortably warm and are similar to Atlanta, Georgia. 23 C (73 F) daytime, 14C (57F) nighttime. Evenings are cool but not cold. Rain is unpredictable but not common. A fleece sweater is suitable for cooler evenings. However, you should also be prepared for any cooler than usual weather. Having a windbreaker handy is always a good idea.\nThe electrical current in Portugal is 220 V 60 HZ. Most telephone, camera and computer chargers are prepared for 100-240V and 50-60HZ. If this is the case for your electronics then all you need to do is have a European round two prong plug adapter. If you plan to use your telephone you will want to ask your provider to set you up for roaming. Be sure to ask about the charges and be aware that voice connection is not the same as data connection. If you plan to use your smart phone for email you might find the charges are very high. A way to avoid this is to disable your phone date connection and only use Wi-Fi where it is available along our route. Most days we have Wi-Fi but not always.\nFRIEND US ON: facebook.com/DouroKayakExpeditions","Westwater CanyonTrip Length: 2 or 3 days\nWestwater offers great rapids in what many consider to be the most\nscenic canyon on the Colorado River. There are wonderful camping beaches\nhere, along with interesting side canyons and historic sites (Native\nAmerican, outlaw and pioneer.) This is a great choice for people seeking\na shorter trip that doesn’t skimp on excitement.\nColorado River Rafting\nA century ago pioneer river explorers Thane Galloway and John Wesley Powell developed two distinctive rowing styles. Your guides will employ them to meet the challenge of Westwater's rapids. Galloway's innovative facing style will be used in most of the rapids that demand tight boat placement, including Funnel Falls and Sock-it-to-me. Powell's distinctive style is used for Skull rapid where a powerful thrust is required to thrust through a diagonal wave feeding right into Skull Hole.\nInside tips on booking Westwater Canyon...it usually sells out so book early. The three-day trip offers more time to leave the world behind and the opportunity to become one-on-one with the Colorado River in an inflatable kayak.: the ultimate three-day getaway.\nWestwater's rapids on this trip are created when the swift flowing Colorado River is forced through Granite Canyon, a narrow seam of polished black schist capped with red slickrock towers. Virtually unknown 30 years ago, Westwater Canyon has become a favorite choice for its pace, rhythm, and intensity.\nOne of the advantages of a river trip is the flexibility of the daily itinerary. It can vary widely from one trip to the next based on group desires, Mother Nature, and courtesy for other groups on the river. The typical itineraries below illustrate a 3-day and a 2-day trip through Westwater Canyon on the Colorado River.\nBeginning of the trip\nUpon your arrival at our headquarters (8:00 a.m., Mountain Time), we will issue your waterproof bags. You can buy any last minute items from our accessory's store at this time (please see our packing list).

Float leisurely through the desert scenery of Ruby Canyon. For those interested, inflatable kayaks provide the opportunity to experience the river on a solo basis. A side hike up Rattlesnake Canyon reveals a variety of desert plants and wildlife. Camp at Black Rocks where thousand year old ebony colored schist provides the background setting.\nDay 2: Peaceful floating and more time in the inflatable kayaks before reaching Westwater Ranger Station. The river enters the narrow canyons that give Westwater the nickname, \"the Little Grand.\" Small rapids begin to materialize along the otherwise peaceful stretches of the Colorado. Camp at one of the many beaches within Westwater Canyon.\nDay 3: Encounter rapids of Westwater--one right after another--Hunter's, Funnel Falls, Surprise and . .. THE BIG ONE: Skull Rapid. Observe bald eagle, great blue heron and snowy egret habitats. Short trip back to Green River.\nSAMPLE 2 DAY ITINERARY\nDay 1: Pack bags at river headquarters in Green River, Utah before ride to Westwater Ranger Station. Relaxing float to Little Hole Canyon's natural amphitheater where shards of Indian pottery can be seen. In favorable conditions a short hike up Little Dolores Canyon reveals a beautiful desert waterfall and swimming hole. Camp near Little Dolores.\nDay 2: Leisurely breakfast before rapids of Westwater Canyon. Rapids, one right after another, Marble, Staircase, Hunter's, Funnel Falls, and Surprise . . . lead to Skull Rapid, one of the Colorado's fiercest drops. Finish with Bowling Alley, Sock-it-to-me and Last Chance. Vans will return you to our headquarters in Green\nBugs, snakes, etc. are generally no problem. In fact, the lack of pesky insects is one of the reasons that wilderness camping on the river is so pleasant. Any river trip, however, is subject to an occasional localized insect hatch. During these hatches (most common in June to mid-July) mosquitos can be bothersome. Be sure to bring long sleeve clothing and repellent. Insect repellents that contain \"deet\" are by far the most effective during heavy hatches, but are also suspected of causing various health problems. Citronella-based products (skin-so-soft) work only in light hatches. We rarely see any snakes, but if the thought of them bothers you, try sleeping on the beaches or in a tent instead of rocky or bushy areas.\nHiking is a highlight of the trip, however, it is strictly an optional activity. There are many interesting short hikes available. Hiking can be done in durable sneakers or lightweight hiking boots. Remember that hiking and other activities vary widely pending time, and what other plans are ahead for the day on the river.\nMedical emergencies Our guides are trained in first aid and carry first aid supplies only. REMEMBER to bring your own prescription medicines. ALERT our guides to any medical problem you might have such as diabetes or allergic reactions. Wilderness expeditions are a long way from hospitals, doctors, and pain-relieving medicines. Evacuations to modern medical care are uncertain, and protracted. In case of evacuation and/or medical treatment beyond first aid, expenses incurred are the responsibility of the participant.\nBeverages We provide ice water, lemonade, two sodas per day per person and ample cooler space. If you choose to bring any specialty sodas and/or alcoholic beverages, we have no problem taking whatever you want to bring - within reason. Don't bring beer, wine coolers or sodas in glass containers. Wine packaged in a box is ideal. Mark beverages that you bring so they are packed on your boat. In Utah, wine or liquor is not sold after 7:00 p.m., before 11:00 a.m. or on sundays and holidays.\nWestwater Canyon weather In the early and late seasons (May to mid-June and late August to September) the daytime temperatures are 70 to 90 degrees, with nighttime tempatures 50 to 60 degrees. It seldom rains in Westwater Canyon, but when it does, it can cool temperatures considerably in May and September. From mid-June to mid-August the days are hot and temperatures average 80 to 100 degrees during the day and 60 to 75 degrees at night. This is the time of year that swimming in the Colorado becomes a popular activity. This seems warm but remember the humidity is very low. There will be an abundance of sun, so bring a hat and plenty of suntan lotion and/or sunscreens.\nTipping the guides Many guests ask us if tipping is appropriate after the trip. If you feel the guides have been instrumental in your enjoyment of the trip, you may choose to direct a gratuity to the trip leader. He/She will then distribute it evenly to the other crew members. Of those that choose to tip, the average contribution amount ranges between $10.00 and $20.00 per guest, per day. However, the decision to tip is left at your sole discretion.\nThings to see in the area John Wesley Powell Museum in Green River, Utah. Arches National, Dead Horse Point State Park, Canyonlands National Park, Fisher Towers, Colorado National Monument, Goblin Valley State, San Rafael Swell, Capital Reef National Park, Natural Bridges National Monument, and the La Sal and Henry Mountains.\nMeeting Place & Time\nWe meet for your trip in Green River, Utah at Holiday Expeditions headquarters, 8:00 a.m. (Mountain Time) the morning your trip begins. Our headquarters is located 1/4 mile east of the Green River Bridge, across the highway from the Motel 6 and behind the Comfort Inn. If you arrive in Green River by shuttle, bus, Amtrak, or plane, call our headquarters (564-3273) upon your arrival to make arrangements to have you and your gear transported to our headquarters the morning of the trip. If you are driving, your car can be left at our headquarters.\nIf you are flying, you can fly to Salt Lake City located 180 miles northwest of Green River, Utah. From there you can rent a car, take a shuttle with Bighorn Express (call 888-655-7433), ride a bus, or fly in a light aircraft to Green River, Utah. If you need assistance with your travel arrangements, please ask your Holiday Expedition reservation agent.\nIn the upper right hand corner of this page, you can enter your location or a point that you know of and hit enter and google maps will open and show you a map to the meeting location and driving time.\nIf cancellations are made prior to 90 days before the trip, monies will be refunded less a $50.00 service charge per person.

{"question":"Can you explain what a cipher suite is in TLS? For example TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_AES_128_GCM_SHA256?","answer":"A cipher suite is a combination of cryptographic algorithms that define the security of a connection. Taking TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 as an example: TLS is the protocol, ECDHE is the key exchange algorithm, ECDSA is the authentication algorithm, AES_128_GCM is the data encryption algorithm, and SHA256 is the Message Authentication Code algorithm.","context":["In part 1, 2, 3 and 4 of this series we looked at What is TLS/SSL?, took a brief look at the History of TLS and SSL, TLS/SSL terminology and basics and TLS/SSL Certificates. In this fifth part in the series, we will be looking at establishing a TLS connection.\nTo get a better understanding of the TLS protocol, we will now see what exactly takes place for a secure connection to be established.\nThe most important process of the connection establishment is the so called “Handshake”. During the Handshake, server and client will exchange important information regarding the properties under which the connection will be established.\nDuring the Handshake we will see how a hybrid of asymmetric and symmetric encryption is used in order to ensure security.\nFor this article we will refer to a browser as the Client. In the following example, Diffie-Hellman is used for the key exchange.\nA standard negotiation between client-server (handshake) starts off with a Client Hello message.\nThe client, sends a Client Hello to the server and includes the following.\nThe client will send a list of all the SSL/TLS protocol versions it supports, with the preferred one being first on the list. The preferred one is usually, and should be, the latest available version.\nA 32-byte random data of which 4 bytes represent the client’s current datetime (in epoch format) and the remaining 28 bytes, a randomly generated number. The Client’s random and Server’s random will later be used to generate the key which the data will be encrypted with.\nThis is the session id which will be used for the connection. If the session_id is not empty, the server will search for previously cached sessions and resume that session if a match is found.\nThis is the method that is going to be used for compressing the SSL packets. By using compression, we can achieve lower bandwidth usage and therefore, faster transfer speeds. Later on this article we will see why using compression is risky.\nCipher suites are combination of cryptographic algorithms which are used to define the overall security of the connection to be established. Typically, each cipher suite contains one cryptographic algorithm for each of the following: Key Exchange, Authentication, Bulk (data) Encryption and Message Authentication.\nA sample cipher suite is the following:\nLet’s break this down so that it makes more sense.\n- TLS is the protocol being used\n- ECDHE is the key exchange algorithm (Elliptic curve Diffie–Hellman)\n- ECDSA is the authentication algorithm (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm)\n- AES_128_GCM is the data encryption algorithm (Advanced Encryption Standard 128 bit Galois/Counter Mode)\n- SHA256 is the Message Authentication Code (MAC) algorithm (Secure Hash Algorithm 256 bit)\nHere’s what an actual Client Hello looks like in a Wireshark capture.\nThe client can request additional functionality for the connection and this can be done via “extensions”. If the server cannot provide the additional functionality, then the client can abort the handshake if needed.\nAfter the server receives the Client Hello, the second step will be to reply with a Server Hello. If it finds an acceptable set of algorithms in Client’s request, it will respond by accepting those options and provide its certificate. If the server does not meet the requirements of the Client it will respond with a handshake failure message.\nThe server, sends a Server Hello to the client and includes the following.\nThe server will (not blindly) select the Client’s preferred version of SSL/TLS protocol.\n32 bytes of random data, out of which 4 bytes represent the server’s current datetime (in epoch format), and the rest 28 bytes is a randomly generated number will be sent to the client. The Server’s random and Client’s random will later on be used to generate the key with which the data will be encrypted.\nThis is the session id which will be used for the connection. If the session_id sent by the Client is not empty, the server will search for previously cached sessions and if a match is found, that session id will be used, thus resuming. If the session_id is empty, a new session will be created for the connection.\nIf supported, the server will agree on the Client’s preferred compression method.\nIf supported, the server will agree on the Client’s preferred cipher suite.\nThe signed certificate of the server which proves the identify it’s to the client. It also contains the public key of the server.\nClient Certificate (optional)\nNot often, the server may require the client to be authenticated with a Client Certificate as well. In cases like this the client will provide its signed certificate to the server.\nServer Key Exchange\nThe server key exchange message is sent only if the certificate provided by the server is not sufficient to allow the client to exchange a pre-master secret. (This is true for DHE_DSS,DHE_RSA and DH_anon)\nServer Hello Done\nThis is sent to the client as a confirmation that the Server Hello message is completed.\nThe following is what a Server Hello looks like in a Wireshark capture.\nClient Key Exchange\nThe Client Key Exchange message is sent right after the Server Hello Done is received from the server. If the server requests a Client Certificate, the Client Key Exchange will be sent after that.\nDuring this stage, the client will create a pre-master key.\nThe pre-master secret, is created by the client (the method of creation depends on the cipher suite that will be used) and then it is shared with the server.\nBefore sending the pre-master secret to the server, the client encrypts it using server’s public key which was extracted from the certificate provided by the server. This means that only the server can decrypt the message since asymmetric encryption is being used for the pre-master secret exchange.\nThe following is what the key-exchange looks like in a Wireshark capture (using DH).\nAfter the server receives the pre-master secret key, it uses its private key to decrypt it. Now both client and server will compute the master-secret key based on the random values exchanged earlier (ClientRandom and ServerRandom) using a Pseudorandom Function (PRF). A PRF is a function used to generate arbitrary amounts of pseudorandom data.\nmaster_secret = PRF(pre_master_secret, \"master secret\", ClientHello.random + ServerHello.random) [0..47];\nThe master-secret key, which is 48 bytes in length, will then be used by both client and server to symmetrically encrypt the data for the rest of the communication.\nEach of the parties, Client and Server, will create 3 set of keys.\n- client_write_MAC_key – Authentication and Integrity check\n- server_write_MAC_key – Authentication and Integrity check\n- client_write_key – Message encryption using symmetric key\n- server_write_key – Message encryption using symmetric key\n- client_write_IV – Initialization Vector used by some AHEAD ciphers\n- server_write_IV – Initialization Vector used by some AHEAD ciphers\nBoth Client and Server will use the master secret to generate the sessions keys which will be to encrypt/decrypt the data.\nAt this point, both the Client and the Server are ready to switch to a secure, encrypted environment. The Change Cipher Spec protocol is used to change the encryption being used by the client and server. Any data being exchanged between the two parties will now be encrypted with the symmetrical shared key they have.\nThis is what the Change Cipher Spec looks like in a Wireshark capture.\nThe last message of the handshake process and first encrypted one in the secure connection is Finished, which is exchanged by both parties.\nTo recap, the following illustrates a typical handshake."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:4e5d51bd-3ffb-42fe-ae2d-05eac301b258>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I'm researching industrial cleaning equipment - how do maintenance and operational efficiency compare between dust collection systems and sandblast chambers, particularly in terms of their filtration components?","answer":"For dust collection systems, maintenance and efficiency are heavily dependent on filter loading. When filters become overloaded (beyond 5-7 grains/cu ft for baghouses or 2 grains/cu ft for cartridge collectors), the system's performance decreases significantly, requiring frequent filter replacements and causing system downtime. This can lead to air leakage into the environment and increased operational costs. In sandblast chambers, the maintenance focus is different - they are designed for continuous operation with reusable abrasive media. Their filtration system, typically using cartridge-style dust collectors, is sized according to the booth dimensions. The efficiency is maintained by preventing cross-contamination between different media types and using proper ventilation to remove airborne particles while allowing for the recovery and reuse of the abrasive materials.","context":["Dust has been one of the biggest air pollutants over the years. Dust extraction and collection systems are thus designed to eliminate dust particles at home and commercial settings. However, the dust collection system’s performance will depend on several factors such as location and number of dust collection points, duct diameter, and dust particle size, to mention just a few. A simple miscalculation when designing such a system can lead to costly performance issues.\nUnderstanding how dust extraction systems work is thus important before you commit to buy one. The following are some of the questions to guide you:\nDoes particle size distribution matter?\nDust particles usually appear in different sizes and shapes. Some of the factors that determine the size include the composition of the parent material and the processing machine’s nature that creates these particles. For instance, you will find some differences in the dust from the sawdust from a chainsaw from the dust you get from gravel in a construction site. The variance in the particle size is also known as the particle distribution. The dust extraction system company will thus be interested in the particles’ size for several reasons. Some of these particles can be inhaled and thus affects industrial hygiene standards. Dust collectors are designed to be permeable to air. However, such collectors may fail to trap dust if the particles are extra-small. Experts in this field must also check the dust particles’ combustibility and their ability to be disbursed during an explosion.\nFan wheel-style; does it affect performance?\nOne of the most important components in typical dust collection systems is the exhaust fan. It is this component that provides the motive behind the entire system. The system is thus bound to fail if the exhaust fan is not performing as expected. The fan must thus generate enough pressure and volume that will pick dust particles. There are three different types of wheels:\nAir handling wheel\nSuch wheel cleans extremely light dust loading or clean airstreams. Such wheels should never be used on the dirty side but the clean side.\nIt works best when the fan is on the dirty side of the dust collector. One of the best places where such wheels are used is in material handling. An open-type wheel applies best when the dust is fibrous or when there is a high dust loading. The design is meant to prevent/protect the dust from wrapping around the wheels.\nSuch wheels are not common on dust collection systems. They typically move a lot of air, but the force behind them is negligible. The material used to make such fans is an important consideration as abrasive specks of dust can erode those fans made from soft metals.\nWhat is a damper?\nA damper is a tool in a dust collection system that controls airflow to a specific branch of the ductwork. The dampers usually open and close, thereby allowing air to pass through. Air always uses a path with the least resistance. Typical dust extraction and collection system will have a damper near each pickup point or hood that allows the system to be balanced. It is this flexibility that will allow airflow to be varied across collection points. An unbalanced system could cause uneven pulling of air within an area. There are spaces or soft connects between flanges that control the airflow at pickup points. However, the approach is not that effective as it keeps the airflow constant in that specific area, even when it is not necessary. Dampers are more effective than soft connects as they close off branches that are not being utilized.\nWhat is load in dust extraction?\nMost dust collectors such as cartridge collectors and baghouses use filters and bags to separate dust from the air. Such collectors use fabric filters, which means that there is likely to be a negative impact on the performance when there is excessive dust loading. If a baghouse has a higher than 5-7 grains/cu ft concentration, then expect that there will be maintenance and operational issues. On the other hand, the load should be below 2 grains/cu ft if you are dealing with cartridge collectors. The airflow that goes through the collector is greatly reduced when the filters are overloaded, which leads to overall system inefficiency. The collection process thus becomes expensive as the system does not collect dust as it is expected. You must also replace the filters often, which means that the system will be offline on many occasions. There are also high chances of air getting into the environment.\nLeave A Comment","A sandblast chamber is a controlled environment where the abrasive media is controlled, recovered, cleaned, and reused several times. The booths are designed to protect the workers from the harmful effects of sandblasting and contain the debris created by the sandblasting process. Sandblast booths are an essential part of the manufacturing process for many industries and effectively reduce worker exposure to harmful dust and debris.\nA sandblast chamber is where the sandblasting takes place. It is usually made of steel and has a door that allows workers to enter and exit. The booth also has ventilation to remove dust generated by such a process.\nBenefits Of Sandblast Chambers\nReuse Of Abrasive Media\nSandblasting is a process in which abrasive media are blasted at high velocity against a surface to clean or roughen it. The benefits of sandblasting chambers are numerous, but one of the most important is the recovery and reusing of abrasive media.\nIn a sandblaster, the dust is created in the same area where the operation occurs. By keeping the containment area free of dust and other airborne contaminants, you can ensure a safe and healthy workplace for everyone involved. Thus helping to keep the area clean and increasing the visibility of the sandblaster.\nIt makes them ideal for businesses that need to blast large, challenging objects. Chambers with this type of construction can also withstand high pressure and temperatures, making them perfect for companies that need to work at high speeds.\nSandblast booths can accommodate multiple projects and applications. However, using different media types should be avoided in the same booth to prevent cross-contamination. It is good to go if one uses the same abrasive media.\nOperators appreciate the safety of sandblasting chambers, as they are not exposed to the sandblasting process’s noise and dust. This is because they wear proper gear and air-breathing helmets. The controlled environment of the room also allows operators to work more efficiently and with greater precision. They also provide a space for sandblasting, preventing damage to nearby surfaces.\nComponents Of A Sandblasting Booth\nBlast Booth Enclosure\nThe blast room is the heart of the sandblasting booth. It is where the abrasive material is blasted onto the surface of the workpiece. It is designed to contain all of the debris created by the blasting process. The debris is then eliminated from the contaminated room via an effective ventilation system.\nThe dust collector removes airborne dust particles created by the blasting process. The type of dust collector used will dependupon the size of the booth. You must get the right size of booth suitable for the parts. Getting an overly-sized collector might add up to the project’s overall cost. The most common type of dust collector is a cartridge-style dust collector.\nThe most important part of this booth is the blast nozzle. This part of the pressure blaster directs the stream of abrasive particles at the workpiece. The blast nozzle must be appropriately aligned with the workpiece to ensure that the stream of abrasives hits the workpiece squarely.\nAnother critical component is the air compressor. It provides the air pressure needed to operate the pressure blaster.\nSandblast chambers are a great way to cleanse dirt, grime, and other particles from different surfaces. They are also effective in removing rust and other debris. You can use these chambers for metal, glass, and plastic materials. Wear appropriate safety gear for sandblasting chambers, such as respirators that cover your entire face. If you are considering buying chambers, do some research. Several high-quality custom-engineered booths are available from reputed suppliers."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:0973069b-6eac-433b-9490-81c43bda35ca>","<urn:uuid:092f7888-fcce-4a7e-bc20-39f57b308612>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do software management services and Class A power quality instruments compare in terms of testing capabilities?","answer":"Software management services can test systems by simulating thousands of scenarios in a short period and interpret results automatically, while Class A power quality instruments must meet specific testing standards, particularly for parameters like flicker and harmonics. Class A instruments require specific features like anti-aliasing filters with 3KHz cutoff frequency to ensure accurate measurements, whereas software management services focus on general system performance testing through dummy requests and automated tools.","context":["A software management service is an automated and integrated set of activities beginning at the inception stage of software, which ensure that it performs at optimum levels. Software management service allows for computer software to run at tip top performance at all times. To achieve this, a software management service server is installed together with the system it’s supposed to monitor. It monitors various parameters about the system and analyses the data to determine how effective the system is. In case of a break down, the software management service effectively reduces response times.\nA software management service process is a complex web of activities which include:\nVersioning involves assigning version numbers to computer software depending on its state. Version numbers will mostly run in an ascending number for example 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2. These versions identify unique states of computer software at a particular time. Software management services constantly check available software version against a current version if a newer version is found, it is updated. Newer versions will mostly include fixes to problems and improvements on previous versions.\nA software management service uses various tools to determine how the system is working. For a website, it will constantly try to check the responsiveness of the website. It might send a dummy request for processing to make sure all request are being handled as expected. If you run mission or business critical software using a software management service will be of great help. You do not want to always worry about how fast or how well your system is performing. A software management service will effectively handle these tasks without breaking a sweat.\nDevelopment is also an important activity in the software management process. It involves actual implementation of design templates into working software. This involves writing code, compiling it and packaging it in a form that can be used for implementation. You could decide to do all these tasks using individual software but an integrated development environment which will easily accomplish the e tasks at ago is recommended.\nSoftware is designed to work in many different environments. Configuring system settings manually to make sure the system performs at optimum levels is quite hard as many factors have to be put into consideration. A software management services will do the same job more effectively. It will try different configurations until if finds the most suitable configuration. It will be able to do this without any strain and take the shortest time possible.\nFor freshly procured software using a software management service should be of great help. The automated tools and activities a will help you a lot in managing the new software. Testing is a very critical step after procuring software, using a software management service will eliminate the complexities involved with manually testing the software. More importantly the software management service will be able to test the system by simulating thousands of scenarios in a short period of time and correctly interpret the results.\nTips and comments\nSoftware installation can be quite challenging in several platforms like UNIX. A software management service will help you install any application with ease. By using a list to select software you want installed, it saves you the hassle of remembering hundreds or even thousands of commands.\nMost Recent Articles\nWhat Is Service Management Software\nService management software refers to automated programming software which help businesses or organizations to manage different parts of the services they provide to their customers. This in...","What do you need to measure?\nSome recommendations for permanent power quality measurements\nAs the system grows it needs to be scalable, i.e. it should be possible to analyze multiple meters simultaneously, to centrally configure and administer meters in groups and to automatically download data fom meters. It should be easy to get an overview and see how disturbances come up and spread throughout the grid.\nIf you intend to work with power quality statistical and/or in the long term, for example with immunity levels, you should review the options available to analyze data over several years. One condition is such that the system supports some kind of database where you collect data and then analyze it as a whole without a broken timeline.\nIf you were limited to an analysis of only a month or so, it would be very difficult to see trends that occur over time. For continuous monitoring, remote communication is an essential part of the system. Choice of communication is mainly controlled by the communication options available on the measuring point. If Ethernet is available, it is to prefer. Otherwise you have to choose equipment that supports other appropriate communication, such as dial-up telephone calls (PSTN modem), wireless modem communications (eg GPRS), etc.\nSome recommendations for portable instruments\nIf the instrument is intended to be used in tough environments with humidity and dust, or in environments where the temperature varies serverly, an IP-65 rated instrument is to be recommended. If you want to perform very long measurements and need to be able to have constant access to your data, there are instruments that use GSM communication, which lets you both configure the meter and retrieve data remotely.\nPortable vs. fixed monitoring\nAnother advantage of continuous monitoring is that you can work more with prevention and that you can detect impending problems before they escalate and lead to very far-reaching consequences. Portable instruments are used more for fault corrections/troubleshooting after a disturbance has occurred. With portable measurements, one is always “too late” out there, the disturbance has already occurred! Depending on the nature of the fault/disturbance it might be necessary to measure during both shorter and longer measurement periods.\nIf you perform measurements that are a few months or longer, permanently installed measuring devices are to recommend. From a security perspective, permanently installed equipment is to be preferred, but also because in some cases they have a better handling of long measurement periods and more alternative solutions for remote communication. With short-term measurements (hourly or weekly measurements) and measurements from a troubleshooting perspective, a portable instrument with its flexibility is preferable.\nHow important is accuracy?\nPower quality instruments can be compared to the development of breathalyzers. There is a variety of indicative breathalyzers of very varying quality, while the normative precision meters that the police uses constitutes an entirely separate segment where there are tough demands on measurement accuracy, measurement methods and regular calibration.\nIn case you perform measurements where the absolute values are of importance in disputes, inspections and measurements for the design of protection etc., it is a prerequisite to use equipment that fully complies with IEC 61000-4-30 Class A. However, if you perform measurements for troubleshooting where the absolute levels are less important, you can get far with the indicative standard instruments available on the market.\nWhat is Class A?\nIn the market there are a number of instruments that claim to comply with IEC 61000-4-30 Class A. However, it has been shown in connection with tests and comparative measurements that only a few of these instruments fully comply with IEC 61000-4-30 , Class A. Two parameters proved particularly difficult to measure according to the standard: flicker and harmonics.\nTo take flicker as an example, it refers to disturbances within the eye’s sensitivity range, which requires that high-frequency disturbances and signals are filtered out. This requires that the instrument is provided with (active) anti-aliasing filter to make sure that anti-aliasing phenomena do not occur and to make sure that no incorrect flicker values are measured.\nIf a measuring instrument is accurate in accordance with Class A it is assumed that the instrument is equipped with an anti-aliasing filter whose cutoff frequency is at 3KHz and signals and noise above that are filtered out. When purchasing an instrument it is of great importance to look very critically at the measurement performance specified in the technical details. For larger purchases it is recommended that you take the help of a test lab, certification institute or university to check the actual measurement performance of the instrument."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:d68293e1-3994-4e7e-ae35-ae4398e81a80>","<urn:uuid:d728d344-00fb-4636-b4f9-22fee3a74b08>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the cost benefits of nylon carpet fibers, and how do they contribute to environmental sustainability?","answer":"Nylon carpet fibers are cost-effective, priced in the economy range of $1.50-$5.00 per square foot. They are sturdy, making up 80% of household carpet fibers, and are affordable for almost any budget while being durable and long-lasting. From an environmental perspective, nylon can be recycled and reused in new products, as demonstrated by companies like Object Carpet who use Econyl yarn (regenerated from nylon waste) to produce carpets while avoiding petroleum use in virgin fiber production.","context":["Whether you are replacing the carpet out of necessity or you’ve sought permission to refresh the carpet yourself, it’s essential to know the costs before you begin your installation.\nA typical range for carpeting an apartment can be anywhere between $700 – $2,600.\nLet’s take a look at what factors into those prices.\nThe Cost of Carpet Installation in an Apartment\nMany factors go into carpet installation; however, the first influential factor is the average cost per square foot of carpet.\nThe cost for apartment-style carpeting can range from $3.50 to $11 per square foot. This depends on the quality of the carpet.\nCarpet Flooring Price Ranges\nNot all carpet flooring is created equal, and the price reflects that. What factors into the price, though?\nWhile high-end carpet brands can cost as much as six times the cost of economy brands, you may find that high-end brands don’t offer the same qualities as other products.\n- Economy: Two of the most commonly purchased fibers are nylon and polyester. Their products are within the $1.50-$5.00 per square foot price range.\n- Mid-Range: Loop and cut pile and Olefin are two of the fibers that occupy this range of carpet flooring. For homes and condos, this is the most popular range balancing cost and features. Their products occupy the $3-10 per square foot price range.\n- High End or Designer: These are the companies that make their mark simply by their name. They usually have a lot of features and are categorized by fibers like Berber and wool. Their prices start at $6-8 per square foot, but they can go up as high as $30 per square foot.\nThis range may be an expensive option for apartment owners if they don’t intend to stay in a location for an extended period.\nApartment and condo owners may wish to invest in a higher quality product or higher-end features.\nChoose a fiber that works for your budget. Find one with qualities that work for your home and lifestyle, such as being a non-allergen fiber.\nIf you have a busy home, select more than one type of flooring in similar colors. This will ensure low and high-traffic areas have carpet that will hold up.\nTypes of Carpet\nCarpet flooring can match virtually any pre-existing color scheme.\nIt is available in an assortment of colors, patterns, styles, dyes, and fibers. Picking the correct type of carpet for your home can make or break your budget.\nAreas that are higher traffic will benefit from different carpet types than low traffic areas. For example, high plush can lack durability and quickly lose its look.\nKnow your home. How different types of carpet and materials react to traffic will help determine which carpet is best for you.\nMaybe your living room has higher traffic than your bedroom. This is essential to know when choosing the right carpet.\nLoop Pile Carpet\nOne of the most popular styles, loop pile carpets, offer fibers that are less likely to absorb spills.\nLoop pile carpets offer a more stain-resistant material and provide greater bounce back than cut pile does.\nThis bounce is because of how the carpet is made. The fibers are looped starting with the bottom side and then drawn to the top and back down again.\nThe pile has a stronger density and a nice, even texture.\nCut Pile Carpet\nWhile the loop pile carpet flooring is dense, a cut pile is plush. Like the name, cut pile carpet has the loops cut at an even level like blades of grass.\nThis technique allows the carpet to move beneath your foot and gives you a softer feel.\nThose cut ends can also absorb spills and messes, so you should be careful if your entertaining area contains a cut pile carpet.\nThe downside to cut pile is that the same movement that gives it that soft feeling can also become damaged quickly.\nConsider cut pile carpet for lower traffic areas of your home.\nOne of the most widely used carpet materials, Berber carpet, is also one of the most expensive. That’s because it has a tight pile and requires special padding and extra labor costs.\nHowever, despite these additional costs, Berber carpet has many advantages over traditional loop or cut pile.\nIt must be specially cut and requires a specific type of padding that is thinner but denser than traditional padding.\nBetween extra costs for the padding, skilled hands to ensure the pile isn’t damaged when it’s being cut, and the use of special tools, choosing Berber increases the costs by up to $3 per square foot.\nWhile it may not be budget-friendly for many people, choosing Berber can mean a longer lifespan on your carpet.\nThis could help to reduce costs in the future when you must replace carpets in your apartment again.\nNylon carpet flooring is sturdy and an excellent choice for moderate to high foot traffic levels.\nAbout 80% of the household carpet fibers are made from nylon. It offers a wide variety of colors and patterns while still being affordable for almost any budget.\nIf you have pets and/or children in the home, nylon is a carpet solution you may want to consider. It’s easy to clean and virtually stain resistant.\nWhile nylon is durable and long-lasting, polyester fibers are becoming more popular. They are resistant to wear, non-fading, and non-allergenic.\nThe synthetic properties of the fiber, which the fashion industry has taken advantage of for decades, allow the carpeting to be resistant to wear and fading.\nThe downside to polyester is that the individual fibers can easily bend or break. Because of this, it is best placed in moderate to low traffic areas.\nBoasting a high durability as well as being an allergen-friendly fiber, polyester has become more popular and budget-friendly over the years for home renovators.\nA manufactured fiber, Olefin is best suited for very high traffic areas and spaces with allergy sufferers.\nIt is a highly resistant fiber that is resistant to fading, moisture, mildew, and mold while being an inexpensive choice.\nWool produces a carpet that is soft underfoot, plush looking, and highly durable, making it a great solution for medium to high traffic areas.\nThe downside to wool is that it can absorb moisture, leading to mold and mildew, and possibly cause issues for people with allergies.\nWool can also fade in direct sunlight and can show wear easier than synthetic fibers.\nUnexpected Carpet Costs\nCarpets today are more than just fibers. They offer a number of different features to assist with comfort.\nThey also last longer by resisting wear, stains, and moisture.\nThese features may well extend your carpet’s lifespan, however you will generally find that more features raise the cost of your carpet..\n- Stain resistance: A blend of polyester and nylon fibers that can be added to the carpet to help resist the absorption of spilled liquids and repel stains.\n- Wear resistance: Helps extend the carpet’s lifespan, including resisting crushing and matting from high traffic areas. A carpet that blends nylon and polyester with a softer fiber can achieve the best of both worlds. It is soft but also durable.\n- Moisture resistance: The addition of Olefin fibers to the flooring helps to reduce the risk of mold and mildew in high-moisture areas like bathrooms or bedrooms.\nDIY vs. Professional Carpet Installation\nIf you have the experience to measure, cut, and install the carpet by yourself, then it can be a great way to save money. However, installing carpet is not an easy job.\nInaccurate measurements or miscutting the carpet can be costly.\nAlso, if the rooms are not perfectly square and have nooks and crannies it may be a challenge.\nFor stairs that need to be covered, there is even more special cutting to be done. Special cutting can require unique tools and the skills necessary to cut the carpet to be sure it fits snugly.\nHiring a professional can ensure that wastage is minimal and can help cut down on the amount of carpet that needs to be purchased.\nAdditional Fees for Carpet Installation\nFinally, in addition to the type of carpet and installation labor costs, there are a few other factors that may affect the total cost.\nEnsure these items are included in the overall labor quote to avoid unexpected costs later on.\n- Repairs to the flooring beneath the carpet\n- Installation of trim and molding\n- Removal of old carpet\n- Furniture moving\n- Custom carpet cutting\nCalculating the cost of replacing carpeting can be tricky with many factors to consider.\nThese include how large your apartment is, how many rooms, and your aesthetic. All these things can raise or lower the costs above and beyond the type of fiber you choose to use.\nTaking all these factors into consideration and knowing the ranges of prices available can help you make educated decisions.\nBy reviewing this guide, you can have an affordable and comfortable carpet for years to come.\nOther articles you may also like:\n- Why Do Most Apartments Have Carpet?\n- How Much Does It Cost to Clean an Apartment?\n- What Time is Okay to Vacuum in an Apartment?\n- How Much Does it Cost to Furnish an Apartment?\n- How Much Does it Cost to Renovate an Apartment?\n- How Much Does it Cost to Turn a Basement into an Apartment?\n- How Much does it Cost to Paint a Small Apartment?\n- Can Apartment Landlord Charge for Carpet Replacement?","Making Metal Production Greener\nJohn visits a small German town where SMS Group services the global steel and metals industry with innovative production technology and processes that contribute to circular economies, and significantly reduce CO2 emissions.\nFeaturing: SMS Group\nDisposable, Sustainable Food Packaging\nJohn travels to Baltimore, Maryland to find out how AmerCareRoyal, a global resource for more than 6,000 disposable products used by the food service industry, makes degradable, easily recyclable packaging.\nThe company’s PrimeWare products are made from sugar cane, corn, and bamboo fiber.

{"question":"How can contact centers improve their quality monitoring processes, and what organizational roles are responsible for implementing these improvements?","answer":"Contact centers can improve quality monitoring by analyzing repeat contacts, using speech analytics to identify specific issues in call recordings, and leveraging wallboards for real-time statistics and supervision. Instead of random call selection, quality monitoring systems can pinpoint calls requiring attention. Business leaders are responsible for creating the strategic plans, while process owners design the monitoring processes and establish KPIs. Operational managers then implement these processes by supervising agents, providing feedback, and analyzing performance data.

The responsibilities of each of these roles are unique, but work together as a system. Some employees in an organization may perform as many as all four of these roles over the course of a day, week, month, or year. Now let’s have a look at each role in detail.\n1. Business leaders\nBusiness leaders have responsibility for creating the business plans (including strategic plans created during the strategic planning process) and associated resourcing plans necessary to cause the organization to be successful.\nSenior leaders (corporate) have the duty of defining the customer and business objectives which an organization needs to achieve in order to be successful. This process includes overseeing the development of the organization’s mission, vision (goal), and values.\nLower leader-levels (business unit and functional) get the task of translating senior leaders’ business objectives into business objectives that make sense for their level and that support the accomplishment of the senior leaders’ business objectives.\nThe responsibilities of the business leaders follow the PDCA (plan, do, check, and act) cycle.\nPlan: The business leaders create and own the business performance objectives of the organization. Senior leaders need to first understand the requirements of their customers, stockholders, workforce, suppliers, and communities. They need to understand their competition. They need to understand the environmental, economic, technological, social, legal, and political environments that they do business within. Senior leaders need to consider all of these elements as they design a Business model and business Strategy map that will meet the customer and business requirements. Business Leaders then translate these requirements and business environment issues into business performance objectives. Business Leaders then create business plans and associated resourcing plans that will cause the organization to achieve these business objectives. The Business Leaders establish business performance metrics to measure the business’s capability to meet these business objectives. Many organizations create a Balanced scorecard to organize and communicate business performance metrics.\nDo: The business leaders are responsible for communicating to the organization their business plans. As the organization conducts business, the Business Leaders are responsible to build bridges and remove barriers that will allow the business performance objectives to be met. The business performance metric data is produced and collected as business is performed by the organization.\nCheck: The business leaders periodically analyze the business performance data and use it to visualize the business’s capability to meet business objectives over time (performance trends), compare actual performance against performance targets, and identify performance issues.\nAct: The business leaders are responsible to create improvement actions to address the performance issues that are identified during their analysis of the business performance data. These improvement actions are created to ensure the organization is able to achieve their business plans.\n2. Process owner\nThe process owner is the person who is responsible for designing the processes necessary to achieve the objectives of the business plans that are created by the Business Leaders. The process owner is responsible for the creation, update and approval of documents (procedures, work instructions/protocols) to support the process. Many process owners are supported by a process improvement team. The process owner uses this team as a mechanism to help create a high performance process. The process owner is the only person who has authority to make changes in the process and manages the entire process improvement cycle to ensure performance effectiveness. This person is the contact person for all information related to the process.\nThe responsibilities of the process owner follow the PDCA (plan, do, check, and act) cycle.\nPlan: The process owners create and own the process performance objectives of the organization. The process owner first needs to understand the external and internal customer requirements for the process. This person uses the business plans as a source to help understand the long term and short term customer and business requirements. This person then translates these requirements into process performance objectives and establishes product (includes service) specifications. This person establishes process performance metrics to measure the process’s capability to meet the product specifications and overall process objectives. The set of metrics that are to be reviewed by operational managers and process operators are called key performance indicators (KPIs). The process owner then designs process steps to describe work that when performed will have the capability to produce products that meets the customer and business requirements.\nDo: The process owner is responsible to communicate to the operational managers the details of the processes that the operational managers are responsible to execute. As the operational managers and process operators perform the processes, the process owner is responsible to build bridges and remove barriers that will allow the process performance objectives to be met. The process performance metric data is produced and collected as the process is performed by process operators. The process owner is continually involved with the operational managers and process operators as they use KAIZEN™ to continually improve the process as they are performing the work.\nCheck: The Process Owner periodically analyzes the process performance data and uses it to visualize the process’s capability to operate within control limits over time (performance trends), compare actual performance against performance targets, and identify performance issues.\nAct: The Process Owner is responsible for creating improvement actions that address performance issues that are identified during their analysis of the process performance data. Improvement actions may include the initiation of Lean projects to reduce waste from the process or include the initiation of Six Sigma projects to reduce variation in the process. Improvement actions may include the use of problem solving tools that would include risk assessment and root cause analysis. Risk assessment is used to identify and reduce, eliminate, or mitigate risk within the process. This is the proactive approach to avoid problems being created from the process. Root-cause analysis is the reactive way to respond to problems that occur from the process. Root-cause analysis is used to identify the causes of problems within the process and identify and implement improvement actions that will ensure these problems do not occur again.\n3. Operational manager\nThe operational Manager is responsible to bring the resources and processes together to achieve the objectives of the business plans that are created by the business leaders.\nThe responsibilities of the operational manager follow the PDCA (plan, do, check, and act) cycle.\nPlan: The operational managers – in collaboration with each Process Operator, create Process Operator performance objectives for the employees they supervise. The Operational Manager needs to understand the performance requirements of the process. They match employees (Process Operators) with the competency and skill requirements of the process to be performed. They ensure that the Process Operators have the budget, facilities, and technology available to them that is necessary to achieve the performance objectives of the processes.\nDo: The operational manager is responsible to teach process operators how to perform the processes (work). Process Operator instruction usually consists of classroom and on-the-job training. The Operational Manager oversees the work and ensures Process Operators receive ongoing informal feedback as to their performance. As the Process Operators perform the processes, the Operational Managers are responsible to build bridges and remove barriers that will allow the process and Process Operator performance objectives to be met. Process and Process Operator performance metric data is produced and collected as the process is performed. The Operational Manager ensures that Process Operators are using KAIZEN™ to continually improve the process as they are performing the work.\nCheck: The operational manager periodically analyzes the key performance indicators (KPIs) during the production cycle to evaluate the work group’s ability to achieve the process and process operator performance objectives. This data is used to visualize the process and process operator capability to meet business plan objectives over time (performance trends), compare actual performance against performance targets, and identify performance issues. They review this performance data and sort out process operator performance issues from process performance issues. Many organizations use a war room concept to post performance data. Within the war room, the operational manager conducts periodic review and analysis of this performance data.\nAct: The operational manager is responsible to create improvement actions to address the performance issues that are identified during their analysis of the process and Process Operator performance data. They address Process Operator performance with ongoing feedback to the Process Operator and/or by using an employee performance management review process. They communicate process performance issues to the Process Operator(s) and the Process Owner.\n4. Process operator\nThe process operator is responsible to learn and perform the processes (work) necessary to achieve the objectives of the business plans that are created by Business Leaders.\nThe responsibilities of the process operator follow the PDCA (plan, do, check, and act) cycle.\nPlan: The process operators – in collaboration with their Operational Manager, create and own their performance objectives. Process Operators are responsible to understand the performance objectives of the process they are to perform and the specifications of the product they are to produce.\nDo: Process operators are responsible to learn the processes (work) that they are to perform. They ensure the processes are performed to meet the process performance objectives and produce product that meets specification. As the Process Operators perform the processes, they are responsible to communicate to their Operational Manager (supervisor) the bridges that need to be built and the barriers that need to be removed to allow the process and Process Operator performance objectives to be met. Process and Process Operator performance metric data is produced and collected as the process is performed.\nCheck: The process operator periodically reviews the Key performance indicators (KPI’s). The Process Operator makes adjustments to their work based on their actual performance compared to KPI targets. The Process Operator is responsible for identifying and reporting any performance issues and stopping production if necessary.\nAct: Process operators practice KAIZEN™ to continually challenge the process and communicate improvement suggestions to their operational manager (supervisor).\nProcesses need to align to business goals. An organization’s strategic goals should provide the key direction for any Business Process Improvement exercise. This alignment can be brought about by integrating programs like Balanced Scorecard to the BPI initiative. E.g. when deploying Kaizen, Six Sigma, identification of projects can be done on the basis of how they fit into the Balanced Scorecard agenda of the organization.\nCustomer focus Fast-changing customer needs underscore the importance of aligning business processes to achieve higher customer satisfaction. It is imperative in any BPI exercise that the “Voice of Customer” be known, and factored in, when reviewing or redesigning any process.\nImportance of benchmarks BPI tools place a lot of emphasis on “measurable results”. Accordingly, benchmarks assume an important role in any BPI initiative. Depending on the lifecycle of the process in question, benchmarks may be internal (within the organization), external (from other competing / noncompeting organizations) or dictated by the senior management of the organization as an aspirational target.\nEstablish process owners for any process to be controllable, it is essential that there be clarity on who is the process owner, and what constitutes success/failure of the process. These success/failure levels also help establish “control limits” for the process, and provide a healthy check on whether or not a process is meeting the desired customer objectives."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:2b228fc6-9038-45e7-b48b-e5a649716e10>","<urn:uuid:fae4bf1c-9efd-417e-bbcd-e78f7e0703a0>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What causes flamingos to appear in Siberia, and how do their migration patterns differ from other animals' adaptations to seasonal changes?","answer":"Flamingos appear in Siberia due to a phenomenon called 'reverse migration,' where birds fly exactly opposite to their intended direction. Normally, flamingos from Kazakhstan migrate south to Iran in November, but some birds get their internal navigation confused and fly north to Siberia instead. This differs from typical animal adaptations to seasonal changes, where animals like Siberian cranes and Arctic terns deliberately migrate thousands of kilometers to warmer places during cold months to find food, shelter, and breeding grounds, returning when winter ends. Some animals alternatively adapt to cold seasons through hibernation, like lizards, bears, snakes, and dormouse, who sleep for several months during winter to protect themselves from extreme weather.","context":["Posted by: Loren Coleman on March 7th, 2011\nThe flamingo in the Muravyev’s apartment. Credit: spb.kp.ru\nFlamingos have fallen from the sky in Siberia. It was discussed on NPR’s Morning Edition today. Push the “listen” button on this page to hear the story, but below is part of the transcript of this news.\nWe’re in Siberia, shivering. It’s November, November 11, 2003, and two boys, Kolya and Maksim Muravyev, are ice fishing along the Lena River, where it’s 13 below zero. All of a sudden, up in the sky, they see what looks like a flamingo. “We thought it was a swan or a stork,” Kolya says, a flamingo being so preposterously improbable.\nIt was large, and made ever lower circles in the sky. It seemed to be losing energy until finally it fell and lay quietly on the snow. The two boys ran over, called their father, Vasily, who picked up the bird and took it home. It was still alive. “[This is the ] first time I see a bird like this,” he told a TV reporter.\nThey fed the flamingo fish and buckwheat saturated in water (not normally flamingo food) and pretty soon it was up, active and knocking around the Muravyev’s apartment. Here it is, head in a feeding bucket.\nThe Muravyevs have a dog. Dogs and flamingos don’t cohabit easily in living rooms, so the flamingo was eventually moved to a local greenhouse and then to the zoo in nearby Krasnoyarsk.\nThat should be the end of the story. Except that one year later, also in November and also in Siberia, it happened again. Another flamingo flew out of the sky, landed by another Siberian river, was also brought to the greenhouse, then sent to the zoo and the locals began to wonder, “Where are these birds coming from? What are they doing here?”\nThis tale appears in Ian Frazier’s new and wonderful travelogue, Travels in Siberia and when I read it, I called up my buddy (and sleuth-on-tap) Ezra Block and said, “Let’s see if we can solve this puzzle.”\nFlamingos Aren’t Always Warm\nEzra checked and discovered that while we normally associate flamingos with tropical lagoons, they are not always warm weather birds. Marita Davison, who studies flamingos at Cornell University, says she regularly sees Bolivian flamingos up in the Andes Mountains. And at that high up — 16,000 feet — the lakes freeze around their feet. She sent us this video of flamingos stuck in ice. There are two on the right trying to get free.\n“It’s really an amazing sight to see,” she told us. “They’ll just wait for it to thaw and then go on [with] their business.” So, we asked her, were you surprised to hear about flamingos in Siberia?\nShe was. First of all, Siberia in November is much colder than Bolivia. Then she pointed out, flamingos are social animals. They always travel in flocks. To have two single flamingos drop from the sky suggests that there were more flamingos up there, that the two who fell were part of larger groups. (Meaning, there could be flocks of Siberian flamingos flying over Siberia! )\nWhere did they come from? There are Asian flamingos. The nearest live and nest in Kazakhstan, so perhaps those birds came from there. It’s a long way, as you see here:\nA map of flamingo sightings in Kazakhstan and Siberia.\nSo what brought them so far north and east? Davison isn’t sure, but she has a notion. We were checking the library, she discovered that 100 years ago scientists also reported multiple sightings of flamingos, again deep in Siberia, and again it was November.\nNovember is the month when flamingos normally fly south from their nests in Kazakhstan to Iran. So, she thought, maybe this is an example of “reverse migration,” a behavior known in migrating birds but not – thus far — in flamingos.\nHere’s the idea. Suppose a bird is wired to fly one direction every fall and for some reason the wiring screws up so the animal goes 180 degrees the wrong way, exactly the opposite direction. This happens to a few birds in migrant populations every year. When she looked on a map, she noticed that the village of Vernemarkovo in Siberia, where the first bird landed, was roughly the opposite distance and the opposite direction from the flamingo’s normal winter quarters in Iran.\nSo maybe what happened is a bunch of birds in 2003 and 2004 got turned around on their way to Iran, and flew exactly where they didn’t want to go. By this logic, they weren’t the first flamingos in Siberia and they won’t be the last.\nSo this may not be a global warming story or a one-in-a-billion story or a winter miracle. It may be just a statistically predictable case of faulty wiring that brightened up the winter for two sets of boys in Siberia.\nAs for the birds, they got names: Phila and Phima, and a warm place to live at the Krasnayarsk Zoo, which they shared with a bunch of (imported) zoo flamingos. Until one of them got sick. We called the zoo and a spokesman told us that one of the birds died “after a long illness”. One imagines the surviving flamingo quietly dreaming of warm nights in Persia, sipping pond-scum, their favorite food. The flamingos we know don’t care much for borscht. Source.\nIan Frasier, while researching his “Travels in Siberia” (2010, Farrar, Strauss and Giroux) recorded an interview with Marina Tabakova, who took care of both flamingos at the Winter Garden in Severobaikalsk in Siberia. He generously allowed NPR to use his recordings.\nLoren Coleman is one of the world’s leading cryptozoologists, some say “the” leading living cryptozoologist. Certainly, he is acknowledged as the current living American researcher and writer who has most popularized cryptozoology in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Starting his fieldwork and investigations in 1960, after traveling and trekking extensively in pursuit of cryptozoological mysteries, Coleman began writing to share his experiences in 1969. An honorary member of Ivan T. Sanderson’s Society for the Investigation of the Unexplained in the 1970s, Coleman has been bestowed with similar honorary memberships of the North Idaho College Cryptozoology Club in 1983, and in subsequent years, that of the British Columbia Scientific Cryptozoology Club, CryptoSafari International, and other international organizations. He was also a Life Member and Benefactor of the International Society of Cryptozoology (now-defunct). Loren Coleman’s daily blog, as a member of the Cryptomundo Team, served as an ongoing avenue of communication for the ever-growing body of cryptozoo news from 2005 through 2013. He returned as an infrequent contributor beginning Halloween week of 2015. Coleman is the founder in 2003, and current director of the International Cryptozoology Museum in Portland, Maine.","We find animals everywhere-in the deepest oceans,the hottest deserts and even in very cold places like the mountains or the articles. The surroundings is which an animal lives are called its habitat.The ability to adjust the once surroundings is called adaption. Like plants,animals also need a habitat that that must meet their basic needs of food ,shelter,water and proper temperature. An animal may die if its habitat changes and a new place does not provide for its basic needs.\nHabitat of animals\nAnimals adapt to the environment or their habitat in order to survive. The earth has many places such as the Cold Mountains, Thick forest, salty oceans, etc. These serve as habitats for different animals.\nObserve these pictures to identify the habitat.\nFrom these pictures you can see that we can classify animals according to their habitats they live in, such as terrestrial animals, aquatic animals, arboreal animals, aerial animals, etc.let us learn more about adapation in these animals.\nAdapation in Terrestrial Animals\nTerrestrial animals like the lion,cow and deer live on land. They breathe through their lungs.They have sense organs and well developed nervous system. They have strong muscular legs to walk and run fast in order to escape from animals trying to attack them.\nAnimals like polar bears,which live in very cold regions have thick fur to protect then from the cold. a thick fur of the fat under their skin keeps them warm and also helps them get through the winters when they do not find food .\nSome animals like lizards, bears, snakes and dormouse sleep for several months in winters when it becomes very cold. this long winter sleep is called hibernation.they do this to protect themselves from the extreme weather.\nSnake in hibernation\nanimals like camels, which live in hot deserts have thick skins that protect them from the sun. They store fat in their hump abd water in their stomach, they have the ability to minimize their water loss. They have three eyelids. two of the eyelids have long eyelashes that prevent sand from getting into heir eyes. The third eyelid allows the camels to see even when it is closed. This adaption is helpful during desert storms. all these adaptions help the camel to survive in the desert.\nAdaptation in Aquatic Animals\nAquatic animals live in water. Different types of fish, crabs, whales, dolphins and seals are examples of aqatic animals. These animals have specific adaptions which help them to survive in their habitat.\nFish breathe with the help of gills and move with the help of fins. The stream-lined shape of their bodies help the fish to cut through the water and swim fast. The hard skin and scales on their body prevent water from entering into it.\nWater birds like herons have long legs which allow them to stand and walk in water. They also have a long pointed beak to catch their food with. Ducks have webbed feet that help them to swim.\nWhales and dolphins are mammals that live in water. They breathe with the help of their lungs. They, therefore, keep coming up to the surface of water to inhale air.\nAdapatation in Amphibians\nSome animals like frogs, toads and salamanders are adapted to live both on land and in water. Such animals are called amphibans. They breathe with the help of their lungs when on land and through their soft skin when in water. They have legs that help them to walk on land and swim in water.\nAdapation in Arboreal Animals\nArboreal animals like monkeys, squirrels and lizards spend most of their time on trees. They have strong arms and legs with well-developed claws to climb trees and cling to the branches. The long mascular tail of a monkey helps it to swing from one branch to the other. Some animals like lizards have plates which do not let them slip and also protect their bodies from getting hurt.\nAdapation in Aerial Animals\nAerial animals like birds and insects are able to fly and spend much if their time in the air with the helpof their wings. The body of the bird is covered with feathers. Their bones are light and hollow, which make it easy for them to fly.their streamlined body helps them to cut through the air easily. Insects have light bones and wings which help them to fly.\nSome birds like the Siberian crane and the atctic tern, which live in very cold places, cannot survive the cold winter in these places. Therefore, to escape the cold months, they fly thousands of kilometres to warmer places to find food, shelter and also to breed. They go back to their old when the winter end. This mass movement of birds from colder regions to warmer places every year is called migration.\nSiberian cranes migrating"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:2e1bcd21-a778-48df-8bc0-ad33d581dc9b>","<urn:uuid:e651d7bf-13cd-4369-8179-6b086ee00985>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Could you explain the key differences between hospice care and home healthcare services in terms of their primary goals and type of support provided?","answer":"Hospice care and home healthcare have different primary goals and support types. Hospice focuses on providing comfort care and support to patients with life-limiting illnesses when life expectancy is measured in months, not years. It includes palliative care, pain management, and emotional/spiritual support through medical staff, social workers, and chaplains. In contrast, home healthcare is primarily focused on recovery and rehabilitation, typically following surgery, accidents, or illnesses. It provides skilled care like physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, and wound care, with the goal of helping patients resume normal function. While hospice is comfort-oriented rather than cure-oriented, home healthcare is part of a treatment plan aimed at recovery and improvement of function.","context":["The subject of Hospice came up at a recent support group meeting and I thought I would expound a little further here in the newsletter.\nHospice is a specialized program that provides care and support to patients (and their families) as they enter the advanced stages of a life limiting illness. Many people think of hospice as a program for people dying of cancer, but in fact, hospice can provide care for people with any number of terminal conditions, including Alzheimer’s disease and dementia, stroke, kidney disease, pulmonary disease, and many more. The goal of hospice treatment is comfort as opposed to cure. And that treatment could be available to you in your home, in an assisted living or nursing home, or at a specialized Hospice care center, like Kline Hospice House in Frederick.\nWhy choose hospice? The medical staff from hospice are specially trained in palliative (comfort) care and pain management…meaning they know a whole lot about how to keep people comfortable in their final months of life. Remember that your regular doctor has been trained to diagnose and cure and might not be a specialist in what to do when there is no cure. The hospice staff do, and they will work closely with your doctor to help get you or your loved one the medicines or treatments that might make you most comfortable. In addition to medical staff like doctors and nurses, hospice also has incredible social workers and chaplains who can spend time with you and your loved one to process the changes that are taking place, prepare for the future, and make peace with the past. Hospice may include nursing aides to help with personal care or volunteers to provide a hand to hold or an ear to listen. In my own experience, one of the most wonderful things that hospice provided was a knowledgeable caring voice at the other end of the phone in the middle of the night. Hospice is knowing that you aren’t alone, and that you can get through this very difficult time. Hospice is also there after, continuing with that special support and care to the family.\nWhen do you know it is time to consider hospice…when life expectancy becomes measured in months and not years. Obviously no one has a crystal ball to predict, so talk to your doctor, visit the hospice website (http://www.hospiceoffrederick.org/) or call their information line and ask questions (240-566-3030). Look sooner rather than later, before a crisis occurs. It may not be time yet, but when it is time, you’ll be ready. You will have had your questions answered, and will hopefully have had the time to prepare yourself to enter in to this final part of the journey of life.\nWell, none of us is ever really prepared, but with the support of the hospice team, you’ll be a little stronger, a little more ready. Of course, you have our support too. Please call us if you have any questions or would like more information.\nChristina Forbes, LGSW from the Daybreak Newsletter 6/2011","Home Healthcare Agencies\nHome healthcare, or skilled care you receive at home, is a continuation of care your loved one might have received or needed in an inpatient care placement. This kind of care may be called senior home healthcare or elderly home healthcare.\nThese services may be part of a doctor’s treatment plan for your loved one, so they can be at home and still receive rehabilitation, recovery or other clinical healthcare. The doctor may recommend occupational or physical therapy, speech therapy, wound care, staff to provide medications or injections, and staff to monitor recovery while remaining at home.\nThis arrangement, as ordered by a doctor, is likely temporary as the patient may resume normal function and can handle household duties and functions after recovery. In some instances, caregivers decide to continue the skilled home healthcare after the physician’s order has ended, with the understanding that coverage for that benefit may change at that point.\nYou will have some ability to negotiate when care providers come to your home, depending on what kind of care the doctor has recommended. For example, a doctor may recommend that a physical therapist come to your home three times a week to work with your loved one. Your family will be able to work with the provider to find the times of day that work best for everyone. Since these services are part of a treatment plan, Medicare or insurance often covers the cost of home health care.\nSenior home healthcare can benefit family caregivers, too. Having skilled healthcare personnel monitoring and helping care for your loved one can reduce your worry, and also relieve you of some caregiving activities you may be unable to provide. In some cases, you may find senior home healthcare services that offer additional staff who can also provide you with respite so you can care for yourself or take care of chores needed to keep your household running.\nServices and Care Provided\nHome health agencies have to be certified or licensed in compliance with state and local standards. In order to receive Medicaid or Medicare, they also have to meet certain standards set out by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). That means that the skilled nursing and other healthcare services your agency provides must be overseen by a team that includes a physician and appropriately qualified nurses, even though your family might not work directly with those medical administrators. They make sure that the home healthcare agency or group can provide a range of services, listed below.\nWhat Certified Nursing Aides Do\nAlso known as: CNA, home health aide or certified nursing assistant\nA certified nurse aide is a caregiver who will come to your home to provide medical care. Home health aides and CNAs may also help with other day-to-day care needs, such as bathing, dressing, light housekeeping, or meal preparation.\nGenerally, home health aides and certified nurse aides have undergone formal training and certification. They can administer medications, and many have received special training to change simple dressings, give massages, and assist with braces and mobility devices.\nSome are also trained to operate and troubleshoot medical equipment, such as home oxygen or ventilators. Training and certification requirements for this type of caregiver vary by state, so be sure to ask about each caregiver’s unique qualifications. You should expect any home health worker to be supervised by a nurse and to provide care as outlined in your loved one’s home healthcare plan.\nWhat Physical Therapists and Occupational Therapists Do\nAfter a stroke, fall, broken bone, or serious illness, your loved one will likely need help with movement and muscle strength. Your home healthcare agency may send a physical therapist or occupational therapist to your home. A physical therapist can help your loved one with overall mobility: walking, getting in and out of bed, sitting, and standing.\nAn occupational therapist will help your elderly loved one with activities of daily living, such as eating, buttoning clothes, and brushing hair. These types of caregivers can also help relieve pain, improve range of motion, and build up and retain muscle performance.\nWhen a physical therapist or occupational therapist comes to your home, you can expect him to teach your loved one to do specialized exercises. Ideally, the therapist will also provide you with detailed instructions, with each step illustrated and clearly explained. Ask your therapist how frequently your loved one should do the exercises and how to be sure the exercises are being done correctly. You can also ask a physical therapist or occupational therapist to help you figure out how to make these exercises a routine part of your loved one’s daily routine.\nPhysical therapists and occupational therapists may also use massage, heat, water, passive exercise or electricity to help your loved one recover.\nWhat Speech Therapists Do\nAlso called: speech language pathologists (SLPs)\nIf your loved one’s illness or injury has affected her speech, your home health agency might send a speech therapist to your home. Speech therapists provide care to improve a loved one’s speech, language, cognition, voice, and swallowing. They may provide drills and activities to improve skills, or they may provide strengthening exercises for the muscles of the lips and tongue.\nWhat Visiting Nurses Do\nAlso called: registered nurses (RNs), licensed practical nurses (LPNs), licensed vocational nurses (LVNs) or advanced practical nurses (APNs)\nThese nurses provide skilled care, including administering medications, changing dressings, managing catheters and intravenous lines, and giving injections. You can expect a visiting nurse to evaluate your loved one, take vital signs, and write detailed notes about your loved one’s progress.\nVisiting nurses are highly trained and tend to have higher hourly rates than other types of caregivers — up to $75 per hour.\nCreating a Home Healthcare Plan\nHome healthcare agencies will assess your loved one’s specific healthcare needs and propose a healthcare plan, sometimes called a plan of care. Your loved one’s doctor will then review the healthcare plan and sign it to show approval. The healthcare plan details what type of medical care your loved one will receive, what types of workers will provide the care, how frequently they will come to your loved one’s home, and how long the care is expected to last. You should receive a written copy of the plan of care.\nDepending on how the patient’s needs progress, the home care agency may request an extension of services. They’ll send additional paperwork to the doctor for approval. And you’ll want to be sure to confirm that your loved one’s insurance will cover extended services.\nNote: It can take time for the doctor of record to approve the original healthcare plan or the extension of services. In the meantime, most experienced nurses and therapists just get started with what they think the patient needs, unless they see an area of concern. This usually works well. Be aware, though, that care providers and doctors aren’t necessarily conferring closely (or at all) about what’s happening. So don’t assume that everyone’s on the same page about what’s needed. If you have a question about any service, be sure to ask the home care agency and the doctor.\nHome Healthcare Costs and How to Pay\nIn most cases, home health care agencies are not set up to provide fee-for-service; they offer services that are reimbursed by Medicare or other insurance. If they do charge fee-for-service, Home healthcare costs range from $15 to $75 per hour, depending on the training and expertise of the specific healthcare worker who comes to your home. Nurses and physical therapists are more expensive; home health aides charge less.\nWhen your loved one is recovering from surgery, accident, or illness and home healthcare is prescribed by a doctor, it’s generally covered by Medicare. Here’s the tricky part: Medicare provides coverage for a specific ailment. Once recovery from that ailment is complete, Medicare coverage ends. And Medicare coverage also ends if your loved one ceases to make progress in recovery efforts.\nWhen home healthcare is not covered by Medicare, you can explore additional options, such as veterans benefits, Medigap, Medicaid, long-term care insurance, or private pay.\nShort-term home healthcare visits by a nurse, therapist, or certified home health aide — which typically follow a hospitalization, injury, or severe illness and are intended to help someone return to a stable condition — are usually covered by Medicare, Medicaid, the VA, and private health insurance. For home healthcare that’s not covered by any program or insurance, provided through a licensed home healthcare agency, expect the cost to run from $20 to more than $100 per hour, depending on location and the level of training of the care provider (nurse, physical therapist, or home health aide).\nNote that home healthcare is different from long-term in-home care assistance that doesn’t involve medical care. In-home nonmedical care — to help someone with things like bathing, toileting, and other activities of daily living; or for companionship, security, or household tasks — involves different costs and coverage possibilities.\nThere are many options to pay for your loved one’s home healthcare. What follows are some of the most common payment options.\nPublic Benefits for Home Healthcare\nIf your loved one is enrolled in Medicare (including a Medicare Advantage Plan or Medicaid, or in the VA healthcare system, one or all of them will pay the full cost — meaning there are no co-payments — of home healthcare as long as certain conditions are met.\nMedicare pays the full cost of covered home healthcare provided by a Medicare-certified agency if prescribed by a treating physician. A different part of Medicare might cover home healthcare in different circumstances, and depending on which part(s) your loved one is enrolled in:\n- Medicare Part A covers the care if, within the previous 30 days, your loved one has been a hospital inpatient for at least three days.\n- Medicare Part B covers the care if there’s no prior three-day hospital stay.\n- If your loved one is enrolled in a Medicare Part C Medicare Advantage plan, instead of traditional Medicare Part A and Part B, the plan will cover home healthcare regardless of a hospital stay but may require that it be provided by a provider/agency that’s a part of the plan’s network.\nMedicare coverage for home healthcare lasts only as long as the physician and home healthcare agency certify that the patient needs regular at-home medical care in order to recover from an injury, surgery, or other acute condition.\nTip: For help with any Medicare question regarding home healthcare coverage, you and your loved one can get free, expert counseling at a local office of the State Health Insurance Assistance Program (SHIP) or Health Insurance Counseling and Advocacy Program (HICAP).\nIf your loved one is enrolled in Medicaid (for people with very low income and few assets other than their home and car), it can cover the full cost of care from a Medicaid-participating home healthcare agency. For people who have both Medicare and Medicaid, the Medicaid program might cover some home healthcare after Medicare coverage stops.\nTo find out about Medicaid home healthcare coverage, contact the Medicaid agency in your state by going to the online link to state Medicaid agencies. Or contact the Area Agency on Aging for the region where your loved one lives.\nIf your loved one is a veteran, he or she might be enrolled in or eligible for Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical care, which includes home healthcare. To find out about enrolling for VA medical benefits, and how to receive home healthcare, call the VA at (877) 222-8387 or visit the healthcare pages on the VA website.\nPrivate Insurance Options\nPrivate health insurance usually provides good coverage for short-term in home nursing care, though, your loved one may have to pay a patient co-payment. This coverage includes health insurance based on current employment (the patient’s or spouse’s) or retiree health insurance. Learn more about using private insurance to help pay for home healthcare.\nOther Payment Options\nIt may happen that your loved one would like to continue home healthcare after public or private insurance will no longer cover it. If so, you may have to pay out of pocket. But there may also be care options other than agency-provided home healthcare for which your loved one is covered or that are less expensive for you to pay out of pocket. Talk to your local Agency on Aging representative to find out what kinds of low-cost or volunteer-based services exist in your community.\nHow to Choose a Home Healthcare Agency\nThe treating physician or the hospital or other facility where you or your loved one is a patient will refer you to a particular certified home health care agency. But if you know a different agency you’d prefer, or if you become dissatisfied with the agency your doctor or hospital chooses (or with the particular nurses, therapists, or home health aides the agency sends), you may be able to switch to a different agency.\nTo search for home health agencies and to see ratings and reviews of home health agencies — use Caring.com’s Home Health Agency Directory by typing in a city or zip code into the search bar at the top of this page. You can also compare information about home health agencies by using Medicare’s official online Home Health Compare tool.\nIn most cases, the doctor or hospital will make arrangements for home healthcare. If you’d like to know more about any agency, search right here in the Caring.com Home Healthcare Directory to see reviews and ratings from other families.\nIt is also possible for you to choose a home healthcare agency rather than having one assigned. If you’d like to find your own home healthcare agency, start your search below.\nYou may also consider asking family and friends for their recommendations. Word of mouth is an excellent way to find an agency, group, or individual who will fit into your daily life and provide the care your loved one needs. Bear in mind that different states have different requirements for certifications, referrals, and background checks. If it is important to you to make sure the individuals coming into your home have the appropriate certifications and a non-criminal background, be sure to ask the agency administration to provide the necessary documentation.\nTop Cities for Home Health Agencies\n- Air Mail Facility, FL\n- Akron, OH\n- Bensalem, PA\n- Bethesda, MD\n- Bristol, PA\n- Bronx, NY\n- Brooklyn, NY\n- Canton, OH\n- Cincinnati, OH\n- Dayton, OH\n- Doylestown, PA\n- Feasterville Trevose, PA\n- Floral Park, NY\n- Fort Lauderdale, FL\n- Fort Worth, TX\n- Glen Echo, MD\n- Hallandale Beach, FL\n- Hialeah, FL\n- Ivyland, PA\n- Kensington, MD\n- Mahwah, NJ\n- Miami, FL\n- New Hyde Park, NY\n- North Bethesda, MD\n- North Hills, NY\n- Oakland, NJ\n- Oradell, NJ\n- Pompano Beach, FL\n- Ramsey, NJ\n- Ridgewood, NJ\n- Rockville, MD\n- Silver Spring, MD\n- Staten Island, NY\n- Warminster, PA\n- Wayne, NJ\nHome Health Agencies by State\n- District of Columbia\n- New Hampshire\n- New Jersey\n- New Mexico\n- New York\n- North Carolina\n- North Dakota\n- Puerto Rico\n- Rhode Island\n- South Carolina\n- South Dakota\n- West Virginia"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:e74c82f2-462b-4df9-b87a-8f48ec25186c>","<urn:uuid:96aa7b4d-ee35-4033-8906-1171b92ac451>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do the traditional laboratory methods of measuring volume compare to Gabriel Mouton's metric system approach from 1670?","answer":"In laboratory settings, measuring cylinders, beakers, and displacement cans are used for volume measurement, with displacement cans utilizing Archimedes' principle of water displacement. In contrast, Mouton's metric system, proposed in 1670, established a more systematic approach where volume measurements are derived from the basic unit of length, creating related units where 1 milliliter has the same volume as 1 cubic centimeter, providing a more standardized and interconnected system of measurement.","context":["Geometry for Elementary School/Measurements\nIn this chapter, we will talk about something that may seem boring to many but is very useful: measurements. You may have learnt them in science, but here they are anyway. This chapter has no corresponding material in Euclid's Elements, and will only serve as a reference chapter.\nWhen measuring length, simply put get a ruler and place the '0' on the endpoint of the segment you wish to measure. Then move the ruler so that the edge of the ruler fits the line exactly. Read the marking on the ruler on the other endpoint. That is the length of the ruler.\nSome people use the metric system when measuring lengths. That means they use centimetres, millimetres, metres and kilometres. Others use inches, feet and yards. Most people prefer to use the metric system, although many people still use other measuring units.\nSometimes we need to measure a longer distance. Then we can use the tape measure, the trundle wheel, or the metre rule. We will not talk about them in detail here.\nSometimes we need to know the area of the figure. That has been discussed before. If you do not remember that, take a look at the chapter about plane figures. When we calculate the area of the figure, we use only one unit. Let us use centimetres as an example. If a square is 4cm long, then its area is 4cm2 which is equal to 16 squared centimetres, or cm2.\nSometimes we need to measure angles. That is, how wide an angle is open. The size of the arms is insignificant. If you remember from the chapter about angles, angles are measured in degrees. So, how can we find out the number of degrees an angle has?\nYou probably have a measuring tool called a protractor. It looks like a semi-circle with markings along the circumference. Some protractors are full circles. You can use both for measuring angles. To measure an angle, look for a tinky marking at the midpoint of the diameter of the circle. Place that on the vertex of the angle. Now let one of the arms fit the radius exactly. Read the marking on the other arm. That is the size of the angle!\nWhen dealing with reflex angles, a full circle protractor may be better for the purpose, but let's stick to using a half-circle for now. Recall that angles with the same vertice and which add up to 360° are called angles at a point. Notice that in reflex∠ABC, for example, you can also measure ∠ABC. Then you can take ∠ABC away from 360°. That is the size of reflex∠ABC.\nMeasuring volume may require more complicated apparatus than measuring angles or lengths. In the laboratory, we use measuring cylinders, but since we are not in the laboratory, we usually use beakers instead. However, sometimes we use displacement cans, which are like large beakers with an opening. We can easily find the volume by looking at the water displaced. The concept is discovered by a mathematician called Archimedes.\nWhen measuring volume, we can use the units cm3 and m3. For example, if a book is 10cm long, 5cm wide and 1cm thick, its volume would be 50cm3.\nA related concept is capacity. Capacity is the amount of liquid that a container can hold. We can use the units, litres and millilitres. For example, a box of vita-soy milk contains about 250 millilitres of soy milk.","Think in Tens!\nCan you count to 10? We have 10 fingers…and 10 toes. The metric system is based on the powers of 10. If you can count to 10, you can know the metric system of measurement. 95% of the world’s population uses the metric system and so can you! Gabriel Mouton, from Lyons, France, is considered the “founding father” of the metric system. First proposed in 1670, the Metric System is derived from the natural systems of our earth. A portion of the Earth’s circumference, or “one ten-millionth the distance from the equator to the North Pole, originally determined the unit of length, a meter. Currently, the length of one meter is defined as 1⁄299,792,458th of a light second. The metric system uses powers of ten prefixes that are comparable to the decimal system of numbers. The most common prefixes for values above the base unit are hecto- (hundred), kilo- (thousand) and mega- (million); and the most commonly used for parts below the base value are deci- (tenth), centi- (hundredth) and milli- (thousandth).\nSimply shifting the decimal point performs calculations for the metric system. Just like scientists around the world, you will find the metric system easy to use and apply! Think in tens!\nTen and powers of ten have never been so important!\nActivity 1 Metric Measure\nThink in tens! Measure in the Metric system. Remember the activities you did in the Measure Journey? Take a second look at your room. This time estimate the length of your room in meters. Using a meter stick or metric tape measure, record the length and width of your room. Look at how long a meter is and think about how many of them (and portions of a meter) stretch across your room. Record your estimate and your answer. Repeat your experiment in other rooms and compare your findings to your answers in the Measure Journey. Were you able to improve your accuracy? Next, try and estimate other metric units: check the length of the table in front of you. Which unit should you use - meter, centimeter or millimeter? Which will do the best job? Measure with a ruler to see how close you came to your guess. Thoughtful practice will improve your understanding of the Metric system. You will find that your guesses will be more accurate once you begin to think in Metric!\nActivity 2 Metric Modules\nMetrics, as a system of measurement, applies to quantities of just about everything we use. Metric and English systems for properties such as mass, length, volume, and temperature differ. Internationally, the metric system is the standard, but the United States still uses the English system. Converting to metric is easy once you know the basic terms, and principles:\nBasic units of Metric Measurement\nmeter - distance\nkilogram - mass\nsecond - time\nampere - electric current\nkelvin - temperature\nmole - amount of substance\ncandela - intensity of light\nMake flash cards and match units of mass, distance, time, current and temperature between the United System and the Metric System. Memorize metric units of measurement!\nActivity 3 Metric volumes\nMeasurements of capacity or volume (liter) and mass or weight (gram) are derived from the relationship of water to the meter: 1 milliliter of water = 1 gram = 1 centimeter. Find an old plastic bottle and fill it about half full with water. Then, carefully pour about 50 ml (milliliter) of water in at a time, making a measurement mark on the bottle each time. Each mark then represents 50 ml. Next, fill the bottle with water until it is right on one of your marks. Then, take a block of clay and form it into a cube that is 5 cm (centimeter) square on all sides.Now, place your cube in the bottle of water, pay attention to how much the water rises. Does it rise 125 ml like it is supposed to? (Remember that your cube is 5 cm x 5 cm x 5 cm cubed, hence 125 cm3) If it doesn't rise 125 ml, ask yourself why. Is your cube exactly 5 x 5 x 5? Maybe your 50 ml marks are not exactly right. Compare your answers with your friends and try your measuring skills again. Try another size, 4 cm x 4 cm x 6 cm. How many ml will make the water rise? Next, collect some coins from around the house. Measure how much area they take up by placing them in your measuring bottle.\nActivity 4 International Metrics\nScientists across the globe are using the metric system to measure our world! Gabriel Mouton, from Lyons, France, is considered the founding father of the metric system. First proposed in 1670, units of the Metric System are derived from the natural systems of our earth. The unit of length is determined by a portion of the Earth's circumference. Measures for capacity (volume) and mass are derived from that original unit of length. Each of the basic units of the Metric system relate to each other and to nature: 1 ml. (milliliter) has the same volume as 1 cubic centimeter, 1 ml. of water has a mass of about one gram and 1 L (liter) of water has a mass of about 1 kg. Larger and smaller multiples of each unit are created by multiplying or dividing the basic units by 10 and its powers. Calculations can be performed simply by shifting the decimal point. Just like scientists around the world, you will find that the Metric system is easy to use and apply!\nMetric units of measure are commonly referred to as the International System of Units or SI. A series of base units define each measurement in an absolute way without directly referring to any other unit.\nActivity 5 English to Metric\nCreate a window to measure the World! Build a metric conversion card. First, take three pieces of heavy construction paper about 7 in by 10 in. Cut one of the sheets a little longer than it is wide, cut the other two the same size slightly wider and a little shorter than the first. Make four columns on the first piece of paper, one each for length, volume, weight and temperature. Use this metric conversion table as a guide. Copy the English-to-Metric version on one side and the Metric-to-English version on the other side. While you are copying the table, do you notice any patterns forming? The relationships between English and Metric measurements are always the same.\nNext, cut four windows, the size of one conversion set, into each of the two wider pieces of paper; then, glue or tape them together to make a cover for your chart. Finally, slide your table chart in between the cover and decorate the outside. Design a colorful cover. Be sure to label each window with the correct abbreviation. Check the Metric Patrol link to be certain.

{"question":"Do lawn clippings and earthworm activity have different effects on thatch development?","answer":"Yes, lawn clippings and earthworm activity have opposite effects on thatch development. Lawn clippings do NOT cause thatch buildup because they are high in water content and decompose rapidly, actually recycling nutrients back into the lawn. On the other hand, earthworms actively reduce thatch through their natural activity of constantly mixing organic matter on the surface into the soil, making them beneficial for thatch management.","context":["Nothing seems to take homeowners more time, or generate more frustration, than maintaining their lawns. In addition to mowing, fertilizing, and applying pesticides for weeds, insects, and diseases, gardeners fret about removing thatch and aerating the soil. Commercial interests have taken note and pedal various “aerifying” products like soap (cunningly described in non-soap terminology), spiked sandals, and thatching rakes. Previous posts (here and here) have addressed ways to decrease fertilizer and pesticide use. This post will look at the science behind aeration of home lawns.\nFirst, let’s acknowledge that most research has focused on maintaining turf on golf courses and playing fields. Neither of these are good models for home lawn management because home lawns have different functions. The turf that one might find on a putting green, for instance, is devoid of most life except for closely mown monocultural (or oligocultural) grasses. The management of these grasses is chemically and physically intensive to preserve a completely unnatural system. Yet these management techniques, including core aeration and vertical mowing (aka verticutting), have seeped into the lucrative home lawn maintenance market, especially to address the dreaded thatch layer common in many home lawns.\nWhat is thatch?\nBriefly, thatch is caused by organic material accumulating at the base of grass plants. (It is NOT caused by lawn clippings, which are small and nitrogen rich – they are broken down quickly.) Accumulation of thatch is said to lessen lawn resilience and increase disease, but this appears to be a classic CCC (correlation conflated to causation) error. I’ve seen nothing in the literature to suggest that thatch causes these problems. Instead, I see evidence that thatch is yet one more negative result of poor lawn management. Removing thatch, without addressing the CAUSE of thatch, is an exercise in futility.\nLawn with thatch layer Natural grassland\nLook at these two images of grass-covered soil: one is a typical lawn, and the other is a natural grassland. There are no roots extending below the “thatch” layer in the lawn, while grassland soils support deep and extensive root systems. The problem with the lawn is that the system is not well aerated, meaning that the grass roots are shallow and contribute to the buildup of thatch. Lack of aeration also inhibits a robust community of microbes, which are necessary to decompose the organic material that makes up thatch.\nSo, lack of poor oxygen and water movement between the grass layer and the underlying soil creates a dead zone in that soil, with life restricted to those few inches of soil where oxygen and water can penetrate. Thatch accumulates and underlying roots from nearby trees and shrubs are forced upwards into the lawn to obtain water and oxygen. This is where lawn maintenance companies promise to fix the problem through core aeration or verticutting.\nIt’s not goose poop. It’s core aeration. Vertical mowers look impressive but do they work?\nDoes core aeration and verticutting improve home lawns?\nWhile there is scant research on home lawns, the results are fairly uniform: core aeration does not reduce thatch accumulation and does not improve grass coverage. Verticutting can decrease thatch slightly but decreases grass coverage and reduces turf quality. Several quotes from published research stand out:\n- “All cultivation practices [which included core aeration and verticutting] resulted in some quality loss at various times during the spring transition period compared to the control.”\n- “Thus, under homelawn conditions, core aeration and vertical mowing should only be used if a specific problem exists and not as routine practices to prevent thatch accumulation.”\n- “After two years, no treatments consistently reduced thatch accumulation compared to the non-cultivated control.”\nThere is no published research, anywhere, that supports these techniques in maintaining healthy home lawns. So, it’s time to stop using these heavily promoted products and practices and instead focus on why lawns accumulate thatch in the first place.\nIt’s all about the oxygen!\nThere’s no question that lawns can be heavily compacted, but it’s not because grasses can’t tolerate foot traffic. Think about those hundreds of thousands of bison that use to roam the Great Plains grasslands. Even modern cattle ranching, done sustainably, does not damage pastureland by compacting the soil. There’s something else going on in home lawns that creates compacted conditions and the cascade of negative effects that follow; it’s improper soil preparation and management.\nWhen sod is laid for home lawns, several inches of compost are tilled into the soil bed. The tilled soil is then flattened with a roller, and then a layer of sand is applied. Then the sod (which consists of grass and growing media and a mat of some sort) is arranged. And voilà! You have a turfed landscape that more closely resembles a five-layer dessert than a functional grassland. Those layered materials restrict the movement of water and oxygen, and this restricts root growth into the underlying native soil. Not only do these barriers create a shallowly-rooted turf, they compound the problem by stimulating ethylene gas production in grass, further inhibiting root growth. To top it off, the anaerobic conditions in the lower layers restrict microbial decomposition. As decomposition and root growth slow, thatch accumulates. And homeowners despair.\nSo, thatch serves as a warning sign that soil conditions are poor – and any attempts to permanently remove thatch without addressing poor soil preparation and management are going to fail. Possible corrective actions to improve soil structure and function are beyond the scope of this column; over the years we’ve had blog posts touching on this topic and I encourage readers to explore our blog archives.\nSod layers Jello layers","Mechanical dethatching (power raking or vertical mowing) removes excess\nthatch buildup. However, it doesn't fix the reasons your lawn produces\ntoo much thatch.\nUsing a power rake to control thatch\nThatch is an interwoven layer of decomposing grass roots, shoots and leaves that forms between the soil surface and the green top growth in established lawns. As grass sheds old roots, shoots and leaves it builds up faster than it rots...making a thatch layer.\nA thatch layer is normal and can be beneficial or harmful...depending upon the amount present.

If the thatch layer exceeds 1/2 inch, you should consider dethatching.\nA thatch layer greater than 1/2 inch thick makes watering\ndifficult, since thatch dries out quickly and is difficult to re-wet.\nAs it builds up, grass roots and crowns grow into the thatch layer\nmaking your lawn susceptible to heat, cold and drought stress.\nThatch build-up varies among lawns. Some lawns never develop a thatch problem, while others become thatch-bound within a few years. Generally, the more aggressively grass is growing, the faster it will develop a thatch layer. Build-up happens when growth exceeds rate of decomposition.\nAggressively spreading species such as bermudagrass and Kentucky bluegrass are heavy thatch builders. Tall fescue and perennial ryegrass have a low tendency for producing thatch.\nSlower growers like zoysiagrass and fine fescues can form a dense thatch layer because their fibrous tissues resist decay.\nCultural practices can have a big impact on thatch.\nOver watering and over fertilizing contribute to thatch buildup because they cause your lawn to grow excessively fast.

Pesticides should only be used after you have identified the cause of the problem and have determined it is necessary.\nAerating with a core aerator promotes better air, water and nutrient movement into the soil. It also brings soil to the surface mixing into the thatch layer. This stimulates microbial activity speeding up thatch decomposition.\nTop-dressing with a thin layer (1/8 to 1/4 inch) of compost adds organic matter full of microorganisms.\nHave your soil tested every couple years. Follow the recommendations to correct soil pH.\nIf you have a serious thatch problem, thatch can be removed with a power rake or vertical mower. These machines have steel spring-like or knife-like tines that rotate perpendicular to the ground. After mechanical dethatching, the cause should be addressed or your problem will likely return.\nMechanical dethatching is hard on lawns. It tears out grass along with the thatch. Therefore...the best time to dethatch is when conditions favor rapid recovery. Fall or early spring for cool season grasses. Late spring (after green up) or early summer for warm season grasses.\nFall is the preferred time to dethatch because few weed seeds are sprouting.

{"question":"How do the Elephant Skin Coral's feeding mechanisms compare to the feeding stages of marine ich parasites?","answer":"The Elephant Skin Coral feeds through multiple methods: it uses zooxanthellae in its body for nutrients, can absorb nutrients from water, and uses a mucous net to capture small particles. It has no discernible polyps. In contrast, marine ich parasites have a complex feeding cycle where the trophont stage feeds on fish tissue fluids while forming a cyst, then emerges as a free-living protomont that settles and divides into hundreds of infective theronts, which then seek new host fish to feed upon.","context":["Elephant Skin Coral\nCorduroy Coral, Castle Coral, Groove CoralPachyseris rugosaPhoto © Animal-World: Courtesy David Brough\nThe Elephant Skin Coral is a curious looking stony coral, with an attractive ruffled surface!\nThe Elephant Skin Coral Pachyseris rugosa gets its name from the \"wrinkled\" look of its surface that is similar to an elephant's skin. The coral has an uneven skeletal surface that looks like it is almost ruffled with deep grooves and valleys that twist and turn. They have a very thin tissue that covers the skeleton, which can be bluish-gray to brown. Under bright lighting they can be a fluorescent greenish brown. It is also known as Corduroy Coral, Castle Coral, and Groove Coral.\nIn the wild, the Elephant Skin Coral lives in large colonies that form mounds over 26 feet (8 m) across in shallow areas with turbid water. They grow in bifacial plates that are generally upright, contorted, and irregular. These corals are unique, in that they have no discernible polyps. They use the nutrients in the water as well as the zooxanthellae in their bodies to nourish themselves, and can also use a mucous net to capture small particles.\nThe Pachyseris genus are for advanced aquarists due to their stringent requirements. They need a lot of nutrients, yet at the same time need pristine water conditions. They appreciate high light and a strong water movement. They are slow growing and If not kept in pristine conditions, will quickly deteriorate. They are susceptible to white-band disease and other afflictions, and don't tolerate the typical treatments used for other stony corals. Captive reared specimens may be slightly easier to care for.\nThe Elephant Skin Coral has been reproduced in captivity, though in a limited capacity. Propagation has been slow. There has been limited success because this coral heals slowly and stresses easily.\nDistribution / Background Pachyseris Coral Information: The Elephant Skin Coral Pachyseris rugosa was described by Lamarck in 1801. Some common names they are known for are Elephant Skin Coral, Corduroy Coral, Castle Coral, and Groove Coral. They have reproduced in captivity, and limited captive propagation has been practiced. Currently the Pachyseris genus and the Pavona genus are the only 2 genera regularly offered to aquarists from this family, Agariciidae.\nWhere Pachyseris Corals Are Found: The Pachyseris rugosa are found from the Red Sea to the Marshal Islands, Samoa, and Micronesia, as well as the Great Barrier Reef to the Houtman Abrolhos Islands of Australia.\nPachyseris Coral Habitat: P. rugosa are found in deeper waters, as well as shallow areas with turbid water. They inhabit reef slopes, surge channels, and shallow lagoons. They live in large colonies that form mounds over 26 feet (8 m) across in the shallower areas, as well as smaller colonies throughout their range.They are found at depths down to 131 feet (40 m). These corals use the nutrients in the water as well as the zooxanthellae in their bodies to nourish themselves, and can also use a mucous net to capture small particles.\nDescription What do Pachyseris Corals look like: The Elephant Skin Coral Pachyseris rugosa growth form is in bifacial plates that are generally upright, contorted, and irregular. It has an uneven skeletal surface that looks like it is almost ruffled with deep grooves and valleys that twist and turn. They have a very thin tissue that covers the skeleton, which can be bluish-gray to brown. In bright lighting, they can be a fluorescent greenish brown. It is unknown how long they live.\nDifficulty of Care Pachyseris Coral Care: The P. rugosa is a very difficult coral to care for. This is a coral for advanced aquarists. They need a lot of nutrients, yet at the same time need pristine water conditions. They need high light and a strong water movement. They are slow growing and If not kept in pristine conditions, will quickly deteriorate. Captive reared may be slightly easier to care for.\nFoods / Feeding Pachyseris Coral Feeding: In the wild, small polyp stony (SPS) corals have developed several feeding strategies. Through a symbiotic relationship with a marine algae, known as zooxanthellae, they receive the majority of their nutrients. They also capture planktonic organisms, food particles from the water column, and can absorb dissolved organic matter.\nIn captivity, the Pachyseris corals primarily use their zooxanthellae for nutrition, and can also use mucosal capture techniques. Direct feeding will not benefit this coral, but proper water flow will help it to feed.\nAquarium Care Pristine tank conditions are typically needed to keep all SPS corals. Keep the nitrate levels low, and maintaining calcium and alkalinity levels. Typically you can do water changes of 20% to 30% a month, 15% every 2 weeks, or 5% a week for SPS corals. The 5% a week also seems to really make a big difference in the corals health.\nThe following water supplements are suggested for Pachyseris species:\n- Calcium: 385 to 425 ppm. If a small poly stony (SPS) coral does not have enough calcium, it will not grow.\n- Alkalinity: 3.2 TO 4.8 MEQ/L (8 to 12 dKh)\n- Phosphates: 0, zero. Phosphates are the worst of all and all corals hate them.\n- Magnesium: 1350-1500. Magnesium makes calcium available, so if your calcium is low, check your magnesium levels before adding any more calcium.\n- Strontium: Strontium (10 for most SPS Corals), and trace Elements are also suggested.\nA well-feed live rock/reef environment is what is needed for your Elephant Skin Coral, along with some fish for organic matter production. These corals are slow-growing and can succumb to disease, a mature tank is recommended.\n|Quick Reference Chart|\nWhen positioning your Pachyseris, keep in mind that lighting rather than food is more important to them. Strong water movement is also needed for a healthy Pachyseris. Make sure that no other corals can come in contact with your specimen. Pachyseris spp. are generally peaceful but will loose any chemical warfare with other species.\n- Minimum Tank Size / Length: 50 to 100 gallons (190 - 380 L) or larger\n- Marine Lighting: High, but not direct metal halide\n- Temperature: 74° - 83° F (23° - 28° C)\n- Salinity / Specific Gravity: 1.023 - 1.025\n- Water Movement: Strong\n- Water Region: Middle of the aquarium\nCompatibility and Social Behaviors The Pachyseris genus are generally peaceful since they do not have tentacles that extend. It does well in a typical small polyp stony (SPS) coral tank, but will suffer in crowded tanks. It should be kept well away from other corals. They are fine with fish that are considered reef safe.\nBreeding and Reproduction The small polyp stony (SPS) corals are male and female and can reproduce both sexually and asexually. In the wild they reproduce sexually by releasing eggs and sperm at the same time, resulting in a fertilized egg which then forms into a free-swimming planula larva. Eventually the planula larvae settles onto the substrate, becoming plankters. This then forms a tiny polyp which begins to excrete calcium carbonate and develops into a coral. Planula larvae are extremely vulnerable to predation, and very few survive. The Pachyseris genus reproduce asexually as well. In the wild Pachyseris spread from breakage due to storms and fragmentation. The P. rugosa has been known to use asexual fragmentation, yet this takes many weeks.\nPropagation for the P. rugosa has been slow and with limited success, since this coral heals slowly and stresses easily. It can easily be cut off of a mother colony that is healthy and has had a chance to grow itself out for many months. Keeping the water in the tank very clean and pristine will help this coral heal if fragging is in its future. Bone cutting implements or scoring can be used to get fragments. Allow the frags to heal before moving them to a new tank. Give the frags ample water flow.\nPotential Problems The Pachyseris spp. tend to be the first to bleach out in the ocean, indicating their sensitivity to water conditions. They tend to get white-band disease and treating the water is not suggested, yet putting the antibiotic directly on the coral is the best choice. If not kept in pristine conditions, they will quickly deteriorate.\nThe Elephant Skin Corals do grow very slow, and do not have polyps that can warn you of illness. The only way to tell if it is healthy is if there is no tissue degeneration. If your P. rugosa has any kind of tissue recession, you may be able to get ahead of it by cutting off some of the healthy tissue just beyond the deteriorating tissue This will ensure if any deterioration is starting on visibly healthy tissue, it will not spread. If you have problems with cyanobacteria or algae, keeping strong water movement will prevent them from attaching to your Pachyseris.\nAvailability Pachyseris Corals for Sale: The Elephant Skin Coral P. rugosa is moderately hard to find at pet shops, but can be found online at times. Online they can run about $49.00 USD or more depending on size and/or color.\n- Animal-World References: Marine and Reef\n- Eric Borneman, Aquarium Corals : Selection, Husbandry, and Natural History , TFH Publications, 2001\n- Anthony Calfo, Book of Coral Propagation, Volume 1 Edition 2: Reef Gardening for Aquarists, Reading Trees; 2nd edition, 2007\n- Bob Goemans, Elephant Skin/Corduroy/Castle Coral, Pachyseris rugosa, Animal Library, Saltwatercorner.com","Diagnosis and treatment of marine ich.\nNeale Monks, Ph.D. |\nBecause marine ich is difficult to treat without harming reef aquarium invertebrates, prevention is definitely better than cure.\nSalt grain-sized white cysts are visible on the skin and fins; cysts are also present on the gills. Fish may scratch against solid objects, and breathing may be labored. Excess mucous may be visible as gray patches on the body.\nMarine velvet is similar, but the cysts are smaller, more like powdered sugar than salt. Velvet makes a fish look like it has been dusted with a fine powder, whereas ich is more like salt grains. Velvet is almost always associated with very rapid ventilation of the gills.\nThe causative agent is the protozoan parasite Cryptocaryon irritans.\nThere are four stages in the marine ich life cycle.\nThe feeding stage is known as trophont (or trophozoite). As the trophont feeds on tissue fluids, the distinctive white spot forms around the parasite as a cyst.\nOnce the trophont is mature, the cyst bursts and the free-living protomont emerges. Secondary infections can set in at this stage because of the damage caused to the host fish’s skin. Within a few hours the protomont settles onto a solid object, potentially even wet objects, such as nets, that can be moved between aquariums.\nProtomonts form capsules and begin dividing, eventually forming hundreds of infective cells known as theronts or tomites. In a tropical marine aquarium, this reproductive stage lasts for about three days.\nAfter the reproductive phase is finished, the capsule bursts, and the theronts swim into the water and seek out new hosts. The theronts will die after a few days if they cannot find a suitable host.\nThe marine ich parasite is only vulnerable to treatment during the free-living stages of its life cycle. The non-free-living trophonts are too well-protected by the skin and mucous of the host fish to be treated.\nWhen treating ich, the temperature of the aquarium is often raised a few degrees above normal. This speeds up the life cycle of the parasite to its vulnerable free-living stages more quickly. However, solubility of oxygen in seawater goes down as temperature goes up, so additional circulation and aeration may be required.\nMedications containing copper (typically copper sulfate) are very effective at killing off the free-living marine ich parasites. A test kit must be used to ensure the copper concentration stays within safe levels. These medications can be very useful in fish-only aquariums, hospital aquariums, quarantine aquariums and as baths for dipping new livestock.\nCopper is acutely toxic to most marine organisms. While bony fish will generally tolerate therapeutic concentrations of copper, cartilaginous fish, corals, invertebrates, living rock and macroalgae will all be harmed or killed by copper. Obviously, copper-based medications cannot be used in FOWLR (fish only with live rock) or reef aquariums.\nAnother way to treat ich is to gradually reduce the salinity of the aquarium by about 2 ppt (parts per thousand) per day until the salinity reaches 18 ppt (about half the normal salinity of seawater). Maintaining the salinity at this reduced level for a month or so will kill off any free-living parasites.\nAgain, this is normally only an option in aquariums containing bony fish. Corals, living rock, macroalgae, and most cartilaginous fish and invertebrates will not adapt to reduced salinities.\nMonitoring and controlling water chemistry is very important. Use chemical buffers to ensure pH and alkalinity remain constant, despite the reduced salinity. Also note that temperature affects specific gravity, not just salinity. So, while a salinity of 18 ppt corresponds to a specific gravity of 1.012 at 77 degrees Fahrenheit, the specific gravity will be closer to 1.010 at 86 degrees.\nSome strains of Cryptocaryon irritans are more tolerant of low salinities than others, in which case reducing the salinity further and/or extending the period of hyposalinity may be required.\nTreating Reef Aquariums\nBecause copper and reduced salinity regimes cannot be used to treat reef aquariums, the only completely safe way to deal with marine ich in a reef aquarium is to remove all of your saltwater fish to a hospital aquarium where they can be treated separately.\nOnce the reef aquarium is devoid of saltwater fish, the parasites will not be able to find hosts and will eventually die. This takes a minimum of four weeks.\nBecause treating marine ich is not easy in aquariums containing anything other than bony fish, prevention is the best way to manage this particular disease. All new livestock should be quarantined for a minimum of four weeks prior to introduction. This will provide ample time to detect, and if necessary treat, ich infections.\nUltraviolet sterilization has sometimes been touted as a useful way to deal with marine ich. While UV light can kill the free-living parasites, the efficacy of a UV sterilizer depends upon proper cleaning and maintenance, and in practice UV sterilization should be viewed only as a supplement to proper quarantining and treatment, not an alternative.\nNeale Monks studied zoology at the University of Aberdeen in the north of Scotland and obtained his Ph.D. at the Natural History Museum in London. He's also been a marine biologist, a high school teacher, a university professor and a museums exhibit designer. But his real love has always been tropical fish. His particular interest in brackish water fish culminated in his editing of the first encyclopaedic book on the topic, 'Brackish-Water Fishes', published by TFH in 2007. Neale regularly contributes to all the major English-language fishkeeping magazines, focusing especially on community aquariums, biotopes, healthcare and water chemistry issues. After living in London and then for a while in Lincoln, Nebraska, Neale now lives in a quaint cottage in a pretty market town in Hertfordshire, England, where he divides his time between teaching and writing.\nGive us your opinion on"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:0198492d-d614-4fd2-8d13-5ee7b2225dc8>","<urn:uuid:b5cddc97-a9f8-4b20-9708-92138caeb25c>"],"error":null}
{"question":"¿How can churches legally use copyrighted music during religious services?","answer":"Churches can legally perform copyrighted music during religious services under §110(3) of the US Copyright Law, which provides an exemption for performance and display of works during services at places of worship. However, this exemption only covers live performance and display - it does not allow churches to reproduce lyrics on PowerPoint/songsheets, create new arrangements, distribute copies, or record services. For uses beyond live performance, churches need additional licensing, which can be obtained by either purchasing hymnals containing the works or getting a CCLI license for contemporary music.","context":["This article is intended to familiarize you with the basics of copyright as it relates to churches. Because copyright is a legal issue and the intricacies of your situation might make a significant difference in your rights and responsibilities, you should consult a lawyer who is familiar with your circumstance before following any legal guidance.\nCopyright is a set of laws designed to help artists and others who produce creative works to be able to benefit from their work and to control its use. Basically it gives the rights holder ownership over his or her work and some very specific rights. Under US Copyright law, those rights are:\n- the right to reproduce the copyrighted work in copies or phonorecords\n- the right to prepare derivative works based upon thecopyrighted work\n- the right to distribute copies or phonorecords of the work to the public by sale or other transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease, or lending\n- the right to perform the copyrighted work publicly in the case of literary, musical, dramatic, and choreographic works, pantomimes, and motion pictures and other audiovisual works\n- the right to display the copyrighted work publicly in the case of literary, musical, dramatic, and choreographic works, pantomimes, and pictorial, graphic, or sculptural works, including the individual images of a motion picture or other audiovisual work\nThe rights holder may, of course, choose to allow others to do some or all of those things, but they aren’t required to do so. If you own the rights to something, then you have control over its use.\nWho Holds the Copyright?\nMost of the time the creator of a work owns the copyright automatically. There’s no paperwork to file or government registry to notify. As soon as a creative work is put into a fixed form (written, recorded, etc.) then copyright law applies. There are some specialized circumstances, such as an employee who is doing creative work on behalf of his or her employer or works done for commission where rights may belong to an organization or publisher.\nAnother exemption of note is that works created by most government employees as part of their duties for the United States Government are the property of the public at large and generally fall into the public domain.\nHow Long Does Copyright Last?\nThis is a tough question, because the answer keeps changing. For works prior to 1923, copyright has expired and those works are in the public domain, meaning anyone is free to use them in any way. They’re considered to be a part of our shared cultural heritage and fair game for anyone.\nFor works produced after that, the answer, unfortunately, is “it depends”. The rule of thumb is that copyright extends to 70 years after the death of the author, or 90 years after the publication of a work with many authors. For a detailed chart of the possible copyright statuses for a work, see: http://copyright.cornell.edu/resources/publicdomain.cfm.\nWhy Should Churches Worry about Copyright?\n- You value those who create music and creative materials for the church and you believe the worker is worth his wage.\n- It’s the law. See Romans 13 for the extended discussion.\nThere’s simply no excuse for a church to ignore copyright law.\nA Special Note on Music\nAnyone who’s ever helped in the songwriting process will tell you that a lot goes in to making a song. There’s the lyrics, the music, the arrangement and, presumably, a recording, all of which are individual creative works, meaning separate copyrights. So while the text of Veni Emmanuel dates from the 9th century, the current translation dates from the 19th century and the melody from then as well. All are in the public domain, meaning anyone can use them freely. That new Pentatonix arrangement of it? Completely under copyright. Even though it builds on public domain work, the arrangement and recording are unique creative works and need to be licensed as such.\nCan Churches Use Copyrighted Works?\nOf course. Anyone can use copyrighted materials with permission or licensing from the rights holder. That’s generally the simplest, easiest way to use a copyrighted work. There are also a few exemptions to copyright law (most notably Fair Use and the TEACH Act) which may apply in some situations. We’ll unpack those in future articles, but one of the bigger exemptions is written into the copyright law for churches and worship directly. §110(3) of the US Copyright Law (see https://www.copyright.gov/title17/title17.pdf for the full text) reads:\nNotwithstanding the provisions of section 106, the following are not infringements of copyright:\n(3) performance of a nondramatic literary or musical work or of a dramaticomusical work of a religious nature, or display of a work, in the course of services at a place of worship or other religious assembly;\nNote the specific language of the law, though. This exemption gives permission only for the performance and display of a work. Of the rights listed at the top of this article, it only covers two, meaning that while you’re free to sing copyrighted material, you’re not free to reproduce (which includes transferring the lyrics to powerpoint or songsheets), create derivative works (including your own arrangements of songs), or to distribute copies (including your worship team CD) or record your services. Uses beyond the actual performance in worship require further licensing (including podcast, streaming, live viewing on YouTube or your website, etc).\nHow Do I Get Permission to Use Works beyond Performance or Display?\nThere are a few options for churches who want to use copyrighted works in worship. The most common (and most obvious) is simply to purchase a hymnal that includes the work. The hymnal takes care of the reproduction rights, allowing the performance rights to fall under the Religious Services Exemption.\nIf you wish to reprint the liturgical materials or hymns from Lutheran Service Book in your service folder or on your screens, Concordia Publishing House does have an electronic version of the hymnal available and licenses that will cover your use of print or projected copying.\nFor churches that use more contemporary music that often isn’t found in hymnals, consider a CCLI license. While CCLI doesn’t represent every artist/recording label, it does cover a decent majority, meaning you’re unlikely to encounter songs that aren’t covered.\nLicensing Trumps Copyright\nBe aware that many services which offer copyrighted materials also come with licensing agreements which may limit the rights you would otherwise have under copyright. As an example, take Netflix. Showing a movie that is relevant to the subject matter in a classroom for educational purposes is generally Fair Use, and would be legal under copyright law, even if the work itself is still under copyright protection. However, the Netflix license expressly forbids public performance, meaning that while it might be legal to show the film, we can’t use Netflix as the medium to do so. This is an emerging area, but for now the law is squarely on the side of the limited license. Therefore, you cannot show a movie for your youth group, or as entertainment in school, after school program or preschool, such as a Disney movie, without a license. Licensing for this type of use is available through CVLI.\nWhat Else Do I Need to Know?\nThere’s a fair bit more to talk about concerning copyright, but it’s beyond the scope of this introduction. As we go forward we’ll unpack some of the exemptions in copyright law relating to Fair Use and some of the other exemptions around educational use of materials. There’s a lot of freedom for specific uses, but we must be careful to obey the law and ensure that those who labor to create the works we use are fairly compensated for their work.\nLearn more about the use of technology in your church by subscribing to this blog!"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:aeb65f5e-5721-47fe-8536-84d31814c4be>"],"error":null}

{"question":"What's the historical origin of Carnaval celebrations in Europe, and how do modern Belgian and Dutch celebrations differ in their traditions? 🎭","answer":"Historically, Carnaval originated in pre-Christian times when February was considered the last month of the year, celebrating the sun's triumph over winter. The tradition evolved through Babylon's sacrificial king rituals and was later integrated into Christian customs, with the Latin term 'Carne Vale' meaning farewell to meat before Lent. The modern form originated in the German Rhineland, specifically Cologne, in 1823. Today, Dutch Carnaval features local associations with a 'Council of Eleven' who choose a prince and organize parades, while the Belgian Carnival of Binche is distinguished by the Gilles - around 1,000 men and boys wearing traditional red and black garments, ostrich-feather hats, and wax masks who perform specific rituals including tossing oranges to crowds on Fat Tuesday.","context":["By Rita Hoefnagels, USAG Benelux Public AffairsFebruary 1, 2018\nSCHINNEN, The Netherlands -- One of the most important local events in the Dutch Southern Provinces is Carnaval. During the three-day event, people wear costumes and masks as they eat, drink and enjoy the festivities. This year, Carnaval is celebrated Feb. 11 to 13.\nCarnaval is a big celebration, which ends on Ash Wednesday when Lenten, or Lent, starts. Although it was originally believed that Carnaval is a religious festival, it is not. Before Christ was born, February was considered the last month of the year. People began the new year by celebrating the fact that the sun had cast away the dark winter.\nThe chronicles of Babylon speak of the sacrificial death of the king every year during their new year's celebrations. The king had to die for his people so they could start the new year without sins. To prevent kinghood from becoming a one-year affair, it was decided to have a temporary king during these days. The temporary king would be either a terminally-ill person or a criminal condemned to death. During the festivities, these men lived like kings.\nThe Christian Church learned that integrating these rituals into the church was a way of dealing with heathen beliefs. People celebrated but did penance afterwards. Ash Wednesday became the official beginning of a 40-day long Lent season before Easter. This was also believed to be an explanation for the event's name. During Lent, people did penance by fasting. The Latin term \"Carne Vale\" meant farewell to meat/flesh. During the Reformation, sobriety was preached so these excessive celebrations were considered sinful. As a result, Carnaval ceased to exist.\nCarnaval, as it is today, originated from the German Rhineland, with its cradle in Cologne. This city, occupied by Napoleon's Army and annexed later by Prussia, had many inhabitants who did not forget Cologne's glorious past when emperors visited. They were welcomed with great pomp and circumstance and entered the city in a parade while the citizens showered them with flowers. The emperors gave money to those cheering. In 1823, the very first Carnaval/Fashing parade was organized. The parade had to be equal to the wealthy and glorious entries of the Habsburg emperors in the old days.\nA lot of traditions are still the same. Prince Carnaval, for instance, still wears a Renaissance costume and is accompanied by Soldiers in 17th century uniforms. At the time of the first parade, these uniforms were really meant as a spoof on the Prussians. Little by little, all kinds of elements were added. Carnaval associations were established and medals were presented to special citizens and event participants. This also started as persiflage on the Prussians' behavior but grew out to be a tradition.\nCarnaval has spread all over the Rhineland and the South of the Netherlands. Nowadays, almost every village has its own Carnaval association while the larger cities have even more than one. The Carnaval association consists of a \"Raad van Elf\" (Council of Eleven) presided by the president or lord, who is responsible for the activities during the Carnaval season. They choose a prince, organize and escort the parade. They also visit senior living homes, schools and other associations to give out medals.\nThe Carnaval festivities typically begin with the mayor handing over the town keys to the prince, making him the ruler of the city or village for the duration of Carnaval.\nMany clubs, associations and schools have their own prince and Carnaval fest. The Schinnen Community is no exception. By tradition, these fests are ruled over by a prince and princess and visited by local authorities and Carnaval associations. The fest at Schinnen will be held Feb. 9 starting at 2:11 p.m. in the Pin Point Café and Bowling Center at U.S. Army Garrison Benelux in Schinnen. The fest will begin with the proclamation of Prince and Princess Carnaval for 2018. For newcomers to the area, this is a perfect opportunity to experience Carnaval.\nThe highlight of Carnaval is the parade. Participants often work year round to build floats and create costumes. Every group tries their best to have the most original designs. After the parade, the festivities start with dancing and singing in the streets and pubs. Many shops will be closed Feb. 12 and 13. Special events, such as Carnaval Band contests, will take place during those days. On Tuesday at midnight, Carnaval officially ends.\nSo dress up, put on your mask and celebrate the festivities!","There are tons of great festivals and events that take place throughout the year in Belgium, but few can rival the tradition and exuberance of the Carnival of Binche. Every February on the three days leading up to Lent, the town of Binche puts on its world-famous carnival, which is included on the UNESCO World Heritage List. Binche, like the Belgian cities of Liege and Dinant, is found in the Walloon region of the country, which is predominantly French-speaking. It is a small Medieval town with just over 30,000 residents, but this small town knows how to throw a good carnival. Should you plan to include a stop in Binche during your Belgium vacation, but are unable make it here for the February Carnival, you can always drop by the Museum of Carnival and Mask. Not only will you find exhibits in relation to the Binche Carnival in Belgium, but also ones that relate to other carnivals from around the world.\nThe Carnival of Binche is without question the most famous carnival in all of Belgium, and while folks from around the world come to experience it, it is exceedingly popular with citizens of nearby France. A Catholic carnival, the Carnival of Binche has its roots in the Christian faith, and it is more or less the last hurrah before the praying and fasting of Lent begin. There is no question that this top carnival in Belgium has quite a history to it, but there are different opinions as to just how far back it goes. While the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries are when some historians believe that it began, others say that it must be earlier. This is due to its attachment to Christianity, which had already extended itself throughout most of Europe long before the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Regardless of the year that it was first celebrated, the Catholic Carnival of Binche is old, though the version that is celebrated today has its roots in the nineteenth century. It was in the nineteenth century that the Carnival of Binche really started to become recognized internationally, and it was also when the festive costumes and accessories implemented in today’s carnival were established.\nWhile the Binche Belgium Carnival is at its best on the three days leading up to Lent, it actually starts 49 days before Lent begins. For seven weeks, Sundays include some form of ritualistic dance or ceremony, and these small acts are more for preparation’s sake than anything. It is neat to catch some of the townspeople practicing for their beloved Belgium carnival on the Sundays leading up to the main affair. The three main days of this traditional carnival in Belgium are known as the “fatty days,” and they start on the last Sunday before Lent. At 10 a.m. on this Fat Sunday, the “Mam’selles” parade commences, and it includes a procession of folks dressed in all kinds of outfits. Performers are decked out in traditional costumes, and these costumes can be quite diverse, some pertaining to animals, others depicting a certain character or person. The most important characters of the Binche Catholic Carnival are the Gilles, who are all men and boys. They number somewhere around 1,000, and they all wear a traditional outfit that involves red and black body garments, ostrich-feather hats, and wax masks. Each Gille’s mask has a curled moustache and a signature pair of spectacles.\nOn Fat Monday, the Gilles dance in the streets of Binche to music that is supplied by barrel organ players. There is a confetti battle on Fat Monday as well, and the highlights also feature the circle of friendship that is formed by members from various youth groups. Monday ends in fireworks, which helps to continue the fanfare, but no day is bigger than Fat Tuesday, or Mardi Gras. Fat Tuesday is the only day in which the famed Gilles wear their costumes all day long, from sunup to sundown. Many Binche locals begin their Fat Tuesday at 4 a.m., getting up to take part in the early morning collections. The Gilles typically enjoy a traditional oysters and champagne breakfast before hitting the streets to perform for the masses. In addition to the Gilles, harlequins, Pierrots, and peasant characters help to make Fat Tuesday even more special, and you’ll want to pay attention to the fancy footwork that some of the dancers put on. The last procession on Mardi Gras takes place at around 3 p.m., and it is when the Gilles are known to toss oranges to and at crowd members, so keep your eyes peeled. After the last procession, folks generally mill about the town center, enjoying further celebrations. The evening is capped off with the week’s best fireworks show.\nIt’s hard to sum up the experience of the Binche Carnival in Belgium. Should you be traveling to Belgium during the festival, you will want to really consider adding it to your itinerary. The town of Binche is just 34 miles south of Belgium’s capital city of Brussels, so you can hop on a train or bus and be here in no time.

{"question":"How different are the roles of attorneys vs mediators in mediation process - can you explain pros and cons?","answer":"Attorneys and mediators have distinct roles in the mediation process. Mediators are neutral third parties who facilitate discussions and help parties reach mutual agreements, but they cannot provide legal advice or opinions on case outcomes. Attorneys, on the other hand, serve to investigate, negotiate, and protect their clients' interests. Attorneys can advise on whether agreements are fair and reasonable, explain negotiating tactics, and ensure settlement agreements contain necessary legal terms. While mediators must remain impartial and cannot influence decisions, attorneys actively represent their clients' interests and help them understand their legal rights. It's advisable to have both - the mediator facilitates communication between parties, while attorneys ensure their clients' legal interests are protected.","context":["Divorce Mediation in Tennessee Answers to FAQs\nTennessee divorce mediation answers to frequently asked questions.\nI’ve heard about mediation in Tennessee divorce cases, but I’ve also heard that the less sophisticated spouse is more likely to be taken advantage of.\nBeing taken advantage of is a much more important concern if you are not represented. If you have a lawyer, it is unlikely you will be taken advantage of. While it is common for one spouse to be perceived as “weaker,” the mediation process is designed to prevent a stronger spouse from taking advantage of the weaker one. Your lawyer can help advise you through the mediation process. Also, an ethical and experienced mediator will take the balance of power into account and even reject cases if there is a likelihood of fraud or unfair dealing.\nI might consider mediation for my Tennessee divorce case, but will I have to waive my ability to use a lawyer?\nAbsolutely not! Ethical Tennessee mediators encourage clients to have representation at all stages of the mediation process. If a mediator suggests otherwise, don’t use that mediator. Any mediator that doesn’t strongly advise that both parties are represented during the mediation process shouldn’t be trusted.\nBut if lawyers get involved, why bother with mediation?\nYour experienced Tennessee family lawyer plays a very important role in the mediation process. Your lawyer advises you to make sure that both the process and agreement are fair, just, and reasonable and include all of the necessary terms and requirements.\nMediators aren’t supposed to offer any advice as to whether the terms of any agreement are fair or reasonable, or comment on what a particular judge might order in the event of a trial. Experienced family lawyers can make sure your settlement agreement contains everything it should and doesn’t omit very important legal conditions and terms.\nWell, this all sounds reasonable, but my spouse would never agree to mediation. Can I force him?\nWhy should I have an attorney during the Tennessee mediation process?\nThree of the primary functions of attorneys are to investigate, negotiate, and eliminate variables. As you can imagine, negotiating a divorce settlement can be an emotional and legal minefield. Your spouse’s lawywer may use unfair negotiating tactics and strategies. Having your own attorney explain to you in clear, concise, and simple terms that an opposing attorney may be “testing the waters” with an overly aggressive negotiating position — and advise you on the appropriate responses — can be a valuable service.\nWhat is mediation anyway?\nInTennessee, mediation is a form of “Alternative Dispute Resolution.” Alternative Dispute Resolution is a general term that describes new procedures used by the courts to facilitate settlements. The theory is that many cases that would otherwise result in trial can be resolved sooner if there’s a formal process by which the parties meet to discuss the issues in the case. The process is controlled by Supreme Court of Tennessee Rule 31.\nBelow are a few selected provisions from Tennessee Supreme Court Rule 31:\nSection 1. Application\nPursuant to the provisions of this Rule, a court may order the parties to an eligible civil action to participate in an alternative dispute resolution proceeding in accordance with this Rule.\nSection 2. Definitions\n- (c) “Mediation” is an informal process in which a neutral person, called a mediator, conducts discussions among the disputing parties designed to enable them to reach a mutually acceptable agreement among themselves on all or any part of the issues in dispute.\n- (e) “Non-binding arbitration” is a process in which a neutral person or a panel, called an arbitrator or an arbitration panel, considers the facts and arguments presented by the parties and renders a decision which is non-binding.\n- (f) “Case evaluation” is a process in which a neutral person or a panel, called an evaluator or evaluation panel, after receiving brief presentations by the parties summarizing their positions, identifies the central issues in dispute as well as areas of agreement, provides the parties with an assessment of the relative strengths and weaknesses of their case, and may offer a valuation of the case.\nSection 3. Initiation\nUpon motion of either party, or upon its own motion, a court, by order of reference, may order the parties to an eligible civil action to participate in a judicial settlement conference, mediation, or case evaluation.\nSection 4. Evidence\nEvidence of conduct or statements made in the course of court-ordered alternative dispute resolution proceedings shall be inadmissible in court to the same extent as conduct or statements are inadmissible under Tennessee Rules of Evidence 408.\nSection 6. Confidentiality\nA Rule 31 dispute resolution neutral or settlement judge shall preserve and maintain the confidentiality of all alternative dispute resolution proceedings except where required by law to disclose the information.\nSection 9. Participation of Attorneys\nAttorneys may appear with clients during alternative dispute resolution proceedings.\nAppendix A. Standards Of Professional Conduct For Rule 31 Mediators\n- (4) The Mediation Process.\n- (a) Orientation Session. On commencement of the mediation session, a mediator shall inform all parties that the process is consensual in nature, that the mediator is an impartial facilitator, and that the mediator may not impose or force any settlement on the parties.\n- (b) Continuation of Mediation. A mediator shall not unnecessarily or inappropriately prolong a mediation session if it becomes apparent that the case is unsuitable for mediation or if one or more of the parties is unwilling or unable to participate in the mediation process in a meaningful manner.\n- (5) Self-Determination.\n- (a) Parties’ Right to Decide. A mediator shall assist the parties in reaching an informed and voluntary settlement. Decisions are to be made voluntarily by the parties themselves.\n- (b) Prohibition of Mediator Coercion. A mediator shall not coerce or unfairly influence a party into a settlement agreement and shall not make substantive decisions for any party to a mediation process.\n- (c) Prohibition of Misrepresentation. A mediator shall not intentionally nor knowingly misrepresent material facts or circumstances in the course of conducting a mediation.\n- (d) A Balanced Process. A mediator shall promote a balanced process and shall encourage the parties to conduct the mediation deliberations in a nonadversarial manner.\n- (e) Mutual Respect. A mediator shall promote mutual respect among the parties throughout the mediation process.\n- (8) Professional Advice.\n- (a) Generally. A mediator shall not provide information the mediator is not qualified by training or experience to provide.\n- (b) Independent Legal Advice. When a mediator believes a party does not understand or appreciate how an agreement may adversely affect legal rights or obligations, the mediator shall advise the participants to seek independent legal counsel.\n- (d) Personal Opinion. While a mediator may point out possible outcomes of the case, a mediator should not offer a firm opinion as to how the court in which the case has been filed will resolve the dispute.","What is Mediation?\nMediation offers an informal forum for resolving problems between parties. The mediator, a neutral third party listens to both sides of your case and acts as a facilitator to help parties focus on the issues, encourage discussion and assist them in reaching a fair and mutually acceptable and voluntary agreement. By reaching a settlement during mediation, you avoid the uncertainty of a trial in which the judge dictates the results. The mediator guides the communication process so that everyone may be heard and personal feelings can be separated from the issues. Conflicts are discussed and various solutions are explored in an effort to reach a satisfactory agreement. The mediator may offer suggestions and help parties develop options to resolve the issues, but the final decisions are made by the parties.\nWho Attends the Mediation Session?\nOnly the parties, whose names appear on the Order to Family Mediation and their attorneys, if any, are included in the session. It is not necessary for attorneys to attend but is advisable if property issues will be discussed. Any third parties admitted to the session will be at the discretion of the mediator and with the approval of all parties. IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAMILY LAW RULE OF PROCEDURE 12.407, CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF 18 SHALL NOT BE BROUGHT TO MEDIATION.\nWhat if an Agreement is reached?\nIf an agreement is reached, the mediator will prepare a document reflecting the terms of the agreement and ask the parties to sign it. However, if the parties are represented by legal counsel who are not present at the session, the parties will have an opportunity to review the agreement with their attorneys before the document is submitted to the Court. If either party should change their mind after consulting their attorney, the attorney can object to the agreement, which would then void the document. If no objection is received within ten days of the session, the agreement will be submitted to the Court for approval.\nWhat if an Agreement is not reached?\nIf the parties do not reach agreement on any issues, the mediator will notify the attorneys, if any, and the Court, so that a trial date can be set.\nIs the Mediation Confidential?\nThe information disclosed in mediation is confidential, except that information which is required or permitted to be disclosed by law and that information which is available through other methods. Information obtained in mediation cannot be used if the case goes to trial. The mediator does not share information nor make recommendations to the judge. The parties are asked to sign a statement agreeing not to subpoena the mediator to testify on either party’s behalf.\nWhat are the Costs of Mediation?\nMediation costs are based on a sliding scale according to the parties’ incomes. Please refer to the Order to Family Mediation for these charges and for the fees for cancellations, rescheduling, or failure to appear.\nTo maximize your time for the session, you should arrive promptly, at the time specified in your Order.\nWhat are the Qualifications of Mediators?\nMediators are certified after meeting specific education and training requirements set by the Florida Supreme Court.\nDo I Need an Attorney?\nMediators do not give legal advice nor is mediation a substitute for obtaining such advice. Attorneys can help their clients understand the law and to have realistic expectations for the outcome of their case. However, no one can predict with certainty what a judge will decide in a case or be able to tell you whether a trial is worth the time or the financial and emotional expense.It is advisable for parties to consult with their attorneys\nprior to mediation and to have their attorneys review any agreement if the attorney does not attend the mediation session.\nWhat are the Advantages of Mediation?\n- Parties actively participate in the decisions that will affect them and their family members.\n- Parties determine the outcome of the process, thereby avoiding the uncertainty of a trial.\n- Immediate resolution can occur, which can save time, money, and stress that is usually associated with a trial.\n- The setting is informal and encourages better communication between the parties.\n- Parties who agree to resolution tend to be more satisfied with the results and are less likely to return to Court for further litigation of their case.\n- Parents can begin working together in a cooperative manner for their children’s sake."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"opinion_recommendation"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:2badab3c-13a4-4e72-8a25-67d88a754e3e>","<urn:uuid:1d695ef1-b459-4548-b442-e90254e63eea>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the primary responsibilities of a Natural Language Processing Scientist in developing language algorithms?","answer":"A Natural Language Processing Scientist uses algorithms to identify natural language rules and enables computers to speak and understand language. They design algorithms to discover and test patterns, collect and explore data, and improve machine learning-based technologies that support areas such as computational linguistics, human language technologies, automatic speech recognition, and machine translation.","context":["Even though we’re just scratching the surface of possibilities when it comes to machine learning, it’s already shaping our everyday lives and the decisions we make. Major companies like Google, Amazon, Netflix, and Tesla use machine learning to deliver personalized results to millions of users, understand and interpret human conversation, train neural networks to predict what a human driver would do, and so much more.\nAnd there’s no sign of slowing down. The global market is expected to reach $117.19 billion by 2027 — that’s a yearly growth rate of nearly 40%.\nThe significant growth within machine learning, as well as the opportunities to develop new and exciting technology, has attracted many professionals to the industry. While there are the obvious titles — like Machine Learning Engineer — there are also other positions you can explore that use machine learning but might not be as obvious.\nHere are seven popular jobs that use machine learning, along with information on how to get started in each role.\n1. Machine Learning Engineer\nMachine Learning Engineer is one of the most popular positions in the machine learning industry, and you’re likely to find many roles with this exact title during your job search. These engineers design and implement machine learning models, expand and optimize data pipelines and data delivery, and assemble large, complex data sets. Models developed by Machine Learning Engineers are used to reveal trends and predictions that can help companies meet business objectives and goals.\nMachine Learning Engineers build the recommender systems that power many digital platforms.

Robotics Engineer\nRobotics Engineers have a huge advantage if they also have a machine learning background. Robots are often driven by either the need to emulate human behavior or to maximize the efficiency with which something can be done. So as a Robotics Engineer, you might help develop a robot’s computer vision, which would enable it to interpret and understand the visual world around it, and then make accurate — and safe — decisions. Or maybe you’d develop a machine-learning algorithm to process massive amounts of data produced by robots that assemble vehicle parts.\nDesigning the machines that make people’s lives easier can earn you about $99,040 a year, on average. If you’re thinking about a career in robotics, you’ll likely need to know C++ and Python, and you can get started with these in our Learn C++ and Learn Python courses.\n3. Natural Language Processing (NLP) Scientist\nA Natural Language Processing Scientist uses algorithms to pinpoint natural language rules, and then use them to enable computers to speak and understand the language. Machine learning makes this easier because you can design an algorithm that discovers and tests patterns for you — so you don’t have to do it manually or with elaborate spreadsheets. In a way, a Natural Language Processing Scientist builds bridges between languages and machines, making it possible for machines to understand people and vice-versa.\nAs an NLP Scientist, you may specialize in a subfield of NLP, such as computational linguistics, human language technologies, automatic speech recognition, or machine translation. And you’ll likely also collect, explore, and improve the quality of data used to adapt and extend machine learning-based technologies that support these areas.\nU.S.-based Natural Language Processing Scientists make between $81,600 to $122,400 per year, with a median salary of $102,000.

Data Scientist\nA Data Scientist analyzes, processes, models, and interprets data to help create actionable plans and guide business decisions for companies and organizations. As a Data Scientist, you have the potential to be one of the most useful team members in your company, largely because your ideas and suggestions are backed by hard data.\nData Scientists working in the machine learning industry help write algorithms that can discover patterns, which are then used to provide insights and recommendations. The critical role of Data Scientists is reflected in their salaries, too. You can earn an average salary of over $119,000 a year as a Data Scientist.\nLearn the skills you’ll need to succeed in this role by taking our Data Scientist career path, and then once you’re ready to apply for jobs, you can check out our interview prep that’s specifically for Data Scientists.\n6. Cybersecurity Analyst\nCybersecurity Analysts are in charge of figuring out the best ways to defend a company’s digital infrastructure and assets. This involves using many different technologies and can be far easier with machine learning. This is because a Cybersecurity Analyst has to collect and study large amounts of data that reflect the vulnerabilities and threats a company may face.\nIf you have a background in machine learning and you’re interested in working in cybersecurity, you may have the opportunity to tweak, upgrade, or create new algorithms used to protect an organization. The crucial role of Cybersecurity Analysts frequently earns them salaries in the six-figure range. The average annual pay is about $103,590.\n7. Artificial Intelligence (AI) Engineer\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) Engineer is another position in which machine learning can be used. Since machine learning is a subset of AI, there are many AI Engineers with expertise in machine learning tools and applications.\nYou might develop and modify machine learning models, apply machine learning techniques for image recognition, and develop neural network applications using popular frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch as an AI Engineer with a machine learning specialty.\nIf a career in AI is in your future, skills like Python, R, and Java are common for this role, as well as linear algebra and statistics.

{"question":"Which event happened first: The premiere of Dorothy Tree's film 'It' or the first BBC broadcast of Big Ben's chimes?","answer":"Dorothy Tree's film debut in 'It' (1927) happened after the first BBC broadcast of Big Ben's chimes, which occurred on December 31, 1923.","context":["Dorothy Tree (born Dorothy Estelle Triebitz, May 21, 1906 – February 13, 1992) was an American actress, voice teacher and writer. She appeared in a wide range of character roles in at least 49 films between 1927 and 1951.\nDorothy Tree, 1939\nDorothy Estelle Triebitz\nMay 21, 1906\nBrooklyn, New York, U.S.\n|Died||February 13, 1992 (aged 85)|\nEnglewood, New Jersey, U.S.\n|Other names||Dorothy Uris|\n|Occupation||Actress, voice teacher|\n|Spouse(s)||Michael Uris (19??-1967; his death); 1 child|\nHer roles included Martha, mother of Knute Rockne in Knute Rockne, All American, and May Emmerich, the invalid wife of Louis Calhern in The Asphalt Jungle. After being blacklisted as a communist because of the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) hearings, she began a second career as a voice teacher in New York. Emphasizing good diction and clarity, and the subtleties of intonation, she published four books on the subject.\nEarly life and stage careerEdit\nShe was born in Brooklyn, New York, the eldest of three daughters of Herman Triebitz (1877–1943) and Bertha Hert (1885–1967). Her sisters were Sylvia Triebitz (1911–1949) and Mildred \"Mimi\" Triebitz (1918–?) Her parents were born in Austria, and immigrated to the United States. Their native language was Yiddish. He was the proprietor of a shoe store in Brooklyn, and later sold shoes wholesale.\nTree attended Cornell University, leaving after two years to pursue a career. Taking the stage name Dorothy Tree, she began her acting career on the stage in 1926. Tree's Broadway credits include Bright Honor (1936), Clear All Wires (1932), The Merchant of Venice (1930), Holiday (1928), The Marquise (1927), and The Triumphant Bachelor (1927).\nTree made her motion picture debut (uncreditied) playing a department store employee in the Famous Players-Lasky/Paramount Pictures silent era romantic comedy It (1927) starring Clara Bow and Antonio Moreno. Tree next played a wife of Bela Lugosi's Dracula (1931); she also played a bride of Dracula in the Spanish language version of the same title, which was shot at night with a different cast using the same sets at Universal.\nTree attracted attention as a feminine menace on the screen as the hairdresser-spy, Hilda Kleinhauer, in the Warner Bros. drama Confessions of a Nazi Spy (1939) starring Edward G. Robinson, which won the National Board of Review Award for Best Film – English Language. Her performance immediately won her the role as Reni Vonich, head of a spy ring attempting to steal the latest in technology, in Paramount's sci-fi drama Television Spy (1939). She was signed by RKO to portray the important role as Elizabeth Edwards, Mary Todd's sister, in Abe Lincoln in Illinois (1940) starring Raymond Massey.\nShe portrayed Martha Rockne in the Warners biopic Knute Rockne, All American, the mother of the famous football coach played by Pat O'Brien. In MGM's film noir crime/drama The Asphalt Jungle Tree played May Emmerich, a bedridden woman who is the very ingenuous and frustrated wife of Alonzo Emmerich (played by Louis Calhern), a crooked lawyer and double-crosser who, although he truly loves May, is having an adulterous affair with the character played by Marilyn Monroe.\nTree also appeared as Aunt Martha Dale in a teleplay of the live television anthology series The Silver Theatre (1950), which was titled Minor Incident. Her last role on the theater screen was as Marie Elsner in Columbia's crime/drama The Family Secret (1951) starring John Derek and Lee J. Cobb.\nBlacklist and new careerEdit\nIn 1952, Tree and her husband, Michael Uris, were branded as communists and blacklisted due to the HUAC testimony of playwright/screenwriter Bernard C. Schoenfeld. That same year, she endorsed Adlai Stevenson in the 1952 presidential election.\nShe then began a second career teaching voice and diction in New York. She specialized in singing in English at the Metropolitan Opera and the Mannes College of Music, and also taught at the Manhattan School of Music, using her married name, Dorothy Uris. She was quoted as saying, \"I left Dorothy Tree in Hollywood.\"\nOn November 4, 1956, an article written by Uris about English singing with good diction and its aiding a singer to clarify words for the listener was published in the New York Times. She published four books, Everybody's Book of Better Speaking (1960); To Sing in English, a Guide to Improved Diction (1971); A Woman's Voice: A Handbook to Successful Private and Public Speaking (1975); and Say it Again: Dorothy Uris' Personal Collection of Quotes, Comment & Anecdotes (1979).\n|1927||It||romantic comedy||Waltham employee||Uncredited|\n|1931||Dracula||fantasy / horror||Dracula's wife||English-language version; Uncredited|\n|Drácula||fantasy / horror||Bride of Dracula (in catacombs)||Spanish-language version; Uncredited|\n|1933||East of Fifth Avenue||drama||Kitty Green|\n|1934||Madame Du Barry||historical drama||Adelaide|\n|Here Comes the Navy||romantic comedy||Gladys|\n|Friends of Mr. Sweeney||comedy||Countess Olga Andrei Misitalsky|\n|The Dragon Murder Case||crime / mystery||Ruby Steele|\n|The Case of the Howling Dog||crime / mystery||Lucy Benton|\n|The Firebird||murder mystery||Mrs. Jolan Brandt|\n|1935||The Woman in Red||drama||Mrs. Olga Goodyear|\n|A Night at the Ritz||comedy||Kiki Lorraine|\n|While the Patient Slept||murder mystery / comedy||Mittie Federie|\n|Four Hours to Kill!||drama||Mae Danish|\n|1936||The Bridge of Spies||crime thrillers||Marion Courtney|\n|Three Godfathers||western||Blackie Winter|\n|Navy Born||drama / romance||Daphne Roth|\n|1937||Marked Woman||crime / drama||woman in raid||Uncredited|\n|The Great Garrick||romantic comedy||Mme.

{"question":"How has the approach to public monuments evolved, and what role do sand mandalas play in contemporary artistic expression?","answer":"Public monuments have evolved from traditional commemorations of great leaders to more inclusive representations of historical experiences, as exemplified by New York's African Burial Ground National Monument, which focuses on forgotten lives rather than individual heroes. In parallel, sand mandalas represent a different approach to public art, emphasizing temporary rather than permanent installations. The creation of sand mandalas in public spaces, such as at the Hammer Museum, demonstrates how traditional spiritual practices can become contemporary artistic expressions. While both forms address cultural memory, sand mandalas specifically embrace impermanence as part of their meaning, contrasting with traditional monuments' aim for permanence, and represent a shift in how art engages with public spaces and cultural memory.","context":["You are currently browsing the category archive for the ‘Public Art’ category.\nThe Hammer Museum, in partnership with Ari Bhöd — the American Foundation for Tibetan Cultural Preservation — is pleased to present The Mandala Project. This two-week program will feature the construction of a Tibetan sand mandala by a team of traditionally trained Lamas visiting Los Angeles from the Thubten Choeling Monastery in Pharping, Nepal. The mandala they create will be a sacred painting, following precise and ancient instructions passed down over thousands of years. Millions of grains of colored sand will be sprinkled carefully on a flat surface over an elaborate 10-day ceremony.\n“Half Houses” by Chilean architect Alejandro Aravena, of the firm Elemental. It is one of eleven building projects that transform poor communities in “Small Scale, Big Change,” an exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art. Photographer: Cristobal Palma/Museum of Modern Art via Bloomberg\nIn one of Africa’s most remote places, a three-room school rises from a hot, dry plain. The metal roof arches over spidery steel rods and mud-brick walls. It’s stark, gorgeous, simple.\nWe are looking at hope in the tiny village of Gando, Burkina Faso, West Africa, one of the exhibits in “Small Scale, Big Change: New Architectures of Social Engagement” at Manhattan’s Museum of Modern Art.\nAfter making good as an architect, the designer returned to build the school his poor village so desperately needed.\nAt another school in Rudrapur, Bangladesh, fabrics in vibrant blue, red and lavender flutter from the doorways and cover the ceiling. Inspired by local adobe traditions, Bavarian architect Anna Heringer used thick walls to deflect the searing sun. Local residents framed an upper level in lightweight bamboo poles lashed together.\nThe result is an environment in which any kid would be happy to learn.\nJames S. Russell\nOn an August afternoon, a shiny sports-utility vehicle pulled into a parking lot of pick-up trucks outside the only school in Cotopaxi. The artist Christo Javacheff took a deep breath and walked into the school’s gymnasium. Someone had set up a microphone under the basketball hoop, and two armed sheriff’s officers stood watch nearby. All the folding chairs planted on the rubbery court were filled, some with people wearing T-shirts that read, “Say No To Christo.”\nThe artist had fretted about this moment for months. “It’s our lion’s den,” he told his staff.\nKnown professionally by his first name, Christo is famous for draping entire buildings, valleys and New York’s Central Park in colorful fabric. Now, at age 75, he’s trying to convince a swath of southern Colorado to let him temporarily suspend flat sections of silvery fabric over a 42-mile-long stretch of the area’s Arkansas River. For two weeks, people will be able to drive alongside this mirror-like ribbon or raft underneath it, he says. He has spent $7 million and 18 years working out the logistics of the project, “Over The River,” and he is campaigning hard for the permits to pull it off.\nWall Street Journal\nIn early 1991, the construction of a federal office building in lower Manhattan was halted after an unexpected discovery. Underneath the ground, covered by a patina of concrete and steel, was the coffin of a colonial-era African. It was not alone. Construction work was halted, archaeologists called in, and it was soon established that the site was a major burial ground from the 17th and 18th centuries. As many as 15,000 to 20,000 black men, women and children were buried there, by the historians’ count, making this one of the most important archaeological finds in all America.\nThe significance was not lost on New York’s people or its authorities. Here was something that challenged the prevailing idea that there was no slavery in colonial New York, and it immediately took on symbolic importance for the city’s African–American community. In 1993, the site was designated a National Historic Landmark, the most important designation for a national monument, and a status it shares with the Statue of Liberty. And, in February, a visitor centre was opened there. Among the poignant displays is one depicting the dual funeral of an adult and child.\nThe African Burial Ground National Monument is both moving and fascinating because of what it reveals about forgotten lives. But it also says something about broader trends in memorialisation. We’ve stopped putting great men on pedestals and started commemorating their victims. In the process we are are losing a sense that human history involved leadership and struggle and, yes, sacrifice. In focusing purely on victimhood we are in danger of turning history into a random series of tragic events, instead of something that was purposeful and directed. Something made rather than just experienced.\nPhone calls and visitors and, yes, dreams from around the world are pouring into the small offices of the Friends of the High Line on West 20th Street in Manhattan these days.\nDetroit is thinking big about an abandoned train station. Jersey City and Philadelphia have defunct railroad beds, and Chicago has old train tracks that don’t look like much now, but maybe they too…\nThe High Line’s success as an elevated park, its improbable evolution from old trestle into glittering urban amenity, has motivated a whole host of public officials and city planners to consider or revisit efforts to convert relics from their own industrial pasts into potential economic engines.\nNew York Times\nToday marks the annual pilgrimage of 100,000 sun-seeking music fans to the Southern California desert for the three-day Coachella Music and Arts Festival. Sure Jay-Z’s playing. So are Thom Yorke, MGMT, DEVO, and Gorillaz–but there are also giant art and architectural installations created by a who’s who of Southern California architects. This year, Crimson Collective, an L.A.-based group of artists, architects, and designers constructed Ascension, a 45-foot tall crane with a 150-foot wingspan.\nThe magnolia tree on the north side of Rittenhouse Square looks as if it were plucked from a Dr. Seuss book. Its split trunk is wrapped in a whimsical sweater of pinks, blues, purples, and oranges.\nThe tree cozy is the work of Jessie Hemmons, 23, a graduate student in psychology at Chestnut Hill College and census worker – and a graffiti artist with a soft side.\nHemmons is part of a growing trend of rogue knitters who have taken their “yarnbombing” to the street to brighten the cityscape. She ties crocheted flowers to lampposts, wraps bike racks with rainbow-colored covers, and gave the Rocky statue a scarf.\nHer motivation is simple.\n“Times are tough,” Hemmons said. “People want to see something bright and pretty.”\nYesterday morning she put up her largest installation yet. Passersby stopped to watch and snap pictures as Hemmons began stitching about 15 feet of knitting – a 30-hour project – to a tree near 19th and Walnut Streets.\nThe yarnbombing trend made headlines this month when three women in West Cape May, known only by their tag name, Salty Knits, began putting up knitting under the cover of night in the borough’s Wilbraham Park and outside private businesses.\nThe mural, a 30-foot tall painting of a rat holding a machine gun, will disappear after the businessman bought the former Liverpool pub it adorns and promised to paint over it.\nThe Grade 2 listed Georgian property was adorned by artwork from the Bristol-born graffiti giant Banksy, around the time of Liverpool’s Biennial art festival in 2004.\nBut after purchasing the artwork at auction on Thursday for £114,000, property developer Billy Palmer, 44, admitted he has no interest in preserving the painting, despite protests from art lovers.\n“I’m not a fan of modern art, I can’t say I know much about it really,” he said after the auction at Liverpool’s Marriott Hotel.\n“All I was concerned about was getting this great building for a good price, I’m going to turn it into luxury flats.\nRenderings show how hundreds of New York taxis will become mobile public art next month when their rooftop ad boards display works by, from left, Shirin Neshat, Alex Katz and Yoko Ono. (Photo illustrations courtesy of Show Media and Art Production Fund)\nThose moving advertisements atop taxis generally deliver not-so-subtle messages, like which airlines to fly or movies to see, who makes the sexiest blue jeans or the coolest sunglasses.\nHigh art they most certainly are not.\nBut for the month of January, Show Media, a Las Vegas company that owns about half the cones adorning New York City’s taxis, has decided to give commerce a rest. Instead, roughly 500 cabs will display a different kind of message: artworks by Shirin Neshat, Alex Katz and Yoko Ono.\nNew York Times\nThe Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art did a smart, simple thing for the Christmas season the other day — small but smart and good for art…the smaller idea was aimed at the media, which is always in search of good images. On Dec. 15 — enough time for planning — the PR department sent out an email with the subject line “Need Christmas Art?” and attaching a PDF listing of all the nativity scenes it holds in its collection for which it had high-res images: a dozen in all.\nJudith H. Dobrzynski\nReal Clear Arts","Demolishing sand castles can be great fun. But what if you had spent weeks creating it painstakingly, only to have it destroyed at the end? Heart breaking, isn’t it? But for the monks of Tibet who create exquisite sand paintings, dismantling their work is the only way. This is said to signify the impermanence of life.\nSand Mandala, the art of creating intricate artworks using colored sand, is practiced by Tibetan monks as a part of tantric tradition. In the Tibetan language, the art is called dul-tson-kyil-khor (mandala of colored powders). As a part of the sand mandala, millions of sand grains are laid painstakingly into place on a flat platform. Several monks work on a single piece, which can take days or weeks to complete. The word Mandala means ‘circle’ in Sanskrit and is said to represent the cosmogram of a Buddha or bodhisattva. This could be the monk’s own, or of the one he wishes to appease. The art includes geometric figures and several Buddhist spiritual symbols. A sand-painted mandala is used as a tool for blessing the earth and its inhabitants. It also provides the monk who practices the art a visual representation of the enlightened mind of the Buddha.\nPhoto: San Jose Library\nA typical sand mandala consists of an outer ring, inside which is a smaller square representing the ‘celestial palace’, a dwelling place of the deity. This square has four gateways representing each of the four directions. The circle as well as the square is made with several intricate layers. The square contains yet another circle, divided into 9 sectors. This circle might just repeat the pattern outside, or the central sector may contain the deity itself. If this is the case, the deity’s manifestations are represented in the surrounding sectors. Sometimes, the whole pattern may be contained within a square, with each of its corners repeating the pattern in smaller mandalas.\nPhoto: San Jose Library\nThe Tibetan mandalas are deceptively simple. They might look like they’re made up of basic patterns, but are extremely complex and might take weeks to complete. Buddhist monks undergo years of training before they can make a mandala. Since the ritual is considered to be very sacred, it cannot be done on a lighter vein. So before a mandala is made, a monk will spend time in philosophical and artistic study. Once a level of understanding has been reached, the mandala is created. In the personal monastery of the Dalai Lama, the Nyamgal monastery, monks spend about three years studying before making the mandala.\nPhoto: Josh Simerman\nTraditionally, four monks work on a single mandala, each taking one of the four quadrants. Each of these four monks has an assistant to fill in their detailed outlines with colors. All the monks begin work on the mandala from the center, moving outwards. Balance is maintained by waiting for all the monks to complete their sections, before moving on to the next. But even before they can start their sand work, the monks perform an opening ceremony. Then, a chalk is used to make a blueprint of the mandala, starting with a single dot at the very center. Four lines are drawn from this dot, after which each monk will work in his own quadrant. The blueprint is completed, the outlines filled with colored sand, made from crushed white stone and dyed. A serrated, funnel-like device is used for the application of the sand, known as chakpu. Two chakpus are scraped against each other, producing a vibration that releases sand onto the blueprint.\nBut what is most unique about the Tibetan sand mandalas is that they are destroyed after completion. The monks work methodically on this as well, brushing off the sand, pushing it all towards the center of the platform. The entire process is undone, and the sand is poured into the nearest body of water. This action is meant to teach us not to get attached to earthly objects, and symbolizes the impermanence of all things material.\nPhoto: Zlatko Unger"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:5ca5a0d7-557d-4c5c-84a2-e4196bfd360d>","<urn:uuid:c9c75d9a-0847-4958-a862-7def7dfb1e9f>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do digital signatures ensure document authenticity in Luxembourg, and what are the main cybersecurity threats they face?","answer":"In Luxembourg, digital signatures ensure document authenticity through three categories recognized by the eIDAS Regulation: qualified, advanced, and simple electronic signatures. The qualified electronic signature, created by a qualified electronic device and based on a qualified certificate, has full legal equivalence to handwritten signatures. However, these digital signatures face several security threats. These include stolen assertion attacks, where eavesdroppers could copy SAML responses to impersonate users, and man-in-the-middle attacks, where malicious sites could impersonate users at service provider sites. To counter these threats, measures include implementing short validity periods for assertions, requiring signed SAML responses for message integrity, and mandating verification of the Recipient attribute.","context":["We will provide a high level and practical overview of the recognition of different forms of electronic signatures in Luxembourg, with a particular focus on “qualified” electronic signatures, and of the practices implemented by Luxembourg professionals to adapt to the restrictive measures in place to tackle the spread of the coronavirus.\nThis overview outlines the general position in relation to documents governed by the laws of Luxembourg. In a cross-border context, and in particular in case of a nexus with another jurisdiction, the position should be ascertained with local counsel.\nThree types of electronic signatures\nA signature identifies the person who signs an act under private seal and expresses said person’s adherence to the content of the act and may be manuscript or electronic in accordance with the terms of the Luxembourg law of 14 August 2000 on electronic commerce, as amended (the e-Commerce Law). The e-Commerce Law further defines the electronic signature as a cryptographic process which consists in a set of data, inseparably linked to the act, which guarantees its integrity.1\nRegulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014 on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market (the eIDAS Regulation) recognises three categories of electronic signatures (classified in decreasing order of probative value):\n- “qualified” electronic signature – electronic signature created by a qualified electronic creation device and based on a qualified certificate (which allows the identification of the signatory) issued by an qualified/accredited trust services provider (prestataires de service de confiance) (TSP).\n- “advanced” electronic signature – advanced electronic signatures are (i) uniquely linked to the signatory, (ii) capable of identifying the signatory, (iii) created using electronic signature creation data that the signatory can, with a high level of confidence, use under his sole control, and (iv) linked to the data signed therewith in such a way that any subsequent change in the data is detectable.\n- “simple” electronic signature (e.g. the electronic (scanned) copy of a handwritten signature placed on a document).\n“Qualified” electronic signatures - full legal effect equivalent to handwritten signatures\n“Qualified” electronic signatures are automatically deemed to have the same legal and probative value as handwritten signatures. As such, just as handwritten signatures, “qualified” electronic signatures could only be contested following the formal repudiation by the signatory, following which a court-ordered verification can be carried out in accordance with the Luxembourg Civil Code.\nWith respect to the “advanced” and “simple” electronic signatures, the eIDAS Regulation provides for a principle of non-discrimination whereby an electronic signature cannot be denied legal effect solely on the basis that it is in electronic format and that it does not satisfy the requirements of a “qualified” electronic signature. In practice, this means that the person who contests the validity of an electronic signature (which is not a “qualified” electronic signature) has the burden of proof and must evidence that the electronic signature does not provide for sufficient guarantees in terms of authenticity and integrity. An “advanced” eletronic signature does not benefit from the presumption of equivalence to handwritten signature and is not binding upon a Luxembourg court, which has a wider margin of discretion whether to accept such signature as evidence, based on the facts and circumstance of the case. When a “simple” electronic signature has been used, the hardcopy of the documents signed by hand and subsequently sent by electronic means could be produced in court as evidence, if required.\nLuxembourg TSPs and recognition of “qualified” certificates issued by EU Member States and third party countries TSPs\nIn accordance with the Commission Decision (EU) 2015/1505 of 8 September 2015, each Member State must draw up a “trusted list” of qualified TSPs. The Luxembourg Institute for Standardisation, Accreditation, Safety and Quality of Products and Services (ILNAS) is in charge of managing this “trusted list” in Luxembourg. This list currently includes only two TSPs as qualified trust service providers: LuxTrust S.A. and BE INVEST International S.A..\nThe eIDAS Regulation requires that “qualified” electronic signatures based on a qualified certificate issued in one EU Member State shall be recognised as a “qualified” electronic signature in all other EU Member States. Therefore, if an electronic signature is based on a qualified certificate issued by a TSP that has been recognised as “qualified” by a EU Member State (i.e. by a qualified TSP listed on the “trusted list” of that EU Member State), such signature will be automatically recognised as having full legal effect equivalent to a handwritten signature.\nThe list of TSPs accredited by EU Member States can be consulted here.\nThe E-commerce Law and the eIDAS Regulation both provide for recognition, subject to certain conditions, of “qualified” certificates issued by third party TSPs. However, in practice, there is no clear recognition of any third country TSP yet – neither at a Luxembourg nor at a European level.\nA pragmatic approach\nMost professionals in Luxembourg have aligned their practice to the eIDAS Regulation and recognise the validity of “qualified” electronic signatures, such as signatures via DocuSign France, a TSP recognised as a being “qualified” by France.\nThe possibility to use electronic signatures should however always be confirmed in advance as legal restrictions apply to certain operations, such as contracts requiring by law a formal notarial process, a legalisation process or requiring signature in the presence of a public officer.\nWe can assist you in ascertaining the compatibility with electronic signature and provide legal advice with respect to related issues.\nProfessionals have taken exceptional measures to guarantee the continuity of business in Luxembourg. We maintain close contact with all the professionals in Luxembourg, in order to adapt our practice accordingly and ensure the continuity of our and your business.\n1 Art. 6 of the e-Commerce Law / article 1322-1 of the Luxembourg Civil Code: “La signature nécessaire à la perfection d’un acte sous seing privé identifie celui qui l’appose et manifeste son adhésion au contenu de l’acte.\nElle peut être manuscrite ou électronique.\nLa signature électronique consiste en un ensemble de données, liées de façon indissociable à l’acte, qui en garantit l’intégrité et satisfait aux conditions posées à l’alinéa premier du présent article.”","a. Stolen Assertion\nThreat: If an eavesdropper can copy the real user’s SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) response and included assertions, then the eavesdropper could construct an appropriate POST body and be able to impersonate the user at the destination site.\nCountermeasures: Confidentiality MUST be provided whenever a response is communicated between a site and the user’s browser. This provides protection against an eavesdropper obtaining a real user’s SAML response and assertions.\nIf an eavesdropper defeats the measures used to ensure confidentiality, additional countermeasures are available:\n- The Identity Provider and Service Provider sites SHOULD make some reasonable effort to ensure that clock settings at both sites differ by at most a few minutes. Many forms of time synchronization service are available, both over the Internet and from proprietary sources.\n- When a non-SSO SAML profile uses the POST binding it must ensure that the receiver can perform timely subject confirmation. To this end, a SAML authentication assertion for the principal MUST be included in the POSTed form response.\n- Values for NotBefore and NotOnOrAfter attributes of SSO (Single Sign-On) assertions SHOULD have the shortest possible validity period consistent with successful communication of the assertion from Identity Provider to Service Provider site. This is typically on the order of a few minutes. This ensures that a stolen assertion can only be used successfully within a small time window.\n- The Service Provider site MUST check the validity period of all assertions obtained from the Identity Provider site and reject expired assertions. A Service Provider site MAY choose to implement a stricter test of validity for SSO assertions, such as requiring the assertion’s IssueInstant or AuthnInstant attribute value to be within a few minutes of the time at which the assertion is received at the Service Provider site.\n- If a received authentication statement includes a <saml:SubjectLocality> element with the IP address of the user, the Service Provider site MAY check the browser IP address against the IP address contained in the authentication statement.\nb. Man In the Middle Attack\nThreat: Since the Service Provider site obtains bearer SAML assertions from the user by means of an HTML form, a malicious site could impersonate the user at some new Service Provider site. The new Service Provider site would believe the malicious site to be the subject of the assertion.\nCountermeasures: The Service Provider site MUST check the Recipient attribute of the SAML response to ensure that its value matches the https://<assertion consumer host name and path>. As the response is digitally signed, the Recipient value cannot be altered by the malicious site.\nc. Forged Assertion\nThreat: A malicious user, or the browser user, could forge or alter a SAML assertion.\nCountermeasures: The browser/POST profile requires the SAML response carrying SAML assertions to be signed, thus providing both message integrity and authentication. The Service Provider site MUST verify the signature and authenticate the issuer.\nd. Browser State Exposure\nThreat: The browser/POST profile involves uploading of assertions from the web browser to a Service Provider site. This information is available as part of the web browser state and is usually stored in persistent storage on the user system in a completely unsecured fashion. The threat here is that the assertion may be “reused” at some later point in time.\nCountermeasures: Assertions communicated using this profile must always have short lifetimes and should have a <OneTimeUse> SAML assertion <Conditions> element. Service Provider sites are expected to ensure that the assertions are not re-used.\nThreat: Replay attacks amount to re-submission of the form in order to access a protected resource fraudulently.\nCountermeasures: The profile mandates that the assertions transferred have the one-use property at the Service Provider site, preventing replay attacks from succeeding.\nf. Modification or Exposure of state information\nThreat: Relay state tampering or fabrication, Some of the messages may carry a <RelayState> element, which is recommended to be integrity protected by the producer and optionally confidentiality- protected.

{"question":"Can you compare the testing environments used for multiple autonomous vehicles - how do they test aerial vs underwater robots?","answer":"The testing environments for aerial and underwater autonomous vehicles differ significantly. For aerial vehicles, testing is conducted in local ponds, with researchers using commercially available aircraft modified with small computers and working with first responders like the Virginia Tech Rescue Squad for real-world validation. In contrast, underwater vehicle testing occurs in specialized facilities like the Actual Sea Model Basin at the National Maritime Research Institute, which provides a controlled environment for testing formation control algorithms with multiple AUVs before implementing them in actual sea conditions.","context":["Funding for research to coordinate aerial and aquatic robots could improve emergency response\nOctober 4, 2016\nResearchers at Virginia Tech have been awarded nearly $900,000 by the National Science Foundation to improve emergency response by developing methods to coordinate teams of aerial and surface vehicles.\nDuring an aquatic emergency such as an oil spill or radiation leak, these vehicles could autonomously assess the extent of the contamination and transmit critical data to first responders.\nLeading the project are David Schmale, a professor of food safety and plant biosecurity in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, who has developed methods for using autonomous vehicles to detect contaminants, and Pratap Tokekar, an assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering in the College of Engineering who works on algorithms that enable robots to sense and gather data.\nThe research will require them to tackle a notoriously difficult problem in robotics: how to process and integrate information from different sources.\nUnmanned aerial vehicles equipped with cameras or other sensors can map a contaminated area and measure the extent of a spill; vehicles on the surface of the water can take physical samples in localized areas. Combining data from the two types of vehicles could yield information about both the scope and nature of the pollution.\n“You have a certain efficiency with the boat alone and with the aircraft alone, but when you couple them you achieve a whole new level of efficiency. And that’s the most important part,” Schmale said.\nThe aerial vehicles can act as scouts, flying higher for a broader view or lower for finer detail. Using this data, they can direct the surface vehicles to the best locations for sampling.\n“What we are really trying to do is come up with algorithmic tools so that the robots can share data among themselves and autonomously plan their paths,” Tokekar said. “And the ultimate hope is to have this in a loop with the emergency responders, to inform them of the extent and nature of the threat, so they can plan a better course of action.”\nIf the vehicles decide autonomously where to deploy and collect data, and how much information to exchange, the system can assemble a comprehensive picture of the contamination without endangering first responders, and freeing them to focus on other tasks.\nThe researchers will use commercially available aircraft modified with a small computer to allow on-board data processing and wireless communication with other vehicles. The surface vehicles will include a custom 3-D printed science package with a variety of sensors and sampling capabilities.\nSchmale and Tokekar have already conducted preliminary experiments, supported in part by funding from the Institute for Critical Technology and Applied Science; now, the team is gearing up for small-scale testing at local ponds this fall.\nThey want to ensure that the system is intuitive for first responders to use, providing clear, actionable information quickly. So the researchers will field-test their prototypes with the Virginia Tech Rescue Squad, a student group that handles around 1,200 calls every year. Their expertise will help inform the development of a system that would be useful in a real-world emergency situation.\n“The engagement of the Virginia Tech Rescue Squad is going to be key to the success of our project,” Schmale said.\nThe grant also includes funding to develop a robotics unit for a local high school. Using 3-D printers and the high school’s design bay, students will explore how to design an efficient sampling system for an autonomous surface vehicle.","Development of Testbed AUV for Formation Control and its Fundamental Experiment in Actual Sea Model Basin\nAkihiro Okamoto, Motonobu Imasato, Shunka C.

However, it is currently difficult to deploy such a package of AUVs for operation at sea because of their large size. The aim of our study is to create a demonstration system for formation control algorithms using actual hardware. To implement a prototype system, we developed a testbed AUV usable in a test basin and performed a simple formation control test in the Actual Sea Model Basin of the National Maritime Research Institute, Japan. Two AUVs, the simulated “virtual” leader and the developed “real” follower, communicate through an acoustic link and hence cruise to maintain a constant distance between them. Tests for more sophisticated formation control algorithms will be enabled using the system; consequently rapid implementation at sea will be realized.\n-  K. Kim and T.

{"question":"What major shift occurred in museum security strategies in recent years according to security experts?","answer":"The first major shift in museum security strategies since the late 1970s occurred in the past couple of years, driven by active shooter concerns and terrorism threats. Museums have become increasingly aware that they are now considered 'soft targets' for potential attacks.","context":["As public cultural centers become terrorist targets, museums are struggling to maintain their rarified atmosphere while also making sure their patrons feel safe. In the process, some are alienating some of their most storied employees: gallery guards, who fear new protocols will take the joy out of their jobs.\nThe past couple of years have seen the first big shift in museum security strategies since the late 1970s, says Steve Keller, an expert in the field for nearly 40 years. “With the active shooter concerns and the terrorism concerns, museums have suddenly become awakened to the fact that soft targets are now fair game,” says Keller.\nBut targets or not, these museums don’t want to lose their softness. “I get calls from museums where the director says, ‘We need to tighten up, but I don’t want to make it unwelcoming or make it look like there’s a problem,’” says Keller.\nThis balancing act requires various levels of decision-making, depending on the venue’s size and resources. Over the last week, Disney World, Disneyland, Universal Studios Orlando and Hollywood, and 11 SeaWorld locations all installed metal detectors—an option that Keller says would be “not very welcoming” in a more intimate environment. In the weeks after the Paris terror attacks, many European museums increased their security levels, implementing bag checks and funneling guests through smaller entrances, the Evening Standard reports.\nMeanwhile, smaller museums search for solutions apposite to their resources. In response to concerns from parents, the Hands On Children’s Museum in Olympia, Washington recently implemented a sign-in policy for visitors for the first time, and has begun training its staff to recognize unusual behavior.\nOften, the resulting changes hit gallery guards hardest. “I see a lot of museums that are very very concerned with having a 70-year-old lady standing at the front door, because she’s wonderful at public relations and not very good at stopping someone with a gun,” Keller says.\nGuards at the Museum of Fine Arts (MFA) in Boston picketed last week in protest of upcoming adjustments to their contracts, including proposed changes in training that would shift their professional priorities. The guards, many of whom took the jobs in order to guide patrons, safeguard the galleries, and answer questions about art, are dismayed that these aspects of the job may be supplanted by morning drills and outdoor patrols. “They want us to not focus on the artwork and be able to fight things like active shooters,” Evan Henderson, president of the Museum Independent Security Union, told the Boston Globe. Karen Frascona, the museum’s PR director, responded by calling such training “industry standard.”\nSome worry that stricter safety laws may literally damage collections—several director generals of British army museums have warned that their collections of historic weaponry could be “nearly destroyed” under proposed stricter European Union firearms directives. And the striking MFA guards fear that a reduced human presence in the galleries will endanger the collections, saying that new electronic security meant to take over while they’re at their new posts will not be enough to stop vandals. “If no one is there, artwork is damaged every day,” Henderson told Hyperallergic.\nKeller predicts improved security technology will reduce those concerns. And in the end, he says, the job of an art guard should involve more guarding and less art. “Many of the security guards who work in museums are really intelligent people who are doing it because they want to be around the art… they want to be able to talk about it,” says Keller. “It’s very hard for officers to understand that we shouldn’t be using them that way.” If security guards are hired and trained as true guards from the beginning, Keller says, these transitions will be less of an issue. “I think they’ll find over time that this is also enjoyable work,” he says. “Plus it’s a far cry less boring than just standing in a gallery.”"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:b71b71c9-cba0-436c-b177-ec92fc62cb6e>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Can you explain how the environmental impact of the Mean Sea Level wave energy project compares to the typical environmental concerns associated with wave power installations?","answer":"The Mean Sea Level project in Hermanus underwent a full environmental impact assessment and is being built on land leased from Cape Nature, with careful consideration of its environmental footprint. Meanwhile, typical wave power installations generally face several environmental challenges, including potential negative effects on marine ecosystems, risks to marine life from moving parts, potential water quality impacts from maintenance chemicals and lubricants, and the risk of electrocution from transmission systems. Both types of installations may create noise pollution from operational equipment, though the Hermanus project's on-shore location might minimize some of the typical marine ecosystem impacts associated with offshore wave power installations.","context":["Construction of 1 MW wave-energy pilot project under way in Hermanus\nPhoto by: Mean Sea Level\nA South African wave-energy start-up is building a pioneering 1 MW pilot project, based on its patented homegrown design, which will supply clean electricity to a large-scale Hermanus abalone farm, in the Western Cape.\nMean Sea Level (MSL) is developing the first-of-its-kind project with equity investments from the Industrial Development Corporation, angel investors and aquaculture group Abagold, which produces 500 t of abalone yearly.\nConstruction of the R30-million pilot plant has also received grant funding secured from EEP Africa, a multidonor fund that provides early-stage financing to innovative clean-energy projects.\nAbagold is a shareholder in MSL and the company’s founder, Pierre Hugo, has been central to the identification and the co-design of the wave energy converter (WEC) solution being deployed.\nThe plant, which is 25% completed, is being built on land leased from Cape Nature and will neighbour the site occupied by Abagold, supplying electricity to drive its pumps and blowers. A full environmental impact assessment was, thus, required ahead of the construction.\nOnce proven, MSL plans to construct a larger 3.5 MW commercial wave-power plant at an adjacent sea-front site on the same property.\nMSL CEO and engineer Marius Hugo, who is also Pierre’s son, tells Engineering News Online that the world-first solution has been developed in response to Abagold’s search for a clean alternative that is able to consistently match the abalone farm’s 3 MW, around-the-clock electricity requirement.\nThe abalone farm currently sources its electricity from the local Overstrand municipality.\nThe WEC design has been developed using lessons garnered over three decades of aquaculture experience, which have proven critical in determining not only the most suitable marine civil construction techniques, but also the nature of the construction materials, which have to be able to withstand the hostile and corrosive conditions.\nIn 2014, MSL was established by Abagold and Marius Hugo with the aim of developing the technology and building the first two converters for Abagold.\nThe “simple” solution, Marius Hugo explains, exploits the classical principle of “overtopping”, whereby the wave is captured in a dam as it overtops the lip of the slope. The captured water’s gravity, or potential energy, then feeds back into the sea through a hydroelectric turbine to generate electricity.\nPractically, the solution involves building a dam next to the ocean, with the wall facing the oncoming waves having the energy converter slope. The waves run up and over the wall, or through non-return valves in the wall.\nThe water is then captured in the common buffer dam, behind the wall, at a hydraulic head above mean sea level. The head is then released through low-head turbines into a turbine stabilisation dam, which only allows water to flow back to the ocean.\nThe overtopping design has been optimised to convert a maximum amount of kinetic energy to potential energy through what Hugo describes as novel multilevel nonreturn valves with momentum splitting edges on the wall slope and a common buffer dam.\n“Our WEC design requires an energetic coastline, ideally with a solid rock ocean bed on which to construct the converter dam. Looking at the global wave energy resource map, all regions rated with wave energy resources above 20 kW/m could be suitable.\n“South Africa is particularly well endowed with wave-energy resources, with almost all of our coastline being viable. The south coast, in particular, can go up to 60 kW/m,” Hugo explains.\nBuilding the converter on-shore lowers the overall cost of the solution, as it negates the requirement for device mooring, underwater cabling, ships, dry-docks and, to a lesser extent, divers.\nThe power offtake agreement for the pilot project, which is scheduled to begin producing electricity from mid-2020, has been set at a discounted rate to Abagold’s current power costs.\nThe offtake agreements for the 3.5 MW project will be set on commercial terms, but Hugo says it will be far more cost competitive than the pilot, which is burdened with the full research and development costs.\n“For the commercial plant, we are targeting a levelised cost of energy, or LCOE, of below R1/kWh.”\nHugo says a key factor in achieving a low LCOE, is the high availability factor of the wave-energy resource, which is considered to be near baseload in character.\nHugo is optimistic that MSL’s first two projects will help identify and negate the technical and environmental constraints for including wave energy in future editions of South Africa’s Integrated Resource Plan, which outlines the technologies that will be considered for inclusion in utility-scale procurement programmes.\nHe is also confident that the second project will go some way to moving the economic constraints currently associated with wave-energy power stations, which have been prohibitively expensive when compared with variable renewable energy technologies such as wind and solar photovoltaic.\nThe pilot site is being constructed using locally developed technology, as well as domestic expertise, materials and manufacturing.\n“In the process, some of us were quite far from our comfort zones, including the team that needed to learn to swim.\n“But through a combination of hiring and training, we have built an exceptional team, which is striving towards a world first,” Hugo enthuses, adding that he is hopeful that the technology could even spawn an entirely new industry for the country.","17 Wave Power Advantages and Disadvantages Explained\nWave power is a renewable form of power that is generated from wave energy, using mechanical and electromagnetic technologies. Wave power advantages and disadvantages are; reliability, renewable operation, sustainability, fossil fuel independence, high potential, versatility, flexibility, consistency, minimal maintenance (advantages); cost, usability, weather susceptibility, technical limitations, transmission challenges, navigation problems, geographic constraints (disadvantages).\nThe characteristics of wave power and wave energy can be analyzed simultaneously, since wave power is a product of the conversion of wave energy.\nThis article discusses the advantages and disadvantages of wave power, as outlined below;\n-Advantages of Wave Power (and Wave Energy)\n-Disadvantages of Wave Power (and Wave Energy)\nAdvantages of Wave Power (and Wave Energy)\n1). Wave Power is Reliable\nWhen compared to other types of renewable energy, wave energy is significantly reliable.\nThis is because, unlike solar and wind intensity which change continuously with geographic conditions, wave motion occurs almost on a consistent basis.\nAnother way to describe the reliability of wave power is to state that, although the amount of wave energy (which is the source of wave power) may vary at different times, it is hardly ever equal to zero. There is an average amount of wave energy that is always available.\nWave power is reliable mainly because it does not depend on one variable. Unlike fossil fuels, solar and wind, wave energy originates from different sources, including solar heat, wind current, and Earth rotation.\nThe role of gravity in producing wave energy is yet another reason why it is reliable. Gravitational forces cause waves to occur in the ocean, as they try to balance the distribution of momentum across the water body, and to restore equilibrium after the disrupting effects of wind and solar radiation.\nThis settling effect and gravitational pull constantly works against the disrupting forces, leading to wave energy production. As a result, wave power can always be generated, although it may vary in magnitude at different times.\n2). Wave Power is Renewable\nWave power is renewable because wave energy is produced from solar, wind gravity and water, which are all renewable resources.\nWhile other types of power and energy are affected by changes like fuel availability and global warming, the oceans will always exist, as well as wind, gravity and solar radiation.\nWhat this implies is that electricity generation from wave energy will always be possible.\n3). Fossil Fuel Independence\nBecause wave power is renewable and reliable, it can serve as a substitute to fossil fuels, in its own capacity.\nIn spite of the advantages of wave power, it is an underdeveloped renewable resource . One of the reasons for this is the fact that adequate effort is yet to be made toward the development of wave energy technology.\nFossil fuels, on the other hand, constitute the most developed energy sector. Over-dependence on fossil fuels has economic and environmental disadvantages, which can be reduced by increasing the prominence and effectiveness of wave power.\nThe word ‘sustainable’ resonates with some important concepts, such as sustainability and sustainable development.\nThere are different reasons why wave power is sustainable. These reasons span across the three aspects of sustainability, which are environmental, social and economic.\nWave power is considered by many environment-friendly. The conversion of wave energy does not typically have any negative effects on water, soil or air quality.\nWave energy technologies and mechanisms are relatively simple, and do not emit any hazardous byproducts like greenhouse gases, toxins, and wastes .\nThe aesthetic impact and spatial footprint of wave power plants are also small, because these plants do not occupy large portions of the ocean, are often partially submerged.\nWhat this means is that wave power generation is a conservative practice. Estimates suggest that a 30MW wave power plant will occupy less than half square mile in the ocean.\nBecause it is mostly done offshore, wave power generation does not cause any notable damage to the land. This is unlike fossil fuels, which are known to cause significant soil and water pollution , or wind turbines and bioenergy plants that may cause aesthetic or air pollution.\nWhat all of these implies is that wave power is not a potential cause of environmental degradation.\nOther advantages such as reliability and renewable production, suggest that wave power is also sustainable and beneficial from social and economic perspectives.\n5). High Potential\nWave power has a relatively high potential because wave energy can be produced in large quantities .\nA vast amount of wave kinetic energy is generated in the oceans on a consistent basis. A reason for this is the vast scale of the oceans, and the magnitude of wind, solar and gravitational forces that act upon the ocean water.\nThe result is a very high energy density and energy efficiency of waves.\nAt the same time, the vastness of the oceans implies that wave energy can be accessed in all parts of the Earth. With availability, reliability, efficiency and high density, it can be said that the potential of wave power is significant.\nThis potential can be put to use simply by developing efficient technologies to harness wave energy and generate electricity.\n6). Versatility and Flexibility of Wave Power Generation and Consumption\nWave power generation is a versatile and flexible practice for different reasons.\nThe flexibility of wave power arises from the fact that it can be generated under a variety of conditions.\nThere are different devices, mechanisms and technologies for converting wave energy to wave power. These include barrages, longitudinal buoys, point absorbers, hydraulic piston systems, among others.\nVarious locations on the ocean are suitable for installing wave power plants, because wave energy is widely distributed across the water body.\nThis reduces the environmental impact of the wave power generation process, as plants can be installed in locations where there us minimal environmental effect, such as offshore areas.\nThe scale of wave power generation is flexible as well. It can be scaled up or down based on the size and design of the wave energy converter or power plant.\nIn terms of versatility, there is a variety of possible uses, of wave power. These include desalination, seawater pumping, and electricity generation.\nCompared to other power and energy sources, wave power is fairly consistent.\nThis is because wave energy is reliable, and its magnitude of output can be estimated with some accuracy.\nIt can therefore be said that wave power is ‘predictable’, because of the existence of a consistent, average amount of wave energy at all times.\n8). Wave Power Requires Minimal Maintenance\nBecause wave power plants are relatively simple in their design, the amount of maintenance required by these systems is much less than that which is required by other power plants.\nWhile some wave power plants are expensive to design, construct and install, there are various avenues where cost is minimized during the operational life of the plant.\nThese include hazard control, fuel usage and vandalism, among others.\nDisadvantages of Wave Power (and Wave Energy)\n1). Capital Cost of Wave Power Plants\nThe capital cost of generating wave power is relatively high, mainly because it is an underdeveloped sector.\nSince there have not been many wave power plant projects so far, the cost of acquiring equipment and carrying out the design and construction of these plants, is yet to be optimized.\nAlso, most wave power plants at this time, are built as a result of intensive research and development projects that are directed toward improving the efficiency and performance of wave power.\nSuch research and development projects add significant expense to the wave power generation effort.\nAlthough the power plants are relatively simple and require minimal maintenance, they are susceptible to corrosion as a result of prolonged exposure to seawater .\nThis means that corrosion-resistant materials must be used for building wave power plants, and these exposed metal parts must be assessed routinely to ensure that they are not damaged.\n2). Scale of Usability\nAlthough the amount of wave power produced by a plant depends directly on the size of the plant, there has not been much progress so far in terms of developing and implementing a practical wave power generation plant.\nExisting wave power plants are generally not yet capable of delivering utility-scale power for domestic use. This is a major setback, and limits the actual utilization of wave power.\n3). Wave Power Plants are Susceptible to Weather Hazards\nWave energy capture devices and other technologies used in wave power generation, are constantly exposed to the elements.\nThis exposure means that the equipment can get damaged or impaired due to harsh circumstances of operation.\nAsides the risk of damage, exposure of wave power equipment to harsh weather elements may reduce the performance of these equipment . The efficiency and scale of electricity generation are therefore inhibited at such times.\n4). Impact on the Marine Ecosystem\nIn order to capture wave energy and generate wave power, facilities must be installed on the ocean.\nHowever, this can have some negative effects on the biotic and abiotic components of the marine ecosystem .\nIn addition to occupying the natural habitat of marine species, wave power plants have moving parts that can be dangerous to marine life. Since water is a conductive material, there is also the risk of electrocution by transmission systems that are linked to wave power plants.\nChemicals used to operate and maintain the wave power equipment, such as lubricants, can also act as toxins, and may negatively affect water quality in the marine ecosystem.\n5). Technological Limitations of Wave Power Technology\nWave power also has some technological limitations.\nThese limitations arise solely from the fact that wave power technology is still a developing field and has not seen sufficient inputs and modifications to optimize its potential.\nAlso, because there are relatively few wave power systems that have been developed so far, there is not much practical information available to serve as a reference point for improvement.\nThe result of these conditions is a low technical-efficiency form of wave power, which does not meet the existing energy needs.\n6). Wave Power Transmission Challenges\nThere are two main reasons why wave power is often challenging to transmit.\nOne of these is the fact that wave power technology has some practical limitations. As a result, the transmission mechanism for electricity produced by wave power systems, has not been well developed.\nAnother reason is the obvious fact that wave power is produced offshore. Aside applications like water pumping where wave power is used offshore, it must be transmitted over long distances to the shore where it is needed.\nSuch long-distance transport of electricity across the ocean to the land is a notable challenge that affects the use of wave power.\n7). Sea Navigation may be Affected\nWave power facilities that have been installed offshore can affect navigation on the sea.\nThis is because such facilities may become obstacles within the travel route of marine vessels of various types.\nThe effect of such circumstances can be bad for the economy, as they could affect the marine economy by reducing the speed and sustainability of export and import, sea travel, tourism, fishing, and other marine-based activities.\n8). Noise Pollution May Occur\nThe equipment needed to convert wave energy to power, usually consist of moveable parts and generators.\nThese components can be loud when operating, and can cause significant, continuous noise pollution, that may affect inhabitants of the surrounding environs.\n9). Geographical Constraints of Wave Power Generation\nThere are geographical constraints involved in the generation and consumption of wave power.\nTo begin with, wave power generation varies with location. While wave energy is always being produced, not every marine region may produce enough energy to be harnessed in a profitable manner.\nThere may also be restrictions to the installation of wave power plants in some areas. This is especially the case in places where the marine sector is a notable aspect of the economy.\nLastly, wave power can only be beneficial where there are usable and reliable transmission schemes to send the electricity to where it will be used. In many coastal regions, such schemes and facilities are not available.\nWave power advantages and disadvantages are as follows;\nAdvantages of wave power are;\n- Wave Power is Reliable\n- Wave Power is Renewable\n- Fossil Fuel Independence\n- High Potential\n- Versatility and Flexibility of Wave Power Generation and Consumption\n- Wave Power Requires Minimal Maintenance\nDisadvantages of Wave Power are;\n- Capital Cost of Wave Power Plants\n- Scale of Usability\n- Wave Power Plants are Susceptible to Weather Hazards\n- Impact on the Marine Ecosystem\n- Technological Limitations of Wave Power Technology\n- Wave Power Transmission Challenges\n- Sea Navigation may be Affected\n- Noise Pollution May Occur\n- Geographical Constraints of Wave Power Generation\n1).

{"question":"How do the cleaning and maintenance requirements differ between acrylic and cast iron bathtubs?","answer":"Acrylic bathtubs require simple maintenance - they can be cleaned with just a soft cloth and soapy water, followed by rinsing with clean water and wiping dry, with no special cleaning agents required. Cast iron bathtubs, while more durable, may need occasional resurfacing and can be painted, though this requires specific preparation work to ensure a good finish. Cast iron tubs are noted for their longevity, staying in perfect condition for much longer than other types and not turning yellow as easily as standard baths.","context":["Choosing a bathroom suite very often depends on the type of bath you want and this page is designed to answer the most common questions asked by people visiting bathroom showrooms.\nChoosing between acrylic baths, steel baths or cast iron baths is not simply a matter of cost and knowing about the material your bath is made from can help you in many ways. Not least on installation.\nI Want a Bath Which Allows me to Fit the Taps on the Wall\nNo problem. Most manufacturers have a range of baths with no pre cut tap holes. This will allow you to not only fit wall mounted taps, but cut your own tap holes if you would like to and have the taps anywhere you like.\nHow do I Fit Taps in a Bath With no Tap Holes?\nSee our project on using a hole saw and buy a hole saw of the correct size. 35mm is the most common size for taps in the UK. You will need an arbor for your hole saw. This is the small drill bit which acts as a guide and is fixed inside the centre of the hole saw. You can find out more about how to use a holesaw by clicking through to our project on using holesaws.\nWhat is the Best Way to Clean an Acrylic Bath?\nUse a soft cloth and some soapy water. Then rinse with clean water and wipe dry. No special agents are required to get a good clean acrylic bath.\nAre Acrylic Baths as Good as Other Types?\nAll baths should meet BS 4305 part 1/EN198. This ensures that their quality is guaranteed. The process of manufacturing and the cost of the materials usually makes acrylic baths cheaper than others but this does not mean they are inferior. To learn more about acrylic baths check out our project page.\nIf I Buy a Cast Iron Bath, can I Paint it?\nIn short, yes you can but there is some preparation work needed first to ensure that the finish is as good as it possibly can be. See our project on painting cast iron baths for more information and also check out our project on cast iron baths for general information.\nDo all Types of Bath Come in Different Colours?\nYes but the range of different colours in acrylic is much greater that that of cast iron and steel. This is because of the process required to colour porcelain enamel and its difficulty compared to colouring acrylic sheets.\nWhich Type of Bath Gives me the Greater Range of Styles?\nAgain, acrylic baths have a much greater range of styles because of the ease of moulding an acrylic sheet compared to shaping steel or cast iron moulds. More information on baths and bathrooms can be found in our bathroom projects section.\nIs a Special Water Supply Necessary for a Whirlpool Bath?\nNo a normal hot and cold water supply can be used for a whirlpool bath which, if installed correctly, should be quiet and efficient.\nDon't I need a Huge Bathroom for a Whirlpool Bath?\nNo, as the majority of whirlpool baths are acrylic they are made in all shapes and sizes and there are manufacturers about who specialise in producing goods for smaller bathrooms.\nHow do I Resurface an old Bath?\nTo find out how to repair or resurface an old bath and give it a new lease of life take a look at our project on bath repairs and resurfacing.\nDo I Need to Buy a Complete Suite From one Supplier or can I Buy the Different Parts From Different People?\nIts recommended that you buy bathroom suites from a single manufacturer. Bathroom suites can vary in shade and buying from different suppliers can lead to different colours. If you have no wish for everything to be the same however, you can buy from as many different people as you like.","There is nothing as beautiful as a cast iron bathtub in a newly renovated bathroom. However, there are more benefits in having a cast iron bathtub than just the beauty of it. The one thing that you should know is this type of bathtub is really heavy. And, it can be too heavy for just any bathroom floor. Its why you should make about what the cast iron tub weighs. In order for you to know if your floor is strong and durable enough for this type of bathtub. This is everything that you need to know about how much a cast iron bathtub weighs and some other, essential information about these bathtubs.\nBenefits of installing a cast iron bathtub in your bathroom\nFirst of all, why are there so many people that are considering installing a cast iron bathtub in their bathrooms? These bathtubs are a lot more expensive than other tubs that are basically doing the same thing.\nThe first benefit is durability. These tubs are staying in perfect condition for much longer. It doesn’t turn yellow as easily as other, everyday baths. It really looks great, if you are walking into a bathroom and you are seeing a cast iron bathtub. It feels like you can get into the bath and enjoy a long bath right at that moment. They are investments to any home and adding value to the home.\nWhy should you know exactly what a cast iron bathtub weigh?\nIt is essential to know exactly what a cast iron bathtub weight. This is because these baths are really heavy and can damage any floor. You should normally need to strengthen the floor of a bathroom that has a cast iron bath in. And, if the bathroom is on the second floor, it is even more important to know.\nSome cast iron bathtubs are a lot heavier than other cast iron baths, and, this is something to consider if you have a delicate floor, or as said before, if the bathroom is on the second floor. The contractor is normally doing the calculations to ensure that even with a bathtub full of water, the floor will be strong enough to hold the bathtub without any problems.\nDifferent size cast iron tubs weigh differently\nSomething else to know is that different type and different size cast iron bathtubs has different weights. And, it is important to know exactly the weight of the tub that you are going to purchase. Even, if you are hiring a contractor to upgrade your bathroom.\nHe needs to know the weight of the tub in order to strengthen the floor correctly. Just to say to him that you have ordered a cast iron tub, won’t be enough information. He needs to know the exact type of bath that you have purchased and the total weight before and after water.\nSamples if different tubs with their weighs\nHere is some sample of how different cast iron bathtubs can weigh differently. And, this can assist you in finding the right tub that will be the right weight for your bathroom floor. An average bathtub can weigh between 240 and 500 pounds depending on the size and style.\n- Pegasus Claw Feet Tub weight without water is about 247pound and in total it can go up to 738 pounds with water.\n- KOHLER Seaforth Tub has weight without water of about 277 pounds and in total it can go up to 743 pounds with water.\n- Barclay Products Lion Paw Feet Tub has a weight without water of about 364 pounds and with water is can go up to 914 pounds.\nRemember that the water in the bathtub is added to the weight\nIt is really important to calculate the weight of the water in the bathtub as well when you want to find out if the floor is going to be strong enough for the floor. You might say that the water isn’t staying long enough in the bathtub to cause damage, but this is where most people are wrong.\nWith the floor not strong enough, even a small weight difference in a short period can cause damage. And a small amount of damage done over a long period of time can become a lot of damage and become seriously dangerous. Especially, when the bathroom is on the second or third floor. This is why you always should calculate the weight of the water with the tub when you are installing a cast iron bathtub.\nIt is important to know the weight of a cast-iron bathtub before you install it in your newly renovated bathroom. You should make sure that your floor is strong enough to hold this heavy bathtub safely. There are many benefits of having a cast iron bath, but then you should make sure that your bathroom floor is strong enough to take the weight of this heavy bathtub."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:ba93e5c2-3cd0-4619-a7df-f4ac440fc55d>","<urn:uuid:60913687-6e8d-4b8e-af7c-ec1507902310>"],"error":null}
{"question":"For my research on British-French colonial rivalry, I want to understand both the territorial exchanges in the 1763 Treaty of Paris and the subsequent colonial taxation disputes. Could you explain these?","answer":"In the 1763 Treaty of Paris, Britain gained most of France's North American possessions, including Canada and territories east of the Mississippi River. France retained only fishing rights off Newfoundland and the small islands of Saint Pierre and Miquelon, while regaining Guadeloupe and Martinique. After the treaty, Britain's relationship with its colonies deteriorated due to taxation issues. Parliament passed the Declaratory Act asserting its right to bind the colonies 'in all cases whatsoever,' followed by the Townshend Acts imposing import taxes on goods like glass, paper, lead, and tea. These taxes led to colonial resistance through measures such as non-importation agreements and protests, ultimately contributing to increasing tensions between Britain and its American colonies.","context":["The combatants of the Seven Years' War as shown before the outbreak of war in the mid-1750s.\nGreat Britain, Prussia, Portugal, with allies\nFrance, Spain, Austria, Russia, with allies\n|Context||End of the Seven Years' War (known as the French and Indian War in the United States)|\n|Signed||10 February 1763|\n|See also: Treaty of Hubertusburg (1763), Treaty of Paris (1783).|\n|Part of a series on the|\n| Constitution |\n|Politics of Canada portal|\nThe Treaty of Paris, also known as the Treaty of 1763, was signed on 10 February 1763 by the kingdoms of Great Britain, France and Spain, with Portugal in agreement, after Great Britain's victory over France and Spain during the Seven Years' War.\nThe signing of the treaty formally ended the Seven Years' War, known as the French and Indian War in the North American theatre,and marked the beginning of an era of British dominance outside Europe. Great Britain and France each returned much of the territory that they had captured during the war, but Great Britain gained much of France's possessions in North America. Additionally, Great Britain agreed to protect Roman Catholicism in the New World. The treaty did not involve Prussia and Austria as they signed a separate agreement, the Treaty of Hubertusburg, five days later.\nDuring the war, Great Britain had conquered the French colonies of Canada, Guadeloupe, Saint Lucia, Dominica, Grenada, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and Tobago, the French \"factories\" (trading posts) in India, the slave-trading station at Gorée, the Sénégal River and its settlements, and the Spanish colonies of Manila (in the Philippines) and Havana (in Cuba). France had captured Minorca and British trading posts in Sumatra, while Spain had captured the border fortress of Almeida in Portugal, and Colonia del Sacramento in South America.[ citation needed ]\nIn the treaty, most of these territories were restored to their original owners, but not all: Britain made considerable gains.France and Spain restored all their conquests to Britain and Portugal. Britain restored Manila and Havana to Spain, and Guadeloupe, Martinique, Saint Lucia, Gorée, and the Indian factories to France. In return, France recognized the sovereignty of Britain over Canada, Dominica, Grenada, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and Tobago. France also ceded the eastern half of French Louisiana to Britain; that is, the area from the Mississippi River to the Appalachian Mountains.\nSpain ceded Florida to Britain.France had already secretly given Louisiana to Spain in the Treaty of Fontainebleau (1762). In addition, while France regained its factories in India, France recognized British clients as the rulers of key Indian native states, and pledged not to send troops to Bengal. Britain agreed to demolish its fortifications in British Honduras (now Belize), but retained a logwood-cutting colony there. Britain confirmed the right of its new subjects to practise Catholicism.\nFrance lost all of its territory in mainland North America, but had retained fishing rights off Newfoundland and the two small islands of Saint Pierre and Miquelon, where its fishermen could dry their catch. In turn France gained the return of its sugar colony, Guadeloupe, which it considered more valuable than Canada.Voltaire had notoriously dismissed Canada as \"Quelques arpents de neige\", \"A few acres of snow\".\nThe Treaty of Paris is frequently noted as the point at which France gave Louisiana to Spain.The transfer, however, occurred with the Treaty of Fontainebleau (1762) but was not publicly announced until 1764. The Treaty of Paris gave Britain the east side of the Mississippi (including Baton Rouge, Louisiana, which was to be part of the British territory of West Florida). New Orleans on the east side remained in French hands (albeit temporarily). The Mississippi River corridor in what is modern day Louisiana was later reunited following the Louisiana Purchase in 1803 and the Adams–Onís Treaty in 1819.\nThe 1763 treaty states in Article VII:\nVII. In order to reestablish peace on solid and durable foundations, and to remove for ever all subject of dispute with regard to the limits of the British and French territories on the continent of America; it is agreed, that, for the future, the confines between the dominions of his Britannick Majesty and those of his Most Christian Majesty, in that part of the world, shall be fixed irrevocably by a line drawn along the middle of the River Mississippi, from its source to the river Iberville, and from thence, by a line drawn along the middle of this river, and the lakes Maurepas and Pontchartrain to the sea; and for this purpose, the Most Christian King cedes in full right, and guaranties to his Britannick Majesty the river and port of the Mobile, and every thing which he possesses, or ought to possess, on the left side of the river Mississippi, except the town of New Orleans and the island in which it is situated, which shall remain to France, provided that the navigation of the river Mississippi shall be equally free, as well to the subjects of Great Britain as to those of France, in its whole breadth and length, from its source to the sea, and expressly that part which is between the said island of New Orleans and the right bank of that river, as well as the passage both in and out of its mouth: It is farther stipulated, that the vessels belonging to the subjects of either nation shall not be stopped, visited, or subjected to the payment of any duty whatsoever. The stipulations inserted in the IVth article, in favour of the inhabitants of Canada shall also take place with regard to the inhabitants of the countries ceded by this article.\nWhile the war was fought all over the world, the British began the war over French possessions in North America. million a year in sugar, versus Canada which was expensive to keep, Great Britain decided to keep Canada for strategic reasons and return Guadeloupe to France. While the war had weakened France, it was still a European power. British Prime Minister Lord Bute wanted a peace that would not aggravate France towards a second war.After a long debate of the relative merits of Guadeloupe, which produced £6\nAlthough the Protestant British worried about having so many Roman Catholic subjects, Great Britain did not want to antagonize France through expulsion or forced conversion. Also, it did not want French settlers to leave Canada to strengthen other French settlements in North America.\nUnlike Lord Bute, the French Foreign Minister the Duke of Choiseul expected a return to war. However, France needed peace to rebuild. 114 In Canada, France wanted open emigration for those, such as nobility, who would not swear allegiance to the British Crown. Lastly, France required protection for Roman Catholics in North America.[ citation needed ]French diplomats believed that without France to keep the Americans in check, the colonists might attempt to revolt. :\nThe article states:\nIV. His Most Christian Majesty renounces all pretensions which he has heretofore formed or might have formed to Nova Scotia or Acadia in all its parts, and guaranties the whole of it, and with all its dependencies, to the King of Great Britain: Moreover, his Most Christian Majesty cedes and guaranties to his said Britannick Majesty, in full right, Canada, with all its dependencies, as well as the island of Cape Breton, and all the other islands and coasts in the gulph and river of St. Lawrence, and in general, every thing that depends on the said countries, lands, islands, and coasts, with the sovereignty, property, possession, and all rights acquired by treaty, or otherwise, which the Most Christian King and the Crown of France have had till now over the said countries, lands, islands, places, coasts, and their inhabitants, so that the Most Christian King cedes and makes over the whole to the said King, and to the Crown of Great Britain, and that in the most ample manner and form, without restriction, and without any liberty to depart from the said cession and guaranty under any pretence, or to disturb Great Britain in the possessions above mentioned. His Britannick Majesty, on his side, agrees to grant the liberty of the Catholick religion to the inhabitants of Canada: he will, in consequence, give the most precise and most effectual orders, that his new Roman Catholic subjects may profess the worship of their religion according to the rites of the Romish church, as far as the laws of Great Britain permit. His Britannick Majesty farther agrees, that the French inhabitants, or others who had been subjects of the Most Christian King in Canada, may retire with all safety and freedom wherever they shall think proper, and may sell their estates, provided it be to the subjects of his Britannick Majesty, and bring away their effects as well as their persons, without being restrained in their emigration, under any pretence whatsoever, except that of debts or of criminal prosecutions: The term limited for this emigration shall be fixed to the space of eighteen months, to be computed from the day of the exchange of the ratification of the present treaty.\nDuring the negotiations that led to the treaty, a major issue of dispute between Britain and France had been over the status of the fortifications of the French coastal settlement of Dunkirk. The British had long feared that it would be used as a staging post to launch a French invasion of Britain. Under the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713 they had forced France to concede extreme limits on the fortifications there. The 1748 Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle had allowed more generous terms,and France had constructed greater defences for the town.\nBy the Treaty Britain forced France to accept the earlier 1713 conditions and demolish the fortifications they had constructed since then.This would be a continuing source of resentment to France, who would eventually have this clause overturned in the 1783 Treaty of Paris which brought an end to the American Revolutionary War.\nWhen Lord Bute became Prime Minister in 1762, he pushed for a resolution to the war with France and Spain, fearing that Great Britain could not govern all of its newly acquired territories. In what Winston Churchill would later term a policy of \"appeasement,\" Bute returned some colonies to Spain and France in the negotiations.Despite a desire for peace, many in the British parliament opposed the return of any gains made during the war. Notable among the opposition was former Prime Minister William Pitt, the Elder, who warned that the terms of the treaty would only lead to further conflicts once France and Spain had time to rebuild. \"The peace was insecure,\" he would later say, \"because it restored the enemy to her former greatness. The peace was inadequate, because the places gained were no equivalent for the places surrendered.\" The treaty passed by 319 votes to 65 opposed.\nThe Treaty of Paris took no consideration of Great Britain's battered continental ally, Frederick II of Prussia. Frederick was forced to negotiate peace terms separately in the Treaty of Hubertusburg. For decades after the signing of the Treaty of Paris, Frederick II decried it as a British betrayal.[ citation needed ]\nThe American colonists were disappointed by the protection of Roman Catholicism in the Treaty of Paris because of their own strong Protestant faith.Some have pointed to this as one reason for the breakdown of American–British relations.\nThe article provided for unrestrained emigration for 18 months from Canada. However, passage on British ships was expensive.A total of 1,600 people left New France through the Treaty clause, but only 270 French Canadians. Some have claimed that this was part of British policy to limit emigration.\nArticle IV of the treaty allowed Roman Catholicism to be practised in Canada.George III agreed to allow Catholicism within the laws of Great Britain. In this period, British laws included various Test Acts to prevent governmental, judicial, and bureaucratic appointments from going to Roman Catholics. Roman Catholics were believed to be agents of the Jacobite Pretenders to the throne, who normally resided in France supported by the French regime. This was relaxed in Quebec to some degree, but top positions like governorships were still held by Anglicans.\nArticle IV has also been cited as the basis for Quebec often having its unique set of laws that are different from the rest of Canada. There was a general constitutional principle in the United Kingdom to allow colonies taken through conquest to continue their own laws.This was limited by royal prerogative, and the monarch could still choose to change the accepted laws in a conquered colony. However, the treaty eliminated this power because by a different constitutional principle, terms of a treaty were considered paramount. In practice, Roman Catholics could become jurors in inferior courts in Quebec and argue based on principles of French law. However, the judge was British and his opinion on French law could be limited or hostile. If the case was appealed to a superior court, neither French law nor Roman Catholic jurors were allowed.\nMany French residents of what are now Canada's Maritime provinces, called Acadians, were deported during the Great Expulsion (1755–63). After the signing of the peace treaty guaranteed some rights to Roman Catholics, some Acadians returned to Canada. However, they were no longer welcome in English Nova Scotia.They were forced into New Brunswick, which is a bilingual province today as a result of that relocation.\nMuch land previously owned by France was now owned by Britain, and the French people of Quebec felt great betrayal at the French concession. Commander-in-Chief of the British Jeffrey Amherst noted that, \"Many of the Canadians consider their Colony to be of utmost consequence to France & cannot be convinced … that their Country has been conceded to Great Britain\".\nIn a nutshell, Britain emerged as the world's leading colonial empire.\nHis Britannick Majesty, on his side, agrees to grant the liberty of the Roman Catholic religion to the inhabitants of Canada.\n|Wikisource has original text related to this article:|\n|Wikimedia Commons has media related to Treaty of Paris (1763) .|","\"Nervous tension\" is the term that best describes the relationship between the American colonies and England in the aftermath of the Stamp Act repeal.\nSeveral issues remained unresolved. First, Parliament had absolutely no wish to send a message across the Atlantic that ultimate authority lay in the colonial legislatures. Immediately after repealing the Stamp Act, Parliament issued the Declaratory Act.\nThis act proclaimed Parliament's ability \"to bind the colonies in all cases whatsoever.\" The message was clear: under no circumstances did Parliament abandon in principle its right to legislate for the 13 colonies.\nIn the Western Hemisphere, leaders were optimistic about the repeal of the Stamp Act but found the suggestions of the Declaratory Act threatening. Most American statesmen had drawn a clear line between legislation and taxation. In 1766, the notion of Parliamentary supremacy over the law was questioned only by a radical few, but the ability to tax without representation was another matter. The Declaratory Act made no such distinction. \"All cases whatsoever\" could surely mean the power to tax. Many assemblymen waited anxiously for the issue to resurface.\nFrom infancy I was taught to love humanity and liberty. Inquiry and experience have since confirmed my reverence for the lessons then given me by convincing me more fully of their truth and excellence. Benevolence toward mankind excites wishes for their welfare, and such wishes endear the means of fulfilling them. These can be found in liberty only, and therefore her sacred cause ought to be espoused by every man, on every occasion, to the utmost of his power. As a charitable but poor person does not withhold his mite because he cannot relieve all the distresses of the miserable, so should not any honest man suppress his sentiments concerning freedom, however small their influence is likely to be. Perhaps he may \"touch some wheel\" that will have an effect greater than he could reasonably expect...\n– John Dickinson, Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania to the Inhabitants of the British Colonies (1767)\nSure enough, the \"truce\" did not last long. Back in London, Charles Townshend persuaded the House of Commons to once again tax the Americans, this time through an import tax on such items as glass, paper, lead, and tea.\nTownshend had ulterior motives, however. The revenue from these duties would now be used to pay the salaries of colonial governors. This was not an insignificant change. Traditionally, the legislatures of the colonies held the authority to pay the governors. It was not uncommon for a governor's salary to be withheld if the legislature became dissatisfied with any particular decision. The legislature could, in effect, blackmail the governor into submission. Once this important leverage was removed, the governors could be freer to oppose the assemblies.\nTownshend went further by appointing an American Board of Customs Commissioners. This body would be stationed in the colonies to enforce compliance with tax policy. Customs officials received bonuses for every convicted smuggler, so there were obvious incentives to capture Americans. Given that violators were tried in juryless admiralty courts, there was a high chance of conviction.\nTownshend also pressed the Americans to the limit by suspending the New York legislature for failing to provide adequate supplies for the British troops stationed there. Another showdown appeared imminent.\nReactions in the colonies were similar to those during the Stamp Act Crisis. Once again nonimportation was implemented. Extralegal activities such as harassing tax collectors and merchants who violated the boycotts were common.

My research advances ecological engineering by exploring the potential of novel technologies to monitor urban ecology, particularly urban soils and forests. I believe technology can be a powerful tool—and in this series, I hope to illustrate how digitising our urban ecosystems into useful data can help us build healthier, happier, and more resilient places to live.\nIn Part 1 of Talking Trees (read here if you missed it), we asked: Do city trees talk to each other? In short, they probably don’t talk, and when they do, it’s a whisper. Even when there are tree-mycorrhizal associations, there typically aren’t enough of them to support the tree’s health.\nIn Part 2, I want to unpack why the life of a city tree is so difficult. There is a lot to unpack. For one, Bainard, Klironomos, and Gordon (2011) found mycorrhizal associations to be 37% lower in urban areas, as compared to rural areas . Why? Mycorrhizae are elusive and prefer not to ‘deal’ with urban soil issues like compaction, pollution, nutrient content, pH levels, or a lack of oxygen. For example, if polluting aluminium levels establish in the soil, the pH of the soil may be too low for effective tree–mycorrhizal associations to establish.\nTree-mycorrhizal associations may be the least of our worries, though. Even to apply the term ‘soils’ to the earth I sampled during my fieldwork is to be awfully polite. The urban soils I saw can only be described as highly variable. Often due to soil compaction, the varying contents of organic matter, or the patchy distribution of coarse natural or human-made materials such as coarse gravel or construction waste, as often even the parent material is anthropogenic in origin. In general, urban forest soil health has been little investigated due to the complexity of urban environments (e.g., variations in soil cover, land-use history, pollution, and degradation) and the difficulties of soil monitoring (e.g., limited training in accurate methods, lack of investment, and tedious and time-consuming work). Nevertheless, urban-forest soil health is the primary determinant of urban-forest health, and vice versa.\nAlthough healthy soil is fast becoming a limited commodity in cities, healthy soil, with ample microbes, should provide the foundation for healthy urban forests. However, urban trees face very different growing conditions than do forest trees; as a result, urban trees live for only a fraction of the time forest trees do. Many studies have catalogued the plight of dying urban trees, and inadequate soil quality is an important cause of this premature mortality.\nOnce the healthy-soil foundation has been established, water availability is the next consideration. Everyone knows that trees need water to live: the question is, how much?\nIf a tree has too little water during a period of drought, the tree becomes stressed. It may wilt for a little while and then bounce back—or the tree could permanently wilt. When this happens, the tree has to use more energy to recover—or it may die back completely. Watering newly planted trees is especially important, as the root zone of such a tree is not as large as that of an established tree.\nTrees that get too much water and have ‘wet feet’ for long periods can also be severely damaged. The tree will not be able to access oxygen from the soil, and the roots may begin to rot.\nPhillip Craul, a Harvard landscape ecologist once said: ‘street trees die for many reasons, but the best place to start looking for causes is in the soil.’\nIn cities, trees live fast and die young  for a number of reasons: not only smog, dog urination, insufficient soil volumes, compacted soil, and bad pruning practices, but also the fact that there is no network of fellow trees to share nutrients and information with via their roots, as mentioned above. Tree health is severely impacted by the absence of a network of close family nearby to communicate with and supply nutrients to. Some urban trees are orphans; we must foster these trees. If only we could find a way to hear what the trees had to say...\n Bainard, L. D., Klironomos, J. N., & Gordon, A. M. (2011).

{"question":"What is the relationship between crop modeling and artificial intelligence in modern farming, and how do these technologies impact agricultural productivity?","answer":"Crop models perform calculations that simulate trade-offs within real-world systems, helping farm managers optimize inputs like water and fertilizer for specific fields and conditions. These models allow testing different scenarios to understand how agricultural inputs will affect plant health and yield throughout the growing season. Complementing this, AI technologies are transforming agricultural productivity - the global AI farming market is estimated to reach USD 3.62 billion by 2028, with potential productivity improvements of $7.6 billion annually. Studies show that AI adoption can increase crop yields by 10% while reducing chemical use by 20%, and predictive analytics driven by AI can improve farm yield up to 30%.","context":["With one-fifth of the world’s population, China is a key player in global water and food security. The country has a long history of intensive farming, as well as a large rural population (FAO 2018). China produces one fourth of world’s grain with less than 10 percent of global arable land, and ranks first in the world in production of cereals, cotton, fruit, vegetables, meat, poultry, eggs and fishery products. The Chinese government has always placed a high priority on agricultural development and production trends are driven by shifts in national policy (FAO 2018). Prior to 1978, China operated under a communal farming system (CPL 2018). During this time of collective production, the basic farm management unit was a “team” of 20-30 households, with multiple teams grouped into villages.\nAfter 1978, with the implementation of Deng Xiaoping’s Four Modernizations program (agriculture, industry, defense and science), China transitioned from a communal system to an individual farm household system (CPL 2018). Every farm household received an allocation for its share of the communal land, on average one acre per household. Current economic trends, however, have made it so that farmers cannot reasonably live on the profits from such a limited amount of land. As a result, many farmers have migrated to urban areas the for majority of the year, perhaps returning only for planting and harvest, leaving women and the elderly to take care of farms (see Graph 1). The exodus of skilled farming labor, balanced by greater access to farm inputs such as fertilizer, herbicide, and insecticide, have resulted in multiple years of overall stable yields, neither significantly increasing nor decreasing (see Graph 2).\nThe relative inability of smallholder farms to be profitable has resulted in a national trend over the last decade towards land consolidation in China. In China, all land is nationally owned and people are given the rights to use it for only specific amounts of time (typically 70 years, or an average lifetime). Many Chinese smallholders have been leasing their land rights to business developers, who consolidate several farms into a larger operation. These new corporate farm owners often hire farm managers to oversee production, but lack of experience in managing larger farm operations result in knowledge gaps that limit production. Using start-up funds from the institute, DWFI Faculty Fellow Haishun Yang has developed crop models to help bridge these knowledge gaps. NUtech Ventures, the commercialization affiliate for the University of Nebraska–Lincoln, has exclusively licensed three of Dr. Yang’s crop models—Hybrid Maize, Maize-N and CornSoyWater—to a Chinese agricultural technology company, ICAN Beijing, for use and field-testing in China.\nCrop models perform calculations that simulate trade-offs within a real-world system. In the case of applying water and chemicals to fields, more is not always better. Too much irrigation, fertilizer, or pesticides (inputs) can cause leaching of chemicals to groundwater, surface water pollution, erosion, and comes at a higher cost with diminishing returns. The goal of effective agricultural management is to optimize amount of input for a given situation.\nA crop model allows the farm manager, agricultural consultant, or others to test different scenarios, answering questions such as “given my specific field, including soil and climatic conditions, what effect will increasing irrigation from 10 inches to 12 inches of water have on my expected yield for grain this year, in bushels per acre?” Understanding how agricultural inputs, such as water, fertilizer and other chemicals, will affect plant health and yield throughout the growing season, allows farmers to optimize the timing and amount of agricultural inputs for a specific field or season, based on the farmer’s goals. Goals can include increasing yield, reducing groundwater pumping, reducing input costs, or some combination of the three.\nAccording to Yang, “the true power of a crop model is to educate and enable the user to think critically about resource management in agriculture.” If farm managers in China know the cost and expected benefit of water and fertilizer application, then they will invest and use these resources wisely to increase their yields and profits, while avoiding environmental degradation. Smart management of agricultural and natural resources are vital to feeding the future, and achieving the vision of a water and food secure world. The partnership between ICAN Beijing, DWFI and the University of Nebraska will help catalyze this change.\nTo learn more, please contact Lacey Bodnar, DWFI Research Project Manager.\nBased on July 2018 interview with Dr. Haishun Yang, DWFI Faculty Fellow and Associate Professor of Agronomy at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln\nFood and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO). © 2018. “China at a glance.” Accessed Aug. 1, 2018. http://www.fao.org/china/fao-in-china/china-at-a-glance/en.\nChicago Public Library (CPL). © 2018. “Timeline of China’s modern history.” Accessed Aug. 1, 2018. https://www.chipublib.org/timeline-of-chinas-modern-history.\nG.

Thus, this dramatic reduction in the crop development cycle, triggered by AI, underscores the seismic shift that technology is poised to inflict on traditional farming practices, reshaping the agro-sector’s future and squarely positioning AI as a potent tool in the arsenal of the 21st-century farmer.\n98% of large agribusinesses are investing in AI, according to a Microsoft Agri-Food Survey.\nAs we delve into the fascinating world of artificial intelligence and agriculture, a recent Microsoft Agri-Food survey provides a startling revelation. Almost like a testament to the radical shift in farm management strategies, the survey shows that a staggering 98% of large agribusinesses are actively investing in AI. This intriguing piece of information drives home the realization that we are not merely speculating about a potential AI revolution in farming. Instead, we are living it, with most big players already embracing this technology. Furthermore, it underscores the message that if this phenomenon hasn’t yet arrived at smaller farms and agribusinesses, it is only a matter of time before it does. AI is no longer a distant, futuristic concept but a reality altering the landscape of farming, as evidenced by this compelling statistic.\nIt is estimated that AI technologies will make an overall impact of $14.6tn on the world’s economy by 2035.\nGazing into the crystal ball of economic prediction illuminated by that staggering $14.6tn figure attributed to AI by 2035, one can’t help but wonder how this massive influence spills over into the agricultural sector. Indeed, ploughing this fertile intersection, between the world of artificial intelligence and the soil of our farms, unearths expansive potential for growth and refinement.\nJust imagine, for a moment, the future of farming in this landscape of AI-sculpted innovation—technologies that micro-manage crops for optimal growth or drones that autonomously patrol fields, diagnosing and treating pest invasions at their earliest stages. Such advancements could drastically increase crop yield, improve resource utilization, and reduce wastage, monuments of economic gain contributing to that astounding $14.6tn.\nThus, standing on the cusp of this tech-infused era of agriculture, this statistic not only signifies economic progress on a global scale, but also paints a picture of tremendous transformation within the agrarian sphere itself—an evolution unraveled through statistical stories that sprinkle seeds of inspiration onto this digital farming frontier.\nIn summary, the advanced evolution of AI in farming and its integration into the agricultural sector paints a promising future. Agriculture + AI, as supported by the stimulating statistics we’ve dissected, represents a powerful duo that’s revolutionizing farming operations around the globe. From streamlining operations, improving productivity, to ensuring sustainability, AI’s robust potential in farming is virtually limitless. These statistics, without a doubt, support a scenario where both the farmer and technology coexist, driving a revolution aimed at smarter, more efficient, and successful farming. To keep up-to-date, agriculturists should continuously embrace these emerging AI technologies. Future farming is indeed getting smarter and greener with AI.\n0. – https://www.emerj.com\n1. – https://www.www.agriculture.com\n2. – https://www.reportsanddata.com\n3. – https://www.medium.com\n4. – https://www.financesonline.com\n5. – https://www.www.alliedmarketresearch.com\n6. – https://www.www.grandviewresearch.com\n7. – https://www.www.springer.com\n8. – https://www.azure.microsoft.com\n9. – https://www.analyticsindiamag.com\n10. – https://www.www.marketsandmarkets.com\n11. – https://www.www.nature.com\n12. – https://www.www.datainnovation.org"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:8437e9da-be56-4bd8-a18b-9845fe83c82e>","<urn:uuid:fabf1c36-787f-4dce-907e-8e2ecad64a4a>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do behavior therapy and occupational therapy differ in their focus? I'd love to understand the main distinctions!","answer":"Behavior therapy and occupational therapy have different focuses. Behavior therapy addresses specific behaviors in the present rather than inner conflicts, using techniques like extinction, systematic desensitization, and aversion therapy to change undesirable behaviors. In contrast, occupational therapy focuses on helping people adapt to or maintain their everyday activities, particularly when affected by injuries, illnesses, or disabilities. OTs work on practical tasks like teaching adaptations for daily activities, correcting dysfunction of limbs, and helping patients perform jobs, self-care, and household chores.","context":["You probably can think of a time when you were helped by “Working something out” with a friend. Psychotherapy is based on the same principle – the idea that an understanding, receptive, nonjudgmental listener can help you work through a problem.\nUnlike most friends, however, psychotherapists use a tool kit of techniques called “interventions,” which are designed to help change self-defeating behavior or thinking. There are many approaches to psychotherapy. They seem to vary in success rate from person to person, but most studies have shown that any therapy at all is better than none.\nPsychoanalysis, developed by Sigmund Freud, was the first kind of psychotherapy. Some still practice it, but since Freud’s time several other major approaches have been developed. The three most common are behavior therapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and humanistic-experiential therapy.\nThe success of these therapeutic approaches depends on the needs of the individual client. For this reason, many therapists use elements of several approaches. The “match” between you and the therapist may be as important as the strategy he or she uses. Your therapy should feel comfortable to you; understanding how different therapies operate will help you determine whether your own needs are being met.\nTraditional psychoanalysis is an intensive and long-term probing to understand unconscious memories, thoughts, fears, and conflicts rooted in the earliest years of development. Understanding these repressed conflicts helps you to break away from them. Instead of dwelling on the past, you can put energy into a healthier present.\nTo get at these hidden anxieties, therapists may use such traditional techniques as dream analysis and free association, in which you follow seemingly unconnected chains of thought and the therapist looks for connected ideas. He or she also may see the therapist-client relationship as reflecting how you reacted to a critical earlier figure, such as a parent.\nClassical psychoanalysis often included hundreds of sessions and lasted for several years, but today many analysts have modified it to shorter term treatment.\nBehavior therapy addresses specific behavior in the present rather than inner conflicts or past traumatic events. Following are some common tools of behavior therapy:\n- Extinction and systematic desensitization frequently are used for anxiety disorders. The therapist may increase your exposure, in a safe setting, to the object of your fear, or may ask you to imagine the source of your anxiety while consciously trying to relax. In this way, you learn to overcome your fear.\n- Aversion therapy discourages undesirable behavior by punishment, such as an electric shock. At the same time, the therapist works on reinforcing more effective behavior. For example, to treat alcoholism your therapist might prescribe a drug that reacts negatively with alcohol, causing stomach upset. But you are unlikely to quit permanently unless being sober has its own incentives.\n- Systematic use of reinforcement develops and shapes effective behaviors. By continually increasing reinforcement and making you do more to receive it, therapists can shape your behavior. Another example of this approach is behavioral contracting, in which you and someone closely involved with the therapy (for example, a teacher, parent, or spouse) agree on set responsibilities and appropriate behaviors.\n- Biofeedback teaches you to learn to control physical responses that we normally think of as automatic, such as the panic related responses of increased heart rate and heightened blood pressure.","Occupational Therapy Treatment in Rhode Island\nWhat Is Occupational Therapy?\nOccupational therapy consists of treatment that helps people with injuries, illnesses, or disabilities adapt to recover or maintain their everyday activities. Rather than a job or career, “occupational” in this instance means your day-to-day activities and how you move throughout your life.\nOccupational therapists (OTs) provide a broad range of services, including:\n- Teaching adaptations for daily activities like showering, dressing, and preparing meals.\n- Correcting dysfunction of the hand, arm, and shoulder.\n- Fitting splints or orthotics for appropriate positioning, healing, and functional use of a limb.\nOTs work with patients across the age spectrum in a variety of settings, including acute care, inpatient rehab, outpatient clinics, and skilled nursing facilities.\nWho Needs Occupational Therapy?\nOccupational therapy is designed to help people who are having trouble with things like:\n- Performing their job or schoolwork\n- Caring for themselves\n- Completing household chores\n- Moving around in their daily lives\n- Taking part in the activities they enjoy\nPeople with a wide range of conditions can benefit from occupational therapy. OTs work with patients with neurological or cognitive dysfunction, including stroke patients or people diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease. They work with patients who have had a limb amputated, helping them adapt to new ways of carrying out tasks of everyday life, such as eating using a non-dominant hand, negotiating stairs, and reaching into cupboards for dishes.\nOTs can also assess an employee’s capacity to return to work after an injury on the job.\nHow to Prepare for Your Occupational Therapy?\nBefore your initial appointment with an occupational therapist, think about which activities and movements you’d like to improve upon.\nConsider asking your occupational therapist questions like:\n- Do you have specialized training for my condition?\n- How will occupational therapy help improve my functioning?\n- How long do you estimate the treatment will take?\n- Have you achieved positive results for people with my condition in the past?\nWriting down your questions ahead of time will help you make sure you get the information you need. You should also be prepared to share your medical history, including your medical records.\nWhat to Expect During Your Occupational Therapy?\nDuring the first appointment, your occupational therapist will talk with you about your goals and will likely perform a series of tests and exercises to assess your strengths and weaknesses. From there, they will design a treatment plan that will help improve your daily movement and functioning.\nDepending on your specific situation, your occupational therapist may recommend interventions like:\n- Range-of-motion exercises – Often helpful for people suffering from arthritis or other kinds of joint pain.\n- Fine motor activates – Fine motor skills are the delicate motions of the hands, wrists, and fingers that enable precise movement. These activities can improve tasks like eating, writing, and getting dressed.\n- Sensory re-education – Techniques that are designed to retrain your sensory pathways or stimulate unused ones.\n- Pain management – Therapeutic approaches to overcome or mitigate pain and its effects on daily living.\nHow Does Occupational Therapy Differ from Physical Therapy?\nMany people are not familiar with the distinction between physical therapy (PT) and occupational therapy. OT aims to improve a patient’s ability to perform activities of daily living, whether they are recovering from injuries or have developmental or cognitive challenges. OTs work with their patients to promote productivity and independence.\nThe goal of PT is to improve a patient’s ability to move their body with optimum ease and functionality, through exercises, massage, using ultrasound or electrical stimulation, and other techniques.\nOccupational Therapy Services Near Me\nLifespan has numerous locations throughout Rhode Island that provide convenient rehabilitation services near where you live and work.

{"question":"How does popular sovereignty in the US Constitution compare with the concept of citizens' rights in the French Declaration of the Rights of Man?","answer":"The US Constitution establishes popular sovereignty as one of its Six Big Ideas, with ongoing debate about whether voters should directly participate through ballot initiatives or only through elected representatives. The French Declaration of the Rights of Man similarly emphasized citizens' power but focused on guaranteeing specific rights like liberty, property, security and resistance to oppression. The French Declaration explicitly defined rights as an 'expression of the general will' aimed at promoting equality, while placing citizens' rights at the center of society. Both documents therefore recognize the power of the people, but articulate it differently - through governmental structure in the US and through explicit rights in France.","context":["The Big Six Ideas of the Constitution\nWhat is the significance of the Six Big Ideas in the Constitution historically and for Americans today?\nThe Six Big Ideas are:\n1. limited government\n3. checks and balances\n5. separation of powers\n6. popular sovereignty\nExamine the Constitution to identify two examples of any two of these Big Idea in action.\nStudents will quote from the Constitution and identify the quotes location.

The idea: Popular Sovereignty\nQuestion: Should voter ballot initiatives be allowed to overturn laws passed by legislative bodies?\nPosition A: Yes; ballot initiatives allow voters to directly participate in their government.\nPosition B: No; voters already express their views through election of public officials.","The History of Human Rights\nUpdated: Dec 20, 2019\nThis article was written for Queen Mary Legal Advice Centre's blog in celebration of Human Rights Day: 10th December 2014.\nThis article intends to take you on a journey through the history of human rights, providing interesting facts about the legal instruments that protect our most fundamental liberties. It does not aim to provide legal analysis. It is, simply, a celebration of my human rights, your human rights and everybody’s human rights. It is an appreciation of human rights, which ‘are [universal and] premised on the inherent dignity of all human beings whatever their frailty or flaws.’\nBritain’s Magna Carta is a fitting first call in this human rights time travelling mechanism. The ‘great charter’ was initially enacted in 1215 but was drastically altered in the following years. Much of the original charter, however, has now been overruled but many of its fundamental principles are now enshrined in numerous human rights instruments. Values from the Magna Carta can be found in the United States Bill of Rights (1791), Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) and the European Convention on Human Rights (1950). This includes the concept that everyone is subject to the law. The Magna Carta also introduced the very basics of legal systems around the world as it states that:\nNo free man shall be seized or imprisoned, or stripped of his rights or possessions, or outlawed or exiled, or deprived of his standing in any other way, nor will we proceed with force against him, or send others to do so, except by the lawful judgement of his equals or by the law of the land. To no one will we sell, to no one deny or delay right or justice.\nIt soon becomes apparent that some of the fundamental rights that we take for granted date back to the Magna Carta and its revised versions. The United States Bill of Rights is no different in that it also provided an elaborative notion of liberties that are relied upon today. The Bill of Rights protects rights that are respected in constitutions around the world and contained in numerous international human rights instruments. Freedom of speech, religion, and of assembly and to petition is now respected worldwide. It also gave birth to key constitutional principles such as the prohibition unreasonable search and seizure, cruel and unusual punishment and compelled self-incrimination. The federal government is prohibited from depriving any person of life, liberty or property without due process of law that are fundamental human rights around the world.\nThe Declaration of Independence (1776) is equally significant. The Declaration, a means of breaking away from the British Empire, placed much emphasis on individual rights and the right of revolution to which many American’s hold value. These themed have dispersed internationally, and had particular influence on the French Revolution.\nThe Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen (1789) was adopted after the abolishment of the absolute monarchy and the birth of a republic. The Declaration, considered the first step towards a French constitution, guaranteed, to all citizens, the rights to ‘liberty, property, security, and resistance to oppression.’ It also extends itself to explaining the concept of human right and, in fact, law in general as it states that ‘the natural rights of each man has only those borders which assure other members of the society the enjoyment of these same rights. The law, as explained in the Declaration, is an “expression of the general will,“ and aims to promote equal rights and to only prohibit “actions [that are] harmful to the society.’ This placed equality, human rights and control over power at the centre of society and became hugely influential to human rights mechanisms around the world.\nHuman rights were being declared around the world. This, however, did not stop the atrocities of the World Wars that saw so many treated inhumanly. Action was taken to help ensure that they were never repeated as delegates from fifty countries met in San Francisco in the April of 1945. Their aim was to create an international body with the purpose of promoting peace and preventing conflict in the future. The Charter came into force on the 24th October 1945 and gave birth to the new United Nations (“UN” hereafter) organisation; a date celebrated yearly that has become United Nations Day.\nThe UN Human Rights Commission was created in 1946 and, although replaced in 2006 by the Human Rights Council, remains a key part of human rights history. The Commission, led by Eleanor Roosevelt, a fundamental human rights advocate and the United States delegate, drafted, introduced and adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (“UDHR”) on December 10, 1948. The Declaration attracted the world’s imagination and was considered the ‘international Magna Carta for all mankind’ given that it compiled 30 articles of human right. This was revolutionary as it was the first instance of human rights being assembled in this way. It sets out, in the preamble and Article 1, that all human beings are born free and enjoy equal dignity and rights, including freedom of speech and belief and freedom from fear.\nMore specific UN human rights conventions were born out of the success of the UDHR. Such conventions often protect minorities and those who are most vulnerable to defend those who are most at risk. Significant examples include the Convention on the Rights of the Child, Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. The realisation that particular social groups require certain protection in order to achieve equality is a step forward from universal rights. Universal rights, however, remain as the fundamentals of society. More specific rights, on the other hand, protect minorities and the vulnerable from discrimination. Domestic anti-discrimination laws that play a similar role have mirrored this approach.\nThe European Convention of Human Rights (“ECHR”) illustrates two further developments: individual court hearings and the emergence of regional human rights instruments. The ECHR came into force on 3 September 1953 after being drafted by the newly formed Council of Europe (“CoE””). All member states are signatories to the Convention and new members should ratify it at the earliest opportunity. It is hugely influenced by the UDHR as it adopted similar rights. It was also enacted with the same ambitions as the UDHR; to avoid the atrocities of the world wars from being repeated. It protects 21 rights, though not all are enforceable. The key rights include the right to life, freedom from torture and inhuman treatment, privacy and liberty. This represents a development from the UDHR in that it has a court in which individuals can bring a case once they have exhausted domestic options. This is different from the UN procedures that often involved reporting from selected non-governmental organisations and the observance of specialist UN committees. In the UN, reports are written explaining the member state’s compliant and contravening behaviours and advice as to how to make amends. This is, however, often ignored by states. Individual complaints and remedies provide for a more intimate solution. The ECHR is also a development as it is an example of a regional treaty. Regional treaties on human rights appear globally and include examples such as the CoE’s Social Charter, the European Union’s Charter of Fundamental Rights, African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights and Asian Human Rights Charter.\nHuman rights have enjoyed gradual development in the last one hundred years. These progressions are under threat and human rights in Europe face a bleak future. Failures of the welfare systems and a rise in right-wing parties have seen citizens question the nature of human rights and are asking for reform. Many simply lack a human rights education and a well-informed opinion. The rise of the right-wing also threatens international and supra-national human rights as they seek more domestic independence. Much emphasis has been placed on the importance of human rights in the last decade and it is hoped that the reasoning for their introduction will be remembered, ensuring a safe passage through this difficult times. Human rights are fundamental and will play a vital role in the protection of the individual until the end of time.

{"question":"Hi! Me study dimensional spaces and bird protection. Can u tell what limits beings have in seeing dimensions and how this relates to bird monitoring at wind farms? thx!","answer":"In any n-dimensional universe, beings can only see in n-1 dimensions - for example, three-dimensional beings can only see in two dimensions. This limitation in dimensional perception is similar to how bird monitoring at wind farms requires multiple viewing perspectives - pre-construction and post-construction studies are needed to properly assess bird movements and impacts. These studies must employ mathematical models that account for variations in local conditions and use techniques like radar to detect bird movements, ensuring effective monitoring despite our limited dimensional perspective.","context":["A Look in Many Dimensions: The Universe of Flatland and Planiverse\nWelcome to a universe of infinite dimensions.\nEven if we cannot see any\nbut our own three dimensional universe,\nwe can explore the realities of living in them here, through a cube.\nInside this cube is an object.

By 2030, there will likely be more than 100,000 wind turbines in the U.S., and these are expected to kill at least one million birds each year—probably significantly more. Wind farms are also expected to impact almost 20,000 square miles of terrestrial habitat, and over 4,000 square miles of marine habitat by 2030, some of it critical to threatened species.\nTo be a truly green source of energy, wind power needs to be Bird-smart and that means wind power employs careful siting, operation and construction mitigation, monitoring, and compensation to reduce and redress any unavoidable bird mortality and habitat loss from wind energy development. These are issues that should be included in mandatory federal wind standards. All wind farms should employ bird-smart principles and comply with relevant state and federal wildlife protection laws.\nWhat is bird-smart wind energy?\nBird-smart wind power implements careful siting considerations, operation and construction mitigation, bird monitoring, and compensation to reduce and redress unavoidable bird mortality and habitat loss. These are issues that the federal government should include in mandatory wind standards. For terrestrial wind farms, bird-smart wind should address:\n- Siting: Bird-smart wind power (including wind farms and associated infrastructure) is sited to prevent harm to birds, ideally in already altered habitats such as farmland, and avoids sensitive areas. Examples of such areas may include migratory bottlenecks, wetlands, raptor concentration and key nesting areas, the edges of ridges used by migrants, key habitat or flight paths for endangered or declining species, breeding concentrations of species that avoid tall structures (such as some grouse species), and in or adjacent to Important Bird Areas. Maps with detailed data on wildlife are currently being developed by conservation groups for use by the wind industry. Pre-construction assessments should always be conducted to confirm whether a particular site presents an especially high risk to birds. Some areas are not going to be suitable for wind development.\n- Operation and Construction Mitigation: Bird-smart wind power uses the best technology and management practices to avoid and minimize harm to birds, such as by burying transmission lines in high risk areas, following Avian Power Line Interaction Committee standards for above-ground transmission lines, using lighting that minimizes nighttime migratory bird collision mortality (such as strobe lights), using unguyed rather than guyed meteorological towers, and restoring habitat disturbed by construction, e.g., re-compacting soils disturbed by construction and replanting native vegetation (or restoring the site if the wind farm is decommissioned).\n- Monitoring: Bird-smart wind power conducts effective, federally reviewed and approved, site-specific, pre- and post-construction studies/assessments to assist with improved siting and operation, and to properly quantify impacts. Pre-construction assessments must provide sufficient data to assist with micro-siting (e.g., by use of radar to detect local bird movements), create an annual baseline against which post-construction studies can be evaluated, use all existing available bird study data, and be conducted during months when bird use can be expected to be at its peak at the selected site. Post-construction studies must employ mathematical models that best account for variations in local conditions and the relative difficulty of locating bird carcasses in different habitats, as well as any scavenging by predators that may reduce the number of carcasses found, and run for at least two years (and long enough to determine the efficacy of, and make needed revisions to, operational mitigation measures).\n- Compensation: Bird-smart wind power redresses the loss of any birds or habitat unavoidably harmed by construction and operation to a net benefit standard. This includes bird deaths caused by collisions with turbines and their associated power lines, and lost or degraded habitat (e.g., areas of abandoned habitat) Such compensation could include acquiring additional land for the National Wildlife Refuge system or other off-site habitat conservation projects.\nAlthough offshore wind power is not yet operational in the U.S., an analogous set of siting, operating, and compensatory measures need to be developed to make it bird-smart.\nAll wind farms should have an Avian Protection Plan which includes American Bird Conservancy’s bird-smart principles, and a means of implementing them and tracking and reporting on this implementation. Wind farms should also comply with relevant state and federal wildlife protection laws such as the Endangered Species Act, Migratory Bird Treaty Act, Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, and National Environmental Policy Act.\nHow would you know if a potential wind farm site will have large or small impacts to birds?\nSee section above on pre-construction monitoring and post-construction monitoring.\nIsn’t the Federal Government developing wind energy regulations?\nNo, the Federal Government has released draft, voluntary wind-energy guidelines that were produced from recommendations to the Secretary of the Interior by a Federal Advisory Committee. During the public comment period on those proposed voluntary guidelines, ABC will urge that that the Department of the Interior enact mandatory standards that the industry must follow. We do not believe that energy industries should be able to choose whether or not to consider bird impacts.\nA recent lawsuit regarding the Altamont Pass Wind Farm in California illustrates that getting the right thing done voluntarily is anything but a sure thing. Recent studies say that approximately 7,600-9,300 birds were killed there each year, including 55-94 Golden Eagles, 475-477 American Kestrels, 253-433 Red-tailed Hawks, and 714-718 Burrowing Owls. After seven years of being challenged by various conservation groups, it finally took a lawsuit to get changes made at Altamont Pass. NextEra Energy Resources has only recently agreed to replace 2,400 of its old wind turbines at Altamont Pass with fewer, larger models that produce the same amount of total power. They also agreed to place the new turbines in “more environmentally friendly” locations, and to pay $2.5 million for research and raptor habitat improvement.\nWhat kinds of birds are impacted by wind farms?\nPotentially all night-migrating songbirds are at risk of colliding with wind turbines, as are raptors and other birds when wind farms are sited in areas they frequent. Habitat loss is also an issue as wind farms can degrade bird habitat or cause birds to abandon habitat.\nGolden Eagles will be especially impacted because much of the additional wind build-out planned for the western U.S. is expected to occur in areas they inhabit. The endangered Whooping Crane will be exposed to additional risk from collision with new power lines erected to service wind farms along their migratory pathways.\nTo a Greater Sage-Grouse and some other birds, any tall structure such as a wind turbine is a threat because it is a potential perch for a predatory bird. A wind turbine standing a considerable distance away has much the same effect as a small tree at a few hundred yards, causing sage-grouse to abandon traditional lekking grounds up to three miles away from a wind farm. Unfortunately for the Sage-Grouse, Wyoming, one of this bird’s last remaining strongholds, is slated for significant wind farm build-out. It is very important for the future of the Greater Sage-Grouse that this development is appropriately sited\nHow many birds are killed by wind farms each year?\nNo one knows for sure. Recent estimates of the number of birds killed by wind turbines ranges from a low of 100,000 birds/year to 440,000 birds/year (calculated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service). If 20% of the nation’s electricity comes from wind power by 2030, ABC estimates that at least one million birds per year will be killed by wind turbines, probably significantly more.\nAren’t there laws that protect birds from being killed by wind farms?\nWhooping Cranes and some other birds are protected under the Endangered Species Act. Golden Eagles are protected under the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act (BAGEPA), and most migratory birds are protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA). Unfortunately, both the BAGEPA and MBTA are not currently sufficiently enforced to prevent predicted mortality resulting from wind development. However, in 2011, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is expected to begin issuing permits for wind farms that expect to kill Golden Eagles, contingent on the wind farms taking tangible steps to protect eagles. The Greater Sage-Grouse, meanwhile, currently receives no federal legal protection, though several states have stepped up to protect remaining core breeding areas.\nRead full ABC Policy Statement on Wind Energy"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:b06a7f2d-614c-47c3-b886-ddf60e0352d4>","<urn:uuid:ad348f5b-9b9c-419d-9045-9be2eb6e06f6>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Why winter training program need diferents loads between new players and experienced ones, and what are best strategies for maintaining fitness during winter break? 🤔","answer":"Training loads must be differentiated based on professional experience, with players having less than 2 years of professional training receiving 75% of total training time. Players with 8 or more years of experience require individualized programs developed through one-on-one discussions. As for winter break strategies, maintaining 40% of normal training load is optimal - this means reducing from 4 sessions to 2 sessions of 30 minutes per week. This approach limits detraining effects and allows return to full training load in just 14 days, compared to 32 days needed after complete rest. The training should remain sport-specific and include elements like controlled sprint distances and accelerations scaled to 40% of normal load.","context":["09 Jan How to stay fit during the winter break\nAs a coach you want your team to get fully rested during the winterbreak without losing all fitness after the holidays, so your team doesn’t have to catch up lost fitness when recommencing competition.\nwinter break, generally lasting about 14 days, is the perfect opportunity to\nshrink any accumulated fatigue built up during in-season competition. Including\nholidays Christmas and New Year’s Eve, players are often at absolute rest. At a\nfirst glance this doesn’t seem harmful. After all, it enables players to fully\nrecover from physical discomforts. However, absolute rest for a prolonged\nperiod of time is detrimental for previously built up fitness as well, also\ndescribed as ‘detraining’. More elaborately, detraining consists of loss of\n(an)aerobic power and endurance, strength, flexibility, muscle tone, muscle\nmass and metabolism, with the steepest deterioration in the first three weeks\nof training cessation (1). However, the magnitude of training re-adaptations after\ndetraining is different depending on athlete’s fitness level and duration of\ntraining cessation (2). To ensure optimal team performance at competition\nresumption reduced fitness levels must be caught up again which costs valuable\ntime. It is estimated that after two weeks of absolute rest during winter break\ntime to safely return to full training load will be 32 days (3). Increasing\ntraining load back to pre winter break levels too fast\ngreatly increases risk of injury and illness.\nTherefore, as a coach you want to limit detraining effects and return to full training load as soon as possible without increasing risk of injury and illness. Therefore, absolute rest is not recommended how to spend the winter break. Relative rest (reduced training load) limits detraining effects leading to less time spent on catching up on fitness. Implementing a winter break program of training 40% of normal load greatly decreases detraining effects, reducing time to safe return to full training load to only 14 days (table 1) (3), after which competition matches are often schedules again.\n|% Training Load||Days to safe return||Total days reduced training|\nTable 1. Retrieved from regression AIS whitepaper (3). Number of days to safely return to competition load during two weeks of relative rest (40% or 60%) or absolute rest (0%).\nTrain at 40% normal load\nBased on a schedule of four sessions per week (1 match, 3 training), lower training volume and frequency to two sessions per week of approximately 30 minutes each during winter break. Schedule one session of 40% normal load per every 3 to 4 days to enable full recovery and replenishment. This way, at recommencement of team training players are less affected by detraining and can withstand higher initial training loads leaving less time necessary to restore lack of fitness and more time available for team tactical sessions. Nevertheless, we must remain cautious not to immediately overload players as any reduction in training load leads to detraining. On return to training, session frequency is restored to 4 per week automatically increasing total weekly load. Simultaneously increasing acute training load will further increase player fatigue, lengthen their recovery and greatly increases risk of injury and illness. Therefore after winter break training load must be progressively increased and can be back at competition load in two weeks (see figure 1). Using this program outline will shorten time to safe return to training by almost 3 weeks without increasing risk of injury and illness.\nFigure 1. Schematic outline of absolute rest and relative rest winter break periodisation. The left graph shows safe return to training load (grey line) after two weeks, which is significantly prolonged after absolute rest (right graph, blue line) during winter break.\nWinter break training session\nHow can one train at 40% normal load? What factors need to be considered when making exercises? What kind of exercises are suitable. Basically, any exercise activity that requires physical exertion can be beneficial. Nevertheless, remain as sport specific as possible. Include exercises in winter break programs to expose players to comparable types of physical exertion done in normal training. For example, high amount of sprint distance and accelerations included in regular training sessions should be represented in winter break training sessions. Convert the load exerted by these sprints and accelerations to 40%, so if 100% load contains 400m sprint distance and 100 accelerations, include a running exercise that achieves 160m sprint distance and 40 accelerations. See table 2 for a training session exposing that particular load. After a thorough warm-up, players start with 10x5m sprints focussing on accelerations followed by a 60m lane high speed running targeting sprint distance. Keep in mind that the goal is to expose the body to sprint related stimuli (i.e. limiting detraining) and not to increase fitness. Therefore, make sure for adequate rest in between series.\n|60m Lane Outline||Training outline||Duration [min]|\n|15m accel to max speed||Sprint 10x5m||3|\n|15m max speed||4x60m lane||3|\n|15m roll out||Rest||4|\n|Total||160m SD & 38 Acc||33 min|\nTable 2. Example of 40% load training session.\nResuming team training\nAfter two weeks of 40% relative rest players return to team training less affected by detraining. However, proceeding on competition load levels straight away will still result in high acute load spikes exposing players to increased risk of injury. By reducing initial training load when resuming team sessions players will readapt to higher training loads fast and get 100% fit without increased risk of injury. This can be done by placing focus on volume with a small portion of high intensity small sided games in the first sessions after winter break. In these sessions, include large running/passing/sided games exercises to increase total distance in a controlled way. In the following sessions, gradually progress towards more chaotic exercises (small position games / small sided games) to increase random explosive movements and mimic more match relevant situations. With adequate monitoring and session planning your team is back to perform in two week!\n- Prefer relative rest over absolute rest\n- 40% relative rest counters detraining\n- Two weeks of 40% relative rest is restored in two weeks\n- Gradually shift from controlled to chaotic exercises post winter break\n- Relative rest gives more time for tactical sessions\n- Mujika I.

The rest of the squad will fall into the major training groupings.\nI would try and limit each session to a 30 or 60 or 90 minute time frame, since we need to add sessions such as stretching, yoga, pilates, prehab/rehab to the overall plan as well.\nTime allocation is critical and should reflect your main focus, I also like adding an activities plan to the off season for two reasons;\ni) Firstly, the development of a broad focus of physical skills from a variety of sports to supplement the specific skills they get from the main sport, a very much former Soviet approach where athletes are exposed to as many sports as possible in the developmental phases of their training; and secondly\nii) Exposure to a variety of activities will introduce players to possibilities for post career that they may wish to take up that otherwise they may have never had an opportunity or interest in.\nSome of these activities maybe boxing, wrestling, karate, kick boxing, kayaking, water polo, mountain biking, yoga, basketball, netball, korfball, volleyball, Gaelic football, handball, Australian Rules, football. All these sports/activities add to the physical development plan by challenging players both mentally and physically. I would select maybe 5 or 10 (if you want them to have a choice between activities) and schedule them for the last session on each day of training.\nSo depending on the priority of your program, the number of sessions for each type of specific training will be as follows:\nNeural – Intensity and recovery are the key, again with Olympic lifting you may go as high as 10 sessions per week but these may only be one or two exercises per session, speed sessions 3 – 5 per week.\nMechanical – Depending on your preference could be 4 sessions per week or up to 8 if you move to a more double day body building split style.\nMetabolic – 5 sessions per week, cross training (indoor rowing, versa climber, Grappler, bike, grinder, swim), anaerobic (fitness) games, hill repeats, repeated speed, cross country running, General Physical Preparedness (GPP) following weight training sessions, strongman circuits, weight training complexes and circuits, of course they will also gain in this area from the activities training they do as well.\nI also like to keep off season training from Monday to Friday only and not take any time on the weekend since we take most weekends during the season, leave that for recovery and family time.\nOur current program is attached to give you an idea how we put things together, enjoy, it is great fun putting all the pieces together and watching the plan come together.\nHello Ash, based on your off season programs (5 days of weight training) ,I would like to know if they could also be used by centres-winger? By the programing that I read in the crusaders off season, you only have “finishers” do a 3 day weight training program. I do not really need to put more then 2-5 Kg`s top, my real goal is to improve my conditioning.\nMy other question is, how do you set the “ideal playing weight”? I am 1.81 mts tall and weight 90 KG (my body fat is 10%) and I play centre, I would like to be at 93-95 but I don`t know if that would be good for me In season.\nHi Nico, the reason the outsides only do 3 weights workouts is because they do a lot more speed training and I see this as more important, you could do the 5 days per week weights but I think it would impact on your ability to recover and do the speed work at maximum intensity to ensure gains. I do not think there is a perfect weight for any player in any position and feel that the weight you are talking about sounds just right although some centres are over 100kg, so perfect is what is right for you and that is just a trial and error situation I had a player once who like to be closer to 90kg during Super 14 since it was a lot faster game and more expansive but wanted to be closer to 95kg for test match rugby, hope that helps, ash"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"language-ambiguous"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:e8060072-37cf-4e5b-bf58-7bf38755c9bc>","<urn:uuid:94f13ee7-c169-456d-8c7d-43f196a75b48>"],"error":null}

(NASDAQ:IRDM) announced today that it has been selected as the preferred provider of satellite communications services for The Ocean Cleanup , the non-profit organization deploying advanced technologies to rid the world’s oceans of plastic. The Ocean Cleanup is embarking on one of the largest environmental initiatives of this generation by cleaning up ocean plastic debris, starting with what’s known as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. The Ocean Cleanup has chosen Iridium L-band satellite broadband services to support this important mission. The service is being delivered in partnership with Iridium service provider The AST Group.\nBy creating a system of 600-meter-long floating plastic collectors (floating screens, or systems) that include a 3-meter-deep skirt, The Ocean Cleanup collects plastic pollution through a combination of the wind, waves, natural ocean currents and the floating screen’s ability to prevent plastic escaping underneath it, or flowing over the top, while avoiding to ensnare sea life. Each system is equipped with two Iridium broadband terminals, and upon full deployment of a fleet of 60 floating screens, there will be 120 Iridium broadband terminals operating as part of this project. The Iridium terminals will be relaying critical systems data including compartment flood detection, position and location information, pictures, 360 degree video and system performance information.\n“The opportunity to play a role in such an important and historic endeavor was a no-brainer for Iridium. It’s an honor for us to be a part of The Ocean Cleanup’s incredible mission to rid the oceans of plastics,” said Iridium CEO Matt Desch. “A reliable, predictable and redundant communication network, that can work despite adverse weather conditions is critically important to this system, and that’s when the Iridium network really shines. When the oceans aren’t cooperating and several foot waves and powerful winds are causing havoc, the Iridium system will help make sure The Ocean Cleanup understands the operational status of each floating screen in the fleet.”\nThe Iridium broadband terminals will receive data from a complex combination of sensors and data gathering equipment hosted by each system. That information will then be relayed to The Ocean Cleanup’s headquarters in Rotterdam in real-time. Iridium’s unique constellation of 66 interconnected low-earth orbit (LEO) satellites requires no local ground infrastructure and provides the robustness, reliability and redundancy needed to ensure this critical data is delivered as expected.\nIridium is nearing complete deployment of its next-generation satellite constellation, Iridium NEXT. The new constellation is completely replacing the previous network of 66 interconnected satellites. To date, there have been seven successful Iridium NEXT launches completed by SpaceX, deploying 65 new satellites. One launch remains before completion of the company’s historic constellation refresh. In total, 75 new satellites are being launched to LEO, of which 66 will be in the active constellation, with nine on-orbit spares.\nFor more information about The Ocean Cleanup, please visit www.theoceancleanup.com\nFor more information about Iridium, please visit www.Iridium.com\nAbout Iridium Communications Inc.\nIridium is the only mobile voice and data satellite communications network that spans the entire globe.

An artificial body which is placed in an orbit around the earth for the purpose of communication is known as Communication satellite. GMSS is a system which consists of various artificial communication satellites orbiting around the earth for the purpose of communication.\nA satellite network is a combination of nodes that provides communication from one point on the Earth to another. A node in the network can be Satellite, an Earth station, or an End-user terminal or Telephone. Satellite networks are like cellular networks, they divide the planet into cells.\nThe frequencies reserved for the satellite microwave communication are in gigahertz(GHz) range. Each satellite sends and receives over two different bands. Transmission from earth to satellite is called the Uplink. Transmission from the satellite to the earth is called the Downlink.\nUplink and downlink frequencies must be different to avoid interference. Now, stations at the earth have greater power sources than that of satellite as it has only solar power. Also, higher frequency results in higher attenuation and to compensate with it more power is required. So, uplink uses higher frequency to penetrate the environment.\nAn artificial satellite needs to have an orbit, the path in which it travels around the Earth. The orbit can be equatorial, inclined or polar.\nSatellite process microwaves with bidirectional antennas. Therefore, the signal from the satellite is normally aimed at a specific area called the footprint.\nBased on the location of the orbit, satellites can be divided into three categories as follows\n- GEO stands for Geostationary Earth Orbit.\n- The communication satellites in this orbit operates at a distance of about 36000 km above the earth’s surface and their orbital time period is about 24 hours.\n- Geostationary Orbit Satellites are used for radio broadcasting.\n- To ensure constant communication, the satellite must move at the same speed as the earth, so that it seems to remain fixed above a certain spot. So such satellites are called geostationary.\n- One geostationary satellite cannot cover the whole earth. One satellite in orbit has line-of-sight contact with vast number of stations, but the curvature of the Earth still keeps much of the planet out of sight. It takes minimum of three satellites equidistant from each other in geostationary Earth Orbit(GEO) to provide full global transmission.\n- MEO stands for Medium Earth Orbit.\n- The communication satellites in this orbit operates at a distance of about 5000 to 12000 km above the earth’s surface.\n- These satellites are positioned between the two Van Allen belts. A satellite at this orbit takes approximately 6 to 8 hours to circle the Earth.\n- One Example of a MEO satellite system is Global Positioning System(GPS), constructed and operated by US Department of Defense, orbiting at an altitude about 18,000 km above the earth.\n- The system consists of 24 satellites and is used for land, sea, and air navigation to provide time and locations for vehicle and ships.\n- The orbits and the locations of the satellites in each orbit are designed in such a way that, at any time, four satellites are visible from any point on the Earth. A GPS receiver has a almanac that tells the current position of each satellite.\n- GPS is based on a principle called Trilateration(also sometimes called Triangulation). Principle states that “On a plane, if we know our distance from three points, we know exactly where we are.”\n- LEO stands for Low Earth Orbit.\n- The communication satellites in this orbit operates at a distance of about 500 to 1200 km above the earth’s surface and their orbital time period generally ranges between 95 to 120 minutes. The Satellite has a speed of 20,000 to 25,000 km/h. Low Orbit Satellites makes global radio coverage possible.\n- An LEO system is made of a constellation of satellites that work together as a network, each satellite acts as a switch. Satellites that are close to each other are connected through inter-satellite links (ISLs). A mobile system communicates with the satellite through a user mobile link(UML). A satellite can also communicate with an Earth station(gateway) through a gateway link(GWL).\n- LEO satellites can be divided into three categories: Little LEOs, Big LEOs, and Broad Band LEOs.\n- Little LEOs operate under 1GHz. They are mostly used for low-data-rate messaging.\n- Big LEOs operate between 1 and 3GHz. Globalstar and Iridium system are examples of Big LEOs.\n- Broad Band LEOs provide communication similar to fiber-optic networks. The first broadband LEO system was Teledesic.\n- The concept of Iridium system, a 77-satellite network, was started by Motorola in 1990. The project took 8 years to materialize.\n- Finally in 1998, the service was started by 66 satellites. The original name, Iridium, came from the name of the 77th chemical element. A more appropriate name is Dysprosium (the name of 66th element).\n- The System has 66 satellites divided into 6 orbits, with 11 satellites in each orbit. The orbits are at an altitude of 750km.\n- Iridium is designed to provide direct worldwide voice and data communication using handheld terminals, a service similar to cellular telephony but on a global scale.\n- Globalstar is LEO satellite system that uses 48 satellites in six polar orbits with each orbit hosting eight satellites. The orbits are located at an altitude of almost 1400km.\n- The Globalstar system is similar to the Iridium system, the main difference is the relaying mechanism.\n- Communication between two distinct users in Iridium system requires relaying between several satellites.\n- Globalstar communication requires both satellites and earth station, which means that ground stations can create more powerful signals.\n- Teledesic is a system of satellites that provides fiber-optic like communication.\n- Its main purpose is to provide broadband Internet access for users all over the world. It is sometimes called “Internet in the sky”.\n- The project was started in1990 by Craig McCaw and Bill Gates, later other investors joined the consortium. Teledesic has 288 satellites in 12 LEO orbits, each at an altitude of 1350km.\n- The commercial failure of the similar Iridium and Globalstar ventures and other systems, along with bankruptcy protection fillings, were the primary factors in halting this project, and Teledesic officially suspended its satellite construction work on 1 October 2002."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:4ffeea5b-541e-4c02-a46d-14d7995b339a>","<urn:uuid:fa8059f6-62e8-40cc-bdda-25fc84cd0c99>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I'm fascinated by ancient architecture - how do the unique building structures of Masouleh compare to the legendary Hanging Gardens of Babylon in terms of their architectural innovation?","answer":"Masouleh and the Hanging Gardens of Babylon both showcased innovative architectural solutions. Masouleh features interconnected buildings built into mountains, where buildings' roofs serve as streets and courtyards, following the principle 'the yard of the above building is the roof of the below building.' The buildings are typically 2-story structures made of adobe, rods and bole. The Hanging Gardens of Babylon, on the other hand, featured high stone terraces that imitated mountains, reaching heights of 20 meters. These terraces were built on pillars, lined with reeds and bricks, and included stairs to reach various levels. Both architectural marvels developed solutions for their environments - Masouleh's yellow clay exterior improved visibility in fog, while Babylon's gardens had complex irrigation systems with screws to draw water from the Euphrates River to water the planted vegetation.","context":["Masouleh architecture is unique. The buildings have been built into the mountain and are interconnected. Courtyards and roofs both serve as pedestrian areas similar to streets. Masouleh does not allow any motor vehicles to enter, due to its unique layout. It is the only village in Iran with such a prohibition. However, the small streets and many stairs simply wouldn't make it possible for vehicles to enter.\nThe spectacular architecture of Masouleh is popularly known as \"The yard of the above building is the roof of the below building\".\nYellow clay coats the exterior of most buildings in Masouleh. This allows for better visibility in the fog.\nBuildings are mostly 2 stories (1st floor and below floor) made of adobe, rods and bole. A small living room, big guest room, winter room, hall, WC and balcony are usually found in 1st floor. A cold closet, barn and stable are located on the floor below, which are connected to the upper floor by several narrow steps inside the building.\nThere are four main local communities at the village named: \"Maza-var\" (meaning beside the Mosque) at the south, \"Khana-var\" (beside homes) at the East, \"Kasha-sar\" (stretched on top) at the North, and, \"Assa-mahala\" (Assad community) at the West.

One of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, they are the only wonder whose existence is disputed amongst historians. Some scholars claim the gardens were actually at Nineveh, capital of the Assyrian Empire, some stick with the ancient writers and await archaeology to provide positive proof, and still others believe they are merely a figment of the ancient imagination. Archaeology at Babylon itself and ancient Babylonian texts are silent on the matter, but ancient writers describe the gardens as if they were at Nebuchadnezzar’s capital and still in existence in Hellenistic times. The exotic nature of the gardens compared to the more familiar Greek items on the list and the mystery surrounding their location and disappearance have made the Hanging Gardens of Babylon the most captivating of all the Seven Wonders.\nBabylon & Nebuchadnezzar II\nBabylon, located about 80 km (50 miles) south of modern Baghdad in Iraq, was an ancient city with a history of settlement dating back to the 3rd millennium BCE. The greatest period in the city’s history was in the 6th century BCE during the reign of Nebuchadnezzar II when the city was the capital of the Neo-Babylonian Empire. The empire had been founded by Nebuchadnezzar’s father Nabopolassar (r. 625-605 BCE) after his victories over the Assyrian Empire. Nebuchadnezzar II would go on to even greater things, including the capture of Jerusalem in 597 BCE. The Babylonian king then set about making his capital one of the most splendid cities in the world. The Ishtar Gate was built c. 575 BCE with its fine towers and depictions in tiles of animals both real and imaginary, a 7-20 km brick double wall surrounded the city - the largest ever built - and then, possibly, he added the extensive pleasure gardens whose fame spread throughout the ancient world.\nThe majority of scholars agree that the idea of cultivating gardens purely for pleasure, as opposed to the production of food, originated in the Fertile Crescent, where they were known as a paradise. From there the notion would spread throughout the ancient Mediterranean so that by Hellenistic times even private individuals, or at least the wealthier ones, were cultivating their own private gardens in their homes. Gardens were not just about flowers and plants, either, as architectural, sculptural, and water features were added, and even the views were a consideration for the ancient landscape gardener. Gardens became such a desired feature that fresco painters, such as those at Pompeii, covered entire walls of villas with scenes which gave the illusion that on entering a room one was also entering a garden. All of these outdoor pleasant places, then, owed their existence to ancient Mesopotamia and, above all, to the magnificent Hanging Gardens of Babylon.\nThe Hanging Gardens of Babylon were sometimes referred to as the Hanging Gardens of Semiramis after the semi-legendary and semi-divine female Assyrian ruler thought by the Greeks to have extensively rebuilt Babylon in the 9th century BCE. Herodotus, the 5th-century BCE Greek historian, describes the impressive irrigation system of Babylon and the walls but does not mention any gardens specifically (although the Great Sphinx is also curiously missing from his description of Giza). The first mention in an ancient source of the gardens is by Berossus of Kos, actually, a priest named Bel-Usru from Babylon who relocated to the Greek island. Writing c. 290 BCE, Berossus’ work survives only as quoted excerpts in that of later writers, but many of his descriptions of Babylon have been corroborated by archaeology.\nBerossus describes high stone terraces which imitated mountains and which were planted with many types of large trees and flowers. Terraces would not only have created a pleasant aesthetic effect of hanging vegetation but also made their irrigation easier. Berossus also explains why the gardens were established, to make a wife of the Babylonian king, a Mede called Amytis, feel less homesick for her green and hilly homeland. Alas, there is no reference to a queen of that name in Babylonian records.\nSeveral other sources describe the gardens as if they were still in existence in the 4th century BCE, but all were written centuries after the reign of Nebuchadnezzar and all were written by writers who almost certainly never visited Babylon and who knew little of either horticulture or engineering. Strabo, the Greek geographer (c. 64 BCE - c. 24 CE), describes the location of the gardens as by the Euphrates, which ran through ancient Babylon, and a complicated machinery of screws which drew water up from the river to water the gardens. He also mentions the presence of stairs to reach the various levels. Meanwhile, the Greek historian Diodorus Siculus, also writing in the 1st century BCE, notes that the terraces sloped upwards like an ancient theatre and reached a total height of 20 metres (65 ft). He describes the terraces as being built on pillars and lined with reeds and bricks.\nThere are known precedents for large gardens in Mesopotamia which pre-date those said to have been at Babylon. There are even depictions of them, for example, on a relief panel from the North Palace of Ashurbanipal (668–631 BCE) at Nineveh, now in the British Museum, London. Indeed, some scholars suggest that the whole Babylonian gardens idea is the result of a monumental mix-up, and it is Nineveh which actually had the fabled wonder, built there by Sennacherib (r. 705-681 BCE). There is ample textual and archaeological evidence of gardens at Nineveh, and the city was sometimes even referred to as ‘old Babylon’. In any case, even if the hypothesis of Nineveh is accepted, it still does not preclude the possibility of gardens at Babylon.\nThere were also gardens after the supposed date for the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, those at Pasargadae in the Zagros Mountains built by Cyrus the Great (d. 530 BCE), for example. All such gardens usually had terraces to aid irrigation, high walls to provide shade, trees were clustered together so as to better maintain their vital moisture and withstand scorching winds, and, of course, all were located near an abundant water source. That gardens were commonly associated with palaces (in just about every culture from ancient China to Mesoamerica) has led some scholars to speculate that the gardens at Babylon, if they did exist, would also have been near or in one of the royal palaces of Nebuchadnezzar on the banks of the River Euphrates.\nThe Seven Wonders\nSome of the monuments of the ancient world so impressed visitors from far and wide with their beauty, artistic and architectural ambition, and sheer scale that their reputation grew as must-see (themata) sights for the ancient traveller and pilgrim. Seven such monuments became the original 'bucket list' when ancient writers such as Herodotus, Callimachus of Cyrene, Antipater of Sidon, and Philo of Byzantium compiled shortlists of the most wonderful sights of the ancient world. In many early lists of the ancient wonders the gardens were listed alongside the magnificent walls of the city of Babylon which were, according to Strabo, 7 km long, in places 10 metres thick and 20 metres high, and regularly punctuated by even taller towers. The author P. Jordan suggests that the gardens made it on to the established list of Seven Wonders of the Ancient World because they \"appealed for sheer luxurious and romantic perversity of endeavour\" (18).\nAfter Nebuchadnezzar, Babylon continued to be an important city as part of the Achaemenid (550-330 BCE) and Seleucid Empires (312-63 BCE), the rulers of both entities often using the palaces at Babylon as their residence. Taken over in succession by the Parthians, the Arsacids and Sasanids, the city still maintained its regional strategic significance and, therefore, it is perfectly possible that the gardens survived for several centuries after their construction.\nSystematic archaeological excavations began at ancient Babylon in 1899 CE, and although many ancient structures such as the double walls and the Ishtar Gate have been found, there is no trace of the legendary gardens. A promising find of 14 vaulted rooms during excavations of the South Palace of Babylon turned out - after tablets were subsequently discovered on the spot and deciphered - to be nothing more spectacular than storerooms, albeit large ones. Another series of excavations much nearer the river and part of another of the king’s palaces have revealed large drains, walls, and what could have been a reservoir, all necessary irrigation features for the gardens but not proof positive of the fabled lost wonder.\nAside from the silence of archaeology, significantly, no Babylonian sources mention the gardens - either their construction or existence, even in a ruined state. This is perhaps the most damning evidence against the gardens having been at Babylon because the surviving Babylonian records include comprehensive descriptions of Nebuchadnezzar’s achievements and construction projects right down to the street names of Babylon.\nDespite the lack of physical and contemporary textual evidence, it seems difficult to believe that the gardens never existed at all when their legend stimulated such coverage by ancient writers and they held their place on the list of wonders for so long. If the neat idea that the gardens were really at Nineveh is rejected, then the likely answer, as always, seems somewhere in the middle. The original lists of wonders were compiled by either Greek writers or those writing for a Hellenistic audience and what would have more impressed a Greek, used to dry terraced hillsides of olive groves, than a lush garden of exotica ingeniously irrigated in the impossibly hot climate of Iraq? Perhaps, there was a garden of some sort at Babylon, and its scale became exaggerated just as the palace of Knossos on Crete was made into a mythical labyrinth by previous generations of Greek authors. Perhaps, time will tell as archaeology continues its slow and laborious investigations into the past. If anything, the Hanging Gardens of Babylon are the supreme example of why the idea of the Seven Wonders was created in the first place - a shortlist of truly wonderful human endeavours which few would ever see for themselves but which, nevertheless, still stimulated wonder, discussion, and emulation."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:0bb3d4ef-196e-4984-956a-ffef3f218959>","<urn:uuid:0ffc8b34-975f-40c3-8e27-850507adb9fd>"],"error":null}
{"question":"As a network administrator, I'm curious - what role does documentation play in fiber optic networks, and how does it connect to network survivability strategies?","answer":"Documentation plays a crucial role in fiber optic networks by supporting the design, installation, and maintenance processes. It includes recording cable plant paths, component specifications, interconnections, and test results in CAD drawings and databases. Proper documentation speeds up installation, helps in troubleshooting, and is essential for customer acceptance. This documentation directly connects to network survivability because it enables quick fault identification and implements protection strategies. For survivability, networks employ either protection architectures (where both working and spare lightpaths are established during configuration) or restoration architectures (where spare lightpaths are assigned after failures occur). The documentation helps maintain these redundant paths and supports rapid service restoration when failures occur.","context":["Documentation of the cable plant is a necessary part of the design and installation process for a fiber optic network. Documenting the installation properly during the planning process will save time and material. It will speed the cable installation and testing since the routing and terminations are already known. After component installation, the documentation should be completed with loss test data for acceptance by the end-user. During troubleshooting, documentation eases tracing links and finding faults. Proper documentation is usually required for customer acceptance of the finished project.\nThe documentation process begins at the initiation of the project and continues through to completion. It must begin with the actual cable plant path or location. Outside plant cables require documentation on the overall route and details on exact locations, e.g., on which side of streets, which cable on poles, where and how deep buried cables and splice closures lay, and if markers or tracing tape is buried with the cable. Premises cables require similar details inside a building for the cable to be located anywhere in the path.\nMost of this data can be kept in computer-aided design (CAD) drawings and a database or commercial software that stores component, connection and test data. Long outside plant links that include splices also may have optical time domain reflectometer (OTDR) traces, which should be stored as printouts and possibly in computer files for later viewing in the event that problems arise. Of course, that works only if a computer with proper software for viewing traces is available, so a copy of the viewing program should be on the disks. If the OTDR data is stored digitally, a listing of data files should be kept with the documentation to allow finding specific OTDR traces more easily.\nThe documentation process\nDocumentation begins with a basic layout for the network. A sketch on building blueprints may work for a small building, but a large campus, metropolitan or long-distance network will probably need a complete CAD layout. The best way to set up the data is to use a facility drawing and add the locations of all cables and connection points. Identify all the cables and racks or panels in closets. Then you are ready to transfer this data to a database.\nFiber optic cables, especially backbone cables, may contain many fibers that connect a number of different links, which may not all be going to the same place. The fiber optic cable plant, therefore, must be documented for cable location, the path of each fiber, interconnections and test results. You should record the specifications on every cable and fiber: the manufacturer, the type of cable and fiber, how many fibers, cable construction type, estimated length, and installation technique (buried, aerial, plenum, riser, etc.).\nIt will help to know what types of panels and hardware are being used and what end equipment (if any) is to be connected. If you are installing a big cable plant with many dark (unused) fibers, some will probably be left open at the panels, which also must be documented. When designing a network, it’s a good idea to have spare fibers and interconnection points in panels for future expansion, rerouting for repair or moving network equipment.\nDocumentation is more than records. All components should be labeled with color-coded permanent labels in accessible locations. Once a scheme of labeling fibers has been determined, each cable, accessible fiber and termination point requires some labeling for identification. A simple scheme is preferred and, if possible, explanations provided on patch panels or inside the cover of termination boxes.\nCable plant documentation records are very important. Keep several backup copies of each document, whether stored in a computer or on paper, in different locations for safekeeping. If a copy is presented to the customer, the installer should maintain his or her own records for future work on the project. One complete set on paper should be kept with a “restoration kit” of appropriate components, tools and directions in case of outages or cable damage. Documentation should be kept up-to-date to be useful, so that task should be assigned to one on-site person with instructions to inform all parties keeping copies of the records of updates needed. Access to modify records should be restricted to stop unauthorized changes to the documentation.\nHAYES is a VDV writer and trainer and the president of The Fiber Optic Association.

DWDM technology provides an excellent platform to exploit the huge capacity of optical fibre by multiplexing non-overlapping wavelength channels offering multiple terabits per second (Tb/s) transmission rates. The DWDM technique is emerging as a promising technology for the next generation of high-speed communication networks.\nOptical networks are prone to failures or may face attacks. When these come unexpectedly in network components, such as link and node failures at the optical layer, they can potentially lead to a catastrophic loss of data and revenue, thus producing an unacceptable deterioration in the delivered quality of service. Therefore, one of the most important optical network design issues is survivability, also called resilience or fault tolerance. This is the ability of a network to provide continuous service at an acceptable level in the presence of different failure scenarios.\nDesign of optical networks subject to service restoration and survivability requirements has become a crucial issue in network planning, which is known as an NP-hard problem. The integration of resilience into optical core networks is a complicated problem, which requires some redundant resources such as additional bandwidths. Typically in addition to the working lightpaths established between the original and destination node pairs, some spare lightpaths are also established in static or dynamic manners to restore traffic demands in the event of failures at working lightpaths.\nThere are several approaches for designing resilient optical networks, which are mainly based on protection and restoration architectures. In protection architectures, both working and spare lightpaths are established during configuration of the network for arrival requests, while in the restoration methods, the path planner uses network state variables such as link state variables and wavelength state variables to assign spare lightpaths after the occurrence of failures. Generally, the protection architecture is static, while the restoration architecture is dynamic; consequently the latter is efficient for bandwidth trading, and the former is efficient for restoration time. Network resilience approaches are assigned to different classes according to various criteria such as network cost planning, design complexity, bandwidth trading, traffic recovery time, robustness, quality of protection, scalability, type and number of failures, et cetera.\nIn this book we offer a collection of the latest contributions to the area of survivability in optical networks. These have been written by a number of well-established researchers in optical networks. There is also a special section which deals with the latest issues in survivability in each chapter. The book contains several chapters and is preceded by a preview and state-of-the-art introductory chapter. Each of the chapters focuses on some theoretical and practical aspects of network survivability methodologies applied to real world problems.Chapter 1\nintroduces the principles and state-of-the-art of survivability provisioning in optical networks, and in particular, in optical networks that employ wavelength division multiplexing (WDM). Concepts of survivability provisioning in optical networks such as protection and restoration, dedicated versus shared survivability, path-based, link-based, segment-based, cycle-based survivability, and so on, are covered to provide multiple classes of quality of protection against single failure, dual-failure, multiple simultaneous failures, or shared risk link group failures, in WDM mesh networks. Recent developments in survivable service provisioning are summarized, such as survivability provisioning that takes into account the connection holding-time, survivability in WDM light-trail networks, and optical burst switched networks. Finally, the chapter briefly examines future research directions.\nSurvivable routing serves as one of the most important issues in optical backbone design. Due to the high data rates enabled by the wavelength division multiplexing technology, any interruption in the service results the loss of a large amount of application data. Thus, making efforts to calculate and signal the protection resources promptly after the failure occurred would lead to an unacceptable high delay. As the main purpose of Chapter 2\n, the principles of pre-planned protection approaches in mesh optical backbone networks are discussed. The Shared Risk Link Group (SRLG) concept is introduced for modeling physical and geographical dependency among seemingly unrelated link failures. Finally, methods are presented for calculating the exact end-to-end availability of a connection.\nPassive Optical Networks (PON) support access network subscribers with bandwidth requirements more than 10 Mbps. Fiber and node failures in a PON network can lead to large amounts of data loss, while isolating the central office from the subscribers. Hence, high network availability is desired when a PON is used for business enterprises and for providing mobile backhaul services. To maximize network availability, several protection architectures have been proposed in literature. In Chapter 3\n, the novel WDM PON protection architectures amongst those proposed in the literature are critically analyzed and compared. The comparison is performed from topology, resource utilization, and power budget perspectives. The protection mechanisms that are typically used in the architectures and their impact on restoration are also discussed.\nThe advantages of transparent optical networks, such as high capacity and low cost, can be outweighed by their complex fault management and the high impact of the faults occurring within them. Indeed, transparent optical networks reduce unnecessary, complex, and expensive opto-electronic conversion, at the cost of having more damaging faults that affect longer distances than in opaque networks. Moreover, transparent optical networks have limited monitoring capabilities which could hinder efficient and accurate fault detection and localization. Different approaches have been proposed in the literature to perform fault localization, targeting different fault scenarios (e.g. single/multiple faults or looking at the optical/higher layers), and considering different assumptions (e.g. ideal/existence of false or lost alarms). Furthermore, fault management depends on the placement of monitoring equipment, whose optimization is studied and also presented in Chapter 4\nIn traditional optical networks, configured as static physical pipes, the carrier-grade network resilience is provided by means of protection and restoration capabilities. However, there is a need to develop a new generation of dynamic reconfigurable all optical networks with built in network resilience capabilities. In the next generation high-speed photonic packet switching networks, ultrafast packet header processing and packet switching are the vital building blocks. In Chapter 5\n, a review of different routing schemes for high-speed photonic packet switching networks, as well as the concept of reducing the size of the look-up routing table, is presented. A novel PPM signal format is presented in order to reduce the size of the routing table so as to reduce packet switching and processing time compared to conventional routing tables. A failure self detection and a routing table reconfiguration in the optical domain is introduced, and a number of factors such as system performance, reliability, and complexity are also discussed. Chapter 6\noutlines the different survivability approaches for mesh networks under static and dynamic traffic environments. It describes the different solution options and their implementations. Also included are detailed performance analyses and evaluations for the difference survivability approaches under both traffic environments. Finally, a performance comparison between the different survivability approaches is presented, and the chapter ends with some concluding remarks.\nAchieving low blocking probability and connection restorability in the presence of a link failure is a major goal of network designers. Typically, fault tolerant schemes try to maintain low blocking probability by maximizing the amount of primary capacity in the network. In Chapter 7\n, maximizing primary capacities in survivable networks is proposed. It is assumed that the total capacity on each link is fixed, and then it is allocated into primary or backup capacity. The distribution of primary capacity affects blocking probability for dynamic traffic. This is seen by simulating dynamic traffic with different ways to distribute capacities in a network. A Hamiltonian p-cycle is a capacity optimal way of allocating primary and backup capacity. However, different Hamiltonian p-cycles may deliver different blocking probabilities for dynamic traffic. In general, more evenly distributing the backup and primary capacity lowers the blocking probability. This chapter provides upper bounds on how much primary capacity a network can provide if it uses a link based protection strategy to guarantee survivability for one or more link failures. Using integer linear programs, it is shown that requiring pre-configuring carries a cost in terms of capacity if the solution is structured as a set of cycles.\nTraffic grooming supports efficient utilization of network resources by allowing sub-wavelength granularity connections to be groomed onto a single lightpath. Chapter 8\ninvestigates the problem of dynamic traffic grooming for WDM networks under a differentiated resilience scheme. Two differentiated resilience schemes at different grooming levels – the Differentiated Resilience at Lightpath (DRAL) level scheme and the Differentiated Resilience at Connection (DRAC) level scheme - are presented. These two explore different ways of provisioning backup paths and tradeoff between bandwidth efficiency and the number of required grooming ports. Both schemes support three resilience classes: dedicated protection, shared protection, and restoration. Simulation is carried out to evaluate and compare the two differentiated resilience schemes. Simulation results show that the DRAL scheme is relatively insensitive to the changes in the number of grooming ports, while the DRAC scheme utilizes grooming ports more aggressively as it trades grooming ports for bandwidth efficiency in routing and grooming.\nThe high capacity advantage of optical networks also introduces the risk of substantial data loss in case of a service interruption even if the outage lasts only a short time. Therefore, survivable and reliable design and management of optical networks is urgent. However, deployment of efficient survivability policies does not always guarantee the continuity of the service. Long failure restoration delays, multiple failures, and lack of protection resources may lead to service unavailability. Hence, connection availability arises as a design constraint, and it is defined as the probability of a connection being in the operating state at any time. Availability-constrained optical network design and availability-constrained connection provisioning are two important problems to guarantee robustness of connections in a survivable network which are discussed in Chapter 9\nOriginally, networks were engineered to provide only one type of service, i.e. either voice or data, so only one level of resiliency was requested. This trend has changed, and today’s approach in service provisioning is quite different. A Service Level Agreement (SLA) stipulated between users and service providers (or network operators) regulates a series of specific requirements, e.g., connection set-up times and connection availability that has to be met in order to avoid monetary fines. In recent years this has caused a paradigm shift on how to provision these services. From a “one-solution-fits-all” scenario, we witness now a more diversified set of approaches where trade-offs among different network parameters (level of protection vs. cost and/or level of protection vs. blocking probability) play an important role. Chapter 10\naims at presenting a series of network resilient methods that are specifically tailored for a dynamic provisioning with such differentiated requirements. Both optical backbone and access networks are considered. In the chapter, a number of provisioning scenarios - each one focusing on a specific Quality of Service (QoS) parameter - are considered. First, the effect of delay tolerance, defined as the amount of time a connection request can wait before being set up, on blocking probability is investigated when Shared Path Protection (SPP) is required. Then, the problem of how to assign “just-enough” resources to meet each connection availability requirement is described, and a possible solution via a SPP scheme with Differentiated Reliability is presented. Finally, a possible trade off between deployment cost and level of reliability performance in Passive Optical Networks (PONs) is investigated. The results presented highlight the importance of carefully considering each connection’s QoS parameters whilst devising a resilient provisioning strategy. By doing so, the benefits in terms of cost saving and blocking probability improvement become relevant, allowing network operators and service providers to maintain satisfied customers at reasonable capital and operational expenditure levels.Chapter 11\nprovides new distributed frameworks to support Quality of Service (QoS) differentiation. These frameworks provide differentiated protection services to meet the availability requirements of customers in an effective manner. The availability-analysis for connections with different protection schemes is described. Through this analysis, it is shown how connection availability is affected by resource sharing. Based on the availability analysis, the proposed framework provisions each connection, in which an appropriate level of protection is provided according to its predefined availability requirement. Networks without wavelength conversion capability are considered as well as dynamic traffic environment. In these distributed frameworks several distributed schemes to provision and manage connections cost-effectively while satisfying the existing and new connections availability requirements are proposed.Chapter 12\npresents a novel approach for dealing with failures in and attacks on Transparent Optical Packet Switching (TOPS) mesh networks. The approach is composed of two phases, wherein the first one dynamically dimensions the resources in the network and the second one applies an incremental learning algorithm, which generates an intelligent policy. At each node, such a policy allows a self-healing behavior when there are failures or attacks in the network. Finally, the performance of this approach is presented as well as future research lines.\nThe idea of Chapter 13\nis to give an overview of fiber-optic communication systems. The most important devices for fiber-optic transmission systems are presented and their properties discussed. In particular, there is consideration of such systems working with those basic components necessary to explain the principle of operation. Among them is the optical transmitter, consisting of a light source, typically a high speed driven laser diode. Furthermore, the optical receiver has to be mentioned; it consists of a photodiode and a low noise high bit rate front-end amplifier. Nevertheless, in the focus of the considerations the optical fiber is found as the dominant element in optical communication systems. Different fiber types are presented and their properties explained. The joint action of these three basic components leads to a fiber- optic systems, mainly applied for data communication. The systems operate as transmission links with bit rates up to 40 Gbit/s. Furthermore, optical communication systems have also been used for recent application areas in the MBit/s region, e.g. in aviation, automobile, and maritime industry. Therefore, besides pure glass fibers, polymer optical fibers (POF) and polymer-cladded silica (PCS) fibers have to be taken into account.\nThus, this collection provides a wide ranging overview of many of the salient issues in modern optical networks from the point of view of resilience. It is intended to appeal to a wide range of readers, and for this reason, it includes both material of a tutorial nature and reports on state of the art methods. It is essential that the key differences and similarities between optical and other networks are appreciated, particularly with regard to all optical networks. Moreover, given the importance of WDM in the provision of multiple channels, it receives substantial coverage. Furthermore, optical networks make it necessary to take a broad view of resilience, and this collection has done so, including several layers of the OSI model. For readers new to many aspects of the topic, there is coverage of many of the essentials fundamentals, particularly in the first few chapters. Needless to say, these can be skipped over quickly by those more familiar with the subject area.\nWhen considering transparent optical networks with their advantages such as high capacity, it was also part of the aim to bring to the attention of the reader their complex fault management and the high impact of the faults occurring within them. Thus, the collection here considers cutting-edge aspects of this problem such as incremental learning and the optimum placement of monitoring equipment.\nResilience is not just of significance within the core network, and in this collection, high speed access networks are not forgotten, with a particular emphasis on Passive Optical Networks (PON) supporting relatively demanding end users. Given the tree structure implicit in PONs, failures can lead to large data losses and subscriber isolation, so protection is of paramount importance. Moreover, the differentiated services offered throughout modern optical networks (including the access part) mean that differentiated resilience must also be offered. For the future, it will be necessary to provide an appropriate level of protection across the same network for users from impoverished students tackling homework assignments to major corporations handling voluminous and confidential data processing tasks. Whereas in the past, networks were often designed for just one type of service, modern service level provision is via a totally different model. In the networks of today and tomorrow, each user may have a different level of agreed service, leading to inevitable tradeoffs that may include price as well as purely technical factors. In this respect, distributed frameworks are germane to the delivery of the differentiated QoS required. Moreover, traffic grooming offers a route to the efficient of network resource utilization, and thus, features significantly in the book in the context of differentiated resilience.\nAchieving low blocking probability and connection restorability when failures occur also figure prominently in the work. Within these topics, methods for bounding the capacities available and for offering rapid restoration are covered. In addition, the traffic changes with time in modern high speed networks, so the increasing prevalence of dynamic traffic environments figures within the collection\nResearch and development engineers, graduate students studying optical networks, and senior undergraduate students with a background in algorithms and networking will find this book interesting and useful. This work may also be used as supplemental readings for graduate courses on internetworking, routing, survivability, and network planning algorithms.Yousef S.

{"question":"What role do community resources play in supporting both individual wellness and environmental sustainability initiatives?","answer":"Community resources play a vital role in both individual wellness and environmental sustainability initiatives. For individual wellness, community facilities like libraries provide opportunities for intellectual health through books, lectures, and computer skills training, while also offering spaces for social interaction and volunteer opportunities that contribute to emotional and social health. Similarly, in the context of environmental sustainability, community infrastructure like public EV charging stations is essential for promoting clean transportation. However, current deployment shows significant disparities, with charging stations concentrated in certain communities - particularly those with higher education levels and income. This uneven distribution of community resources affects both personal wellness opportunities and environmental sustainability efforts, highlighting the need for more equitable access to these facilities across all neighborhoods.","context":["Optimal Health: What it is and how to get it\nYou are over your rehab and are reaching a level of health that you feel good about. How do you keep healthy? What does being healthy mean, considering your spinal cord injury? Here are some ideas about what optimal health means and what you can do to keep healthy for a long, long time.\nWhat is optimal health?\nIf we asked a group of people this question, their responses would be quite different. Some would say physical health is the key. To them, athletic skills or physical abilities might be what matter most. Others might view good health in terms of relationships and maintaining social interactions. Still others believe that emotional health and intellectual challenges are most important. We are all very different and complex persons. We grow and change as different challenges, problems or needs become a part of our lives.\nBut how do we continue to grow – and keep in good health – in the presence of a disability like spinal cord injury? In recent years, health-care professionals agree that health is not merely \"freedom from disease\" or disability, but that it includes life's physical, emotional, social, spiritual, and intellectual aspects as well. It's not just medical self-care and treatment of health problems that promote optimal health; it's increasing potential as well. Here then are five areas that make up your overall health.\nFive areas of health:\nPhysical health: Relates to your body, and includes eating habits, exercise, medical self-care and treatment of health problems. Smoking, drugs, and alcohol use have potential negative affects on your health.\nEmotional health: Refers to your state of mind. It is how you react to day-to-day stresses, your sense of worth, and your ability to relax and enjoy leisure.\nSocial health: It’s the ability to keep healthy interactions with friends, family, neighbors or co-workers.\nSpiritual health: Includes having a sense of purpose in life, the ability to give and receive love and the ability to feel goodwill toward others.\nIntellectual health: Results from the mental stimulation and development we get through our work, school, community service, hobbies, or cultural pursuits.\nHow to promote optimal health\nPromoting optimal health in any or all of these areas may mean changing your lifestyle. Yet, choosing and sticking with healthy behaviors is tricky. With a spinal cord injury, even more roadblocks may impede the journey. Coping issues, wheelchair inaccessibility, inadequate health coverage for general and disability-related health care needs, and trouble staying physically fit with paralysis are just a few of the challenges people with spinal cord injuries face.\nWhat can you do?\n- Follow good health practices and seek regular medical follow-up\n- Stop smokingo Eat a balanced diet\n- Maintain the best body weight for your height and age\n- Reduce alcohol consumption and keep track of the variety of medications you use daily\n- Get regular exercise as allowed by your level of SCI\n- Working on neck and/or shoulder strengthening\n- If you have a high level SCI, you might consider:\n- Working on diaphragmatic breath control\n- Taking voice and/or singing lessons\n- Working on neck and/or shoulder strengthening\n- Read books and the newspaper regularly; if necessary, look into adapted page turners\n- Attend lectures and programs\n- Decrease time watching TV\n- Explore at your local library\n- Learn computer skills\n- Learn from public library or college library audio and video tapes\n- Explore volunteer possibilities\n- Explore forms of and set time aside each day for meditation and/or prayer\n- Attend a spiritual or religious meeting\n- Read a spiritual book or lesson\n- Select a valued personal characteristic (patience, forgiveness or compassion) and develop it\n- Journal or write an account of your daily life, feelings and thoughts\n- Learn to recognize your feelings and express them\n- Accept compliments or praise graciously\n- Seek professional help for serious adjustment problems\n- Relieve tension with relaxation and leisure activities\n- Learn how to cope with and adapt to stress\n- Learn relaxation and stress management techniques\n- Show more affection toward loved ones\n- Be less critical of others\n- Express your feelings\n- Help educate others about what disability is – and is not – about\n- Fulfill responsibilities to others\n- Learn relaxation strategies\n- Learn effective communication and other life skills\nThe good news is that health care providers are getting better at supporting you in your journey to optimal health. Find a provider who is experienced in working with spinal cord injury survivors and in whom you have confidence. Seek out the information that you need to improve your health in all five areas of life.\nFinally. . . .\nPersons with SCI – and everyone else – can develop a healthy life by learning to:","As electric vehicles (EVs) roll onto the roads in large volumes across the U.S, there has been a corresponding demand for more robust charging infrastructure. Despite the appealing environmental and economic benefits of EVs, the convenience of charging stations heavily influences adoption. And there begins the problem. While electric vehicle use is growing rapidly in well-to-do, predominantly White communities, minority neighborhoods have largely been left behind to date.\nThe U.S. government has emphasized the importance of equity when planning infrastructure investments in bills like the Build Back Better plan, and has incentivized a large portion of EV infrastructure funding in programs like NEVI and policies that seek to ensure EV charging infrastructure is deployed equitably.\nBut how well are these policies performing?\nTaking a granular approach to assess the current state of EV infrastructure\nIn an effort to understand the current state of equity in charger deployment, identify gaps that may exist, and add to the body of knowledge surrounding EV infrastructure deployment – we decided to leverage our vast data core, analytical expertise, and powerful software platform to conduct an analysis of Public EV Level 2 chargers in Columbus, Ohio.\nIn the sections below, we explore where access to EV chargers is most prevalent based on variables like population density, various socio-demographic statistics, and with different definitions of what constitutes a charging gap.\nEV Charging Infrastructure Basics\nFor EVs to achieve broad adoption and utilization, drivers need easy access to charging infrastructure. While many EV owners charge at home, people with longer commutes or irregular driving habits are unlikely to see themselves in EV ownership without excellent access to public charging stations.\nThere are three levels of charging equipment, determined by charging speed.\n- Level 1 (L1) – less than 2% of public EV chargers in the U.S. are L1.\n- Level 2 (L2) – the most common type of public EV chargers, accounting for more than 80% of public EV chargers in the U.S.\n- Level 3 (L3) – more than 15% of public EV chargers in the U.S. are L3.\nDue to the overwhelming preference for and majority of public charging stations being Level 2, we focused our analysis on L2 chargers.\nThe Landscape of EV Charging Infrastructure in Columbus\nAt first glance, you see that Columbus has Level 2 EV chargers spread across the city. A high concentration of chargers are located in the downtown area. So during our study, we took population density into consideration when drawing any conclusions regarding charger placement.\nRacial Factors and public EV Charger Locations\nCloser inspection of the distribution of public chargers in Columbus reveals disparities when comparing majority White areas to majority non-White areas. This is in line with other recent studies on public EV charging distribution. For example, Axios did an analysis of 35 U.S. cities and found that majority-White census tracts are 1.4 times as likely to have a charger.\nGiven UrbanFootprint’s unique ability to aggregate data across all census resolutions, we looked a level of granularity deeper, analyzing census block groups in Columbus using our Analyst application. It revealed that the EV charging locations in our study area are even more heavily skewed towards majority-White areas than what Axios had found in other cities around the country.\nIn Columbus, majority-White block groups are 2 times more likely to have a charger, and 2.3 times more likely to have at least three chargers.\nBut we knew there were likely other factors that may be more strongly correlated with the prevalence of charging stations than race and ethnicity.\nRelationship between EV Charger Presence and Educational Level\nOur study found an even stronger correlation between high education levels and the presence of EV chargers. It was immediately apparent from looking at the map that the median US educational attainment level (36% with at least a bachelor’s degree) was a tipping point for whether a block group would likely contain an L2 charger.\nTo be specific, around 80% of L2 chargers in our study were located in block groups with above the US median for bachelor’s degree attainment – and those block groups were 3.55 times as likely to contain a charger than those below the median.\nThe really shocking piece of this statistic is that these same block groups accounted for only 51% of population and only 40% of area.\nMedian Income and its Impact on EV Charger Distribution\nMedian income also appears to play a significant role in charger presence. Within our study area, block groups with chargers had median incomes 1.1 times higher than those without. Moreover, block groups with average incomes above the US median for household income ($68,703) were 2.24 times as likely to have a charger.\nThis finding supports the argument that historically, charger placement has favored higher income areas, and raises concerns for how access to EV infrastructure will lead to income-based disparities in future EV usage.\nEquitable Access to EV Chargers\nThe end goal of public EV charging infrastructure is to serve the public. That is, having enough chargers in a given block group to satisfy demand. We wanted to get an overall picture of who is being “served” versus “unserved” in Columbus. We chose 4 L2 chargers as a threshold for which to consider a block group “served.”\nWhen we looked at the data through this lens, all three ‘metrics’ (education level, median income, and racial composition) showed equity-related differences.\nConclusions and Recommendations\nOverall, our findings indicate that education level and median income are the most closely related metrics to the distribution of EV chargers in Columbus, Ohio. While racial factors are not quite as strong, there is still a trend for chargers to be more present in predominantly White block groups – in line with studies of other major cities across the country.\nAdditionally, the results were progressively more compelling as we peeled back all of the layers of data. For example, when limiting the analysis to the areas of the city with the highest population density, and increasing the threshold of what counts as a charging gap, the trends are magnified significantly.\nPolicymakers, local governments, utilities, and private companies should consider these findings when incentivizing, funding, planning, and placing future EV infrastructure. By focusing on ensuring equitable access to chargers, they can support the wider adoption of EVs. This includes prioritizing charger installation in diverse neighborhoods and areas with lower educational attainment and income levels.\nBy leveraging the right data at the intersections of climate, community, and the built environment, we can surface the actionable insights that will ensure a more equitable distribution of EV chargers – that will ultimately contribute significantly to higher EV adoption rates, pushing us closer towards a more resilient, sustainable, and inclusive future.
