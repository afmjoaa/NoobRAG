{"question":"How do the privacy protections in FERPA for student records compare to the privacy considerations for student Internet access in filtered school libraries?","answer":"FERPA provides strict privacy protections for student records, requiring written consent from students over 18 (or parents/guardians of minors) before releasing information about grades and personal details. In contrast, privacy protections for student Internet access in filtered school libraries are less rigid - while libraries have an ethical obligation to protect user privacy, content filters can monitor and log student Internet activity. Libraries are advised to minimize logging of user data and regularly delete logfiles, but there isn't the same level of legal protection as FERPA's consent requirements. Additionally, while FERPA specifically protects educational records, library filtering affects broader access to information while potentially compromising privacy through monitoring capabilities.","context":["For a variety of reasons, many public libraries and schools install content filters on the Internet access they provide to their patrons and students. A library may decide to filter in response to community standards or to comply with state filtering legislation in order to receive funding. A governing authority such as a school district or local government may also require a library under its jurisdiction to filter. Libraries that receive federal E-rate funds for Internet access or in-building network enhancements must also comply with the filtering and other requirements of the Children’s Internet Protection Act (CIPA).\nWhatever the reasons, many libraries must deal with the well-documented negative effects of content filters on intellectual freedom. Filters often block adults and minors from access to a wide range of vital information and forms of expression that are constitutionally protected speech. CIPA requires only a narrow category of speech to be blocked: visual images that are obscene, child pornography, or visual images that are deemed \"harmful to minors\" under the law. Filtering technology is not sophisticated enough to make such narrow distinctions, and as a result both over filtering and under filtering occurs in the attempt to block images that meet these criteria.\nFilters also threaten the privacy of users by monitoring and logging Internet activity. As more websites move to HTTPS to secure communications from eavesdropping, this presents a challenge for filters that employ content inspection techniques. Some filters now include the ability to decrypt HTTPS protocols and can thereby monitor and log user activities on secure websites. Implementation of these capabilities is not required under legislation like CIPA, nor is it consistent with the mission and values of libraries.\nThese guidelines are issued to provide public and school libraries with information about how to select, configure, manage, and assess content filters to minimize the negative effects on free inquiry and the privacy of library users.\nLibrary staff, who have an ethical obligation to protect intellectual freedom, and information technology (IT) staff, who typically must install and support the product, should work collaboratively to select filtering software.\nThe filter selection team should consider standard criteria for purchasing any technology product or service including features, performance, ease of administration, vendor support, cost, user privacy, etc. To minimize the negative effects on intellectual freedom, the following additional criteria should be considered when selecting a filter:\n- Ability to select narrow and specific categories of content to be blocked.\n- The technologies and procedures used by the vendor to categorize content.\n- Ability to permanently unblock content that is incorrectly blocked.\n- Ability to notify users that content is being blocked and their options, if any, for accessing the content.\n- Options to easily disable the filter upon request by library staff or directly by the users.\n- Ability to run reports or analytics on what is being blocked and how frequently it is blocked.\nDeciding what categories of content to filter is a law and policy decision that should be made by library and school administration and ultimately approved by their respective boards. Filter settings should not be selected solely by IT staff who likely do not have a background in the importance of intellectual freedom in libraries.\nFilters often come pre-configured with many categories and types of content blocked by default. These settings should be carefully reviewed by library staff, school administrators, and educators. Only the minimal number of categories (e.g. only illegal categories of sexually explicit images, if the concern is CIPA compliance) should be blocked. Ideally a technology team (consisting of library staff, IT staff, administrators, educators, etc.) will test filter configurations by running sample searches before implementation to ensure that the chosen settings over-block and under-block as little as possible.\nAvoid blocking content based on viewpoint or because the topic is controversial. Avoid blocking entire types of content (e.g. videos or social media) or protocols (i.e. music streaming). Some libraries may restrict these services not because of the nature of their content but because of the bandwidth they consume. However, bandwidth concerns can be managed without blocking protected speech by using other technologies and techniques that focus on the amount of network activity, rather than the type of content.\nLimitations in filtering technology cause over filtering, a situation that occurs when content is blocked because it is incorrectly categorized. Schools and libraries should establish procedures that allow adults and minors to request content which is incorrectly categorized to be unblocked in a timely manner. Schools and libraries should also establish procedures to notify users about what is being filtered and what their options are to access incorrectly blocked content.\nMany filters provide the ability to decrypt secure (HTTPS) transactions using a so-called “man-in-the-middle” method. This allows the filter to scan the content of web pages and URLs that would normally be secure. Without decryption, a filter can only block an entire HTTPS domain (e.g., ala.org), and it is unable to block individual web pages or sections of a website. The effects of decryption on the privacy of patrons can be profound if they use the library for web activities that require secure communications. For example, the security of usernames, passwords, and sensitive personal information, including commercial, educational, financial, legal, and medical information may be compromised. Because of this, decryption should not be enabled on library computers.\nBy default, most filters and routers generate logs of user activity data. Library staff have an ethical and often a legal obligation to protect the privacy of this information and thus access to these logs should be restricted to authorized staff. The library should configure the device to log the minimum amount of data and develop procedures to regularly delete the logfiles.\nThe ability to easily disable filters is crucial to mitigating their negative effects on free inquiry. The Supreme Court affirmed in its decision to uphold CIPA that adults and minors 17 or older have the right to have content unblocked or the filter disabled for research or any lawful purpose. Public and school libraries need to establish a set of procedures that allow the disabling of filters for adults and minors 17 and older quickly and easily with as little staff intervention as possible. Libraries of all types should be prepared to unblock incorrectly categorized or incorrectly blocked websites for users of all ages.\nHere are some possible disabling scenarios to accommodate libraries of different sizes and technical capabilities.\n- A library could make some computers available with a browser extension that allows the user to disable the filter by enabling a web proxy. The library would need to have procedures in place to make sure only adults and minors 17 and older used the computers with the proxy extension.\n- A library could provide staff with the ability to disable the filter at the request of an adult. If the filter does not support disabling by staff on-the-fly, the computers could be configured with a second account with unfiltered access that requires staff login. The disadvantage of this scenario is that making users ask library staff for unfiltered access presents a barrier that may have a chilling effect on such requests.\n- A library with computer sign in software that includes user authentication could allow adults and minors 17 and older to choose their own filtering level, e.g. none, minimal or strict. If the sign in software does not support the ability of adult users to select their filtering level when logging in, the browser could be configured with an extension that allows the user to quickly and easily disable the filter by using a web proxy.\n- A library or school could set up procedures to allow users to request that specific web pages or websites become unblocked by library staff either temporarily for a specific activity (e.g. student assignment) or permanently. The procedures to permanently unblock a resource should include a request form that allows the user to explain why the resource should be unblocked, a review process by library staff or educators, and a way to notify the requester about the outcome of the review.\nIn addition, if CIPA compliance is the concern, filters only have to be applied to devices provided by the library for use in the library or school. User-owned devices connecting to a library’s wireless or wired network do not need to be filtered. Laptops and other devices checked out for use outside the library or school do not need to be filtered.\nAll types of libraries should establish procedures to continually assess the impact of the filter on library users. The assessment should include:\n- Tests by library staff on common research topics to determine extent of over filtering and under filtering.\n- Regular reports on what is being blocked, recategorizations, disabling requests, etc.\n- Survey of library and classroom users on the effect of the filter on their Internet activities.\nThe results of the assessment should be used to make continual improvements to the filter (i.e. to reduce the negative impacts on free inquiry and privacy). These improvements may involve changes to the filtering software's configuration, changes to library and school procedures, or the selection of different filtering software.\nBandwidth Management (TechSoup for Libraries)\nFencing Out Knowledge: Impacts of the Children’s Internet Protection Act 10 Years Later (American Library Association, Office of Information Technology Policy OITP & Office for Intellectual Freedom Policy Brief No. 5, June 2014)\nFiltering and the First Amendment (American Libraries, April 2013)\nHow to: Circumvent Online Censorship (Surveillance Self-Defense, Electronic Frontier Foundation)\nInternet Filtering: An Interpretation of the Library Bill of Rights (American Library Association)\nChildren's Internet Protection Act (CIPA) Guidance for Libraries (Universal Service Administrative Company, July 2016)\nIssue Brief: The Time has Come to Move to HTTPS!

Web proxies are often used to avoid content filtering and censorship. There are a number of browser extensions that allow users to enable a pre-defined proxy. A library could run their own proxy using free software like Squid or point to one of the many public proxies. Note that making some computers available that are unfiltered would not be CIPA compliant because of specific language in the legislation that mandates that filters must be installed on all computers.","Public Records Law: Know Your Rights and Limitations\nWhen searching for public records and the information contained in them, you may not be aware of the several laws existing at both the state and federal levels which will affect your efforts. There are basically two types of laws and statutes that concern public records; these include both “right to access” or “right to know” laws as well as “right to privacy” laws. Following is a discussion of both.\nRight to Know Laws Affecting Public Records\nThere are several federal laws which directly affect your ability to access public records. These include the Freedom of Information Act, open meeting laws, and even the First Amendment of the Constitution.\nThe Freedom of Information Act, also known as FOIA, was signed into law in 1966 and provides for public access to records maintained by the federal government. Previously, these records were unavailable to the public. Furthermore, in 1996 an amendment was passed which requires federal agencies to provide these records to the public electronically. Each state generally has its own version of the FOIA implemented to ensure access to local public records.\nIn an effort to promote transparency in government operations, open meeting laws or “sunshine” laws allow the public to attend government agency meetings where official business is conducted. These laws vary from state to state, and may even be known by a different name. For example, California’s open meeting law is the Brown Act.\nThe First Amendment to the United States Constitution states that the U.S. Congress may not create any statute which directly impedes the freedom of the press. In 1938, the press was defined as “every sort of publication which affords a vehicle of information and opinion” in Lovell v. City of Griffin. However, this fundamental right is always subject to privacy laws.\nRight to Privacy Laws Affecting Public Records\nThere are several different privacy laws which affect the public’s ability to access specific types of records or information found in them. These include the federal Privacy Act, the Driver’s Privacy Protection Act, HIPAA, FERPA and FCRA.\nThe federal Privacy Act of 1974 outlines the requirements and restrictions for concerned agencies which gather, maintain and provide information that concerns an individual. The Privacy Act also aims to protect personal identifying information such as Social Security numbers while allowing the public to request copies or amendments to federal records. Similarly, the Driver’s Privacy Protection Act of 1994 protects sensitive information about an individual stored by the Department of Motor Vehicles.\nHIPAA, or the Health Insurance Privacy and Portability Act, was passed in 1996 by Congress. This act protects sensitive information contained in an individual’s medical records, and requires express written consent from a patient before they may be disclosed to an outside party.\nThe Federal Educational Rights and Privacy Act, or FERPA, was passed into law in 1974. This law protects the information contained in a student’s records such as institutions attended, grades and other personal details. Students over the age of 18 must provide written consent for anyone else to access them. Parents or guardians of minor students are the only parties able to access these records without consent.\nThe Fair Credit Reporting Act regulates information concerning an individual’s credit. This law also determines who can access the information, and requires employers to obtain an appropriate release form from potential employees prior to conducting a background check.\nFinally, regardless of whether you are concerned with your rights of privacy or access concerning public records, become familiar with your local state laws. Each state has its own laws and regulations concerning the public records maintained by state agencies such as property and vital records, and these will directly affect your efforts to obtain them."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:d4163bb3-bf00-4d4c-bce6-3fcd7c7e8f38>","<urn:uuid:f8f3812d-e597-4bcc-a098-a8e374ea8fe0>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What's the likelihood of death from measles in developed countries compared to global statistics before widespread vaccination?","answer":"Before widespread vaccination in 1980, measles caused an estimated 2.6 million deaths worldwide annually. In developed countries today, the death rate is approximately 1-2 deaths per 1,000 measles cases. For comparison, during a 1989-1990 U.S. outbreak, there were 55,000 cases resulting in 123 deaths, primarily affecting unvaccinated preschool children.","context":["Have you heard the news? There has been a documented case of measles in the area and there will probably be more. How can this be? Though we don’t see measles very much, the disease is still around. Most of the time an outbreak can be traced to a case being “imported” in from another country. Before the vaccine in this country, EVERYONE got the measles, mumps and rubella. There were approximately 3 to 4 million cases diagnosed a year. During an outbreak of measles in this country in 1989, 1 out of every 500 people diagnosed died. It is an awful, preventable disease.\nNone of us like to see our children hurt, and vaccines are not fun for our child. Last night I worked at an immunization clinic in the area and even though I am a firm believer in vaccinating, as I gave those vaccines, the tears tugged at my heart strings. But, I knew that those children were being protected from a disease much worse than the few moments of discomfort resulting in the tears. So with a sticker and a small stuffed dog for each child, there were smiles after the tears and those children left protected.\nHere are the most common questions parents have regarding the MMR (measles mumps rubella) vaccine.\n1. What about autism?\n- There is NO scientific link between the MMR and autism.\n- The first study that reported a connection between the MMR vaccine and autism was done by Dr. Andrew Wakefield of the Royal Free Hospital in the United Kingdom in 1998. Dr. Wakefield attempted to link the MMR with bowel problems such as Crohn’s Disease and Autism. The study was based on 12 children. There was no control group; the study did not identify the time period during which the cases were identified, in four of the 12 cases behavioral problems appeared before the MMR. Ten out of 12 of Dr. Wakefield’s fellow researchers have withdrawn their support of this study. The study has been has been withdrawn.\n- There are a large number of medical and scientific studies that show no connection between the MMR vaccine and autism. These studies have included thousands of children in many countries and were completed by many different scientists. All of the studies were well controlled and published in well-respected journals.\n- The MMR vaccine has NEVER contained thimerosal, a preservative that many tried to link to autism.\n2. Aren’t measles, mumps and rubella harmless if my child gets the diseases?\n- Measles is a highly contagious disease spread by water droplet. It causes a rash, high fever, cough, runny nose and red, watery eyes.\n- Measles can cause encephalitis which can lead to seizures, deafness or brain damage in 1 to 2 of every 2,000 cases.\n- In the 1989 -1990 outbreak in the U.S., there were 55,000 cases, 11.000 hospitalizations, and 123 deaths. Most of these cases were in preschool children who were not vaccinated.\n- Mumps cause fever, headache and swelling of glands on the sides of the jaw.\n- 4 to 6 people out of 100 who are ill with mumps will develop meningitis\n- 4 out of every 10 adult men who get the mumps may develop sterility due to inflammation of the testicles.\n- Mumps may cause hearing loss.\n- Rubella is a mild illness in children and young adults which results in rash and fever for about 3 days.\n- Rubella will cause birth defects if contracted by a pregnant mom, there is at least an 80% chance of damage to an unborn child.\n3. What is the danger of the MMR vaccine?\n- The MMR vaccine is safe and most children have no reactions.\n- About 5 to 15% of children will develop a fever 5 to 12 days later.\n- About 5% will develop a rash 1 to 2 weeks after the vaccine.\n- Central nervous system reactions such as encephalitis have been reported in less than one case per 1 million doses of the vaccine. This is many times lower than the occurrence of serious central nervous system problems after the measles which is 1 in 800 cases.\n4. When should my child receive the MMR?\n- Your child should receive 2 doses of the MMR. The first dose is recommended on or after the first birthday. The 2nd dose is before entering school between age 4 and 6.\n- If your child is behind schedule, they may receive one dose of the MMR and a 2nd dose 4 weeks later.\n- 95% of those vaccinated are immune after the first dose, 99.7% are immune after the 2nd dose.\n5. What if my child has been exposed and has not been vaccinated?\n- The MMR may be effective if given in the first 3 days after exposure to measles. More information can be found at www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs.\nI know there is so much information in so many different places. It is difficult to decide what is credible and what is not. The fact is, your child is safer and healthier when he or she is fully vaccinated. Don’t take the risk. We are a society that has not seen the devastating results of these preventable diseases because of vaccines. If your child is not fully vaccinated, make that appointment today!\nTake a breath, enjoy the joyful moments of each day, and remember you don’t have to be perfect to be the perfect parent.\nKaitlyn was a typical toddler, she definitely had an opinion!\nYou wake up one day, and it is a whole new ball game. You now have a toddler. Toddlers are so much fun, but can also be a challenge. We are not used to our child having an opinion, and a toddler has one and often expresses it very loudly! Toddlers can be having a tantrum one minute and laughing the next!\nYour toddler’s biggest developmental task is to start to develop independence. Your child will begin to separate from you at times, and be very clingy at other times. Every day and sometimes every minute,is a new adventure when you have a 1 to 3 year old!\nWe know that toddlers are a bundle of energy. Everything is an adventure! Kitchen cupboards, knobs and buttons, computers, and even the drain in the tub is interesting. Toddlers are busy discovering and really don’t have time for naps and potty training, although both are important for toddlers! Toddlers are free little spirits and have very little self-control, which often results in your precious child throwing himself on the floor in a fit of frustration and anger. To better understand your toddler, there are a few principles of toddler psychology…..\n- A toddler is developing creativity, independence, curiosity, and imagination. The whole world is open and exciting! Your child is not misbehaving when he smashes peas, climbs on the table, or puts his finger in a place it should not be, he is exploring. Exploration is developmentally appropriate for your toddler!\n- A toddler has very little self-control and tolerance to frustration. Sometimes it is so frustrating that a puzzle piece will not fit, or he can’t climb on the counter, or you break up his cracker that he wanted whole! Because a toddler has very few words and a limited repertoire to handle frustration, the “logical” thing for him to do is melt down, kick, cry, and let his opinion be heard by all!\n- Toddlers want attention. Attention is attention to a toddler, whether it is negative attention or positive attention. As parents, we need to limit our words of explanation to a toddler. A 2-year-old doesn’t really care if he will fall off the table, he just wants to climb on it. You will never convince him otherwise…there will be no moment of epiphany when he understands your safety talk! We must not reinforce behavior by giving extended attention to unwanted behavior. Give lots of positive words to positive behavior….very few words to negative behavior.\n- Toddlers need predictability and routine. Your child will behave much better when there is a routine in place at home. The amount of frustration and the number of tantrums will decrease when you establish routines and rituals.\n- Toddlers need some sense of control. Give your child true choices. “Do you want the bananas or the apple sauce?” “Do you want to wear this shirt or this one?” “Do you want to read your story before your bath or after?” Do not give choices when there are no true choice. Only ask a yes or no question if you are happy with the answer being “No!”\n- Toddler temper tantrums are a result of frustration, being overly tired, being hungry and learning that they work!\nBetween 12 and 15 months your toddler should:\n- Have tripled his or her birth weight.\n- Start to combine syllables like saying Ma Ma and Da Da.\n- Start walking alone.\n- Bang two objects together.\n- Like to read interactively.\n- Follow one step directions.\n- Begin to use spoon or fork.\n- Begin to limit pacifier use to the crib only. Use during waking hours will limit speech.\n- Like to explore.\n- Begin to point. Respond by saying the name of the object he is pointing to.\n- Take 1 to 2 naps a day and sleep 11 to 12 hours at night. Be sure to have a good bedtime routine.\nBy the end of the 18th month your toddler should:\n- Be able to walk backwards, walk up steps, and kick a ball.\n- Be able to say 10 to 25 words and name 3 body parts.\n- Be able to turn pages in a book.\n- Be able to stack 2 blocks.\n- Play next to a playmate, but not with a playmate.\n- Not be able to share! Sharing does not happen without parental guidance until about the end of the 3rd year.\n- Attach to a “lovey” if one has been encouraged.\n- Continue to love to explore.\n- Take 1 nap a day and sleep 11 to 12 hours at night.\n- Not separate easily. Separation anxiety peaks between 18 and 24 months.\n- Know the difference between how Mom and Dad parent and play. Many will prefer one parent over the other at times. Toddlers cannot intentionally do things to hurt your feelings at this age. Connecting with one parent over the other may be because your toddler is learning male and female roles, may need more nurturing from mom or more physical play from dad. Roll with it!\nBy age 2 your toddler should:\n- Be able to put on simple clothing with some help.\n- Be able to stack 4 to 6 blocks.\n- Be able to combine words into at least 2 word sentences at age 2. Your child should have a vocabulary of over 50 words and be 1/2 understandable by others.\n- To follow two-step directions.\n- Know his body parts.\n- Continue parallel play with peers.\n- Have 1 nap a day and 11-12 hours of sleep at night.\n- MAY develop fears. Explain loud noises, show what things are, introduce new people slowly, read books about things he is afraid of, and let him handle objects that are causing fear.\n- MAY continue to have separation anxiety. Do not leave without saying good-bye. If he cries when you leave, remind him you will be back. Leaving and coming back helps diminish separation anxiety.\nDuring the 3rd year your toddler should:\n- Dress himself.\n- Stack 9-10 blocks.\n- Walk up steps using alternating feet.\n- Be able to jump, hop, walk on toes.\n- Use his imagination for play.\n- Have a large vocabulary and use 3-4 word sentences. Speech should be 3/4 understandable to others.\n- Be able to tell stories, sing nursery rhymes.\n- Be able to sort objects by shape and color.\n- Be able to play cooperatively now and share and develop friendships.\n- Show an interest in words, numbers, and letters. No need to force learning these, but plan activities around this interest. Show your child his name, write it out, point out letters on signs and in books, talk about colors, shapes, and point them out in your child’s world.\n- Still sleep at least 11 hours at night and have 1 nap a day or an extended “rest time” without the TV.\nParenting activities for toddlers include:\n- Toddler “field trips”. Bring your toddler to museums, parks, library story times, the post office, the grocery store, fire stations, apple orchards, and play groups.\n- Play matching games, sorting games, shape and color games and puzzles.\n- Read, read, read! Try to read 30 minutes a day broken into short time slots.\n- Encourage crayons, finger paints, and clay to develop fine muscle control for writing. Writing on an easel or blackboard is easier for young children because larger muscles are used.\n- Encourage water play, sand or dry rice play, filling and dumping.\n- Play with puppets.\n- Allow your child to feed himself, encourage use of utensils.\n- Help to expand your toddler’s language by talking to him. Help him finish words and sentences. If he says “cup”, you can respond, “You want your blue cup with milk.”\n- Play pretend with your toddler. Play kitchens, dolls, stuffed animals, trains, cars, dress up….\n- Play follow the leader with your toddler.\n- Encourage rhymes and songs.\n- Play musical instruments with your toddler.\n- Respond to wanted behaviors with positive words and ignore unwanted behaviors. Use time outs for behaviors like hitting, biting, and shoving.\nAt your child’s 18 month and 24 month well child visit, your physician should be screening for signs of autism. Red flags that a parent might see are:\n- Your child repeats words but does not try to participate in conversations.\n- Your child does not respond to his name when you say it.\n- Your child does not make eye contact with you or others.\n- Your child avoids social contact or physical touch.\n- Your child has not developed speech or is losing words rather than building a vocabulary.\n- Your child does not play with toys like his peers and does not use imaginative play.\n- Your child seems to be under sensitive or overly sensitive to stimulations such as sound, touch, and texture.\nRemember, if your child is reaching developmental milestones, no worries! Many times children will not be able to do something that is expected because they have never been encouraged or have never had the opportunity. Be sure to provide the opportunity for your toddler to reach milestones, even if it takes longer to allow your child to complete a task, or it is messy!! If your child is not reaching developmental milestones, contact your doctor, and refer to your state’s early intervention program. The earlier the intervention, the better the outcome.\nImportant links that will help you:\n- “Learn the Signs. Act Early.” Campaign\nThis campaign educates parents about childhood development, including early warning signs of autism and other developmental disorders, and it encourages developmental screening and intervention.

For every 1,000 people who get measles in a developed country like Canada, one or two people will die.\nMeasles is caused by a virus. Measles is an extremely contagious disease, spread easily through the air. In fact, your child can get measles just by passing through a room/location where an infected person was up to two hours before! The infected person does not still need to be there to put your child at risk of disease. Your child also does not need to be in direct contact with an infected person to be at risk.\nWithout immunization, your child is at risk for measles. Two doses of the measles vaccine, given at the appropriate ages and stages (as per the routine childhood immunization schedule) are required to be protected against measles.\nMeasles can cause very serious illness. In addition to a fever, rash and other symptoms, your child could get brain swelling (encephalitis) or experience seizures, hearing loss or even death. In fact, about one in three children suffer severe complications like ear infections with a risk of permanent hearing loss, pneumonia, and swelling of the brain (encephalitis).\nIf you think your child has been exposed to measles, and your child has NOT been fully immunized (with two doses of measles vaccine), dial 811 for Health Link before visiting any healthcare provider or facility. The registered nurse who answers your call will guide you on the appropriate next steps for your child.\nSymptoms of measles are:\n- fever 38.3 C or higher; and\n- cough, runny nose or red eyes; and\n- red blotchy rash appearing three to seven days after fever starts, beginning behind the ears and on the face and spreading down to the body and then to the arms and legs\nIf your child is showing symptoms of measles, keep your child at home, avoid contact with others, and call Health Link Alberta (1-866-408-5465) before visiting any healthcare facility or provider.\nIf your child has measles, your child will be considered contagious from one day before showing any symptoms (which is usually about four to seven days before the rash appears) until four days after the appearance of the rash.\nThe MMRV vaccine will prompt your child’s immune system to build antibodies – or ”armour” – that will protect your child from measles, mumps, rubella and varicella (chicken pox).\nTo be protected against measles, your child must receive two doses of the measles vaccine, at the ages and stages recommended in the routine schedule. Your child is recommended to receive MMRV at 12 months of age, and again between four and six years of age. Without both doses of vaccine, your child is not fully protected from – or “armed against” – the measles disease.\nYour child may have redness, swelling and soreness where the needle was given. These side effects will be temporary, lasting for only one or two days. Four to 12 days after getting the immunization, your child may also develop a slight fever, a red blotchy rash and/or small blisters. These side effects are also temporary. For tips on managing side effects after immunization, click here.\nNo, vaccines do not cause autism. Research has found no link between vaccine and autism. You may have heard about Andrew Wakefield, a British surgeon who suggested a link between autism and vaccine. What you may not have heard is that the research he published was found to be false, and Wakefield had his medical licence taken away because of this.

{"question":"How can I improve my bowhunting accuracy beyond just practicing at comfortable distances? Looking for some advanced training tips! 🎯","answer":"To improve your bowhunting accuracy, you should practice outside your comfort zone in several ways: 1) Practice at longer distances than your effective kill range (e.g., practicing at 60 yards will make 30-yard hunting shots less intimidating), 2) Try 'blind shooting' - draw your bow with eyes closed and release to build muscle memory and consistent form, 3) Practice quick shots by giving yourself only 5 seconds to settle and release, 4) Practice holding at full draw for extended periods to prepare for stubborn bucks, and 5) Engage in competition shooting, which simulates the pressure of drawing back on a big buck. These techniques help develop muscle memory and prepare you for high-pressure hunting situations.","context":["Bowhunting Tips and Strategies\nPracticing- Get Out of Your Comfort Zone\nAside from actually taking an animal’s life with “primitive” weaponry, bowhunting is a very docile sport. The relaxation experienced in the tree stand on a cool October afternoon is unattainable any way other than bowhunting and many hunters declare their mind is most at peace when perched high in a tree on a frosty November morning. The tranquility experienced during the hunt is precious, however, the preparation and practice, more precisely shooting your bow, shouldn’t be.\nIt’s easy for the majority of bowhunters today to go in their back yard and tightly group arrows to their maximum comfort level, be those 20 yards, 30 yards, etc. Having fired a several shots at predetermined distances, they feel content in their abilities and call it a practice session. However, when the moment of truth arrives, they are unprepared, second guess their skills and botch the shot. Had that deer hunter gotten out of their comfort zone at the practice range, they may have made the shot on that trophy deer.\nTo truly better yourself as an archer, you must practice outside of your comfort zone. Many bowhunters consider 30 yards their effective kill range when hunting, so that’s as far as they shoot when practicing. There’s no reason to practice any further, right? Wrong! Why limit yourself at the practice range, when you could seize the opportunity to better yourself? Practice at ranges that you wouldn’t dare shoot at animal from. Practicing from 60 yards will make shots from 30 in hunting situations much less intimidating. Picture yourself in a hunting situation and give yourself no more than 5 seconds to settle the pin on the target and release an arrow to improve target acquisition. Conversely, hold at full draw as long as possible to prepare yourself for that stubborn buck that stops just before entering your shooting lane.\nAnother innovative practice technique is “blind shooting.” Drawing your bow back with your eyes closed, comfortably finding an anchor point and releasing an arrow blindly will build muscle memory and reinforce consistent shooting form. This may sound like a dull and ineffective practice technique, but muscle memory and true shooting form pay big dividends when your adrenaline gets pumping and your heart is racing when a shot opportunity presents itself. Letting your subconscious handle your pre shot routine (drawing, finding your anchor point, settling the pins, etc.) will allow you to focus entirely on the shot; this could be the difference between a dead deer and a clean arrow.\nCompetition is perhaps the best way to enhance your archery skills. Competition is a wonderful tool for self-improvement in anything in life and archery is no different. Putting your skills to the test against another shooter is an excellent excuse to push and better your archery abilities. Nobody likes losing, and the added pressure you feel shooting alongside your buddy can simulate the pressure of drawing back on a big buck.\nBe a Deer Hunter, Not a Deer Finder\nComplacency is the most common problem that prevents hunters from regularly harvesting trophy animals. They fall victim to hunting treestands where they have killed deer in the past, or where their scouting tells them the deer should be, instead of hunting where the deer are. Simply finding and seeing deer from stand isn’t enough for some bowhunters. If this sounds like you, then stop waiting for the deer to come to you, and you go to the deer! This type of versatility is almost required when hunting mature bucks because they are so unpredictable. Being a versatile hunter requires a lot of extra effort, because it means taking down and hanging multiple stands often, and/or carrying climbing treestands in and out of the woods. The extra work, however, can pay big dividends.\nHunting the same stands repeatedly allows the deer to pattern you rather than you patterning them. If you hunt a stand, and in two or three sits you don’t have a close encounter, then move! For many hunters time in the woods is considered a precious commodity, and it’s more efficient to go get your deer than waiting for the deer to make a mistake.\nBeing a versatile hunter will keep the deer, especially the bucks, off balance and keep your entire property fresh for the entire season. Certain gear is required for hunters who want to say mobile, and lightweight, durable treestands such as those from Lone Wolf are necessary for quick and quiet set up. A trusted pair of climbing sticks will also allow you to set up in areas where the deer are spending the majority of their time.\nGround Blind Greatness\nPop up ground blinds have become insanely popular in recent years because they offer incredible concealment and are easy to erect. It’s unfortunate though, that many bowhunters are still reluctant to use them. The purpose of a treestand is to position you above the deer’s line of sight and above their sense of smell. Of course, even when hunting from an elevated position, deer will still see and smell you, but treestands are definitely an advantage. Since ground blinds put you literally at eye level with the whitetail as well as our scent, some bowhunters feel it’s impossible to get an old buck within bow range. Unfortunately, they are missing out on some incredible bowhunting opportunities.\nThe most obvious benefit of a ground blind is safety. Not having to climb high in a tree for a shot at whitetail is the primary reason many hunters utilize ground blinds. However, they offer many hunting benefits as well. Sometimes a well placed ground blind is the only way to get close to deer. How many times have you found a promising area, yet were unable to hunt it because there we no good trees to hand a stand in? A ground blind would have enabled you to get up close and personal with the deer and hunt that area immediately since it takes less than 5 minutes to erect a ground blind.\nA well brushed in ground blind provides maximum concealment and allows deer hunters to draw their bows without being detected. They also serve as great alternatives to hunting in foul weather. They keep you dry in rain or snow storms and shield you from freezing wind chills. Another bonus of ground blinds is how little they seem to effect deer movement. Since they are so well camouflaged and blend into their surroundings, deer do not recognize them as a threat and pay little mind to them as soon as they realize they are safe.\nHunting whitetails out of ground blinds is a unique and exciting way to get up close and personal with your quarry. They are safe, advantageous and offer flexible hunting situations and should become a part of your hunting arsenal this fall."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"content_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:a0e0443d-4a25-4e37-b684-8eb6703c4853>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How did the Catholic Church's approach to sensory elements in worship differ between the Counter-Reformation period and modern church architecture?","answer":"During the Counter-Reformation, the Catholic Church embraced sensuous elements in worship, including images, relics, liturgy, processions, music, and theatre, as a way to win back the faithful after Protestant criticism. This emphasis on sensory experience continues in modern Catholic church architecture, as exemplified by the use of skylights over sacramental spaces, stained glass windows, statues, and carefully designed spaces for liturgical purposes. Modern churches incorporate both historical elements (like preserved stations of the cross and traditional statues) while also emphasizing sensory experiences through architectural features that enhance sound, light, and communal gathering.","context":["This book examines the promotion of the sensuous as part of religious experience in the Roman Catholic Church of the early modern period. During the Counter-Reformation, every aspect of religious and devotional practice was reviewed, including the role of art and architecture, while the invocation of the five senses to incite devotion became a hotly contested topic. The Protestants had condemned the material cult of veneration of relics and images, rejecting the importance of emotion and the senses and instead promoting the power of reason in receiving the Word of God. After much debate, the Church concluded that the senses are necessary to appreciate the sublime, and that they derive from the Holy Spirit. As part of its attempt to win back the faithful, the Church embraced the sensuous and promoted the use of images, relics, liturgy, processions, music and theatre as important parts of religious experience.\nMarcia B.

We enter the Church in Baptism and we welcome Christ into our midst around the altar.\nThe present Church contains as many sacred objects from our earlier Church buildings\nThe stained glass in our Reconciliation rooms, conference room, and family room are from the former Church. The altar, ambo, and statues of Mary and Joseph are from the Church built-in 1980. The Stations of the Cross are from the original Church.\nThis a building for the liturgy\nAlthough it has been important for our parish that the building makes a good impression on Kingsley Avenue, the most important use of this building is liturgical. We want it to sound well, provide the space and elements necessary for good liturgy, and remind all visitors of the importance of the gathering of the Church.\nTour of Our Church\nThe Entrance: Hospitality is one of our core values and we want hospitality to be a mark of the Church from the moment one approaches. The entrance area is the shape of a courtyard to make gathering easy. Handicapped access is through the west columns and through the electric door at the right-hand entrance. A commissioned statue of St. Catherine, who welcomes all people to experience God’s mercy, stands in the center of the courtyard.\nThe Narthex (Gathering Area): The window dominating the gathering area is based on two themes – the mission of the Holy Trinity and the work of the Church. The Trinity is represented by the symbols of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. The shell of Baptism brings people of every race and nation into the Body of Christ working for justice. Six model Christians selected by the commissions of our parish flank the doorways. We want to show how the mission of the Trinity is completed in the lives of holy people. We want all members of our parish to be saints like the following:\n- Dorothy Day – a 20th-century woman who worked for justice\n- Saint Martin de Porres, OP – a brother who cared for the poor in Lima, Peru\n- Blessed Teresa of Calcutta – a contemporary prophet and guide\n- Saint Pope John XXIII – a reformer of the Church with a heart\n- Archbishop Oscar Romero – a 20th-century martyr from San Salvador\n- Saint Kateri Tekakwitha – an American Indian virgin who was baptized in honor of St. Catherine of Siena\nThe Baptismal Font: This font is placed near the entrance of the Church because we want everyone who enters for worship to remember his or her baptism. The oils of the Church are stored near the font. The font allows for the full immersion of those entering the Church in order to more clearly signify that baptism requires dying and rising with Christ.\nThe Nave: The nave is the central body of the Church where the community gathers. It comes from the same Latin root for navy or naval; therefore, if you look up, you will see the framework of the hull of a ship. There is seating for 1,200 people in the main body of the Church, including the choir area.\nThe Family Room: The family room on the east side of the Church is intended to be used by those with young children who are unable to sit still or remain quiet throughout the liturgy.\nThe Reconciliation Rooms: Both Reconciliation rooms are set apart for their special use with stained glass from the old chapel.\nThe Stations of the Cross: The Stations are the stations from our original Church.\nThe Chapel: The Pieta (the image of Mary accepting the body of her son from the cross) dominates this chapel in which Perpetual Adoration occurs. The Chapel has its own Stations of the Cross that are replicas of the Stations found in the Marian Garden. The stained glass window facing Kingsley Avenue is custom for our Church. The first window shows two important moments from the Virgin Mary’s life: the Annunciation and the Assumption. The second window shows St. Monica and St. Augustine, patron saints of the Diocese of St. Augustine.\nThe Chapel Entrance: There is a special garden outside the chapel for meditation and reflection when the doors of the chapel are locked. One can see the tabernacle through the glass doors. This area is meant to be a place of hospitality and welcome.\nThe Altar: The altar is the same one that was in our Church that was built in 1980.\nThe Crucifix: The large crucifix over the altar with stained glass window that surrounds it is a visible statement of our faith. We believe that Jesus of Nazareth, Son of God and a man like us, was obedient to death and has been raised to glory by the power of God the Father and the Holy Spirit. The angels sing His praises in heaven and prepare a place for us. The 24 angels that surround the cross are described in the Book of Revelation (4:4)."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:d8b75450-3cb3-4d62-94d0-9c071a7f0e18>","<urn:uuid:cbc2cfae-734c-4407-ae5c-992f3cfaa9d4>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What is special about California zoos compared to typical museums? I would like to know about size and activities.","answer":"California zoos stand out from typical museums in both their scale and activities. While an average museum sees around 60,000 visitors annually (for art museums) or 20,000 (for history museums), California's zoos are much larger operations. For instance, the San Diego Zoo spans 100 acres and houses over 3,700 animals from 650 species, while the Los Angeles Zoo features more than 1,100 animals from 250 species plus extensive botanical gardens with over 7,400 plants. These zoos offer unique experiences beyond traditional museum viewing, such as Safari West's safari-style tours where visitors can observe African wildlife in natural settings and even stay overnight in luxury tents. They also engage in significant conservation work - many California zoos are actively involved in breeding endangered species and creating specialized habitats, like the California Condor Rescue Zone at the LA Zoo, which has helped save species from extinction.","context":["Types of Museums\nThere are over 17,000 museums in the US and they serve almost 900 million people each year.\nSo on average, Americans attend three museums each year. Of course some people attend many and others attend none. For comparison, the only industry with greater attendance is the movie industry, which has about 1.5 billion tickets sold in a year. About 170 million Americans go to the movies.\nWe divide the 17,000 museums into a few categories for convenience, but acknowledge that some museums defy categorization or beg for more detailed categorization.\nArt museums display works of art by local, national, or international artists and many offer classes in the various disciplines of art. Art galleries are different. Just to be confusing, art museums display art in galleries and art galleries display works of art, too. But the term galleries usually refers to businesses that sell art or promote one artist. Art museums sell art and trinkets in their gift shop, but won’t sell the art hanging on the display wall. Art museums come in all sizes from small to giant. In the US the average attendance for an art museum is about 60,000 people (AAM’s 2006 Museum Financial Information).\nHistory museums and historic houses or sites constitute the largest number of museums in the US and, on average, have the lowest attendance (less than 20,000 per year).\nMany tiny towns have a town history museum or historic house, and these swell the number of museums, but reduce the average attendance. A few large history museums and sites draw huge numbers of people. Historic sites, like battlefields, often have collections on display inside buildings as well as interpretative signage and robust artifacts outside.\nNatural history museums and nature centers serve similar purposes but with somewhat different approaches. The grand natural history museums found in major metropolitan areas started out to display ecosystems (in dioramas) and nature’s oddities and wonderfulness. Many were funded by the industry titans of yesteryear, whose names adorn galleries and metal plaques hanging along the hallways. Some incorporate planetarium and a few have observatories. The heavily endowed natural history museums have curatorial staffs that conduct academic research and maintain collections of minerals, insects, mammals, birds, shells, etc. Some have live collections, but nature centers are more likely to have them. Nature centers are often newer and smaller, and do not have substantial collections or conduct research. Collectively natural history museums and nature centers have an average attendance on par with art museums.\nMuseums started in the 19th and early 20th centuries tended to focus on showing art and natural wonders to their audience. A new model of a museum and one that stretches the definition of museum is the children’s museum. Unlike its older cousins, children’s museums have few or no collections. They focus on providing experiences and learning programs for children and families. In recent years the concept has been finding more adherents and children’s museums are experiencing rapid growth. There are about 300 children’s museums in the US – by far more than in the rest of the world combined. If your mental image of a museum is quiet, dusty, and academic, visit a children’s museum for a paradigm shift. On average children’s museums draw about 80,000 people a year. Many of the museums are quite small and draw a fraction of this number. And of the attendees, many are repeat attendees with some returning on a weekly schedule.\nMost people’s image of a museum starts with being inside a building. But arboretum and gardens are types of museums where the collections are display, for the most part, outdoors. Attendance here is quite high: on average over 100,000 people attend each arboretum.\nKeeping the average attendance numbers of the other museum types in mind, consider that science museums draw about 250,000 visitors a year – some four times as many as art museums or history museums. Is science so popular? Not really, but science museums, like children’s museums, exist to provide experiences, not to show off collections. They provide a more active experience – one that appeals especially to families. The science museum movement leaped forward in the 1960s and 1970s and continues to expand today. Since they evolved after the era of grand industry titans, they tend to be supported by the income they can generate, rather than by endowment. This means that they have to have larger attendance and more memberships to stay afloat financially. Many are entrepreneurial or at least more entrepreneurial than other museums. Surprisingly, few scientists work at science museum – of course not many employees at an art museum are artists.\nIn terms of attendance, the 900 pound gorilla in the museum world lives in a zoo. On average zoos draw nearly 450,000 per year. Their income lives and dies with the weather: on warm, sunny spring days everyone wants to go to the zoo. Zoos are more recreational than educational, but all have classes and presentations. Some, especially aquarium (which we are lumping with zoos), engage in research that is funded by federal agencies. How would like a job at SeaWorld or a San Diego zoo job?\nIn addition to these types of museums are general museums. These often combine several disciplines under one roof. For instance there are museums that provide exhibits and programs in art, history, and science under one roof.\nMaritime museums focus on ships and all things nautical. This includes the art, history, and science of people at sea. Usually it doesn’t include marine life except for fisheries. Like ships on the ocean, ships in the air warrant their own museums. Air and space museums are quite popular and there are dozens of them scattered across America. Not to be outdone is land transportation with both car and train museums. Learn about maritime job opportunities in another section of JobMonkey.\nHalls of Fame remind us of famous toys, inventors, and football players. And, dozens of other groupings. Like transportation museums, halls of fame typically cover a spectrum of academic fields in their focus on the best of class within their grouping.\nAnd, there are other specialty museums: doll museums, toy museums, agricultural museums. The National Museum of Play is one such museum. Then there is the Henry Ford Museum and Greenfield Village – what do you call a collection of everything an eccentric rich man could buy? You call it a museum.","Zoos are fascinating and educational places for families to spend a day. Children are especially captivated by animals, particularly animals that are new or unusual to them. Zoos have a wonderful effect on adults, too. Breeding endangered species in captivity to reintroduce them into the wild is a goal for several zoos.

When it comes to issues involving the price of a product or service, and there is little interest in forming a relationship, you need to know how to use the right tactics to gain the most for your side.\nHere are five terms that will outline some powerful techniques to gain the best value, in fixed pie distributive negotiations, also known as plain old market style haggling.\nJust like the word suggests, you want to set a reference point around which the negotiation will revolve. Making the first offer can be to your advantage, as this offer might set the height of the negotiation bar. This anchor is the arena where the two parties will wrangle in a tug and pull negotiation scenario. Interestingly enough, many studies have shown that the first offer has a strong psychological pull, almost a magnetic lure. The resulting agreement is often strongly attracted towards the person who proposes the first offer.\nHow do you determine where to place your first offer or anchor? Obviously, your opponent will have some notion of the price range where they may accept an offer. If your offer is beneath their minimal reservation price, the transaction won't happen. So, the ideal point is trying to gauge the minimum amount they will accept.\nNaturally, this also depends on how much you want, or are willing to pay, also known as your aspiration base. If the price range you want to pay, doesn't overlap the price range your counterpart is prepared to accept, then you aren't going to get anywhere. Figuring the minimal amount they will accept, will likely take some guesswork and possibly some research. Remember one thing though; the offer should be based on practical considerations, as you may need to justify your reasons for making a particular offer. Be prepared to back up the reasons for your first offer.\nWhat if the other side make the first offer ? The first thing you need to do is to resist the urge to let yourself get tied to their offer. Anchors only have an effect when one or both of the parties are uncertain about the value of the market price of the product or service. A piece of equipment can be researched to ascertain a fair market value. The more you know about the product being bought or sold, the more you can substantiate the price you are willing to pay. Your decision can be based squarely on the facts.\nEither way, don't let the other side set the anchor bar. Essentially, if you believe their offer is unrealistic, the best thing to do is to ignore it. If they persist, you should ask them to justify their reasons for arriving at their offer. This information may serve as a valuable guide. Then, you could put forth your own counter offer or anchor, and present your reasons. as this will shore up and add strength to your position.\nIn many situations, the other party may make a concessionary move, such as to lower their price. A large concessionary move, telegraphs the possibility there is some latitude to play with and negotiate further. Likewise, the same will apply if you give too large a concession. The ball goes back and forth, with each side trying to nudge the other into making further concessions. Small concessionary moves suggest that the other party may be moving close to their reservation price.\nBefore engaging in concessionary moves there are several things to consider.\n- What's your BATNA? - This is an acronym for Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement. It means, that if you have a strong alternative, then you may not need to make any concessions whatsoever. If you have good options sitting on the sidelines, why lose value when you don't have to?\n- Be Patient - 'All good things come to them that wait '- Well, mostly they do. Be patient in your negotiations. Any concession that you make, is money out of your pocket and into the pocket of the other person. You don't have to decide to make a concession right away. Remember this - there are plenty of people out there who will be more than happy to take advantage of you, so why make it easy for them?\nThe clock is ticking\nAnother good tactic to employ is to set a definite time expiration for the offer. This prevents the other side from sitting on the fence, while you wait for either a decision or for them to make another counter offer. The other side could also be using the delay, hoping to get a better offer from someone else.\nMake a multiple offer\nOne effective negotiation tactic that also has some punch to it, is to make several offers simultaneously. A package offer, doesn't paint your counterpart into a corner like some form of ultimatum, as a single offer does. Secondly, your counterpart now has a chance to compare the different offers in the package, instead of solely reflecting on their own objectives. Another reason to present a package offer is to see whether the other side is inclined, or appears especially interested in one of the offers.\nThere are several things to consider before you decide how to put together a proposal package.\n- Evaluate and think about how much value the offer might actually mean to each side. What would each side lose or gain by this offer?\n- Adjust the offer to meet your own needs so that you are comfortable with your decision. Don't make an offer that makes you feel uncomfortable, there's probably a good reason behind that feeling.\n- If any of the offers being considered appears to diminish the potential return - if you are losing out in other words - try and see if this can be offset by increasing the return in some other manner, such as a side deal for example.\n'Don't throw good money after bad money.' In distributive negotiations, there's a winner and a loser. It may not be readily apparent, but you have to remember that their gain is your loss. Why not try and strike the best deal or bargain that you possibly can get, right?\n- Roger Fisher and William Ury, Bruce Patton, 'Getting to Yes-2nd Edition', Penguin Books, (1991).\n- Harvard Business Essentials 'Negotiation' Harvard Business School Press, (2003).\nBack to Negotiation Articles\nThis page's contents may be re-published in full or part - we ask only that you include an honest html link back to this site, preferably to our home or www.negotiations.com/training/ page.\nAverage Reader Rating: Comments: 1\nshare your comment"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:c966e7ae-aecb-4bc5-9ef8-915714b1f0ca>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What safety considerations should be taken into account when choosing between round brilliant and modified brilliant diamond cuts?","answer":"Modified brilliant cuts, particularly those with sharp points like marquise and pear shapes, require more careful consideration for protection as they are more prone to accidental breakage. It's recommended to use protective settings like bezels for these cuts. In contrast, round brilliant diamonds don't have these vulnerability concerns due to their symmetrical shape without pointed edges. The round brilliant's 58 facets are arranged in a way that prioritizes both brilliance and structural integrity. This makes round brilliants a more durable choice for everyday wear, while modified brilliants need additional protective measures in their settings.","context":["WHAT IS A MODIFIED BRILLIANT DIAMOND?\nQ: WHAT DOES A MODIFIED BRILLIANT-CUT DIAMOND MEAN?\nA modified brilliant-cut diamond is exactly what its name implies: a brilliant-cut diamond that has been modified from its conventional round shape. Modified brilliants account for the greatest amount of fancy cut diamonds in terms of shape. This is due to the fact that round-cut diamonds can be reshaped in a variety of ways.\nThese modified cuts are classified as \"ideal\" because they have perfect symmetry between the pavilion (the bottom section) and table (top section). Ideal cuts can be difficult to locate on the market, have the best light performance, and are pricey.\nQ: WHICH DIAMOND CUTS ARE REFERRED TO AS MODIFIED BRILLIANTS?\nThe most popular modified brilliant cuts are oval, marquise, and pear shaped diamonds. Others include heart-shaped diamonds, trillion cuts, and half-moon diamonds.\nQ: WHAT SHOULD YOU KNOW ABOUT MODIFIED BRILLIANT-CUT DIAMONDS?\n- Modified brilliant-cut diamonds are known by a variety of names. Some of the most popular fancy-cut shapes go by several names. It's common to refer to a marquise cut diamond as a navette, which is French for \"little boat.\" Pear-shaped diamonds may also be called \"drop cuts\" due to their teardrop shape. It is essential to understand that a single diamond cut may go by several names. This will prevent you from getting up-sold to a navette cut that is identical to the marquise you just saw.\n2. Modified brilliant cuts should glitter as brightly as diamonds with a round cut. The number and arrangement of facets in modified brilliant cut diamonds should match those in round brilliants. Because they combine a more unusual shape with the greater sparkle of a round diamond, modified brilliant cuts have become a very popular choice for diamonds.\n3. The number of modified brilliant shapes available keeps growing. You will probably only have access to the more popular pear, marquise, and oval forms if you desire a hand-cut modified brilliant diamond. However, as laser diamond cutting technology has developed, your options for altered brilliant shapes have almost endless possibilities. Among the many innovative and intriguing shapes available right now are butterflies, stars, and even horses.\n4. Be cautious with these diamond cuts. This is especially true for the previously mentioned marquise cuts and pear-shaped diamonds. Any loose modified brilliant diamond with \"sharp points,\" such as the ends of a marquise cut, is more prone to accidentally breaking. So, if you buy a modified brilliant cut, you must ensure that your diamond is well-protected (such as opting for a bezel setting).\n5. Know what a “square modified brilliant” is. Customers looking to purchase modified brilliant cut diamonds frequently struggle with this. Princess cut diamonds are sometimes specifically labeled as \"square modified brilliants\" by some diamond vendors. This is somewhat accurate because princess cuts have a square shape and the multifaceted dazzle of brilliant cuts, but they are actually a type of mixed cut. The term \"square modified brilliant\" can also refer to some cushion cuts, radiant cuts, and other diamond shapes.","The round brilliant cut has 58 facets (faces) accurately polished to reflect all the brilliance of the diamond. The top section of the diamond is called the crown, the bottom is called the pavilion. The top facet is the largest and is called the table, the smallest facet is known as the culet and is at the base.\nHow many faces does a brilliant cut diamond have?\nThe modern round brilliant (Figure 1 and 2) consists of 58 facets (or 57 if the culet is excluded); 33 on the crown (the top half above the middle or girdle of the stone) and 25 on the pavilion (the lower half below the girdle). The girdle may be frosted, polished smooth, or faceted.\nWhat is the difference between round and brilliant cut diamonds?\nWhile Old Europeans were cut primarily for color, the Round Brilliant is cut for brilliance. The primary difference between the Old European and the Round Cut is that the Old European maintains facets with triangular blocks while the Round Brilliant has thinner facets.\nWhat does round brilliant cut diamond mean?\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS AND GRADING\nA brilliant cut is defined as one resembling two pyramids placed base to base, intended to enhance the gem’s sparkle with the least possible sacrifice in carat weight. The Round Brilliant diamond shape has 57 facets comprising 33 facets on the crown and 25 on the pavilion.\nWhat does a brilliant cut diamond look like?\nA brilliant is a diamond or other gemstone cut in a particular form with numerous facets so as to have exceptional brilliance. The shape resembles that of a cone and provides maximized light return through the top of the diamond.\nWhat is the rarest diamond color?\nIn diamonds, rarity equals value. With diamonds in the normal range, value is based on the absence of color, because colorless diamonds are the rarest. With fancy color diamonds—the ones outside the normal color range—the rarest and most valuable colors are saturated pinks, blues, and greens.\nWhat is the best diamond cut?\nTop 10 Diamond Cuts\n- PRINCESS CUT DIAMOND. …\n- EMERALD CUT DIAMOND. …\n- OVAL SHAPE DIAMOND. …\n- MARQUISE CUT DIAMOND. …\n- PEAR SHAPE DIAMOND. …\n- ASSCHER CUT DIAMOND. …\n- RADIANT CUT DIAMOND. …\n- HEART SHAPE DIAMOND. Last (but by no means least) is my personal favourite, the heart shape diamond.\nWhich cut of diamond has the most sparkle?\nRound Brilliant is the most classic stone shape and is made up of 58 facets. Round engagement rings are by far the most popular of all the shapes as they’re the diamond cut that sparkles the most.\nWhat is the most affordable cut of diamond?\nThe cheapest diamond cuts that you can purchase are the Asscher diamond cut and the Emerald diamond cut. Asscher shapes and Emerald shapes are cheaper is because of two factors. When cutting the rough diamond, they lose more weight.\nWhy are round brilliant diamonds more expensive?\nRound Diamonds Lose The Most Rough\nIn order to achieve the fire and briiliance of the round shape a large amount of the rough stone must be cut away. In short, that is the main reason round diamond are more expensive than other fancy shape diamonds.\nWhat is more important cut color or clarity?\nCut is the most important determinant of the overall appearance of a diamond. No Clarity grade can help a poorly cut diamond; however, an excellent cut diamond can have a lower color (G-H) or clarity (SI1-SI2) and still look quite beautiful due to its superior ability to create sparkle and brilliance.\nAre all round diamonds brilliant cut?\nDue to the mechanics of its shape, the round diamond is generally superior to fancy diamond shapes at the proper reflection of light, maximizing potential brightness. Virtually all round diamonds are brilliant-cut, meaning they have 58 facets (57 when there is no culet).\nWhat should I look for in a diamond cut?\n- Cut. The most important of the 4Cs is cut because it has the greatest influence on a diamond’s sparkle. …\n- Color. The second most important of the 4Cs is color, which refers to a diamond’s lack of color. …\n- Clarity. …\n- Carat Weight. …\n- Shape. …\nIs a very good cut diamond OK?\nFor superior brilliance, choose a diamond with a Cut grade of Very Good or Excellent for round diamonds, and Good or better in fancy shape diamonds. … While the diamond will lack the scintillation and brilliance of a well cut diamond, it will allow a significant increase in size for the same price.\nIs round brilliant a good cut?\nFor the most brilliance and beauty, only consider Round Brilliant diamonds with an Excellent cut. Ensure the symmetry and polish of the diamond are either Excellent or Very Good. The reality is that 55% of all Round diamonds receive an excellent cut grade from the GIA.\nHow should a round diamond look?\nCut Quality: Recommended Proportions for Round Cut Diamonds\n|Polish/Symmetry||Excellent – Very Good|\n|Crown Angle||34.0 – 35.0°||33.0 – 36.0°|\n|Pavilion Angle||40.6 – 41.0°||40.2 – 41.4°|\n|Girdle Thickness||Thin – Slightly Thick|"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:189d6ae6-f9f9-472b-bb05-a72f7467ecf6>","<urn:uuid:69f68e04-b026-4874-a872-7b0267534eba>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Compare the approaches to handling torque between RomaxDesigner software and planetary gearboxes in extrusion - what are their key features for torque management?","answer":"RomaxDesigner and planetary gearboxes handle torque through different but sophisticated approaches. RomaxDesigner analyzes torque through its system-level design capabilities, allowing simulation of duty cycles and loads with multiple conditions of speed, load, and temperature. It enables cumulative damage analysis while considering nonlinear interactions that affect load and component stress. Meanwhile, planetary gearboxes manage torque through their unique mechanical design featuring sun, planet, and ring gears working in concert. They offer high torque density, making them particularly effective for operations like extrusion cooking. Their design allows for efficient power transmission through spur and helical gears, while their robust construction enables them to handle heavy loads and persevere through abrasive operating conditions.","context":["RomaxDesigner provides a suite of tools for mechanical analysis of rotating structural components such as gears, shafts, bearings, clutches and synchronizers, and spline connections and housings. Engineers designing gearboxes, transmissions, vehicle drivelines at a system level, as well as providers of components, will find value in the consolidated analysis approach this software provides. The unified approach is especially valuable when there are multiple nonlinear interactions contributing to load, component stress, and misalignment. When components are operating near to their limits, the increased accuracy provided by the detailed analysis modules lets users maintain adequate safety factors while avoiding defensive overdesigns.\nRomaxDesigner is modular software, with a base package allowing system-level design and analysis, and with modules that allow the detailed analysis of individual components. The base software can analyze systems on parallel axes, with extensions available to analyze perpendicular shafts and planetary systems. Even in the base package, users can build and analyze complex systems, including nonlinear and 3D effects.\nUsers define each system component with a level of complexity appropriate to the needed analysis. Base modules let users define each component using an industry-standard closed-form equation. With more-advanced modules, individual components can be converted to models with finite-element attributes. For example, a housing can be defined according to its stiffness, (using a reduced-stiffness matrix from a finite-element model) or as a finite-element model solved in an advanced module. Users can define a bearing simply as a rotatable support with specified flexibility; a catalog-level design with ISO capacities and macrogeometry; or with full microgeometry, life adjustment factors, and high-speed inertial effects. As the model develops, users can add further detail to each component.\nThe software then simulates the effect of a duty cycle or series of loads on the entire system, with multiple conditions of speed, load, and temperature defined, allowing simultaneous cumulative damage analysis of all components. Users can define and apply multiple duty cycles, reflecting different applications.\nRomaxDesigner models shafts for deflection and stress using closed-form equations for beam segments. Advanced modules provide the capability to use FE models for more-complex shaft geometry. Users can choose from predefined materials and stress concentration factors, or develop their own. The base package can model parallel and concentric shafts. Perpendicular shafts and moving axis (planetary) shafts are modeled with extended modules. An additional module analyzes shaft fatigue. The software can define and analyze shafts that are connected at non-90° angles, though the gear definitions for these systems are limited.\nThe base package provides standard bearing-life and load-capacity analysis using ISO 281:1990 or ISO 291:2007. The program also includes a modified rating with a closed-form calculation of effects of misalignment. A built-in database includes data from four bearing manufacturers’ catalogs. Users can define and save additional bearings. A bearing search tool allows quick access to all four catalogs and user-defined bearings.\nBearing models provide nonlinear stiffness interactions with adjacent components, which can be critical when calculating gear-support stiffness, gear-mesh misalignments and preload requirements. When calculating bearing life, the models include the effects of misalignments developed through the flexibility of any coupled components. A bearing preload tool automates studies of bearing life as a function of preload. RomaxDesigner does not currently include the effects of localized housing distortion on bearing roundness, nor a direct way to calculate the effects of thermal expansion on bearing fit and preload. These features have been proposed for a future release.\nAdvanced bearing-analysis modules provide detailed analyses (ISO 281 Supplement 4), including contact stress, fluid-film thickness, and stress-based life calculation. Advanced bearings can be defined with an assortment of predefined roller and raceway crowns, or with a measured crown.\nRomaxDesigner models may include spur and helical gears, and with the perpendicular-axis module, bevel and hypoid gears. The base software models gears with enough detail to analyze their effects on the rest of the system. Additional modules allow design and rating to AGMA, DIN and ISO standards. For parallel-axis gears, additional modules permit macrogeometry definition and optimization for manufacturability as well as detailed analysis of microgeometry for contact stress and transmission error. RomaxDesigner graphics are suitable for a variety of reporting illustrations, such as system topology and component deflection.\nFor parallel and perpendicular-axis gears, modules provide interfaces to more detailed analysis software, such as Simpack, LDP, and AnSol. They act as a “front end” for even more-computationally intensive formulations of bending and contact stress. The combination of these software packages is particularly powerful, as it permits cumulative damage-life analysis including the nonlinear effects of gear-tooth deflection and bearing stiffness, acting on a fully developed tooth profile. Additional modules focus on NVH and dynamic characteristics, such as gear rattle and whine, system modal analysis, and clutch analysis. Modules are also available to automate optimization and for the sensitivity analysis of system and component designs.\nThe developer does not include self-directed tutorials with the software, but the company does provide user training directly. The trainers customize course content and duration to meet the needs of each organization. A one-week training session would be sufficient to cover the basic modules and a few advanced topics. Many highly specialized software packages require constant use to become and stay proficient. I find that RomaxDesigner does not require this level of attention. Engineers with other responsibilities will find this software functional even if not used on a regular basis.\nThe software comes from Romax Technology, based in Nottingham, U.K., with offices in Asia, Europe, and North America (www.romaxtech.com).","Planetary gearboxes are essential in the extrusion process, providing torque and speed control for efficient operation. This article will explore the design and benefits of planetary gearboxes in extrusion applications. We will discuss the key features of planetary gearboxes, their advantages over other gearboxes, and how they contribute to extrusion systems’ overall performance and reliability.\nThe Basics of Planetary Gearboxes\nWhat is a Planetary Gearbox?\nA planetary gearbox is a fascinating feat of mechanical engineering. At its core lies the input shaft, intimately linked to the sun gear, which is the central protagonist in this intricate gear drama. As the sun gear springs into motion, it nudges the planet gears—dutifully perched on a carrier—into action.\nThese diligent planet gears, in turn, engage with the encompassing ring gear. This meticulously choreographed dance between the gears culminates in transforming input energy to an output on the shaft, achieving the intended speed reduction with precision.\nAdvantages of Planetary Gearboxes\nCompact and Lightweight Design\nDive into the marvel of engineering with planetary gearboxes! The harmonious symphony of sun, planet, and ring gears not only refines the design but does so in a more condensed form than simple planetary gears.

Serving as the bedrock of consistency and reliability, these gearboxes ensure that every finished product mirrors the epitome of engineering excellence.\nDesign Considerations for Planetary Gearboxes in Extrusion\nLoad and Torque Determinants\nVenture into the rhythmic ballet of extrusion, and you’ll realize that understanding load and torque is not just essential – it’s transformative. These dynamics play a central role, and the chosen gear ratio acts as the choreographer, setting the pace and ensuring each movement (or operation) is pitch-perfect for stellar performance.\nLubrication and Temperature Management\nThink of the gearbox as a star athlete – if it doesn’t receive the right hydration (lubrication), it will falter. Lubrication is the elixir that ensures the gearbox runs like a dream. But that’s not all; the athletic prowess of a planetary gearbox is further refined when it’s kept cool. Ingenious cooling techniques work backstage to prevent the drama of overheating, ensuring our star – the gearbox – enjoys a long and illustrious career on the extrusion stage.\nNoise and Disturbance Management\nIn the theatre of extrusion, no one wants the unnecessary background score of noise and vibrations. We can orchestrate a serene environment by artistically designing the gearbox with a focus on noise reduction. This enhances the performance of the entire extrusion process and ensures the audience (the end-users) receives a product crafted in tranquility.\nBenefits of Planetary Gearboxes in Extrusion\nEnhanced Reliability and Durability\n- Bulwark Build: Crafted with meticulous attention to detail, planetary gearboxes boast a robust construction, primed to shoulder heavy burdens and persevere through the most abrasive operating conditions.

{"question":"How might younger people's vulnerability to H5N1 compare to adults, and which population groups are recommended to receive the seasonal flu vaccine?","answer":"Younger people might be more susceptible to H5N1 infection than adults because they have a shorter history of exposure to the human influenza virus H1N1, potentially resulting in less existing immune protection. Regarding recommended groups for vaccination, the CDC advises that several populations should receive the seasonal flu vaccine, including: pregnant women, everyone 50 years or older, children aged 6 months to 18 years, healthcare workers, public safety workers, people with chronic medical conditions (such as diabetes, kidney disease, severe anemia, or immune deficiency), residents of nursing homes, and anyone who wants to reduce their risk of getting or transmitting influenza.","context":["N1 protein in the seasonal flu vaccine may trigger an antibody response to avian flu virus.\nThe influenza vaccine that health officials advice people to get every year might also offer some cross protection against the H5N1 virus, commonly known as bird flu, according to investigators at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.\nCross protection occurs when the immune response triggered by a vaccine designed to protect against one germ also offers some protection against a different germ.\nThe investigators found that a protein present in the annual influenza shot can act as a vaccine itself and trigger some cross protection against H5N1 in mice; and that some human volunteers already had antibodies directed against the same part of this virus.\nThe finding also suggests that the annual influenza vaccine might be especially beneficial to populations in areas of the world where H5N1 routinely infects birds and poses a threat to people.\n\"The jury is still out on whether the seasonal flu vaccine is definitely a reliable way to offer people some protection from H5N1,\" said Richard J. Webby, Ph.D., assistant member in the Virology division of the Department of Infectious Diseases at St. Jude. \"But our initial results suggest that this is a research trail worth following.\" Webby is senior author of the report that appears in the Feb. 13 issue of the online journal PLoS Medicine at www.plosmedicine.org.\nThe key to the apparent cross protection against H5N1 provided by the human influenza vaccine appears to be the antibodies produced in response to a protein called neuraminidase on the surface of the virus. Neuraminidase, which is noted as \"N\" in the names of viruses, is one of the major proteins on the surface of human and avian influenza viruses; and it can often be found in human influenza vaccines. However, the amount of \"N\" in an influenza vaccine can vary widely depending on the company that produces it.\nThe other protein is hemagglutinin, or \"H.\" The variations of \"H\" and \"N\" found on viruses are numbered; and in the case of the avian influenza virus, considered by experts to be a major threat to humans, the proteins are designated H5 and N1.\n\"The presence of the N1 protein in both the human flu and the bird flu virus helped to convince us to look for evidence that immunity to human strains of flu might also trigger some antibody response to H5N1,\" Webby said.\nThe investigators first vaccinated mice using DNA that coded for N1 from a human influenza virus. This ensured that the mice would make only N1 and not one of the hemagglutinin proteins, thus eliminating any chance of confusion over whether their immune systems were vaccinated against hemagglutinin, neuraminidase or both.\nThe team showed that all 11 vaccinated mice survived infection with a virus genetically modified to make human N1, while half of another group of vaccinated mice survived infection with H5N1 itself.\nThe St. Jude investigators then showed that the antibodies made against N1 protected the mice against the challenges. Specifically, the team collected the serum, the antibody-containing liquid of blood, from vaccinated mice and injected it into unvaccinated mice. Six of 13 mice getting the antibody-containing serum survived infection with the H5N1 virus, indicating that antibodies against human N1 from the vaccinated mice offered some protection against H5N1.\nFinally, the team tested samples of serum from human volunteers to see if they contained antibodies that reacted against the N1 of H5N1. Sera from 31 of 38 volunteers reacted against the N1 of the human influenza virus H1N1, while serum from nine of these individuals showed low activity against the N1 protein of an H5N1 from Vietnam. It was not clear whether these individuals had developed antibodies from previous seasonal vaccination or from exposure to influenza viruses that carried N1.\n\"Although the number of human donors in this study was limited, the results show that some individuals have levels of antibodies that are high enough to react against H5N1,\" Webby said.\nIf the initial findings of the St. Jude study are confirmed in the future, there may be a greater interest in examining the amount of neuraminidase in yearly influenza vaccines, according to Matthew Sandbulte, Ph.D., a postdoctoral fellow at the Food and Drug Administration, who did much of the work on this project.\n\"Hemagglutinin is more abundant than neuraminidase on viruses and is a better target for protective immunity, so current vaccines are designed to trigger immune responses mostly to hemagglutinin,\" Sandbulte said. \"That is why vaccines contain standard amounts of hemagglutinin, but varying amounts of neuraminidase. But if further research confirms that the N1 part of the influenza vaccine offers some cross protection against H5N1, it will be desirable to have a better idea of the amount of N1 present in these vaccines.\"\nAn implication of the ability of N1 immunity conferring some degree of protection against H5N1 is that younger people who have a shorter history of exposure to the human influenza virus H1N1 might have less existing immune protection against this virus. \"That could mean such people are more susceptible to H5N1 infection than adults,\" Sandbulte said.","When Should I Receive a Flu Shot (Influenza Vaccine)\nPublished : 2009-09-15 - Updated : 2019-12-13\nAuthor : Disabled World - Contact: www.disabled-world.com\nSynopsis* : Information on who and when you should get a influenza vaccine or flu shot including side effects and risks. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that people who are at risk for serious complications from the flu be vaccinated each year. Side effects from the flu vaccine may include: soreness, redness, or swelling where the shot was given; fever; aches and pains.\nAlthough you can get a flu shot well into flu season, it's best to try to get it earlier rather than later.\nIn the Northern Hemisphere the flu (Medically referred to as influenza) season generally runs from November to April, with most cases occurring between late December and early March, but the flu, or anti-flu, vaccine is usually offered between September and mid-November.\nThe flu is highly infectious and is a serious viral respiratory infection and every year in the United States, on average:\n5% to 20% of the population gets the flu\nAbout 36,000 people die from the flu or its complications.\nMore than 200,000 people are hospitalized from flu complications.\nFlu vaccines are routinely available for seasonal influenza, but these vaccines are not likely to be protective against the H1N1 Virus.\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that people who are at risk for serious complications from the flu be vaccinated each year.\nAdults with asthma are at high risk of developing complications after contracting the influenza virus, as respiratory infections like influenza are more serious in patients with asthma, and such infections can often lead to pneumonia and acute respiratory disease.\nThere are two types of seasonal flu vaccines, the injection (with killed virus) and nasal spray vaccines (containing live, but weakened, virus).\n- 1 - The \"flu shot\", an inactivated vaccine (containing killed virus) that is given with a needle, usually in the arm. The flu shot is approved for use in people older than 6 months, including healthy people and people with chronic medical conditions.\n- 2 - The nasal-spray flu vaccine, a vaccine made with live, weakened flu viruses that do not cause the flu (sometimes called LAIV for \"live attenuated influenza vaccine\" or FluMist®). LAIV (FluMist®) is approved for use in healthy people 2-49 years of age who are not pregnant.\nWho SHOULD Receive the Flu Vaccine?\n- Pregnant women\n- Everyone 50 years of age or older\n- Children aged 6 months to 18 years old\n- Police, firefighters, and other public safety workers\n- Out-of-home caregivers and household contacts of anyone in any of the high-risk groups\n- Children and adolescents (aged 6 months to 18 years) receiving long-term aspirin therapy\n- Residents of nursing homes and other facilities that care for people with chronic medical conditions\n- Persons who want to reduce the risk of becoming ill with influenza or of transmitting influenza to others\n- Health care workers and other employees of hospitals, nursing homes, and chronic care and other outpatient facilities who care for patients\n- Those planning to travel to the tropics at any time or to the Southern Hemisphere from April through September who did not receive a flu vaccine the previous year\n- People who have chronic lung or heart disorders, and/or chronic diseases such as diabetes mellitus, kidney disease, severe anemia, or immune deficiency (including HIV/AIDS)\nWho Should NOT Get a Flu Shot?\n- Anyone with a fever\n- Infants under 6 months old\n- Anyone who has ever had a severe reaction to a flu vaccination.\n- Anyone with Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), a rare condition that affects the immune system and nerves\n- People severely allergic to eggs and egg products (ingredients for flu shots are grown inside eggs, so tell your doctor if your child is allergic to eggs or egg products before he or she gets a flu shot)\nWhen Should You Get the Yearly Influenza Vaccine?\nThe viruses that cause influenza change often, and protection declines within a year after vaccination.\nPeople who need the vaccine should get it every year.\nThe vaccine begins to protect you after 1 to 2 weeks and protection may last up to one year.\nWhat are the Risks from the Influenza Vaccine?\nThere is a very small risk that serious problems, even death, could occur after taking the vaccine.\nThe risk from the vaccine is much smaller than the risk from the disease.\nSerious problems from the flu vaccine are rare.\nSide effects from the flu vaccine may include: soreness, redness, or swelling where the shot was given; fever; aches and pains.\nMore information on the Types of Flu Shot Reactions.\nHow Effective is the Flu Shot?\nThe effectiveness of the flu vaccine is dependent upon the extent of the match between the virus strains used to prepare the vaccine and those viruses in actual circulation.\nThe age and health status of the individual also play a role in determining the effectiveness of the vaccine.\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) often will recommend that certain high-risk groups be given priority when flu shot supplies are limited.\nDisabled World is an independent disability community established in 2004 to provide disability news and information to people with disabilities, seniors, and their family and/or carers.

{"question":"What role did historical navigation play in shaping both the Catholic Church at Folly Beach and Aboriginal culture near Cooktown?","answer":"Both locations show evidence of maritime history's impact on their communities. For the Catholic Church at Folly Beach, Masses were initially offered at various locations including a Coast Guard Radar Station between 1940-1950, after a hurricane destroyed their original building in 1940. The current church was finally built in 1949. In Aboriginal culture, their rock art preserves historical encounters with maritime exploration, specifically showing sailing ships they observed along the coast, including Captain Cook's Endeavour, which was damaged on a reef at Kulki (Cape Tribulation) and had to stop for repairs at what later became Cooktown.","context":["The art and architecture of a Catholic church can help us to know more about our Faith and to provide us with many opportunities for prayer and contemplation of the Blessed Trinity, the Holy Family and Saints and especially the life, death and resurrection of Jesus.\nThe General Instruction of the Roman Missal and other church documents provide architects and visual artists with guidelines on how the interior of a church should be designed and decorated, but each church building is unique to the community it serves and reflects the personal touches of its pastor and parishioners.\nBefore there was a Building, the Community was served.\nMasses have been offered at Folly Beach since 1937–at the Elks Lodge on E. Atlantic Avenue until a hurricane in 1940 destroyed the building. Between 1940 and 1950 Mass was offered on Folly Beach in a number of places including the famed Folly Pavilion, the old Community Center and even at the Coast Guard Radar Station. Construction of this church began in 1949 and the First Mass was celebrated in the present Church of Our Lady of Good Counsel on Christmas Day in 1950. You can read about the history of our parish here. Entrance to Our Lady of Good Counsel Church,Folly Beach showing the cornerstone.\nLook around Our Lady of Good Counsel church and see what it has to teach us about our Faith and our community.\nParts of our church\nThere are three main parts of our church building. 1) The Nave 2) The Sanctuary 3) The Sacristy (including the Confessional)\nThe Nave is the area reserved for worshippers, and includes the central aisle. The name is derived from the Latin ‘navis’, meaning a ship, possibly with some reference to the “ship of St. Peter” or the Ark of Noah. Many of the technical names of things you find in a church come from Greek or Latin words because those were the languages Christians spoke when these objects were named.\nThe first thing you see when you enter the door of our church is a pool of water—it represents the water in which we were baptized—because Baptism is the door to the Church. As we enter the church door, each person dips their right hand in the water, makes the sign of the cross and renews the promises that our parents and Godparents made for us at our Baptism. There is also a reservoir of Holy Water available for parishioners to use. Many people use a Holy Water font at home.\nOur parish baptismal font is located near the entrance of the church, but is moved to the sanctuary area when the sacrament is conferred. The postures that we use in church; standing, kneeling, sitting, etc., have a history of their own. Long ago people stood up for most of the Mass, and there were no pews or fixed seating. Pews enabled the congregation to sit and listen to the sermon, which often lasted several hours. In the 13th century, when Christians did not receive Holy Communion frequently and the high point of the Mass was looking at the host rather than consuming it, the congregation knelt in the presence of the Blessed Sacrament just as they were accustomed to kneel before an earthly king. As the practice of kneeling in church became more frequent, small kneeling benches were added. Standing is a posture of adult respect and attention, which is something we do when we hear the Gospel proclaimed.\nThe walls of the nave are decorated with colored glass windows. “Stained glass” is a term for how some glass is colored, but not all colored glass windows are technically “stained glass”. The windows in our church (on the left side) represent the Joyful and (on the right side) Glorious Mysteries of the Holy Rosary. Each window tells the story of an event in the life of Mary and Jesus. From the Annunciation to the Crowning of Mary, Queen of Heaven and Earth. There are three other colored glass windows in the church, and two in the sacristy.\nAlso on the walls are 14 plaques representing the Stations of the Cross. From early times Christians have wanted to visit the Holy Land and follow the way that Jesus walked to Calvary, remembering the important parts of that story. In Europe during the Middle Ages the devotion of the Way of the Cross was made popular by Franciscans. This prayer enabled people who could not afford the expense of the long and dangerous journey to Jerusalem to be able to follow the Way of the Cross in their own town, remembering what Jesus did for them. Our attention moves from one station to the next, praying over these incidents in the life of Jesus. We do this especially during Lent.\nThe Joyful Mysteries of the Holy Rosary\nFinding the Child Jesus in the Temple\nThe Glorious Mysteries of the Holy Rosary\nThe Decent of the Holy Spirit\nCoronation of Mary\nThe word sanctuary means a holy place. While the entire church is a holy place, special reverence is given to the area of the church where the priest and other ministers conduct the liturgy. Always raised up higher than the rest of the church, the sanctuary is the place where Catholics believe Jesus is truly present in the consecrated bread and wine of Holy Communion.\nThe presider’s chair and seating for the other ministers are in the sanctuary. The presider’s chair is not a throne for someone set apart, but is arranged so that the priest is seen to be a member of the worshiping community even though he has a special office to perform.\nThe Ambo, reading stand, or lectern, holds the readings from Sacred Scripture. The church teaches that “The dignity of the Word of God requires the Church to have a suitable place for announcing His message so that the attention of the people may be easily directed to that place during the Liturgy of the Word.”\nThe altar is the holy table upon which we celebrate the Lord’s Supper. It functions as both banquet table and altar of sacrifice; the Mass is both Holy Thursday (meal) and Good Friday (sacrifice). When the Eucharist is celebrated the table is covered with an altar cloth. The different colors represent the different liturgical seasons or feasts. The top of the table is always covered in white.\nA Crucifix is a cross that has the image of Christ crucified on it. The Catholic Church directs that there should always be a crucifix on the altar, with a candle on either side. To better fulfill this requirement, the crucifix is also hung on the wall behind the altar, so that when the priest is facing the congregation the crucifix is not obstructed. The antipendium (the part of the altar below the table, facing the people) has the image of the Paschal Lamb which symbolizes Christ, “the Lamb of God”, who redeemed the world by the shedding of His blood. A sanctuary lamp burning before the tabernacle has traditionally told Catholics of the presence of the consecrated Bread. Our sanctuary lamp hangs from the rafters, and if you look up near it, you will see the image of a dove, representing the Holy Spirit — a gift from one of our parishioners.\nFrom the time of the apostles, when members of the assembly could not be present for Sunday Mass because they were sick or in prison, some of the bread and wine was saved after communion and carried to the absent members. The Eucharist began to be reserved so that it could be received as viaticum at the moment of death. The place for reserving this bread for the sick and dying came to be called the tabernacle.\nThe candles which we find in church were once primarily functional and gave light for reading the Scriptures and celebrating the sacred action. Now that churches have electrical lights, the candles play a more symbolic function. Before every Mass, the candles on either side of the altar are lit, and on special occasions, the more elaborate candelabras beside the tabernacle are lit.\nThe Paschal Candle is large wax candle, set in a great candlestick and featured in the service on Holy Saturday. The five grains of incense set cross-wise in the candle recall the sacred wounds retained in Christ’s glorified body. (John 20:25-27) This candle is also used in Baptismal celebrations to symbolize the transfer of the “light of Christ” to parents and Godparents who have the responsibility of passing the Faith onto their children. Baptismal candles are lit from the paschal candle and given to the parents of the baptized.\nThere is another colored glass window in the Sanctuary, it depicts Jesus breaking bread and blessing wine. It evokes Jesus both at the Last Supper, instituting the Holy Eucharist and Jesus revealing himself to the disciples he met on the road to Emmaus, after His resurrection. Recall how the two disciples “Recognized Him in the breaking of the bread.” (Luke 24:30)\nAnother distinguishing feature of Catholic churches are statues and other devotional images. Long ago, when the Mass and readings from the Bible were in Latin and not always understood by the faithful, statues, pictures and stained-glass windows often became the people’s catechism, teaching and explaining the mysteries of our faith and honoring the heroes who lived it. That is how the expression, a Catechism in Stone and Glass came to be.\nIn this image Mary, the Mother of Jesus, is wearing a blue mantle, symbolizing heavenly grace. The statue shows her crushing a serpent. It is a reference to Gen. 3:14-15 “Then the LORD God said to the serpent: “Because you have done this, you shall be banned from all the animals and from all the wild creatures; On your belly shall you crawl, and dirt shall you eat all the days of your life. I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and hers; He will strike at your head, while you strike at his heel.”This reading from the first book of the Bible is understood as the first promise of a Redeemer for fallen mankind. The woman’s offspring is Jesus Christ.\nPeople often ask for special help from the saints who are represented by the statues. Lighting a candle in front of a statue expresses the desire that their prayers continue even after they leave the church.\nThe St. Joseph Statue includes the symbol of a budding lily on a staff. Pious legend tells us that when the Virgin Mary was only fourteen years old each of her potential suitors left his staff in the temple through the night with the hope that God would indicate which suitor He preferred for her. When the suitors checked the next morning Joseph’s staff was budding into leaf. Another reason for the symbol of the lily on St. Joseph’s staff is because the lily symbolizes chastity and virtue. St. Joseph is the chaste spouse of Mary. He is also the Patron Saint of a Happy Death and the lily represents the resurrection of the body after death.\nOur Parish Patron, Our Lady of Good Counsel is depicted in the large round colored glass windows. This title for Mary, Our Lady of Good Counsel dates back to an ancient fresco icon that is currently in Rome. Mary, The Blessed Mother of Jesus, under the title Our Lady of Good Counsel, was proclaimed the Patron of Albania in the year 1895. There is a very interesting story about how the original fresco image of Mary and Jesus made a miraculous journey from Albania to Rome. The image of Mary and Jesus in the circular glass window above the altar (shown below) of our church is similar to the icon of Our Lady of Good Counsel now in Rome. In the colored glass image above the entrance door of our church (shown left) Mary wears a crown, perhaps to recognize that she is Queen of Heaven and Earth.\nA Catholic historian once analyzed the icon in this way:\nEverything in Our Lady’s face gives the impression of her great satisfaction in having her Child in her arms. She is thinking only of Him. But she is not looking at Him directly, she is looking at the one who is praying to her. But her face touches His forehead. It is a moment of maternal love and tenderness.\nHe holds her like a person who desires nothing else in this world but her. He feels the joy of being protected by her. It seems that she is trying to guess what is going on in His soul, paying attention to realize if He will say something. She is not asking anything in her prayers; she is contemplating His person. He has this great intimacy with her, but His eyes do not look straight at her, they are turned upward. While her eyes look downward, His eyes are raised, up toward God the Father. We look to her; she looks to Him; and He looks to the two other Persons of the Most Holy Trinity.\nShe receives our prayers and transmits them to God. He receives them as God and also transmits our prayers to the other Persons of the Holy Trinity. So, you have the Catholic doctrine of the mediation of graces delicately expressed in this picture, perhaps without having noticed it at first glance.\nPerhaps when you draw nearer to the picture to contemplate the relationship between her and Him, you may feel yourself invited to enter into their intimacy. You may feel yourself being understood, loved, and helped by her, and by Him. You may feel yourself adopted by her as a son or daughter and, therefore like a brother of the Child Jesus.\nThis is the area of the church where the priest’s vestments and the vessels and books used in liturgical celebrations are kept. It is also where the priest and altar servers “vest” for Mass. The particulars of the items held in the sacristy will be discussed in another article. The sacristy bell is another gift from a parishioner. It is a long held Catholic tradition to ring a bell to signify that the priest was leaving the sacristy and entering the church. This bell is decorated with symbols of St. Peter–the fish symbolizes Christ’s call to “Follow me and I will make you fishers of men.” Also, the fish was an early symbol of Christianity, because the initial letters of each word in the Greek phrase “Jesus Christ, Son of God, Savior” form the word ICHTHUS, which means “fish.” The sacristy bell also has a key which recalls Christ’s words:\n“I will give you the keys to the kingdom of heaven. Whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.” Matt. 16:19\nMany of the fixtures and furnishings of our parish church were made possible by special gifts presented in memory of loved ones. Small brass memorial plaques, such as those beneath each of the colored glass windows, recall the names. Praying for the souls of the people inscribed on those plaques is another way to serve our Faith Community.\nComing into the church for Mass, we may miss some of the details around us, but when we take the time to look, we can see that our parish church invites adoration and contemplation even when there are no liturgical celebrations. It is a “beautiful house of the Lord where the faithful are free to recollect themselves. It is a place where, in a restless world, one can meet the Lord in peace.”\nSources: Catechism of Catholic Church, the Catholic Encyclopedia, Catholicliturgy.com, Prof. Plinio Corrêa de Oliveira Our Lady of Good Counsel of Genazzano, Thomas Richstatter, O.F.M.

{"question":"Hi! I want to know if elderberry can help with flu symptoms? Need quick answer pls 😊","answer":"Yes, elderberry can help with flu symptoms. A specific elderberry juice syrup has been shown to relieve flu symptoms and reduce the duration of flu when taken within 48 hours of the first symptoms. Taking elderberry lozenges within 24 hours of first symptoms also reduces flu symptoms. Most people experience relief within 2-4 days of treatment. Additionally, products containing elderberry juice and echinacea appear to work similarly to the prescription drug oseltamivir (Tamiflu).","context":["Arbre de Judas, Baccae, Baises de Sureau, Black-Berried Alder, Black Elder, Black Elderberry, Boor Tree, Bountry, Common Elder, Elder, Elder Berry, Elderberries, Elderberry Fruit, Ellanwood, Ellhorn, European Alder, European Black Elder, European Black Elderberry, European Elderberry, European Elder Fruit, European Elderberry, Fruit de Sureau, Grand Sureau, Hautbois, Holunderbeeren, Sabugeuiro-negro, Sambequier, Sambu, Sambuc, Sambuci Sambucus, Sambucus nigra, Sambugo, Sauco, Saúco Europeo, Schwarzer Holunder, Seuillet, Seuillon, Sureau, Sureau Européen, Sureau Noir, Sus, Suseau, Sussier.\nOverview InformationElderberry is the dark purple berry from the European elder tree. The berries are used to make medicine. Do not confuse elderberry with American Elder, Elderflower, or Dwarf Elder.\nSome people take elderberry by mouth for the common cold, \"the flu\" (influenza), and H1N1 \"swine\" flu. It is also taken by mouth for HIV/AIDS and boosting the immune system. Elderberry is also taken by mouth for sinus pain, back and leg pain (sciatica), nerve pain (neuralgia), and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS).\nSome people also take elderberry by mouth for hay fever (allergic rhinitis), cancer, as a laxative for constipation, to increase urine flow, and to cause sweating. It is also used for heart disease, high cholesterol, headache, toothache, and weight loss.\nSome people apply elderberry to the inside the mouth for gum inflammation.\nElderberry fruit is also used for making wine and as a food flavoring.\nHow does it work?Elderberry might affect the immune system. Elderberry seems to have activity against viruses including the flu, and might reduce inflammation.\nUses & Effectiveness\nPossibly Effective for\n- Constipation. Drinking tea made from elderberry and other ingredients seems to increase the number of stools passed in people who are constipated.\n- \"The flu,\" also called influenza. A specific elderberry juice syrup seems to relieve flu symptoms and reduce the length of time the flu lasts when taken by mouth within 48 hours of the first symptoms. Taking elderberry lozenges within 24 hours of the first symptoms also seems to reduce flu symptoms. Relief seems to occur within 2 to 4 days of treatment for most people. Taking a product that contains elderberry juice and echinacea also seems to relieve symptoms and reduce the length of time flu lasts. It seems to work similar to the prescription drug oseltamivir (Tamiflu).\nInsufficient Evidence for\n- Heart disease. Early research shows that taking elderberry extract daily for 12 weeks does not reduce risk factors for heart disease in postmenopausal women.\n- The common cold. Early research shows that taking a specific type of elderberry extract (BerryPharma by Iprona AG) for 10 days before and up to 5 days after arriving at an overseas travel destination does not prevent colds from developing. However it does seem to shorten the duration of colds and reduce cold symptoms.\n- Gum inflammation (gingivitis). Early research shows that using a mouth rinse (HM-302 by Izun Pharmaceuticals) or mouth patches (PerioPatch by Izun Pharmaceuticals) containing elderberry, echinacea, and gotu kola prevents gingivitis from worsening. However, it doesn't seem to improve symptoms.\n- High cholesterol. Early research shows that taking capsules containing dried elderberry three times daily for 2 weeks does not reduce cholesterol levels in people with high cholesterol.\n- Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS).\n- H1N1 \"swine\" flu.\n- Hay fever.\n- Nerve pain.\n- Other conditions.\nSide Effects & SafetyElderberry fruit extract is POSSIBLY SAFE when taken by mouth for up to 12 weeks. It's not known if taking elderberry fruit extract is safe when used for longer periods of time.\nElderberry is POSSIBLY UNSAFE when the leaves, stems, unripe fruit, or uncooked fruit is eaten. The cooked elderberry fruit seems to be safe, but raw and unripe fruit might cause nausea, vomiting, or severe diarrhea.\nSpecial Precautions & Warnings:Children: Elderberry is POSSIBLY SAFE when taken by mouth for up to 10 days. It's not known if taking elderberry is safe when used for longer periods of time.\nPregnancy and breast-feeding: Not enough is known about the safety of using elderberry during pregnancy and breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use.\n\"Autoimmune diseases\" such as multiple sclerosis (MS), lupus (systemic lupus erythematosus, SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), or other conditions: Elderberry might cause the immune system to become more active, and this could increase the symptoms of autoimmune diseases. If you have one of these conditions, it's best to avoid using elderberry.\nBe cautious with this combination\nMedications that decrease the immune system (Immunosuppressants) interacts with ELDERBERRY\nElderberry can increase the immune system. Taking elderberry along with some medications that decrease the immune system might decrease the effectiveness of medications that decrease the immune system.<br/><br/> Some medications that decrease the immune system include azathioprine (Imuran), basiliximab (Simulect), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), daclizumab (Zenapax), muromonab-CD3 (OKT3, Orthoclone OKT3), mycophenolate (CellCept), tacrolimus (FK506, Prograf), sirolimus (Rapamune), prednisone (Deltasone, Orasone), corticosteroids (glucocorticoids), and others.\nThe following doses have been studied in scientific research:\n- For constipation: A tea made from elderberry flowers, anise fruit, fennel fruit, and senna flowers (Laboratórios Klein) mixed in 150 mL of boiling water has been taken three times daily for 5 days.\n- For the flu: One tablespoon (15 mL) of a specific elderberry juice-containing syrup (Sambucol by Nature's Way) has been taken four times daily for 3-5 days. Also, a specific lozenge (ViraBLOC by HerbalScience) containing 175 mg of elderberry extract has been taken four times daily for 2 days. Also, one teaspoon (5 mL) of a product containing echinacea and elderberry (Echinaforce Hot Drink by A. Vogel Bioforce AG) mixed with 150 mL of hot water has been taken five times daily for 3 days then three times daily for 7 days.\n- For the flu: One tablespoon (15 mL) of a specific elderberry juice-containing syrup (Sambucol by Nature's Way) has been taken twice daily for 3 days. Also, one teaspoon (5 mL) of a product containing echinacea and elderberry (Echinaforce Hot Drink by A.

{"question":"What role does Norway play in supporting both cultural entrepreneurship and environmental finance, and how has this evolved in recent years?","answer":"Norway has established itself as a leader in both cultural and environmental initiatives. In the cultural sector, it provides support through public funding mechanisms for artistic research and public art commissions, though artists must demonstrate their projects' importance and relevance. In the environmental finance sector, Norway has shown significant leadership, with Oslo Børs pioneering the world's first separate green bond list in 2015. This green bond market has grown substantially, reaching nearly NOK 30 billion in total outstanding value, with various institutions participating, from major banks to local savings banks. Both sectors demonstrate Norway's commitment to supporting innovation while maintaining strict requirements for funding and transparency.","context":["How to survive as an artist? In many countries private collectors are key for artist survival, as selling art works are the most important income, but Norway cannot boast on a lot of collectors – yet. Norway is more known for public art commissions and public funding of artistic research, but that does not imply that it is easy to get funding. Many funds depend on political aims or collaboration with local institutions and nonprofit organizations outside the arts, but this is hard to do if you live outside of Norway and do not know how to present your project or find these collaborators. Some artists within the field of figurative painting also have the impression that public funding bodies “detest figurative art”, but this is not the case. Norwegian funding bodies focus on the theme of your project – like with other types of research in the humanities, they care about WHY. Why is your project important? What is it about?\nDuring a two-hour session, art historian, critic, curator, and former gallerist Maria Veie will guide participants through key topics related to artist survival. The workshop is dedicated to artists of all ages and backgrounds, who would like to discover more about how to develop and survive as an art professional. The session offers a short and condensed take on this subject, providing the insight and tools to navigate artist survival in Norway and internationally.\nThe workshop will explore the following topics: how to define a project that attracts attention in Norway, and how to approach and present your project to galleries, museums, art professionals and public funds.\nMaria Veie (b. 1977) is an art historian, critic and curator with a strong focus on site specific, performative and sound based art. After many years living between Oslo and Berlin she is based in Trondheim, Norway. Recent projects: «Queer Spirit» by Pride Art, «Kraft» by Øyvind Brandtsegg and Erlend Leirdal, «Into the Pink Sun» by MFA, KiT NTNU and «Paralysens Liturgi» by Liv Kristin Holmberg and composer Eirik Havnes in Nidaros Cathedral. Currently she’s working as a Publishing Editor at Museumsforlaget specializing on academic publications within art history and museology, teaching MFA students at Trondheim Academy of Fine Art and curating the performance “Liturgi for stemødre” together with the artists Liv Kristin Holmberg and Camilla Vatne Barratt-Due.\nBetween 2018-2022 Veie developed a number of anthologies; «Criticism for an absent reader» that she co-edited together with Anette T. Pettersen, «Gustav Vigeland + Nidaros Cathedral. Two National Icons», «Silver Linings. Clouds in Art and Science», «Digital og analog tegning» and «Et kunstmuseum i endring?» together with Line Engen and Boel Christensen Scheel and “Kunstsentrenes vekselstrøm». Among her upcoming anthologies are «Spreng grensene» and «Tingenes metode».\nShe founded Galleri Maria Veie in 2008. From 2009-2013 the gallery was connected to a permanent location in Oslo, developing solo shows by young artists as Jumana Manna, Elin Melberg and Marit Roland. Since 2014 Maria Veie has presented pop-up projects in other cities, eg. “Abgesang des Posthauses” together with Trondheim Voices and Goro Tronsmo at Berlin Art Week 2016.\nVISP is a resource and a networking organisation for the Visual Arts in Norway, and work to improve and facilitate conditions for the production and dissemination of Visual Arts.\nVISP represents all of the creative community within the Visual Arts, including artists, galleries, institutions, producers, curators, critics and suppliers of materials and services. VISP is a membership organisation and membership is free.\nSector 1 Gallery is a contemporary art gallery dedicated to supporting the evolution of Romanian contemporary art by placing emphasis on artistic freedom and experimentation.\nFrom its founding in 2017, the gallery has developed a program centered on exhibiting and representing contemporary artists trained in the artistic community in Cluj as well as a few Post avant-garde Romanian artists. Currently, the gallery focuses on the development of a diverse program that (re)presents emerging talents, as well as established artists, Romanian and international.\nThis presentation is part of the project “The enhancement of cultural entrepreneurship and the enlargement of audience through organizing the series of exhibitions About Master and Media, the paradigm of bipolarity in contemporary art.” The project takes place between September 2021 to August 2023, in partnership with VISP Norway. The total budget of the project is 217.146 Euros, of which the value of the non-refundable financial support is 195.431 Euros.\nThis project is financed with the support of EEA Grants 2014 – 2021 within the RO-CULTURE Programme.\nThe EEA Grants represent the contribution of Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway towards a green, competitive and inclusive Europe.\nThere are two overall objectives: reduction of economic and social disparities in Europe, and to strengthen bilateral relations between the donor countries and 15 EU countries in Central and Southern Europe and the Baltics.\nThe three donor countries cooperate closely with the EU through the Agreement on the European Economic Area (EEA). The donors have provided €3.3 billion through consecutive grant schemes between 1994 and 2014. For the period 2014-2021, the EEA Grants amount to €1.55 billion.\nFurther information available here: www.eeagrants.org and www.eeagrants.ro\nRO-CULTURE is implemented in Romania by the Ministry of Culture through the Project Management Unit. The Programme aims at strengthening social and economic development through cultural cooperation, cultural entrepreneurship and cultural heritage management. The total budget amounts to almost 34 million EUR. For more details: www.ro-cultura.ro","Norwegian issuers and Nordic investment banks have played a key role in developing the green bond market. In 2015, Oslo Børs became the first stock exchange in the world to have a separate list for green bonds. “Green finance is a preferred option for many investors. An increasing number of them want to invest in green projects. We want this new list to draw attention to green investment choices,\" commented Bente A. Landsnes, President and CEO of Oslo Børs, when the green bond list was launched.\nMarket seeing strong growth\nIn recent years we have seen a wave of green bond issues listed on Oslo Børs, with numerous new green bond issuers and borrowers (see the chart below for further information). Since launching the green bond list, new borrowers have raised increasingly large amounts by listing green bonds. 2018 was a particularly good year, with six companies listing their first green bonds, bringing the total number of issuers with green bonds on Oslo Børs to 18. In total, NOK 12.8 billion was raised through the nine green bond issues listed in 2018. There are now 25 green bonds on Oslo Børs, with a total outstanding value of nearly NOK 30 billion.\nNorwegian and Nordic green bond pioneers\nKommunalbanken (\"KBN\") has been involved in developing the green bond market on a global scale. Since 2010, KBN has offered a lower interest rate on loans to projects that are part of municipal energy and climate action plans in the Norwegian municipal sector.\nIn 2013 KBN became the first financial institution in Norway to issue a green bond. \"Internationally there is growing demand for climate-friendly investments. With access to major investors and important capital markets around the world, KBN is able to meet this demand and at the same time help Norwegian municipalities to realise their energy and climate action plans,\" explained Kristine Falkgård, President and CEO of KBN, when the bank listed two issues totaling USD 1 billion in 2015.\nThe green bond concept was developed by the Nordic financial services group SEB and the World Bank. CICERO, one of the leading global providers of second opinions on green bond frameworks, is based in Oslo, and provided the second opinion for the first green bond issued by the World Bank.\nBroader selection attracts new investors\nNew borrowers and a broader range of projects financed by green bonds attract new investors.\nThe world’s first green mortgage bond was listed on Oslo Børs last year. “We want to play a leading role in this area and to inspire greater use of this type of bond,” commented Eivind Hegelstad, who is responsible for investor relations at SpareBank 1 Boligkreditt. “There is a growing investor market for green bonds in Europe, which we are seeking to address in accordance with the general approach we have always followed of having as broad and deep a pool of investors for our bond issues as possible,” he continued.\nGreen mortgages are mortgages for energy-efficient properties. SpareBank 1 Boligkreditt will allocate the funds raised by its green mortgage bond to new and existing residential mortgage loans.\nIn February 2019, Sunndal Sparebank became the first savings bank to list a green bond on Oslo Børs. Sunndal Sparebank will initially offer loans to private and corporate customers who want to buy vehicles that run 100% on electricity or hydrogen. \"We need to take responsibility for increasing awareness and the level of knowledge about climate risk in our communities,\" commented Jonny Engdal, the CEO of Sunndal Sparebank.\nListing green bonds on Oslo Børs\nIssuers looking to list on Oslo Børs’ green bonds list are subject to the same listing requirements and continuing obligations that apply for regular listed bonds. In addition, the following requirements apply:\n- An independent second opinion that certifies the environmentally friendly nature of the bonds.\n- The second opinion must be made publicly available in order to enable investors to understand the environmental aspects of the projects that are to be financed by the bond.\n- The issuer’s ongoing disclosure obligations from issuing a green bond (i.e. continuing project reporting agreed with investors upon the issuance of the bond) must be made publicly available through stock exchange announcements."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:2a198cdc-126b-44c9-b1bd-c014f49daf75>","<urn:uuid:9303f781-e8c7-40e9-a166-fbe22806d9fa>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How does the Agogo bell's traditional use in religious ceremonies compare to its potential for creating modern Afro-Latin grooves?","answer":"The Agogo bell originated in West African Yoruba religious ceremonies, particularly in Candomble practices. It consists of single or double conical bells that produce distinct sounds based on size. While traditionally used in religious contexts, the Agogo has evolved into a versatile instrument that can be incorporated into modern Afro-Latin music, particularly when combined with patterns like the 2/3 son clave rhythm, cascara rhythm, and other bell patterns to create layered percussion arrangements. It can be integrated with bass lines and piano accompaniments to form complete Afro-Latin grooves.","context":["The Agogo is probably the oldest samba instrument that originates from the West African Yoruba. It is an instrument that was used in music of the religious ceremonies in Yorubaland, based on beliefs like Candomble, an Afro-Brazilian religion. However, nowadays, the Agogo was not only used in Yoruba and Edo music, but also in music all throughout the world.\nIn addition to that, the Agogo is an instrument that has a single or double conical bell that are linked together by a steel bent. The most common arrangement of the Agogo bell is two bells attached on a U-shape. Interestingly, each of the Agogo bells have different sounds that depends on the bell’s size. In its arrangement, the smaller bell is held uppermost. Either bell (the big or small) may be hit with a wooden stick, making a cowbell like sound. These bellswere usually in chrome color or painted steel.\nParts of an Agogo Instrument\nAn Agogo Bell is indeed one of the simplest instruments for it only has a few key parts. This instrument’s key parts include the Bell, the Stick and its handle.\n- Agogo Bell: An Agogo bell is a hollow metal conical bell that is usually made out of metal. However, some Agogos were made out wood and small coconuts. This instrument produces a sound when it was struck. There are three variations of an Agogo bell. These were the Metal, Wood, and Coconut Bell.\n- Wood: If an Agogo bell is made out of wood, of course you cannot expect to sound like a metal bell. However, the sound of a wooden Agogo bell is much more earthy and natural.\n- Small Coconuts: There are also Agogo instruments that has a bell made out of small coconut shells. This type of bell has a rough surface but produces a clear and rich sound.\n- Metal: Most of the Agogo bells were made out of metal for they resonate a lot more in comparison to wood and nut bells.\n- Stick: The stick is the tool that the player used in hitting the Agogo bell.\n- Handle: The Handle is where the Agogo bells is attached. In some construction of Agogo, these two bells can be squeeze for the two bells hit against each other.\nThis instrument is straight forward since the player would onlystrike the bell to produce a sound. However, the trick is, one must know some basic patterns in order to play the instrument right. Below are the basic rhythmic patterns of an Agogo instrument.\nThe Agogo Instrument’s Rhythmic Pattern\nWhen it comes to the instruments rhythmic pattern, the Agogo has the most basic or archetypal pattern. It has a four-basic pattern including the first bell pattern, which is in 4/4 form, the standard pattern known as clave. This pattern is usually used in an Afro-Brazilian dance called Maculete, and in rhythms of Macumba’s and Candoble’s religious practices.\nThe second pattern, is a rhythm that is commonly used in Afoxe, an Afro-Brazillian secular group. This is often thought as the embellished version of the bell pattern one. It has a four additional stroke in comparison to the first bell pattern. Furthermore, the third basic rhythmic pattern of the Agogo instrument is most often used in Batucada, a substyle of samba that refers to an African-influenced Brazilian percussive style.The fourth one can also be thought as the embellishment version of the first pattern, although it sounds like the maracatu bell with an additional four strokes.\nAgogo Instrument as an Accompaniment in Rock Music\nIn a 1975 American funk and R&B song by Ohio Players, one of the notable instruments used in there was the Agogo bell. It is a song originally composed by James Williams, Ralph Middlebrooks, Clarence Satchel, William Beck, and Leeroy Bonner. Aside from that song, the Agogo bell was also played by another rock music band including the Soulfly Band. This band was an American Heavy Metal Band that was formed in 1997 in Phoenix, Arizona. In fact, in one of the band’s debut album, the band’s front man and guitarist, Max Cavalera, had played an Agogo instrument.","Create Your Own Afro-Latin Groove\nThis last lesson in the BANDED series is a culminating experience in which students will build on rhythmic and melodic concepts introduced in all of the previous lessons in the series. The activities in this lesson will focus mainly on building a groove around the 2/3 son clave rhythm pattern and will explore the basic cascara rhythm and other rhythms that are commonly found in many styles of Afro-Latin music. Drawing on experience with pentatonic and blues scales from previous lessons, students will then improvise or compose their own Afro-Latin inspired groove. Many reading, video, and listening resources have been presented previously to provide a jumping off point into the rich history and traditions of Afro-Latin music and should be revisited as needed. The spirit of this lesson is meant to embody the exploration, creativity, and collaboration that is demonstrated by the various musicians featured in BANDED. Request a PULSE demo account now to view endless interactive contemporary music education material within PULSE!\n- As needed, students will listen to various recordings of Afro-Latin compositions and discuss similarities and differences (style, instrumentation, tempo, form).\n- Students will explore and perform the basic cascara rhythm and other common Afro-Latin rhythms.\n- Students will create an Afro-Latin rhythmic groove by performing the 2/3 son clave rhythm pattern along with the new rhythm patterns presented in this lesson.\n- Students will add a simple bass line and chord progression to the rhythmic groove.\n- Students will compose melodies or improvise over the Afro-Latin rhythmic groove using the major pentatonic, minor pentatonic, and blues scales.\nMaterials and Resources:\n- Computer with a browser such as Chrome, Safari or Firefox, to access the Berklee PULSE website (Request a PULSE demo account)\n- Projector, PA system\n- Percussion instruments, non-pitched and pitched (or preferred instrument)\n- Variety of melodic instruments (preferred instrument)\n- Optional: One or a mix of the following - Manuscript paper, Notation software, a DAW\n- Suggested online resources\nSuggested Online Resources:\n- Revisit links from previous lessons, as needed\n- Revisit links from previous lessons, as needed (see links above).\nPULSE Connections: (request a demo here)\n- Informal assessment – through class discussion and participation\n- Formal assessment – through practice and performance of all rhythmic and melodic concepts presented in the lesson\nInstructional Activity Ideas:\nThe available time in your curriculum will determine how much you incorporate from the following suggested activities. This is meant as a cumulative experience based on concepts presented over several lessons, but can also be tailored to a variety of settings based the students’ prior knowledge and experience.\n1. Review the Son and Rumba Clave Patterns from the last lesson (The Clave).\na. This can be done using body percussion, various classroom percussion instruments, or instruments students have made.\nb. Alone, in pairs, or small groups, students can practice the clave patterns along with a recording selected by the teacher, an audio file of the rhythmic patterns, or some other click, such as a metronome.\nc. This lesson will specifically focus on the 2/3 son clave, as seen below. Listen to the 2 measure 2/3 son clave pattern along with the shaker pattern and bass drum pattern. Notice that the shaker is sounding on every quarter note in the measure and the bass drum is sounding on beats 1 and 3. The shaker and bass drum patterns provide a steady pulse, provide the downbeat of measure one, and offset the syncopation of the 2/3 son clave.\nd. In small groups, have the students practice the 2/3 son clave, shaker, and bass drum patterns. Students should rotate the patterns so they have the opportunity to practice each one.\nThe Cascara Rhythm Pattern\nEach rhythmic pattern in Afro-Latin music can be thought of as part of a rhythmic jigsaw puzzle. The role of each pattern matters. The cascara rhythm pattern is very common in many styles of Afro-Latin music. Originally the cascara pattern was often referred to as the \"shell\" pattern because traditionally it was played on the shell (or rim) of the timbales, usually during soft sections of the song. Today, however, cascara refers more to the rhythm than the instrument it is played on.\n2. Introduce the cascara pattern and have the students practice it until comfortable.\n3. Once students master the cascara pattern, put students in groups. Have them begin practicing all the parts together (2/3 son clave, shaker, bass drum, and cascara). Have students switch parts so that they have the opportunity to play and feel the rhythm of each pattern within the whole. Use the following audio file as a reference:\n4. Have students experiment with the following:\na. Play the patterns at various tempos\nb. Play the patterns on different instruments\nc. Improvise other rhythmic patterns over the patterns\n5. Introduce students to other common patterns. The following examples are referred to as “bell” patterns, because they are typically played on some type of metal bell, such as a cowbell or an agogo. They can also be played on other Latin percussion instruments or a drum kit.\na. Have students listen to and practice each pattern alone, then with the 2/3 son clave, shaker, and bass drum patterns.\nOther Common Patterns\nBell Pattern 1\nBell Pattern 1 with 2/3 Son Clave, Shaker, and Bass Drum\nBell Pattern 2\nBell Pattern 2 with 2/3 Son Clave, Shaker, and Bass Drum\nBell Pattern 3\nBell Pattern 3 with 2/3 Son Clave, Shaker, and Bass Drum\n6. Have students practice and master all patterns, then practice them in various combinations.\na. Play the patterns at different tempos\nb. Play the patterns on different instruments\nc. Create a drum circle. Assign each student (or group of students) a pattern. Start the drum circle with just one pattern, then add rhythmic layers one at a time (every two bars, every four bars, etc.). Have students switch to a different pattern when given a cue. Listen to the following example that staggers the entrance of each pattern by two bars:\n7. Once the students feel totally comfortable performing all of the rhythms simultaneously, introduce a simple bass. The following is an example of a bass line found in Afro-Latin music based on two chords, C7 and Bb7. This can be played as is on any melodic instrument, or altered to suit teacher or student needs.\n8. To complete the rhythm section, add an accompaniment using the same chord progression as the bass line. The following is an example of a simple piano pattern. Rhythmically this pattern is similar to the harmonic riff found in “Oye Como Va.”\n9. The following audio examples add the bass line and the piano part to the layered percussion patterns from the previous example. The second example is at a faster tempo.\na. Play the example for the students. Have students pick a rhythmic pattern and tap or clap along with the example. Switch rhythms and repeat as necessary.\nExample 2 – Faster Tempo\n10. Have students choose instruments and rhythmic parts they will play.\na. Practice and perform as a group.\nb. Play at different tempos.\nc. Switch rhythmic parts.\n11.

The palace also houses priceless chandeliers, furniture, tapestries and porcelain. The 23 marble statues which line the main entrance way should not be missed.","Its inauguration by the Head of State coincided, on 8th July (the date on which Vasco da Gama set sail for India), with the commemoration of the 4th Centenary of the Discovery of the Maritime Route to India.\nThis building has five floors, with a lift and large stairway. On entering the Society building, one passes through an inner door decorated with stained glass.\nIn the large entrance hall (1, 2), there are six statues representing Henry the Navigator, Fernão Lopes, Pedro Álvares Cabral, Azurara, João de Barros and Castanheda. It is here that the visitor can see Veloso Salgado’s painting Vasco da Gama perante o Samorim (Vasco da Gama before the Samorin).\nThrough the door to the left of the entrance, we move into the Members’ Common Room. This is a pleasant area where members and their guests can relax. The room also operates as a reception area for researchers working at the Society.\nGoing up the stairway, the visitor finds the Library and Maproom on the first floor as well as the Directors’ Meeting Room. On the walls of this room can be seen oil portraits of former Society Presidents together with one of King Luís, its patron and first Honorary President.\nOn the second floor – considered the main floor– in addition to the large Portugal Room, which follows the entire façade of the building, there are also the Algarve, Padrões and India rooms.\nThe ethnographic exhibits include pieces from West, Central and East Africa, India, China (including Macau), Japan and Timor.\nThe Algarve Room is around 19 metres long and 11 wide. It is used for general sessions, conferences and small meetings.\nBehind the President’s table in this room we find statues of Vasco da Gama, Henry the Navigator and Camões in various niches. The room also houses a large luminous planisphere, with the routes of the Discoveries followed by the Portuguese navigators, from 1482 to 1660, expressly made for the Paris International Exhibition of 1931.\nThe stucco ceiling of the India Room is in Renaissance style, and all around the cymas are coloured medallions, evoking glorious dates or reproducing characteristic emblems.\nOn one side of the room, there are two closets in which the flags of some expeditions to Africa are provisionally stored, along with a small statue of Vasco da Gama by Victor Bastos, and various examples of Indo-Portuguese furniture.\nFurthermore, the India Room has, in addition to various portolans, portraits of King Carlos and Queen Amélia, with signed dedications. The visitor should also notice an admirably worked national coat of arms in teak on one of the walls. A final interesting feature in the room is a chair which belonged to the Marquis of Pombal.\nCommunicating between the Portugal Room and the India Room, there is the Padrões Room.\nThe collection in the Padrões Room is constituted by a group of pieces linked to the Portuguese Discoveries, the highlight being the padrões placed by Portuguese navigators on the coast of Africa.\nUndoubtedly, it is the Padrões Room which has the most important vestiges of Portuguese historical memory. The placing of these padrões led to contact with new peoples and cultures, creating a new humanism.\nThe room contains a group of pieces bearing fascinating inscriptions, all of which have now been deciphered.\nSome were brought from Africa and attest to the arrival of the Portuguese caravels on the West coast, such as the transcription engraved on the Padrão de Sto. Agostinho, dated 1482, but placed in 1483 by Diogo Cão at the Cape of Santa Maria, just south of Angola.\nOthers come from distant India and allude to events that happened there and the personalities involved.\nThis is the case of the inscriptions engraved on the urn containing the remains of Afonso de Albuquerque, possibly from between 1520 and 1565, and sent from Goa to Lisbon in 1869. Another example is the tablet alluding to the 2nd siege of Diu by the King of Cambay in 1546 and the relief given by D. João de Castro. There are also the inscriptions on the famous white marble tablet from India, elaborately decorated on one side with arabesques and transcriptions from the Koran and, on the other, with a strange inscription in Portuguese stating it was used as a funeral stele for Rui Freire and his wife (1546). There is also the tablet which mentions the wreck of the Portuguese ship the São Francisco in 1602 on the Goulan Bar (Eastern India), as well as the miracle attributed to the patron saint of the vessel, in the rescue of the sailors and their safe return to Lisbon in 1604. They later placed a cross made from the ship’s mast in the Lisbon Church of São Francisco in thanksgiving.\nThe moulding of a tablet that D. João de Castro brought from an Indian temple should also be mentioned. Its original was placed by this major figure of Portuguese history, on his farm at Penha Verde, in Sintra and bears a long inscription in Sanskrit.\nA final exhibit of interest to be found in the Padrões Room is an inscribed funeral stone for the 16th century master of the India Run, Manuel Dias.\nThe masters of the India Run were important sailors who contributed greatly to the success of that difficult voyage.\nThe third and fourth floors are on the level of the 1st and 2nd galleries of the Portugal Room. On the fourth floor, there is a spacious and extremely well-appointed amphitheatre. This is also the location of the President’s office, that of the General Secretaries and the office of the S.G.L."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"content_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:a9780c3a-dd18-40d4-b3ad-a200bfb6c31a>","<urn:uuid:1e742e8f-83e2-43d3-8437-5a3324d45984>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What's the difference between how specimen collection in clinical labs works vs BLS training centers? Specifically interested in their staff certification and quality control standards!","answer":"Clinical labs (like NHANES MEC) and BLS training centers have distinct certification and quality control requirements. Clinical lab staff must be certified by the American Society for Clinical Pathology and undergo annual training in blood borne pathogen regulations, exposure control, hazardous chemicals handling, and universal precautions. Their facilities are CLIA-certified and follow strict quality assurance protocols, including equipment calibration, temperature monitoring, and participation in College of American Pathologists proficiency testing. In contrast, BLS training centers focus on instructor certification through the American Heart Association, maintaining specific student-to-instructor ratios (maximum 9:1), and ensuring instructors have medical backgrounds with real-world experience. BLS centers must follow AHA curriculum standards and maintain proper documentation of certification, but don't require the extensive laboratory safety protocols needed in clinical settings.","context":["MEC Operation and Schedule\nNHANES collected biological specimens (biospecimens) for laboratory analysis to provide detailed information about participants' health and nutritional status. Eligibility for specific laboratory tests was based on the survey participants' gender and age at the time of screening. The biospecimen collection took place in the mobile examination center (MEC). This included collecting, processing, storing, and shipping blood, urine, and other types of specimens. The controlled environment of the MEC allowed laboratory test to be performed under standardized conditions at each survey location.\nThe MEC was open 5 days per week; the non-operational days changed on a rotating basis so that appointments could be scheduled on any day of the week. Two examination sessions were conducted daily. Participants are randomly assigned to exams in the morning, or in the afternoon/evening session. Participants aged 12 years and older assigned to a morning session were asked to fast for 9 hours. Participant's fasting status was assessed by the MEC phlebotomist prior to the blood draw.\nBiological Specimens Collection\nBlood was collected from participants aged 1 year and older by a phlebotomist. The amount of blood drawn varied by age. Blood was processed and aliquoted into vials. The vials were then refrigerated or frozen before transport to laboratories across the United States. Except for complete blood count (CBC) and pregnancy tests, which were performed in the MEC, most assays were completed in 35 laboratories across the United States. If consent was granted, some specimens were stored for future studies.\nIn 1999-2014, NHANES collected urine specimens for all participants aged 6 years and older. Starting 2015, the target age for urine collection was extended to participants aged 3 years and older.\nParticipants aged 6 and older were asked to provide a full void urine specimen. The parents/guardians of participants aged 3-5 years were asked to help their children collect a full void urine specimen. The date and time of the prior urine void, along with the date, time, and volume of the urine specimen collected in the MEC were used to calculate urine flow rate. The urine specimen was also used: 1) to perform a urine pregnancy test on all female participants aged 12-59 years and menstruating females aged 8-11 years; 2) to aliquot, store, and transport to multiple laboratories for analysis; and 3) to aliquot and bank for future studies.\nFemale and male participants aged 14-59 were asked to self-collect a vaginal or penile specimen using a sterile swab. The vaginal and penile swabs were tested for the presence of multiple types of human papillomavirus (HPV).\nCollection procedures varied based on the specimen types. Please refer to the 2017-2018 Laboratory Procedures Manual for more details.\nNHANES Laboratory Setting\nEach MEC had a laboratory containing a laminar flow hood, complete blood count (CBC) with 5-part differential analyzer, two centrifuges, a portable balance (scale), refrigerators, and freezers. Each MEC laboratory team included three medical technologists and a phlebotomist. Staff were certified in accordance with guidelines set forth by the American Society for Clinical Pathology. The qualifications for these laboratory staff are described in the component training manuals. All laboratory staff were thoroughly trained to ensure the safety of the laboratory environment. This includes annual training in the following laboratory safety and infection control policies and procedures:\n- Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Blood borne Pathogen Regulation;\n- NHANES exposure control plan;\n- Working safely with hazardous chemicals;\n- Universal precautions and a set of guidelines for preventing the transmission of blood borne pathogens such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis viruses in health care settings; and\n- International Air Transport Association (IATA) training for proper shipping dangerous goods.\nAll staff also completed privacy protection and confidentiality training, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation training. In addition, all laboratory staff completed component-specific training to learn the standardized NHANES laboratory protocols.\nAutomated Data Collection\nIn the MECs and analytical laboratories, data for the laboratory component were recorded directly into a computerized database. Related questionnaire forms (e.g., fasting status) were also automated. The laboratory data collection and reporting systems were integrated with the main NHANES survey database.\nQuality Control Monitoring\nThe NHANES MEC laboratory has been a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act (CLIA)-certified laboratory of moderate complexity. Quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) involved both internal and external surveillance. QA/QC procedures were performed in the MEC as well as in contract and CDC laboratories. As part of the overall QA process, all collection materials, vacuum sample vials, and storage containers used were initially prescreened for background contamination (e.g., lead, mercury, etc.). EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) tubes were used after prescreening for contamination. The lot number and expiration dates for all vacuum sample vials, needles, and reagents were recorded.\nSpecific QC procedures were followed in the laboratory. For example, the freezers, refrigerators, and centrifuges were cleaned before the MEC opened, and a temperature reading on these items was conducted daily. On-site calibrations were performed twice each year. The NCHS biomedical engineer certified the revolutions per minute (rpm) of the centrifuges periodically and replaced the high-efficiency particulate air filters as necessary. All instrument maintenance was recorded. NHANES laboratories participated in the College of American Pathologists (CAP) proficiency-testing program. CAP samples were sent three times a year for the CBC and qualitative serum human chorionic gonadotropin. In addition, blind split samples were used for QC determinations.\nContract laboratories followed QA/QC guidelines when working with NHANES specimens and were required to be CLIA-certified. In addition, to ensure the data quality, NHANES staff conducted annual laboratory inspections and reviewed the QC data from each laboratory.\nRoutine data preparation procedures included a review of frequency data, outliers, and technician notes. Analysts should review the data reported for each component or laboratory assay prior to beginning data analyses.\nLow Detection Limits\nFor laboratory tests with a lower detection limit, results below the lower detection limit were replaced with a value equal to the detection limit, divided by the square root of two. This value was created to help users distinguish a nondetectable laboratory test result from a measured laboratory test result.\nSome NHANES components were collected or processed for a subsample of participants. Subsampling was done to reduce participant burden and facilitate the scheduling and completion of examinations. Each subsample was selected to be nationally representative. For example, some participants were selected to give a fasting blood sample on the morning of their examination. The subsamples selected for these components were chosen at random with a specified sampling fraction (e.g., one-half of the total examined group). Each component subsample has its own designated analytic weight, which accounts for the additional probability of selection into the subsample component as well as nonresponse to the component. See the respective survey protocol and documentation for more specific information on each subsample.\nPlease note that when merging full sample data to the subsample data files, the analytic sample is the subsample and the subsample analytic weights must be used. Users are strongly urged to read the data file documentation to ensure proper analysis and interpretation of the data.\nPlease refer to the NHANES Analytic Guidelines and the Continuous NHANES Web Tutorials for further details on NHANES subsamples, the use of sample weights, and other related analytic issues.\nSpecial Analytic Notes for the Laboratory Data\nThe analysis of NHANES 2017-2018 laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate survey design and demographic variables. The NHANES 2017-2018 Demographics File contains data on demographic characteristics, health indicators, and other related information collected during household interviews as well as the sample weights. The Fasting Questionnaire File includes auxiliary information, such as fasting status, the time of venipuncture, and the conditions precluding venipuncture. The demographics and fasting questionnaire files may be linked to the laboratory data file using the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).\nThere are over 800 laboratory tests performed. However, not all participants provided biospecimens or enough volume for all the tests to be performed. The specimen availability can also vary by age or other population characteristics. For example, in 2017-2018, approximately 80% of children aged 1-17 years who were examined in the MEC provided a blood specimen through phlebotomy, while 95% of examined adults age 18 and older provided a blood specimen. Analysts should evaluate the extent of missing data in the dataset related to the outcome of interest as well as any predictor variables used in the analyses to determine whether additional re-weighting for item non-response is necessary.\nWe strongly encourage data users to read all relevant documentation on the survey overall and for the specific data files to be used in their analysis. Specific data file documentation can be found via the link next to the respective data file on the NHANES website. Data users should also review the NHANES Analytic Guidelines prior to beginning any analyses.","BLS Provider is the version of CPR for healthcare providers. It teaches how to perform CPR on Adult, Child and Infant victims.\nAmerican Heart Association BLS classes are meant for anyone with a medical license, or for those required to have it for their job.\nIf you are not a licensed healthcare professional or are not required to have a BLS certification, please check out our non-healthcare CPR certification classes.\nReady to sign up?\nSign up for Prime's BLS classes by choosing 1 of 4 options below.\nClasses are offered locally in 4 convenient locations, but Prime is not limited from traveling extended distances to teach classes.\nOn this page you’ll learn everything you need to know about what’s covered in the BLS certification, who exactly needs it, what our past students have to say, and answers to all the most frequently asked questions.\n9:1 Student:Instructor Ratio\n2:1 Student:Manikin Ratio\n3-4 Hour Class\nWho needs BLS certification?\nProfessionals with a medical license or students in a medical program are required to have BLS from the AHA. Examples include:\n- Physical Therapists\nIndividuals without a medical license sometimes may also need BLS classes. Workplaces occasionally require non-medical providers, such as administrative staff, to have a BLS AHA certification. As a result, the entire office can work as a team when needed.\nFurthermore, non-medical individuals such as Lifeguards, Fire Fighters, and other professional rescuers are required to have a BLS certification. Because these occupations often work closely with medical providers, having the same level of training produces better outcomes during emergencies.\nPeople that do not fall into one of the above categories, typically only need to take a basic CPR/AED class which is still OSHA compliant and meets job regulatory requirements for non-healthcare providers.\nDo you need a BLS class?\nWhat is a BLS certification?\nBLS stands for Basic Life Support. It’s the healthcare provider level of CPR. BLS for Healthcare Providers requires that students learn the skills of CPR for Adult, Child and Infant. Even if an individual never works with kids, the entire course is required for certification.\nBLS for Healthcare Providers covers the following additional topics:\n- 1 and 2 rescuer CPR for all ages\n- How to use an AED (automated external defibrillator)\n- Mouth-to-mouth breathing\n- Rescue Breathing\n- Use of a pocket mask and bag-valve-mask (BVM\n- How to use Naloxone (Narcan) during opioid overdose emergencies\n- Performing CPR with an Advanced Airway\n- Helping Choking Adults and Infants\n- High Performance Team Dynamics\nStudents must pass the following three tests to receive their certification:\n- Adult CPR Skills Test\n- Infant CPR Skills Test\n- 25-question Written Exam (passing score is 84% or higher)\nHow to get BLS AHA certification?\n#1 Find an Authorized AHA Training Center\nPrime Medical Training is an authorized AHA Training Center providing BLS classes. Please be careful when looking online for training because there are many companies who will use deceptive wording and say they 'follow AHA guidelines', but they are not Authorized AHA Training Centers and do not use AHA curriculum. Licensing boards or employers will likely reject certification if it is not from a recognized training provider. Furthermore, even if an employer accepts a non-approved course, the certification may not hold up under legal questioning.\n#2 Sign Up For a AHA BLS Class\nSigning up for a class should be an easy process and it is! We list all of our upcoming public classes on our website and allow you to register online. When classes reach maximum capacity they are automatically removed from our online calendar, therefore you don't have to check availability. Furthermore, we NEVER cancel classes. Most students need their certification right away and we know you are counting on us, therefore we won't let you down! You can view all our classes and register online.\n#3 Successfully Complete the BLS Training\nThis may sound simple enough, but not all CPR trainers give legitimate classes. We here about these classes all the time. Legitimate AHA BLS for healthcare provider classes are mandated by the AHA to take 3-4 hours to complete (depending on whether you take the initial or renewal CPR class). Classes significantly shorter than this time period are considered by the AHA illegitimate and the BLS certification card is considered invalid as well. You may like the convenience of a shorter class, but this is a huge liability for both the instructor and student and not worth the risk.\nFurthermore, according to OSHA and the AHA, CPR classes are required to include hands-on skills practice during training. Your instructor must provide equipment for you to practice on and be tested in your skills. Because of this requirement, there are no legitimate online only CPR classes. The AHA's online BLS class still requires a hands on portion after completion of the online course and is an approved course. If you took a course and never touched a manikin your certification is invalid and not recognized.\n#4 Get Your BLS Certification Card\nA BLS Instructor is required to submit rosters to their training center within 10 days. The training center is then required to issue cards 10 days from receiving the roster. If a student does not receive their card within a total of 20 days, they can contact the instructor’s training center or the AHA directly. At Prime Medical Training, we issue all cards via email with 24 hours of course completion. We know you need your card quickly and we make sure that happens.\nReady to get certified?\nWhat to expect in BLS classes?\n#1 The Proper Student to Instructor Ratio\nThe AHA requires a ratio of 1 instructor for every 6 students. However, experienced AHA BLS instructors are allowed to teach up to 9 students. In order to receive the best experience, you should have the proper ratio in your classes. We keep our public enrollment classes at 6 students or less because we found our students like the more personal experience of a smaller group.\n#2 Every Student Gets a Book\nFurthermore, the AHA requires every student have a book available before, during, and after the BLS class. Every student at Prime Medical Training is provided a BLS student manual.\n#3 A Friendly and Experienced Instructor\nAt Prime Medical Training, we vet our instructors pretty hard. We make sure they meet three main criteria.\n- They have a medical background and extensive real-world experience practicing the topics that they teach.\n- Instructors must conduct themselves professionally both in their appearance and character.\n- Our instructors are evaluated on their personability, their ability to be dynamic while teaching, and be skilled in teaching what they know.\nPrime Instructors take the BLS classes very seriously, but at the same time they make it very simple and non-intimidating. These may be considered basic skills but it's vital that students can perform them proficiently.\n#4 Top Notch Experience\nPrime Medical Training offer outstanding BLS classes that defy the stereotypical, boring CPR class. A BLS certification is not something that should be taken lightly. Students should not just be checking the box. Prime’s goal is to challenge our students and have them walk away feeling like they earned their BLS for Healthcare Providers card.\nStudents are not always excited to recertify their BLS certification for the 100th time, but our goal is to do everything we can to make it as painless as possible. If you have to be here, our philosophy is to make the best of it, have a few laughs and maybe teach you something new (things are always changing).\n96% of students say this is the best class they have ever taken anywhere. Listen, don't take our word for it. Check out what a few of our raving fans have to say about our BLS classes.\nWant to experience the Prime difference?\nTestimonials for BLS Classes\n“This was the best AHA BSL course I have taken.

It is the CPR class required for healthcare providers.\nWhat is the difference between BLS vs CPR?\nBLS is what they call the level of CPR for healthcare providers. It is the highest level of CPR that you can get. Classes referred to as simply “CPR” are generally for non-healthcare professionals who still require a CPR certification.\nDo you offer free BLS certification?\nNo. We do offer basic free CPR training at events and workshops throughout the year, but these are geared more for community awareness.\nWhere can I find more about the American Heart Association CPR guidelines?\nThe best resource is directly on the AHA’s website. They use to update guidelines every five years, but in 2017 they began moving to a continuous evidence evaluation process to make updates as close to real-time as possible. There is also have a hard copy book available for purchase.\nDo you offer online BLS certification?\nIf you’re looking to do your BLS renewal online, the official course title is called “HeartCode BLS”. Individuals can purchase the online course from Prime Medical Training or from one of AHA’s distributors. Afterwards, must complete the skills portion at a local authorized AHA training center to receive a certification.\nIs there an American Heart Association BLS practice test?\nNo, the AHA does not provide an official BLS practice test. There are resources on the internet from third party providers that offer practice test questions. The official BLS written exam that you will take is 25 questions, you must make an 84% or higher to pass.\nWhat is the cost of BLS certification?\nEvery AHA training center and individual instructor sets their own price for BLS classes. The AHA says “Any fees charged for such a course, except for a portion of fees needed for AHA course materials, do not represent income to the AHA.” You can view Prime Medical Training’s current BLS certification cost on our class registration page.\nWhere can I get a Basic Life Support study guide?\nThere are several study guides available online. A simple Google search for \"AHA BLS study guide\" gives several resources. However, most students find it unnecessary to study beforehand.\nWhere can I buy an AHA BLS for Healthcare Providers student manual?\nWhen you sign up for our AHA BLS class, you will be given the option to purchase the BLS for Healthcare Providers book. You can pick the book up early or wait to get it when you come to class. We ship books by request only.\nIs BLS for Healthcare Providers the same as BLS Provider?\nYes. The AHA revised the name when they released the 2015 guidelines. “BLS Provider” is more inclusive all types of individuals who may need a BLS certification.\nDoes BLS include First Aid?\nNo. Individuals taking a BLS class typically already have a medical background that includes First Aid knowledge. If you need a First Aid certification, you will need to take that class separately by signing up on our class registration page.\nShould I take BLS or CPR?\nThat depends on what you do and what your job requires. If you have any kind of state medical license, you will need BLS regardless of whether or not your job requires a BLS certification. Those who do not have a medical license but their organization or work requires a CPR certification would want to take the basic CPR class.\nIs the online BLS certification AHA approved?\nYes. The BLS certification offered by Prime Medical Training is an AHA approved course. Prime has been designated as an authorized AHA training center.\nHow do I get an American Heart Association CPR card replacement?\nThis article explains what to do if you lost your CPR card. Essentially, those who initially received an eCard via email can login to the AHA and retrieve it. If you initially received a traditional paper card, you will either need to contact the instructor who taught your class or the training center the instructor was aligned with at the time they taught your class. You may be charged a fee for replacement paper cards.\nIs a BCLS certification class the same as BLS for Healthcare Providers?\nYes. BCLS stands for Basic Cardiac Life Support. That is an old title which was replaced by BLS for Healthcare Providers. When the AHA released the 2015 guidelines, they revised the name again to BLS Provider.\nDo I need to take BLS if I already have ACLS?\nYes. These are two separate classes. Sometimes the courses may be offered back to back but they are still individual courses that each require physical and written testing. Taking an ACLS (Advanced Cardiac Life Support) class does not automatically give you BLS certification.\nHow long is a BLS certification good for?\nIt is recommended that a BLS certification be renewed every 2 years. Some employers require refresher training, though, as often as every 3 months."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:9f628a82-c83c-4769-a44e-8f7c242816bc>","<urn:uuid:a150c96a-66b0-458e-a473-58f9de893d37>"],"error":null}
{"question":"¿Tanto Eisenstein como Wajda usaron sus películas como armas políticas? 🤔","answer":"No. While Eisenstein explicitly saw film as a social and political weapon and deliberately constructed Battleship Potemkin as agitprop to convey revolutionary messages, Wajda's approach in Ashes and Diamonds was more focused on exploring personal and national identity crises. Wajda's film examined the Polish post-war psyche through individual characters' struggles, rather than serving as direct political propaganda. Though both films dealt with political themes, Eisenstein deliberately avoided melodrama to focus on political messaging, while Wajda used personal narrative and character development to explore broader political and national themes.","context":["How does a nation go on without a nation? What happens when someone is completely confident in their identity, in their self-worth and value, but continually has that identity stripped away or undermined? Can a single man stand up against the course of history, or are we all just cogs in the machine, destined to grind away into nothing under the influence of a force we can’t even comprehend?\nThese crises make up, in essence, the national predicament of the Polish people for the past several centuries. Overrun, split and scrabbled over by the Russians, Prussians, Austrians, Hungarians and Germans, Poland desperately sought independence on numerous occasions, only to find themselves conquered yet again by a foreign power. The situation was perhaps never more dire than in the years surrounding WWII: divided by agreement between Germany and Russia before being completely overwhelmed by Hitler’s forces, Poland’s steadfast resistance against their occupiers during the war was the stuff of legends (particularly the Warsaw Uprising), but ultimately futile, as the Polish people watched their Nazi oppressors merely switch to Soviet ones.\nDirector Andrzej Wajda (pronounced AN-drey VAI-da), in his 1958 film “Ashes and Diamonds,” completed a trilogy of war films (following “A Generation” and “Kanal”) that seamlessly meshed together the grander implications of a national, political identity crisis with the personal repercussions of individual restlessness. “Ashes and Diamonds” distills the concept of “Polishness” at the time down to one, conflicted young man, and lets circumstance run its course. Like Poland itself, the fate of resistance fighter Maciek is inevitable, except when it’s not: there are so many chances, so much luck involved with Maciek’s path, yet even he seems all along to know where everything will turn out. Indeed, it may be exactly because he knows the ending history has written for him, that in the end it comes to fruition.\nMaciek’s tale takes place entirely in an unnamed Polish town on one day, a critical day: May 8, 1945, the day Germany officially surrendered to the Allied powers. Along with his friend and Home Army (the Polish resistance) supervisor Andrzej, Maciek was been assigned to assassinate Commissar Szczuka, a Polish communist returning from exile to take charge of the new Soviet government in the area. Their first attempt goes tragically awry, but Maciek is given a second opportunity later that day when he checks into the same hotel as Szczuka.\nComplicating matters is the fact that Szczuka is no villain: he’s a genuinely well-meaning man trying to do what’s best for his country. To him, the Soviet regime promises equality and self-preservation for the Polish working class, and his hopes provide a stark contrast to the cyclical violence of the Home Army. In fact, returning home from abroad, Szczuka’s greatest priority is no political task, but merely to find his son Marek, who was adopted and raised by Szczuka’s sister-in-law after his wife died in a concentration camp. Marek, influenced by his aunt’s right-wing Polish nationalist views, has joined the Home Army, but has recently been captured and detained by the Russians. In an ironic twist, it is this side of Szczuka, his enduring humanity, that ultimately does him in, as his impatience to see his son again leads him to walk the streets late at night without an escort.\nMaciek is unaware of all of this, but still he hesitates in carrying out his orders, thanks to a rapidly developing crush on a local bar maid, Krystyna. In Krystyna, Maciek finds a possible alternative to the Home Front’s militarism. The destruction of Warsaw clearly broke Maciek down to his current, disillusioned state, but Krystyna offers hope for a new life, for a chance to rebuild the beauty and peace lost in the war. There is an absolutely extraordinary sequence between Maciek and Krystyna in a bombed-out church, where Maciek refers to the girl as the eponymous diamond amongst the ashes. We get the sense that Maciek desperately wants to cast off his loyalties and find a new future with Krystyna, but he’s already chosen his side. He must stand up for himself and for his nation, no matter how doomed he knows the enterprise may be.\nThat church scene is perhaps the culmination of the technical mastery of “Ashes and Diamonds.” Wajda’s camera is loaded and precise: like with Hitchcock, we sense that every frame is meticulously designed to demonstrate shifts and imbalances in power between the characters. But there is also a brashness to Wajda’s images that is more reminiscent of the French New Wave (much as I may still love Godard, Truffaut and Resnais for their ideas and style, I grow less and less impressed with their “innovation” the more I explore the cinema of the time; between Wajda, Melville, and other Soviet films from the Khruschev Thaw such as “The Cranes Are Flying,” it’s clear that the international cinema of the 1950s was not nearly as stagnant as the canonical narrative of film history would have you believe). Take, for instance, a shot in which Maciek and Krystyna stand in the background, divided by a half-destroyed, upside-down crucifix in the foreground: it takes guts to reflect the chaos of the situation in such a near-blasphemous frame. I would describe a few other shots and montages that are equally powerful, but many of them come at the film’s very end, and I would not wish to spoil the film’s enthralling conclusion any more than I probably already have.\nThere is a sub-plot involving a weaselly double agent named Drewnowski and his drunken escapades, which adds a bit of humor to the film but distracts from the truly engrossing passages revolving around Maciek and Szczuka. Actor Zbigniew Cybulski, who plays Maciek, was often referred to as “the Polish James Dean,” and the comparison is an extremely appropriate one, considering Cybulski’s instant charisma, tortured screen personality and tragically short career (he was killed at the age of 40, attempting to jump on to an already-speeding train). Counterbalanced by the stoic authority of Waclaw Zastrzezynski, the actor who plays Szczuka, the two make “Ashes and Diamonds” a captivating exploration into the post-war Polish psyche. Both of their characters share a vision of a brighter, better, independent Poland, a vision which they know will not come true during their lifetimes but they pursue all the same. Perhaps it was the work of men like these that finally gave rise to Solidarity and an independent nation, but history has no use for such easily disposable parts.\nVerdict: 4 out of 4 stars","by Kevin Lewis\nThe Battleship Potemkin, or Potemkin as it is generally known, galvanized filmmakers around the world because of the audacity of its film editing––especially in the iconic Odessa Steps massacre. Its impact on editors and directors since its premiere in Moscow on Christmas Eve, 1925 is immeasurable.\nThough Sergei M. Eisenstein transformed the possibilities of film language and technique far beyond previous expectations, he generously gave credit to American film director D.W. Griffith and English novelist Charles Dickens, both of whom had previously expanded the palettes of cinema and the novel, respectively.\nIn the twilight of his own troubled career as a director in the Stalinist Soviet Union, Eisenstein wrote a series of essays, which were collected and translated by Jay Leyda in Film Sense. His essay “Griffith, Dickens and the Film of Today,” written in 1944, delineates the evolution of montage, which was associated with Griffith and Eisenstein, but derived from Dickens––specifically, the use of parallel action, close-ups and flashbacks. Parallel action was the basis for montage, stated Eisenstein, which Dickens used as a break in the actions of his characters to pursue another storyline occurring at the same time.Griffith also used this device, along with close-ups, to the dismay of his producers who thought it would confuse audiences.\nUnlike Griffith and Dickens, Eisenstein—who was trained as an engineer— eschewed melodrama as a narrative device because he saw film as a social and political weapon. He deconstructed melodrama, relying on juxtaposition of dynamic images in discordant ways to shatter the anticipatory thought processes of the viewer.\nThe Odessa Steps sequence is unmatched in terror because the long shots of the hundreds of men, women and children fleeing pell-mell down the vast steps while being shot at by the advancing Czar’s firing squad are interspersed with close shots and full-screen close-ups of the individual tragedies. And what tragic moments: The grief-stricken mother holding her trampled child in her arms before the Czar’s officers, and being shot down; another dead mother whose falling body causes her baby in a carriage to roll down those stairs while hundreds are being picked off as they run; an old teacher whose eye is whipped out of her head by a Cossack. (Brian de Palma famously replicated this scene in the Chicago train station––complete with stairs and baby carriage––for his 1987 release, The Untouchables.)\nFor the film’s 85th anniversary, Kino has released Potemkin on Blu-ray, which startles the viewer with its clarity. Even more importantly, those who grew up with re-edited versions can experience for the first time a complete version and restoration by Enno Patalas and Anna Bohn––using prints from Goskinofilm, the British Film Institute, Bundesfilm Archive Berlin and the Munich Film Museum–– which restores dozens of shots censored for graphic violence as well as title cards deleted for revolutionary content (even in Soviet Russia, the original opening title cards with a Leon Trotsky message was eliminated when he was targeted by Joseph Stalin). The original 146 title cards by Eisenstein are restored in this version and reveal that the director did not rely solely on the power of his images to convey revolution because the titles pound home the Bolshevik/Communist message in sledgehammer-and-sickle fashion.\nThe very first title states that the individual is melded into the masses to make revolution succeed. Sailors on the battleship Potemkin discuss Marxism. Whether the four writers (including Gregory Alexandrov, Eisenstein’s collaborator) actually wrote the script, tailored by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Potemkin does not need any titles to convey its message of chaos. The original score by Edmund Meisel was newly recorded by Deutsches Filmorchestra for the Blu-ray release. A documentary on the original production and current restoration is also included.\nPotemkin, which was a progression from the Soviet newsreel Kino-Pravda (film- truth), probably had more impact on inter- national documentary than on commercial filmmaking. John Grierson, the leading force behind British documentary, and later Canadian nonfiction, called Potemkin “a glorified newsreel.”\nDuring the Russian Civil War between the Red and White Armies (1917-23), film- makers Lev Kuleshov and Eduard Tisse (who became Eisenstein’s cinematographer), shot the news events for Kino-Pravda, which were then edited together by Dziga Vertov and projected from trains traveling across Russia to the various villages. The message of the Russian Revolution was spread in this way. Kuleshov trained Eisenstein, as well as V.I. Pudovkin, then in his mid-20s, in the principles of editing and direction. Both Pudovkin and Eisenstein wrote the textbooks on film editing still used today––the former’s Film Technique and Film Acting and the latter’s The Film Sense and Film Form.\nWith Potemkin, Eisenstein deliberately constructed a work of agitprop, which was so detailed and manipulative that audiences and even historians believed that the invented massacre of civilians by Czarist officers and Cossacks on the Odessa Steps actually happened. Once seen,the Odessa Steps sequence is so effective it becomes reality, which is what Eisenstein wanted. The Revolution wrote its own history.\n“The opposite of truth in the cause of verisimilitude” was Eisenstein’s quote from Goethe, and the film, through fiction- al reportage, showed newsreel and documentary filmmakers how to shoot events using high and low camera angles, perspective shots and close-ups. Though the film was banned in Nazi Germany, Hitler’s Director of Propaganda, Joseph Goebbels, studied Potemkin intensely and Leni Riefenstahl used it as a template for Triumph of the Will (1935).\nThe film was conceived and shot quickly, from roughly September to November, after a summer of false starts. The Central Committee, impressed with Eisenstein’s first feature film, Strike (1924), commissioned a film to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the 1905 mutiny and demonstrations. Eisenstein wanted to make an epic (in the manner of Griffith’s Intolerance, 1916), which began with the uprising and ship’s mutiny in St. Petersburg, following Russia’s humiliating defeat in the Russo- Japanese War and the shootings of the demonstrating civilians by the Czar’s officers in front of the Winter Palace. The film would follow a series of events, culminating in the December 1905 crushing of the insurrection in Krasnaya Presnya, a work- ing-class section of Moscow.\nBut the Central Committee wanted a premiere in December 1925, so Eisenstein limited the film to the mutiny of the abused crew of the battleship and the massacre on the Odessa Steps. In his account of the premiere at the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow from Immortal Memories: An Autobiography, Eisenstein confirmed how rushed the whole process was, with the final reel not yet spliced together––even in the projection booth— when the opening section of the film was being projected. “The sequence of the meeting of the squadron was made up of extremely short cuts,” he wrote. “To make sure they would not be lost or get mixed up, I stuck them together by licking them with my tongue, and gave the reel to the assistant to splice. Then I took a look at the first version. Tore it apart. Looked at the second. Tore and changed that one too.”\nTo Eisenstein’s horror, the assistant threaded the film onto the projector with- out cement-splicing the cuts. Miraculously, the film ran through the projector without sputtering into bits. The premiere was a success, and the rest was (rewritten) history.\nEditor’s Note: The restored version of The Battleship Potemkin will screen at the Film Forum in New York in January 2011 and tour throughout the United States, including an engagement in Los Angeles."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:977bfb91-6b67-43d4-b619-f8d740a43b58>","<urn:uuid:8d3928b3-9268-487c-91cf-9b45a3732dcd>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How does regular exercise impact physical health in older adults, and what role do social connections play in their overall wellbeing?","answer":"Regular exercise provides multiple physical health benefits for older adults, including strengthening the immune system against colds and flu, helping manage chronic conditions like arthritis through low-impact activities, improving sleep quality, and maintaining strength needed for independent living tasks. Exercise also helps reduce risks of heart disease and diabetes while potentially improving memory and reducing dementia risk. Meanwhile, social connections are equally crucial for elder health - those with strong social networks show 43% lower disability rates, 70% slower cognitive decline, and are 50% less likely to die compared to socially isolated seniors. Social engagement helps reduce stress responses, strengthens immunity against common illnesses, and promotes better mobility through increased community trust and support.","context":["We hear it all the time - exercise for your health. But how does exercise impact later life? And\nif exercise hasn't ever been a regular routine, why are the retirement years a good time to start?\nThe benefits of exercise are many. It helps reduce stress, manage weight, stabilize blood sugar levels, supports brain and heart health, and the list goes on. Let's look at a few of these in more detail.\nExercise at all times of life, but especially in later life:\n* Benefits the immune system. Colds, the flu and other viruses can be more devastating to older adults whose immune systems are not as strong as they once were. But these germs have less of an impact on those who are exercising.\n* Contributes to independence. Physical activity helps build and maintain strength. Strength is needed for all aspects of independent living - cooking, cleaning, climbing stairs, and carrying groceries to name a few.\n* Manages many different chronic health conditions. Arthritis pain and stiffness can be partially managed by low-impact exercise such as water aerobics, swimming or bicycling. Calories burned during exercise can contribute to a healthy weight, which reduces heart disease and diabetes risks. For those with these conditions, exercise is an important factor in managing the diseases. Exercise may also improve memory and reduce the risk of some types of dementia.\n* Improves sleep quality. Sleep patterns change with age. Many older adults find it difficult to fall asleep or stay asleep. Exercise has helped many to enjoy longer and more restful sleep.\nA well-rounded exercise program targets several areas of strength to provide the greatest benefit. They include:\n* Doctor's approval. Prior to beginning an exercise program, talk to and receive a doctor's clearance.\n* Aerobic. Walking, swimming and low-impact aerobics are examples of aerobic exercise. It strengthens the heart and lungs, improves circulation, increases the red blood count, reduces the incidence of depression, and reduces blood pressure. To gain the greatest benefit from aerobic activity, it should last at least 20 minutes.\n* Flexibility. Flexible joints mean that it's easier to reach items on shelves, tie shoes, drive and much more. When joints are more flexible, they are also stronger. Stretching and yoga are excellent examples of exercises that can help maintain and improve flexibility.\n* Strength. Strength training uses resistance to increase the strength of specific muscle groups. Resistance can be in the form of weights, exercise bands or body weight. Strength training builds and maintains lean muscle mass, which is an important contributor to maintaining independence. Examples include biceps curls, leg extensions, and squats.\n* Balance. Balance training can decrease the risk of falls. Many balance exercises are incorporated into the aerobic or strength training sections of a workout program. They may include standing on one foot, quick stops and starts, walking heel to toe, and walking backward.\nArmed with the \"what\" and \"why\" of later life exercise, the next step is to find resources and programs that fit your personality and can be sustained over time.\nThe National Institute on Aging's \"Exercise and Physical Activity Guide\" is a great place to start. It is a free 120-page guide that provides excellent information about exercise for all ages, but especially for older adults. The chapters include preparing, beginning, and maintaining a good exercise routine. It also includes over 30 pages of sample exercises for strength, flexibility, and balance.\nAnother free National Institute on Aging resource is the \"Go4Life\" DVD. A personal trainer offers tips, motivation, success stories, and sample exercises for a more interactive exercise experience. To order or download these and other National Institute on Aging resources, search the internet for \"national institute on aging exercise.\"\nFor those who prefer a group exercise experience, Kaunoa Senior Centers offer a variety of exercise classes at a very reasonable cost. All classes are included in the Kaunoa newsletter. To receive this newsletter, call 270-7308.\nAnd finally, the Maui County Office on Aging coordinates EnhanceFitness, an ongoing exercise program that meets three times weekly and is designed for adults 50 plus. EF sites are currently operating in Kihei, Spreckelsville, Kahului and Lahaina. For additional information, contact the Maui County Office on Aging at 270-7774.\nThere are many reasons that now is the right time to exercise. But as important as starting a regular exercise routine is maintaining it over time. When exercising stops, the benefits quickly fade away. Decide today to make exercise a part of the rest of your life.\n* Heather Greenwood is with the University of Hawaii Manoa Cooperative Extension, Maui Intergenerational and Aging Programs. Aging Matters will cover topics of interest to the aging Maui community and will appear on the third Sunday of each month.","Social Connections and Healthy Aging\nThis post originally appeared on the NICOA blog.\nThe importance of friends and family to our health is well understood by American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN). Though the specific traditions of tribes, pueblos, nations, and bands can differ quite a bit between one another, we as AI/AN share our respect for, inclusion of, and focus on Elders as a common link between our communities.\nIn today’s culture, many Elders are separated from their communities and therefore from some of this tradition. While we may overlook it, the connections with our families and friends are important to our health and wellbeing as Elders. Research is demonstrating the importance of social interactions to the physical and mental health of Elders, but Elders may face challenges maintaining relationships for a variety of reasons.\nMaking and Maintaining Relationships\nDuring childhood, it is easier to make friends. Many will find their “best friend forever”, but then later take different paths in school, develop new interests, start careers and families, and drift apart from these friends over time. It is even more difficult for Elders, because the process of aging and moving through the stages of life tends to reduce the number of connections we have to other people. Through the aging of our children and their pursuit of goals outside the community and our own changes in careers and retirement, our connections to family, friends, coworkers, and others may weaken over time. In the cycle of life, our own Elders pass themselves, also reducing our connections within the community. In spite of the way time can separate us from others, many still have old friends with whom they have kept in contact with over the years. It is the maintenance of these friendships, along with family and new relationships that can help – or hurt – an Elder’s health. (1)\nHealth Implications of being Connected Socially\nResearch has shown that visiting with friends and family can mean a lot more for Elders than having a good time. Elders who have more of what is known as “social capital” may have better health than those who do not. “Social capital” means the connection, trust, and participation an Elder has with their community. Elders who live in areas where they have high social capital have much better mobility than those who do not, as having trust in the safety of the community and living near neighbors who are willing to help can make them feel safer to walk around and spend time outside of the home.\nElders living in communities with stronger social capital are up to 22% more likely to get screened for diseases at the age recommended by health professionals, as they are also more likely to have better health information and support from other people than those in areas with low social capital. This is thought to be because trust and engagement with others in the community leads to the sharing of health information and knowledge. Those Elders with strong social connections have also been shown to have rates of disability 43% lower than those with weaker social ties. (1)\nIn addition to delaying potential physical decline, Elders who are socially active may also reduce their risk of cognitive decline (knowing, perceiving, problem solving, creativity, thinking, etc.). Researchers found that physical and mental health declined slowly in Elders who had reported:\n- high social involvement which decreased slowly over time, or;\n- moderate social involvement which increased over time.\nHowever, for those Elders who reported low social involvement, their health declined more rapidly. In one study, cognitive decline was 70% faster in those with poor social connections when compared to those with regular social interactions. (1)(2)\nOther research has demonstrated that people exposed to stressful situations have smaller increases in blood pressure, heart rates, and stress-related brain activity when they have a friend or family member along with them for support compared to those who are by themselves facing a stressful situation. Those with strong social networks have even been demonstrated to be less likely to get sick with the common cold than those who have weaker connections to others. (3)\nThe research also leads to a stark conclusion for Elders: Researchers from Brigham Young University and the University of North Carolina have determined that poor social connections can make someone 50% more likely to die than someone with good social connections, a risk of death about the same as that which smokers have when compared to non-smokers. (3)\nWhile not a guarantee, it is clear that social interaction and connections with friends and family are very much an important part of an Elder’s health, even if the exact reasons why are still not yet known and are being researched. But it does seem clear that an Elder surrounded with friends and family is one who is helping to maintain their own health, as well as the health of those around them.\nImproving Social Connections\nFor AI/AN Elders, the community and its traditional events can help keep one engaged with friends and family because of the important role we play in our traditions. For those living outside of traditional communities in the cities or suburbs, however, becoming disconnected from people may be easier. There are a number of different ways in which an Elder can increase their social activity and engagement to help support their own health and that of others.\nOne of the available tools is the internet and computer or smartphone technology. The internet and social networking websites can help Elders to connect with old friends, stay in touch with family, and meet new people. Incredibly, Elders who are active online are 30% less likely to be depressed than those who are not online, so even when distance or circumstance may make it difficult to keep in touch with loved ones, technology can still be beneficial in a real way. Some places to consider visiting online include:\n- Well-known social media sites like Facebook.com, which are easy to use and can help Elders new to computers to become more familiar with the internet. Facebook is best known for connecting family and friends, but it also has social groups based on interests and hobbies as well as groups supporting a cause or political interest. It is the largest social network ever created, with one billion users worldwide.\n- Other websites can help Elders find groups of people with shared interests who hold group meetings and events. Meetup.com is a website used by the young and Elders alike across the world. It can help Elders to find other groups with widely-varying interests in their community or communities nearby to meet new people who share the same hobbies and interests.(4)\nStaying Socially Engaged\nWhile the internet makes it easy to connect with others, there are many ways to connect with others and stay socially active offline too.\n- Community and traditional events are a great way to stay engaged with friends and family, and to help pass on sacred traditions to the young ones.\n- Local resources like libraries and senior and community centers often have fun or educational events that may be of interest. Book clubs, line dancing, financial planning workshops, painting, billiards and board games – there is something for just about everyone!\n- Your local Area Agency on Aging provides free and low-cost meals for Elders. This is a great way to share a meal and converse with others and meet your nutritional needs as well.\n- Volunteering to help a cause is a great way to help other people, the community, and meet others with similar interests. You can reach out to local nonprofit groups, volunteer programs such volunteer match or elder helpers, or national organizations to see if they need help.\n- Hosting events for your friends and family can encourage everyone to come and visit, and have fun.\n1) Suttie, Jill (2014).

{"question":"How do basic outdoor navigation games help develop map skills, and what modern technological alternatives are available for learning navigation?","answer":"Traditional navigation games like the Flag Raid help develop navigation and map skills through practical activities where teams must navigate terrain while capturing flags and avoiding opponents. For modern alternatives, there are GPS devices with digital interfaces and detailed topo maps, as well as smartphone apps like AllTrails that provide access to updated trail information and allow users to build custom maps with waypoints. However, while these tech options offer convenience, they should not be relied upon as the only means of navigation due to their vulnerability to power failures and signal issues.","context":["Traditional & Quality Rover Scouting\nPlaying Card Game No.1\nWhere to play = Anywhere where they can hurtle about, but better if there is some natural cover or places to hide.\nDiscretly remove the same low and high cards from the packs, vary these if you play it again.\nShuffle packs individually.\nDeal one card to each player, note the pack given to what team.\nSend one team out, followed shortly by the next etc.\nRandom play, players run amok and accost any player from another team and demand to see his/her card, the one with the higher card wins and takes the lower card. The losing player returns to base to be dealt a new card from his/her teams pack.\nPatrol Leadership play, PL gets team together and notes cards and values. From this organises tactics such as higher card holders make a direct attack while lower card holders try not to get caught...........\nWinning Team is the one with the most cards from another team.\nPlaying Cards Game 2\nA relatively short game, good filler between program sessions.\nUse as many cards as time and player numbers indicate.\nMake sure the ASL can remember where he/she put them.\nDiscretely place cards around the grounds and or in HQ.\nFor Troops new to obsevation make them obvious.\nFor practiced observers obscure them accordingly.\nOn the word or whistle 'Go' Scouts try and find as many as possible in time allowed.\nPatrol/Team with most cards/highest points is the winner.\nThe Basic Wide Game\nScrounge (buy if pushed) Knitting Wool in various colours.\nIt must be woollen wool, not nylon, or you will have scouts with only one arm intact at the end of the evening.\nTest breaking strength before use.\nDivide Troop into Teams, Patrols are best with points system used to reward positions at end of game.\nFall Troop in, and get heavy and dictate only rough and tumble, no punching/kicking/gouging etc.\nHeavily penalise transgressors.\nSelect a colour per team.\nIssue a short length of wool (a 'Life') per Scout long enough to be tied to the upper left (or right) arm, state at start.\nSend teams into play area.\nTeams tackle each other as they see fit and try to 'kill' an opponent by breaking their wool life.\nOnce a wool life is ripped off that player is 'dead' and out of the game.\n'Dead' players return to base for a new life.\nBase monitor can dictate a penalty time period before fitting new life and letting player back into the game.\nVictors keep broken life.\nAt end of game count lives 'won' to determine team position in game.\nIf you have the manpower and space the game can be played with a seperate base per team.\nWHISTLE COMMANDS FOR GAMES.\nDevise a simple set of whistle signals and ensure all know them, such as;\nOne whistle = Start.\nTwo whistles = Stop play, back to base.\nThree whistles = All back to Hut/master control/campsite, etc.(or emergency, freeze and look to blower for orders)\nAre good to be used at all times, even in the hut/campsite.\nWhistles can be heard above normal din.\nAnd they save a Scouters voice.\nThe Basic Wide Game Level 1. The 'Flag' Raid\nTo be played outside in a wood or area with good cover.\nAs Basic above but a Scouter/Helper per team.\nRolls of hazard tape or large diameter rope or small diameter with 'flags' on so it can be seen.\nA base per team marked by tape or rope of around 8 metres plus in diameter.\nDo not put at throat height.\nDistance between bases to suit terrain, skill and time etc.\nIn centre of base place upright broom handle with suitable pennant attatched (no sharp bits).\nDrums/cones/plastic buckets etc may be used instead of flags.\nTeam/base Scouter inside base with wool lives for his/her team, and a whistle.\nOBJECT OF GAME\nGet all the flags into your base. Success signalled by base Scouter on his/her whistle.\nTeams start at their own base.\nPL decides how to split his/her troops between attackers and defenders.\nNo defenders allowed in base other than to deposit captured flag.\nAttackers once in are safe and can claim one only flag from base Scouter if his/her life is intact.\nNo play if you have lost your life. Return to your base for a new life.\nIf you have a flag and lose your life you have to give it to your attacker.\nCaptured lives can be counted or disregarded, they do like them counted.\nCheating players must be dealt with severely.\nThe Rocket Game\nSame layout as above, but no flags, plus a central area for storing rocket parts at start.\nObjective of game is to assemble a rocket in your base area by obtaining parts from central store and/or from other bases.\nA rocket consists of round plastic drums and traffic cones;\nThree or four drums for its body\nTwo or three drums for its motors\nCones for nose and top of motors\nDrums and motors must be assembled in a 'rocket' shape to win.\nHowever there is only sufficient parts to construct one complete rocket. All others will have one or more parts missing!\nTroop Nights must never ever be anything like school.\nThis makes checking their skill level a bit of a problem.\nScouters have to be very clever and ingenious in assessing without resorting to tests or exams.\nScouting is always a game so we must assess via a game of some sort.\nOne very popular method is The Quarter Masters Stores (or Bosun's, not sure what the air section have).\nKnotting is used in this example.\n'QMs Stores' can be used to assess many skills, map and compass, first aid, pioneering etc etc.\nThis ones just for fun.\nMore than enough round balloons for the total number of players.\nSame number of 1metre/1yard lengths of; Odd wool lengths not used for 'Lives', string etc.\nCan be played on mass or as a inviduals from each Patrol\nIssue each with a balloon and string (reserves for those that burst/lose one).\nOn the command STOMP players try and burst others balloons whilst keeping theirs intact.\nWinner is obvious, but strong control needed as many get carried away.\nFun game but best played once an evening as many are out quickly and sit around bored.\nBored is not allowed in Trad Scouting.\nHorse and Rider Tag\nFun and team work, with verbal input required from Patrols (look behind you!!!).\nPatrols pair up with arrangements made for odd ones.\nOne becomes the horse the other the rider.\nThe rider tucks his/her necker down the back of his/her trousers with most of the necker exposed.\n(Bit dodgy this if the neckers are not marked with names so an alternative is best.\nYou could use the tatty rags normally reserved for triangular bandage practice.\nAn ingenious Scouter makes sure kit has more than one use).\nPairs start in their corners.\nOn the command go they ride into the play area and try to steal other neckers whilst keeping their own.\nRider and Horse are out if they lose their necker.\nYou can use various scoring methods e.g. total captured neeckers, individual round winners, Knockout etc.\nBut remember no bored Scouts.\nI once read that if the Scouts have a favourite game/s only use it/them sparingly!!!!!\nThink about it!\nIt took me a while!\nFor the more involved wide game such as the Flag Raid or Rocket Ship you can also use Bases as prisons.\n'Killed' players must accompany the player, or a person nominated by the player who took their 'Life', back to the 'killers' home base.\nHere they must stay supervised by the Base Scouter until one of their own team complete with life gets in and Tags them for release. They then return to their own base for a life.\nOne or more members of teams are nominated medics. They carry 'x' spare lives and have two tasks;\n1. Get into prisons and fit a new life allowing the repaired Scout to be released by the Base Scouter, however the repaired Scout cannot leave with a flag/whatever.\n2. Roam the field of play repairing 'killed' team mates.\nThere are thousands of these, most can be played in or out after a quick check on the suitability of the ground and shrubbery.\nThey are ideal as a quick in fill, the gap between program sections etc etc.\nMost need a start line and a finish line such as; joints in flooring, chalk marks, painted lines, cones, water drums etc.\nline them up in columns facing the start line.\nGet them to leave a gap between each other.\nOn the 'Go' the back player alternately crawls under the legs and over the backs of the team. At the front they run to the far line and back to their original place.\nThey then pat the back of the next in line who does the same but on return must go over or under the last player to gain their place.\nAnd so on until the front player runs straight to the far line and on his/her return goes over and under the whole team from the back to the front. At that point No1 orders the alert and the team stands quietly. Award points for places.\nA SLIGHTLY TECHNICAL ONE.\nThe Signal Transmitter\n1. A fair bit of small guage electric cable, single or twin core. Scraps will do. Coiled on drums.\n2. A low power flashing/rotating beacon/lamp (signal transmitter). Voltage dependent on battery.\n3. A clock or timer to suit battery voltage.\n4. A pole to put the signal device on top of.\n5. A number of 'booster boxes'. Basically connector blocks/boxes that can be snipped or disconnected without losing bits.\n6 A battery. Those 6 volt ones with the springs on top, they are cheap in builders merchants for lanterns and road markers. 4 will give you 24volts which might be right for that old fork truck red flashing lamp you scrounged.\nAn old car one is ok if it suits your other bits but its heavy and has acid in it.\nIts a simple circuit. Depends on single or twin cable.\nBut its basicaly a battery/batteries feed the lamp and clock through the booster boxes.\nYou can keep the battery and signal pole all together.\nThe booster boxes should be some distance apart.\nThe attackers try and disconnect the booster boxes whilst the defenders try and reconnect them.\nThe clock indicates the time the 'transmitter' is on.\nAny one booster box will of course stop the transmitter and the clock.\nNormal wide game rules.\nTakes a little making and scrounging but adds a certain piquance to a woodland wide game.\nAnd requires a bit more stealth and planning on both sides.\nAdd a Comment","What are the different types of hiking navigation devices?\nWant to Know More about Navigation?\nYou’re in the right place! In this guide, we will be covering the following:\n- The various potential devices on the market\n- The Pros and Cons of Each\n- Our Personal Favorites\nThe term ‘the more the merrier’ is never more apt than when used in reference to the navigational tools we can take with us on our backcountry adventures.\nBut if you’re in any doubt as to which devices deserve their place in your pack and the respective merits of each type, our short guide should help to clear up the confusion.\nHiking Navigational Devices\nMap and Compass\nIf navigational devices were friends, the map and compass combo would be that ever-reliable, trustworthy, life-long gem that we can rely on to be there come what may and when the rest of the crowd have forsaken us.\nLearning to use a map and compass takes a little bit of effort, granted. But this duo of tools are still the first choice of hikers, backpackers, mountaineers, and explorers everywhere owing to their reliability and accuracy. They are, moreover, less susceptible to the various failures—breakage, water damage, dead batteries, system bugs, etc.—that are the main downside of electronic devices.\nWhichever of the navigational devices you choose to carry with you, it’s always a good policy to have a map and compass along for the ride just in case.\nCommercial GPS devices have undergone a number of game-changing improvements since first hitting the market back in the late 1980s.\nThose original, trailblazing versions cost nearly $3,000 and were often only capable of giving a series of coordinates accurate to within a 100-foot radius. Those available nowadays are much more affordable, reliable, and boast a wealth of handy, user-friendly features that let us do a lot more than merely pinpoint our location.\nFurther reading: Interested in purchasing a handheld GPS unit? Then check our guide to the Best Hiking GPS to help you choose the correct one for your needs!\nSome of those features include digital interfaces with detailed topo maps, integrated altimeters, touchscreens, a digital compass, and reliable and accurate satellite positioning. Most models also let you create your own routes pre-trip or access and alter info on the device from a smartphone or computer.\nAnd the downsides? In addition to their expense, GPS devices, like all electronic devices, are susceptible to bugs, power failure, and are far less likely to survive a drop than a map and/or compass.\nOf all the devices on our list, the altimeter is the one that offers its user the least amount of information. In short, and as the name suggests, altimeters only give you a reading of your altitude (elevation above sea level) by using barometric pressure.\nWhile this may seem like a poor return for the hefty whack of $ you might have to shell out to get one, an altimeter is a very handy tool to have along as a backup or to complement your topo map.\nAltimeters can be used in various ways. The most important of these include:\n- pinpointing your exact location by altitude (if, for example, you know you’re on a certain ridge or slope, but not exactly where)\n- breaking your hike into sections or navigating by altitude-based trigpoints\n- ‘contouring’ your way around slopes to avoid dangers above and below\n- calculating trip times by rate of ascent.\nAnd the downsides? Beyond not giving you any notion of your whereabouts barring your elevation, altimeters are also prone to inaccuracy if there are significant changes in atmospheric pressure (i.e. thunderstorms). They also need to be reset fairly frequently to maintain accuracy.\nThis wild-card entry to our list may raise a few eyebrows, but bear with us…\nIn recent years, a number of online and offline map-app resources have begun appearing on the market and are improving almost by the day. As with GPS devices, these shouldn’t be relied upon as your only means of navigation. If you want to navigate quickly and easily, however, apps can be a good option—as long as you have a map and compass along for the trip too.\nBoth apps offer access to updated trail info on tens of thousands of trails in the US and Canada with detailed maps and many features found on top-end GPS devices, such as the ability to build your own map with pre-trip waypoints and on-trail navigation. Both apps also allow you to download and save maps for offline use (though this add-on costs $29.99/year with AllTrails).\nThe downsides? Cell phones are breakable, signals are spotty, rain is ruinous, and yearly subscriptions can be kinda pricey."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:d300bca2-a636-4183-994b-d80300297b9f>","<urn:uuid:1318d3a7-4ae4-4e91-ba7c-6aa46ae3e795>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What was unique about the comet 29P's outburst series in September 2021?","answer":"The September 2021 outburst series was particularly significant, featuring five sequential eruptions over less than two days that made the comet approximately 250 times brighter than before. This was likely the most significant outburst observed since the comet's discovery in 1927.","context":["One of the strangest comets in the solar system has been erupting with unpredictable bright outbursts since late September and nobody knows why. An international observation campaign comprising amateur and professional astronomers alike, and even the famous Hubble Space Telescope, now wants to crack the mystery.\nComet 29P is a mind-boggling object. More than 37 miles (60 kilometers) across, it is one of the largest comets known — about as big as the famous Hale-Bopp that streaked the sky in the 1990s. It is one of only a handful of comets known as Centaurs, which orbit the sun between Saturn and Jupiter, slowly making their way through what astronomers call a gateway, waiting to eventually be flung by Jupiter's gravity closer to the sun (or out of the solar system entirely). And 29P brightens up periodically with powerful eruptions that make it the second most active body in the solar system after Jupiter's moon Io. But why is it erupting? Nobody knows.\nBut despite its curious nature, most observations of Comet 29P until recently came from amateur astronomers.\n\"You can't predict when the comet erupts,\" Richard Miles, an amateur astronomer and former research scientist in hydrocarbon chemistry who is currently the head of the Asteroids and Remote Planets Section of the British Astronomical Association, told Space.com. \"For professional astronomers to get telescope time to do systematic monitoring is quite difficult. But amateurs have their telescopes in their backyards and can observe when they choose to. So professionals cooperating with amateurs on a research like this is the way to go.\"\nOn Sept. 25, just after the full moon, the patient dedication of the devoted group of amateurs was rewarded in the most unexpected way. The comet, located in the constellation Auriga, was quite close to the moon and very faint for proper observations, but five astronomers, based in Utah, Scotland, France and on the Spanish island of Tenerife were watching.\n\"We spotted several sequential eruptions,\" said Miles. \"There were four obvious ones and then a fifth one at the end. After less than two days, the brightness of the comet was something like 250 times brighter than it was before it started becoming active.\"\nThe comet's 'acting out' behavior has been notorious, but its latest performance, Miles said, was probably the most significant observed since the comet's discovery in 1927. The series of outbursts generated a bright nebulous coma, a fuzzy envelope of gas released from the surface that is typical for comets.\nAs the comet's temperamental behavior continued, Miles alerted not only other amateur astronomers, but also professionals. Since the outbursts were so unusual, a group of astronomers based at six U.S. universities managed to obtain some observation time on the Hubble Space Telescope, hoping they might be able to observe the fading coma and learn something about the comet's nature.\n\"This would be the first time that we would catch the aftermath of such a big outburst,\" John Noonan, an astronomy graduate student at the University of Arizona and one of the investigators behind the Hubble proposal, told Space.com. \"The previous times that Hubble looked at Comet 29P, it's been for a smaller outburst. What's happening now is quite unprecedented, at least in the last 40 years.\"\nUnfortunately, the veteran space telescope experienced a technical glitch on Oct. 25 and switched into safe mode, one day before it was supposed to turn its eye to the distant comet. The timing would have been perfect as the comet lit up with yet another outburst on Sunday (Oct. 24).\n\"We think that if Hubble can come back online at the typical timescale that it normally comes back from the safe mode events, we should still be able to get our science and to really crack the nut on this 29P case,\" said Noonan.\nThe astronomers hope that Hubble might be able to distinguish individual pieces of debris ejected during the outbursts and track these objects as they move away from the comet's nucleus.\n\"Hubble will be able to detect objects down to 100 meters [330 feet] in size,\" said Miles. \"So if any fragments have been thrown into space, Hubble will be able to detect them and see them moving.\"\nIf astronomers can follow such fragments, they will be watching the birth of a completely new comet, said Noonan.\nA previous study suggested that the interaction of Comet 29P with the gravity of Jupiter might fling the cosmic ice ball into the inner solar system as early as 2038, turning the Centaur into a Jupiter family comet that comes much closer to the sun. If that was the case, astronomers might be just about to make a key discovery about the processes that help comets make their way from the Kuiper Belt, the repository of space rocks beyond the orbit of Neptune, to Earth.\n\"If there are fragments that are being split off of it in these huge outbursts like the one that happened at the end of September, those fragments may become Jupiter family comets as well,\" said Noonan. \"If there is a process happening in the Centaur region that could fragment incoming Kuiper Belt objects that are Centaurs for this brief period of their dynamical lifetimes, and give us these 100 to 200 meter [330 to 660 feet] size Jupiter family comets, that'd be fascinating.\"\nThe truth is that astronomers know very little about 29P and its strange behavior. Scientists don't even understand why the sudden increase of activity is occurring now. The activity of comets is usually determined by heat from the sun. The closer to the star, the more material from the icy comet vaporizes. But the orbit of Comet 29P is circular, so its distance from the sun barely changes. It should therefore not display very pronounced variations in activity, said Noonan.\nRichard Miles believes that the powerful outbursts observed recently might be a result of complex geological processes taking place inside the comet as well as on its surface.\nIn 2014, the astronomers for the first time detected a mini-outburst on the comet. If the big outbursts, such as the recent ones, could be compared to volcanic eruptions, Miles said, the mini-outbursts are more like geysers. These mini-outbursts, the astronomers have found since, can be observed about 10 to 15 times a year, and the material these geysers shoot off falls back to the comet's surface to form a strong crust.\nThe presence of this crust is what then makes the powerful outbursts explode with such a force, some scientists believe.\n\"It's quite the same thing that happens with volcanoes on Earth,\" said Miles. \"You have molten rock deep down and water that dissolves in it creating water vapor. Then the plug of the volcano is removed like a cork from a champagne bottle, the gas comes out of the liquid magma and you get an eruption.\"\nBut for now, these are theories. Thanks to the renewed scientific excitement for the temperamental Comet 29P, we might soon learn more."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:eff813c2-5658-455a-83d3-ba828b06a878>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the requirements for getting an EB-1 visa? Looking to understand if I qualify! 🤔","answer":"The EB-1 first preference visa is available for three categories of workers: 1) Those with extraordinary ability in sciences, arts, education, business or athletics (EB-1A), 2) Outstanding professors and researchers (EB-1B), and 3) Multinational managers or executives (EB-1C). Specific qualifications apply to each group. For instance, professors/researchers must be pursuing tenure, accepting a tenure-track position, or similar research opportunity at a higher education institution. Multinational managers must have worked at least one of the past three years for a foreign affiliate, subsidiary, parent company, or branch of the proposed U.S. employer.","context":["While the qualifications for an employment-based immigrant visa are generally more stringent than those required for a temporary, non-immigrant visa, there are categories encompassing a wide range of employment types.\nEmployment-based visas are broken out into five preference levels, determined by the desirability of recruiting that particular class of workers to the United States.\nEmployment-Based Visa Preference\nIn some cases, a person hoping to become a permanent legal resident of the United States through an employment-based immigrant visa has the potential to qualify for more than one type of visa. When the would-be immigrant has a choice, there are multiple considerations, including the likelihood of a particular type of petition being approved. However, one key factor to consider is preference.\nPreference is important because having a visa application approved is just the first step. The next is to wait for a visa number to become available and be issued to you. Preference determines how long you are likely to wait before receiving a visa number and the green light to begin working in the United States.\nEmployment-Based Visa Allocation by Preference\nThe first, second and third preference employment-based visa categories are each allocated 28.6% of available employment-based immigrant visas. Unused EB-1 visas spill over to the EB-2 category, and remaining unused first and second preference visas spill over to EB-3. The fourth and fifth preference categories each receive 7.1%.\nAt first glance, it seems as if first, second and third preference visa applicants are treated equally. The critical difference comes into play when the applicant is coming from a country with a high level of employment-based immigrant visa applications. In addition to the annual overall cap and allocation by preference, there is a cap for employment-based immigrants from a particular country. Since EB-1 applicants get first preference for those visas, lower-preference applicants from certain countries may wait a long time to be issued a visa number, even after successfully petitioning.\nTypes of Employment-Based Immigrant Visas\nEB-1 Visas for Priority Workers\nThe EB-1 first preference visa is granted to foreign workers who fall into one of three categories, all highly competitive:\nExtraordinary ability in the sciences, arts, education, business or athletics (EB-1A)\nOutstanding professors and researchers (EB-1B)\nMultinational managers or executives (EB-1C)\nSpecial qualifications apply to each of the above groups. For example, a professor or researcher seeking an EB-1B visa must be relocating to pursue tenure, accept a tenure-track position or pursue a similar research opportunity at an institution of higher education. Similarly, an EB-1C visa applicant must have worked at least one of the past three years for a foreign affiliate, subsidiary, parent company or branch of the proposed U.S. employer.\nThe EB-2 second preference visa is issued to two types of workers:\nProfessionals with advanced degrees\nIndividuals with exceptional abilities in the arts, sciences or business\nAn EB-2 visa applicant must have a job offer, and a labor certification is required.\nThe third preference EB-3 visa is issued to the following types of workers:\nSkilled workers, meaning that a minimum of two years of training is required; the work must also not be temporary or seasonal in nature\nProfessionals with at least a U.S. baccalaureate degree or foreign equivalent\nOther workers, meaning unskilled labor requiring less than two years of training or experience; the work must not be temporary or seasonal\nUSCIS warns that, while the requirements for the EB-3 visa are less stringent, wait times can be long. That is especially true for those applying under the “other workers” category.\nEB-4 Special Immigrant Visas\nEligibility for an EB-4 visa is limited to workers of certain specific types, including religious workers, members of the armed forces, broadcasters and Afghan and Iraqi petitioners who translated for or otherwise assisted U.S. troops overseas.\nDepending on the circumstances, an employer may be required to petition on your behalf or you may be entitled to file your own visa petition.\nTalk to an Immigration Lawyer\nIf you’re considering seeking a green card through the employment-based visa process, a knowledgeable guide can be your best resource.

{"question":"What is the maximum number of members allowed in a Close Corporation, and who can be a member?","answer":"A Close Corporation can have a minimum of one member and a maximum of ten members. Only natural persons or Trusts can be members of a Close Corporation.","context":["Article by listed Attorney: Nanika Prinsloo\nAlthough one cannot register a new Close Corporation after 1 May 2011 anymore, there are still plenty of people who own and operate Close Corporations. It is not uncommon to find persons who own a Close Corporation who don’t understand how a Close Corporation really works.\nWe give you a series of articles on the inside workings of a Close Corporations: what is important, what is not, what are the tax implications, how does a Close Corporation come to an end, what is an Association Agreement and a few other topics such as The Liability of CC Members.\nThis article will explain in general how a Close Corporation works.\nA Close Corporation is a legal entity with its own persona. To have its own persona means that, although it is not an individual person, it can act as if it is a person and certain rights and obligations are conferred to it, seperate from its members, from the moment it is registered. A Close Corporation is registered in terms of the Close Corporations Act 69 of 1984.\nA Close Corporation has members and a Company has shareholders and directors. The Close Corporation has its own estate seperate from its members. (An estate consists of all the assets i.e. cash, movables, building, vehicles, investments, debts, liabilities, everything that a person or an entity owns.) The debt of the Close Corporation belongs to the Close Corporation and the debt of the members that they incur in their personal capacities is not the debt of the Close Corporation as well, it remains their own debt seperate from the Close Corporation.\nIt offen happens that a member signs surety for the debt of the Close Corporation. If the Close Corporation does not pay its debt, then the suretyship will be called up and the member will have to pay the debt of the Close Corporation. That will only happen if the member signed surety for the debt of the Close Corporation. If the member did not sign debt then he/she will not be liable to pay the debt of the Close Corporation.\nA Close Corporation has members. It can have only one member or it can have up to ten, and no more than ten, members.\nThe members of a Close Corporation can be either a natural person, or a Trust.\nWe mentioned in the beginning of this article that no new Close Corporations can be registered after 1 May 2011. That only pertains to new Close Corporations, as Close Corporations that were registered before that date, carries on as usual and will carry on indefinitely or until it is liquidated or if the members decide to close it down, or in short: until it is deregistered for whatever reason. Originally the government said that they want to phase out Close Corporations altogether, and only have Companies as entities. The idea was that Close Corporations keep on running for the next ten years after 1 May 2011, whereafter all Close Corporations would be converted to Private Companies. The new Companies Act of 2008 was promulgated and at the moment companies are registered in terms of the new Act. Nowadays Companies are not as difficult to manage as it used to be and the requirements are less. Whether Close Corporations are going to be phased out after ten years or not will have to be seen and until new leglistation is promulgated in this regard, Close Corporations will exist indefinitely.\nClose Corporations can be converted into Private Companies at any time. Let’s look closer at how that works.\nWe mentioned above that a Close Corporation can convert into a private company at any time. This conversion will take place in terms of the Companies Act of 2008 and the Close Corporation must comply with the following requirements before it can convert itself into a company:\na) At least 75% of the members who hold an interest in the Close Corporation must confirm in a written statement that it approves of the conversion;\nb) There must be a Memorandum of Incorporation; (each company must have one)\nc) The prescribed filing fee must be paid.\nd) The prescribed forms must be completed.\nThe Close Corporation is thereafter converted by completing forms and filing the conversion documents with the CIPCO, where the conversion is registered.\nA Close Corporation is a seperate legal entity and must register for Income Tax and can register for VAT.\nOnce a Close Corporation is registered and it does not hand in tax returns, the Close Corporation is automatically deregistered by SARS. If your Close Corporation is dormant, but you want to keep it as a vehicle for when you need it, it is imporant to lodge tax returns religiously, otherwise it will be deregistered and you won’t be able to use it.\nIf there is more than one member, the single most imporant document for the Close Corporation is the Association Agreement. The Association Agreement is the agreement in which the members’ rights and obligations towards each other and towards the Close Corporation, percentage of membership and everything that pertains to the agreements made between the members is regulated. It can be very problematic if there is no Association Agreement and the members are upset with each other.\nThe Association Agreement is preferably signed before the Close Corporation is registered, but can be drafted and signed afterwards. If you have a Close Corporation and there is more than one member and no Association Agreement, take this free advice and arrange for an Association Agreement to be drafted and signed immediately, to avoid future problems. If one of the members dies, it is imperative that there is an Association Agreement that makes provision for what will happen in such an instance. It is also advisable that each member leaves his/her membership in his/her will to the remaining members or sell it to them in a buy and sell agreement.\nIf a member dies, his/her membership in the Close Corporation will devolve in terms of his/her will if there is no Association Agreement or buy-and-sell agreement in place. This can mean that the remaining members can end up with a family member or person they did not want as member or do not like. Even worse, if there is no buy-and-sell agreement in place, and no policy taken out for this,, the remaining members can end up having to borrow money to buy out the deceased member’s membership in the Close Corporation and this can cause a cash flow problem for the remaining members.\nA Close Corporation comes to an end when :\na) The members agree to end it\nb) The Close Corporation is liquidated\nc) The final end is when it is deregistered.\nWhere the members decide to close down the Close Corporation, all the debts will be settled, the bank accounts closed, the assets sold and staff retrenched. It is very important that the last tax return for the Close Corporation is handed in to SARS (South African Revenue Services) and that SARS is advised that the Close Corporation will be deregistered. The income tax and VAT numbers at SARS must also be deregistered as soon as SARS has given an approval for the deregistration (meaning that there are no outstanding taxes). All creditors must be informed as well and settled. Once all this is done, the Close Corporation can be registered.\nIf the Close Corporation is insolvent and it has to be liquidated it will be deregistered as soon as the final liquidation order has been granted by the High Court.\nA Close Corporation can also be placed under business rescue if it experiences financial problems, to try and nurse it back to a solvent state.\nAs soon as CIPCO has completed the deregistered, the Close Corporation has ended.\nRead our other articles about Close Corporations for more information.\nThis article was written by Nanika Prinsloo of Prinsloo and Associates Attorneys and Conveyancers.\nCell: 072 8558 106"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"advanced_reasoning"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:ddc02a8e-bdcd-4c5a-b9fc-e7c1011ebe0d>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the maintenance needs of daylilies during summer in Tennessee and South Carolina - are they equally hardy?","answer":"Daylilies are equally hardy and low-maintenance in both Tennessee and South Carolina. They are drought tolerant, immune to heat stress, and grow well in both full sun and partial shade in both states. They require minimal care, though they perform best with consistent watering during budding and flowering. In both regions, they are tolerant of most soils and can survive flooding and drought conditions. While fertilizer isn't essential, they benefit from light fertilization, particularly with moderate nitrogen and higher rates of phosphorous and potash.","context":["It’s summertime, and the livin’ is easy…\n...at least, it’s easy when you’ve made smart plant selection choices for your landscape!\nNo one wants to spend their summer doing more chores than necessary. So unless you really enjoy spending time coddling finicky plants, it makes sense to choose low maintenance and drought tolerant species and varieties.\nThey’ll allow you to enjoy your landscape with minimal fuss. And they’ll save you a ton on your summer water bill as well.\nThe following five perennial plant species are ones that we have found to be especially suited to thrive in Tennessee’s climate and soil conditions with a minimum of input on your part. They are our top picks for an easy-breezy summer landscape.\nOur top 5 drought tolerant, low maintenance landscape plants for the Memphis area.\nDaylilies (Hemerocallis spp.)\nBlooming from May through August, these ever-popular landscape plants come in a huge variety of colors and sizes, ranging from under 6” to over three feet in height.\nThey are especially prized for their vibrant displays of color in the first part of the summer.\nDaylilies are extremely versatile. Use short varieties for borders, and taller ones as accent plants or in large beds for a wide swath of color in the landscape.\nSome varieties, such as the golden yellow Stella D'oro, will provide multiple bloom opportunities throughout the season.\nPlant these low maintenance plants in full sun to partial shade — they’re not picky!\nPurple Coneflower (Echinacea purpurea)\nWell known as an immune boosting herb, Echinacea is also a beautiful and hardy bedding plant. Because it is native to our area, it thrives in the garden with very little maintenance.\nThe original wildflower has purple petals with a gold center, and this is still the most common cultivar.\nHowever, a whole rainbow of other color varieties are now also available, some with exotic-looking double blooms. Plant them in full sun to light shade.\nPurple coneflowers grow up to 47” tall.\nEnjoy these low maintenance plants in your Tennessee landscape from June through August. They make great cut flowers, too!\nRudbeckia (Rudbeckia spp.)\nPerhaps better known by its common name, Black-Eyed Susan, the classic Rudbeckia sports deep golden orange-yellow petals that contrast strikingly with a deep black center.\nLike Echinacea, the plant has since been bred into many colorful varieties, some with striking multi-colored petals.\nWe especially love the sunny yellow variety called ‘Goldstrum’ for landscaping purposes.\nGoldstrum grows about 23”-29” with a spread of one to two feet.\nThis drought tolerant plant in full sun to partial shade and blooms mid summer through August.\nButterfly bush (Buddleia davidii)\nAnother colorful addition to your Memphis summer landscape, the Butterfly Bush is a deciduous shrub with very large (up to 12” long), showy, fragrant flower panicles that of course attract butterflies.\nIt also is available in many color varieties. One of our favorites, 'Black Knight,' is a striking deep purple that contrasts beautifully with the flowers listed above.\nThe Butterfly Bush makes an attractive accent plant, growing 6-10 feet tall and up to 10 feet wide. One caution: this low maintenance plant can become invasive, so take care to plant it where it can’t escape!\nButterfly bush blooms from June through September in Memphis.\nChaste Tree (Vitex angus castus)\nThis native of central Asia can be grown as a small tree or pruned to a large shrub. Left to its own devices it will grow up to 20 feet tall with a spread of 10-15 feet.\nIts multiple trunks give it a spreading habit and lend interest to the winter landscape.\nWith its showy purple panicle blooms, Vitex is a real showstopper in the landscape, as well as an excellent food source for butterflies and bees.\nPlant it in full sun, and make sure the soil is well-drained — this little drought tolerant plant hates wet feet! (That’s one reason it’s so easy to take care of - it thrives on very little water.)\nThe chaste tree blooms from July through August.\nFind More Drought Tolerant Plants For Your Memphis Property\nOf course, this is just a small sampling of the many easy-care plants that do well in Tennessee and the mid-south.\nIf you are looking for more low maintenance plants, you can’t go wrong to explore the many wonderful native varieties that are now available in nurseries. Not only are native plants typically low-maintenance, but they also are important food sources for our native pollinators and other wildlife.\nHowever, if you don’t find native plants you like, don’t despair. Remember that one of the keys for successful Xeriscaping (landscaping with minimal or no irrigation) is not as much a plant’s place of origin but the type of climate that it is native to in the wild.\nIf its native climate is similar to ours, or slightly drier, it will probably do well here.\nIf you have any questions about planting an easy-care landscape, or would like suggestions for additional species that we have found are well suited to Memphis growing conditions, feel free to give us a call at 901-755-3207","Prepared by Karen Russ, HGIC Horticulture Specialist, and Bob Polomski Extension Consumer Horticulturist, Clemson University (New 06/99. Images added 05/09.)\nDaylilies are many gardeners' favorite plants. They are dependable perennials, they are prolific and colorful bloomers, and they are relatively free of pests. Daylilies are tolerant of drought and flooding, immune to heat stress, tolerant of most soils and grow well in full sun or light shade. They grow well in all areas of South Carolina.\n'Happy Returns' is a classic yellow daylily\nKaren Russ, ©2008 HGIC, Clemson Extension\nDaylilies can range in height from 8 inches to 5 feet, and flower size can be as small as 2 inches or as large as 8 inches.\nDaylilies may bloom the year that they are planted, even from a relatively small plant. They will reach mature size in about three to four years. Daylilies are long-lived if given even moderate care.\nDaylilies are grown for their flowers in a rainbow of colors, and many shapes and sizes. There are daylilies in bloom from late spring until autumn. Individual flowers last only one day but since each plant produces many buds, the total blooming time of a well-established clump may be 30 to 40 days. Many varieties have more than one flowering period\n'Stella de Oro' is one of the best known reblooming daylilies.\nJoey Williamson, ©2008 HGIC, Clemson Extension\nDaylilies are little troubled by diseases and pests. The most common disease problem is daylily leaf streak. Thrips, spider mites, aphids, slugs and snails are the main pests of daylilies. For more information see HGIC 2102, Daylily Diseases & Insect Pests.\nDaylilies are used for color in shrub borders and in perennial beds. They are excellent ground covers on slopes. Their roots will hold soil against erosion once established. Small cultivars can be planted in containers.\nDaylilies grow best in direct sun or light shade. Darker-colored cultivars should be protected from strong afternoon sun that may fade the petals.\nDaylilies prefer slightly acid (pH 6 to 6.5) well-drained soil with plenty of organic matter. They are however, very tolerant and will grow in almost any soil except poorly drained soils. If drainage is a problem, plant daylilies in raised beds.\nThe best time to plant daylilies is during early fall or early spring when soil temperatures are moderate. Daylilies will tolerate planting during any time of year. Plant daylilies 18 to 24 inches apart. Set the plant so that the crown (the point where roots and foliage meet) is no deeper than 1 inch below the surface of the soil.\nWater plants thoroughly after planting, and continue to deep soak them at least weekly until established. Although daylilies are drought-tolerant once established, consistent watering while budding and flowering produces better-quality flowers.\nDaylilies usually grow adequately without fertilizer but grow best when lightly fertilized. They prefer moderate nitrogen and higher rates of phosphorous and potash. Slow-release fertilizers are best for daylilies. Put down fertilizer in the early spring just as new growth commences, and again in midsummer. Make sure that the soil is moist whenever applying fertilizer. Mulch helps to conserve moisture in the soil and control weeds.\nDaylilies grow rapidly to form dense clumps. Division is not essential but may revitalize flowering if the plants have become crowded. Division is the usual way to increase your supply of daylilies. Dividing is usually done following flowering, but plants will tolerate division throughout the entire growing season.\nLift the entire clump or cluster out of the soil with a garden fork. To separate a clump into individual fans (sections with a set of roots and leaves), shake the clump to remove as much soil as possible, then work the roots of individual fans apart.\nDaylilies look best if given some grooming through the year. During winter, remove any rotted or damaged foliage from around evergreen daylilies. Remove spent blooms and seedpods after summer flowering to improve appearance and encourage rebloom. When all the flowers on a scape (the daylilies' flowering stalk) are finished, cut off the scape close to ground level. Remove dead foliage from daylilies as they die back in the fall.\nThere are thousands of named cultivars of daylilies. Because of the variety of daylilies available, they have developed a language of their own. This glossary should help you find your way through the daylily description jungle.\nSelf: The flower is the same color throughout. The stamens and throat may be different.\nBlend: The flower is a blend of two or more colors.\nPolychrome: The flower segments have an intermingling of three or more colors.\nBitone: The petals and sepals differ in shade or intensity of the same basic color.\nBicolor: The petals and sepals are different colors.\nEyed or Banded: The flower has an area of different or darker color (called a zone) between the throat and the tips of the flower. It is an Eye if the zone occurs on both the petals and the sepals. It is a Band if the zone occurs only on the petals. It is a Halo if the zone is faint or only lightly visible. It is a Watermark if the zone is a lighter shade that the rest of the flower.\nEdged or Picoteed: The edges of the flower segments are either lighter or darker than the segment color.\nMidrib: The center vein of each flower segment. May be different in color from the rest of the segment.\nDiamond Dusting: The flower has a sparkling or glistening appearance as if sprinkled with gold, silver or tiny diamonds.\nFlower Form: Daylily blooms have a wide array of different forms. These include:\nCircular:The flower appears round. Segments often overlap, giving a full appearance.\nTriangular: When viewed from the front of the bloom, the flower segments form a triangle.\nStar: The flower shape looks like a three-pointed or six-pointed star.\nRuffled: There are ruffles along the flower edges.\nRecurved: The flower flares, and petals roll under.\nTrumpet: The flower form resembles a true lily.\nSpider: Flowers with very narrow petals and a spider-like form.\nSpider form daylily flowers have narrow petals\nKaren Russ, ©2008 HGIC, Clemson Extension\nDouble: This form has more than six segments. The extra segments may appear as a tuft in the middle of the flower. They may appear as two blooms in one or a hose-in-hose effect (like some azaleas).\nMiniature: Flowers less than 3 inches in diameter.\nSmall: Flowers from 3 inches up to 4 ½ inches in diameter.\nLarge: Flowers 4 ½ inches and over in diameter.\nLow: The scapes are from 6 to 24 inches high.\nMedium: The scapes are from 24 to 36 inches high.\nTall: The scapes are more than 36 inches high.\nNocturnal: These daylilies open late in the afternoon, and remain open all night. Most daylilies are only open during the day.\nExtra Early (EE): Varies from March on the coast to early May in the upper Piedmont and mountains.\nEarly (E): Three to five weeks prior to the mass of bloom at midseason.\nEarly Midseason (EM): One to three weeks before the height of bloom of most cultivars.\nMidseason (M): This ranges from May on the coast to June in the mountains.\nLate Midseason (LM): One to three weeks after the height or peak of bloom in your garden.\nLate (L): Four to six weeks after the peak of the season.\nVery Late (VL): These daylilies are the last to bloom in late summer or early fall.\nRebloomer (Re): These daylilies bloom more than once during a single season.\nEverblooming: These daylilies bloom repeatedly through the summer and may have very little or no time between flushes of bloom.\nDormant: The leaves of these daylilies die completely back as winter approaches.\nEvergreen: These daylilies retain their leaves throughout the year. In mild climates, the leaves of evergreens remain green all winter.\nSemi-Evergreen: This is an intermediate classification.\nIn general, evergreen types will do better in hot climates with very mild winters and dormant types prefer colder areas. Both types will grow in South Carolina.\nTetraploid:These daylilies have twice the normal number of chromosomes. They have larger flowers than most daylilies. Colors are often more intense. Scapes tend to be sturdier and stronger.\nDiploid: These daylilies are considered by some to be more graceful in form. Spider and double daylilies are more commonly diploid. Diploid flowers though usually smaller are also more numerous per plant. There are more diploid daylilies than tetraploids.\nHybridizers have made great improvements in daylilies. The only colors originally were yellow, orange and a brassy reddish color. The daylily color range now includes palest lemon, bright yellow and gold, orange, scarlet, carmine, maroon, wine-reds, pale pink, rose, lavender, lilac, grape, and melon. Whites and blues are the only colors still unavailable in daylily flowers. Near-whites are found among the palest tints of yellow, pink, lavender or melon.\nWhen choosing daylily cultivars, consider that light-colored flowers show up better at a distance than darker ones. Dark-colored varieties look better when planted against a light backdrop.\nThe following cultivars are just a few of the thousands that do well in the South. The Stout Medal is the highest award given to superior quality daylilies.\n'Gental Shepherd' daylily\nThe Dow Gardens Archive, Dow Gardens, www.insectimages.org\n'Little Grapette' daylily\nThe Dow Gardens Archive, Dow Gardens, www.insectimages.org\nSeveral other species of daylilies are also popular in South Carolina. Although Tawny Daylily is seen everywhere and is virtually indestructible, it can not be recommended for most gardens. It is a bit too indestructible and is able to spread far too rapidly. The species below are well-behaved, graceful plants.\nLemon Lily (Hemerocallis flava, H. lilioasphodelus): Lemon yellow fragrant flowers on tall scapes open at dusk and fill the garden with their sweet perfume.\nTall Daylily (H. altissima): Very slender bloom stalks stand 4 to 5 feet tall with many small flowers. It blooms very late in the summer. An excellent old cultivar is 'Autumn Prince.'\nCitron Lily (H. citrina): This sweetly lemon-scented species blooms at night. It grows about 3 feet tall and is a strong, vigorous plant.\nThere are many, many more daylilies for you to choose from; these are just a small sampling.

{"question":"What are the genetic characteristics of rainbow trout and steelhead populations, and how do fish passage experts address migration barriers for different species?","answer":"Research shows that rainbow trout and steelhead share remarkable genetic characteristics, with genes associated with anadromy persisting even in populations with little or no ocean access, suggesting behavioral plasticity is hard-wired into their DNA. They can occur in sympatry, interbreed, and both forms can produce progeny that are either freshwater residents or anadromous. To address migration barriers, fish passage experts from state agencies, federal agencies, and non-governmental organizations work through the Fish Passage Working Group to improve passage of diadromous species. They have developed policies on passage efficiency and guidance documents for upstream fish passage, including specific guidelines for species like American eel. The group also works on FERC licensing projects and utilizes tools like the Northeast Aquatic Connectivity Project to prioritize fish passage projects.","context":["Oncorhynchus mykiss is perhaps the most popular freshwater sport fish in the United States. The geographic distribution of native Oncorhynchus mykiss within the lower 48 states is limited to a handful of states along and adjacent to the west coast — California, Oregon, Washington, and Idaho, although it extends south to Baja California and north to British Columbia and Alaska. It is artificially propagated by federal and state fish and game agencies and in private aquaculture for game fishing purposes in hundreds of hatcheries and is now established in all of the 48 lower states, at least 45 countries, and every continent except Antarctica. Fly-fishing enthusiasts who live east of the Rockies might be surprised to know that the pan-size rainbow trout stocked in streams and rivers in diverse circumstances east of the Rocky Mountains are the very same species as the 20-pound steelhead that returning to spawn in rivers and streams along the west coast after several years out in the Pacific Ocean. An artificial line has been drawn by federal regulators between rainbow trout on the one hand and steelhead on the other that is inconsistent with our contemporary understanding of the species – a species that exhibits a dizzying array of life histories and astounding ecological and behavioral plasticity. For that reason, the time is ripe for the National Marine Fisheries Service to re-assess its approach to conserving populations of Oncorhynchus mykiss.\nThe diverse and complex life history of Oncorhynchus mykiss is thought to reflect evolutionary adaptation to highly variable environmental conditions, including extended drought, wildfires, floods, and dynamic habitat conditions in both freshwater and the ocean. The life histories exhibited by rainbow trout and steelheadchallenge conservation planners and resource managers. They include (i) individuals that spend their entire lives in freshwater rivers, streams, and lakes — those are typically referred to as resident rainbow trout; (ii) individuals that spawn in streams with juveniles migrating to lakes where they grow to maturity; and (iii) individuals that migrate to the ocean as juveniles that either mature in the ocean before returning to freshwater to spawn or mature only after they return to freshwater where they then spawn – those are typically referred to as steelhead. Notably progeny of a single mother fish can exhibit both a resident rainbow trout life history and an anadromous steelhead life history, nonetheless, those offspring can be morphologically identical through the juvenile rearing stage.\nThe construction of dams on most river systems up and down the west coast along with other human activities, including harvest of the species, hatchery effects, land and water resource development, and land uses that degrade aquatic habitat — including land reclamation and levee construction — all have contributed to reductions in coastal populations of Oncorhynchus mykiss. Freshwater hydrology, ocean-rearing conditions, and predation by native and introduced fish and wildlife also effect habitat suitability and the numbers of Oncorhynchus mykiss. The abundance of ocean-going steelhead has declined substantially over the past century. The diminished steelhead fisheries led the National Marine Fisheries Service in 1997 to issue a final rule listing five evolutionarily significant units (or ESUs) — genetically and ecologically distinct demographic units — of west coast steelhead as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). At the time of the listings the agency stated that “[f]ew detailed studies have been conducted regarding the relationship between resident and anadromous Oncorhynchus mykiss and as a result, the relationship between these two life forms is poorly understood” (Federal Register 62:43,937-43,954). The Service limited the listing to just steelhead populations or runs, the anadromous life form of the species.\nIn the intervening decades, research has made clear that the distinction between anadromous and freshwater forms of Oncorhynchus mykiss is more of human conceptualization of complex and vexing life-history responses to environmental conditions than a true reflection of the fish’s adaptations to diverse and dynamic landscapes. The mechanistic basis for the wide array of rainbow trout and steelhead morphs and behaviors can only be guessed at. Recent studies address the subject — Anadromy and residency in steelhead and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss): a review of the processes and patterns, which appeared in the Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences in 2015 and Life history diversity in Klamath River steelhead published in Transactions of the American Fisheries Society in 2016. Those articles reinforce earlier analyses indicating that rainbow trout and steelhead can and do occur in sympatry — that is, they can occur in the same place at the same time. They also document the fact that rainbow trout and steelhead can and do interbreed. The investigations confoundingly found that rainbow trout can produce progeny that are both freshwater residents and anadromous ones, and that steelhead can do the same. In fact, Oncorhynchus mykiss can exhibit dozens of distinct life histories, reflecting an adaptive capacity to respond to a wide breadth of landscape conditions and water bodies and stream courses and the dizzying array of environmental conditions associated with them. The fish’s genetic and behavioral plasticity expressed in dramatically varying life history patterns in response to environmental influences, explains the success of the species. Research shows, remarkably, that the genes associated with anadromy often persist in populations with little access or no access at all to the ocean, indicating that behavioral plasticity may be hard-wired into the species’ DNA.\nAt this point, the existing Oncorhynchus mykiss populations listed under the ESA include only those individuals that exhibit anadromy and that occur below the lowest impassable barriers to their migration (see Federal Register 71:833-862). But, as the Service explains in its 2006 final rule retaining 10 populations of west coast steelhead on the list of threatened or endangered species, the agency presumes all Oncorhynchus mykiss that occur in streams where listed steelhead occur are protected from take under the ESA, irrespective of whether they are resident or anadromous fish, and whether they are categorized as trout or steelhead. At the same time, the Service presumes that resident Oncorhynchus mykiss in steams in which anadromous Oncorhynchus mykiss occur do not contribute to the viability of the anadromous population. Such determinations by the Service have implications that extend well beyond listing decisions to critical habitat designations, consultations, and habitat conservation planning efforts that pertain to the protected populations. In those contexts, agency determinations based on an equivocal understanding of the uniqueness, size, and viability of the constituent demographic unit – thus the risk and implications of an extirpation or extinction event — can have substantial societal implications; for example, complicating flood control, land use planning, water supply projects, and other activities in and adjacent to coastal streams and rivers. Whereas the plasticity exhibited by Oncorhynchus mykiss indicates the species can be expected to exist and persist in varied environmental conditions, the listing of numerous ESUs suggests that Oncorhynchus mykiss cannot persist without prohibitions and protections, which can contribute to a burdensome regulatory regime, which in some cases has included actions that are not necessary to conserve the species.\nThe time is ripe for the National Marine Fisheries Service to re-assess its approach to conserving Oncorhynchus mykiss in light of the best available scientific information, some of it advancing a new and provocative understanding of the species. Analyses conducted since the 2006 rule contribute to clarifying distinctions among populations of the species, including distinctions based on barriers to passage and between resident and anadromous fishes. The studies highlight the varied life history strategies that the species has evolved to survive under multifarious environmental conditions. A pro-active, rigorous approach to conservation of Oncorhynchus mykiss and other listed species, informed by the best available scientific information, is essential to ensure that the Service is expending its limited resources on the species, subspecies, and distinct population segments that are most in need of protection.","River herring moving up a fish ladder in Weymouth, Massachusetts. Photo courtesy of George Loring.\nHundreds of thousands of artificial barriers have been constructed along the Atlantic coast to impound and redirect water for irrigation, flood control, electricity, recreation, drinking water, and transportation—all altering the natural features of rivers and streams. Fisheries managers and scientists, stakeholders, and the public at large have become increasingly concerned about the effects of barriers on fish and other aquatic species. Many barriers are obsolete and no longer serve their original purpose. These barriers often create impediments to fish migration, which is fundamental to the life history of diadromous species. As a result, some fish populations have significantly declined over their historical range.\nThe Commission is particularly concerned about the migrations of Atlantic sturgeon, American shad, hickory shad, alewife, blueback herring, and striped bass to their spawning habitat, as well as access to the long-term growth areas for American eel. Without access to these habitats, it will be very difficult to restore populations of these very important diadromous species.\nIn response to the growing recognition of and concerns about barrier impacts on diadromous species, the Commission organized the Workshop on Fish Passage Issues Impacting Atlantic Coast States in April 2008. The workshop consisted of presentations and discussions by fish passage experts on common designs for fish passage, experiences with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s (FERC) hydropower dam relicensing process, experiences with fish passage and dam removal at non-hydropower dams, and case studies dealing with fish passage.\nA working group of fish passage experts from state agencies, federal agencies, and non-governmental organizations was established in 2009 to see these tasks through and improve passage of diadromous species managed by the Commission. The Fish Passage Working Group convenes as needed to discuss developments in fish passage and promote critical thinking to mitigate the negative effects of fish passage on diadromous species. Major accomplishments of these meetings include development of a policy (see sidebar) on passage efficiency for diadromous fishes and a guidance document identifying effective approaches to upstream fish passage. The Working Group’s recent efforts have focused on the unique challenges of fish passage for American eel, the only catadromous species managed by the Commission. A report outlining guidelines on upstream eelway design can be found here.\nWorking to restore fish passage, both upstream and downstream of barriers, is an evolving field that requires continued collaboration. Fish passage in FERC licensing and relicensing projects is a major concern of the Commission, with the Fish Passage Working Group developing a guidance document to promote the states’ involvement in these projects. The Nature Conservancy’s Northeast Aquatic Connectivity Project is being utilized by jurisdictions in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic as a means to prioritize fish passage projects. The Fish Passage Working Group will continue monitoring the expansion of this project to the Southeast states as a potentially valuable tool to prioritize fish passage projects along the Atlantic coast.\nJeff Kipp, Fish Passage Working Group Coordinator\nSteve Gephard, Chair Fish Passage Working Group"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:57608b88-5e1b-433c-9e49-ac9bdda79144>","<urn:uuid:a1d2bde3-d4c9-4cc5-b589-a2f4260ad229>"],"error":null}
{"question":"When was Bernard Haitink involved with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, and how did its sound compare to Mitropoulos' early performance venues? 🎭","answer":"Bernard Haitink served as a principal conductor of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, during which time he helped change the orchestra's sound to become darker and more European, moving away from the bright brass sound established under Georg Solti. In contrast, Mitropoulos' early performances took place in more modest venues - first at his home in Old Phaleron in 1913, and later at the Athens Royal Theatre in 1917.","context":["Dimitri Mitropoulos (1896-1960)\nUn morceau de concert for violin and piano (1911/13;)\nScore and part\nPublished in collaboration with the Gennadius Library\nPages: 13 score + 4 violin part\nScore designing and editing: Yannis Samprovalakis\nForeword: Ioannis Fulias\nEnglish translation: Helena Grigorea\nGraphic design: Antonis Kapiris\nThe work Un morceau de concert, for violin and piano, holds a special place in the oeuvre of Dimitri Mitropoulos, as it is his oldest existing chamber music composition. However, the scanty information that we possess on this piece is rather vague and comes almost exclusively from a manuscript title page that was added at a later date to the neatly copied (in ink) but undated autograph score of the work. There, the original German title – Conzert-Stück – is rendered in French, accompanied by the composer’s initials, the date 1913, and, above all, an interesting reference to the first performance of this piece, according to which it took place at NewPhaleron, on 22 March (Old Style) / 4 April (New Style Calendar) 1913, with Armand Marsick (violin), who was Mitropoulos’ teacher at the Athens Conservatoire at the time, and the young composer (piano). However, it seems more likely that this private musical performance should have taken place at Mitropoulos’ home in Old Phaleron, while the authentic reference to Old Style and New Style Calendar (which was established in Greece as late as 1923) suggests that this precious yet obviously cursory note must have been made long after the artistic event itself.\nMoreover, recent researches indicate that this same work was performed again by Mitropoulos and his friend, the famous violinist Georgios Efstathiou-Lykoudis, at a public concert given on 18 February / 3 March 1917 at the Athens Royal Theatre and consisted exclusively of compositions by Dimitri Mitropoulos, this time under the title Sonata in C minor and bearing the date 1911. It seems, therefore, that the compositional process of the work in question, which is not recorded at all in the manuscript sources kept in the Dimitri Mitropoulos Archive of the Gennadius Library (the final copy of the score for violin and piano as well as a violin part), might well be moved from 1913 back to 1911, since it is reasonable to assume that the work underwent several phases of development and successive revisions before taking its final form.\nIn any case, Mitropoulos’ Un morceau de concert reflects, among other things, a fruitful attempt by the budding Greek composer to blend elements of European art music and local musical tradition. To this end, the typically romantic idiom of the work, expressed either through pure lyricism (as in the opening of the middlesection, where the sensitive style of ‘salon music’ prevails) or through brilliant virtuosic climaxes, is enriched in the outer sections with a basic thematic idea of ‘ethnic’ character, in the well-known Greek ‘syrtos-kalamatianos’ dance rhythm and with sporadic augmented seconds lending the melodic line a characteristic, though fleeting, air of chromatic modality of Greek traditional music.Atthe same time, this charming work also reveals the great talent of the adolescent composer, at a time when his incomparable musicality was already making up to an amazing degree for the still imperfect knowledge derived from his formal musical studies.\nEnglish translation by Helena Grigorea","The young German conductor, assistant of the London Symphony Orchestra, reflects on time with the world's top orchestras\nBack in 2008 you won the Donatella Flick Conducting Competition – how did it feel to win?\nIt was the first big international conducting competition I applied for, so I knew that it would be a great experience. The first thing was to get invited, then there were three rounds. One focused on symphonic repertoire, another concertos. The final one was with the LSO.\nAre competitions important for musicians today?\nEverybody has to decide for themselves. Nowadays you have to fight to live from your art. Just one of the possibilities of getting there is to enter competitions. At music conservatoire, you don't know how you compare to your international colleagues. So an international competition is important for this, but it's not a promise for being successful.There are many wonderful musicians who never do a competition.\nIs it difficult for young conductors to establish a career now?\nIt’s difficult to say. In the German tradition, young conductors don’t start immediately as conductors. First you go to the opera house and spend years playing all the operas on the piano. Then maybe you're asked to conduct a little operetta, then if you can conduct you become a conductor. There's also the route of being an assistant and having a mentor. And in the last 50 to 70 years competitions have maybe made it easier. But in a way it's also more difficult as now everyone has the chance to compete!\nBernard Haitink is your mentor – what have you learnt from him?\nThis is a big question. I met him during a conducting masterclass in Lucerne, Switzerland. It was an eye-opener. I was a student then and my horizon was focused, or limited, by the conservatoire. Being in contact with such a personality as Haitink, who has so much experience and knows so much about music, makes you feel how much bigger the horizon is. Then of course there's all his experience with musicians, repertoire, technique and how to conduct with your mind rather than your hands. He has the enormous will and concentration to lead an orchestra from inside not from outside.\nWhat makes a good conductor?\nA conductor should know his technique – how to communicate with people without words. This is so personal. If you think of Herbert von Karajan, Carlos Kleiber, Bernard Haitink or Valery Gergiev, they each have their own language. But they are all masters of their language. You should know what your message with the music is, the interpretation. Normally conductors should do what's written in the score, but of course there are always little question marks. Then there are the mysterious things that happen in performance that you can't explain but come through the souls of the musicians and conductors.\nYou've worked with several of the world's top orchestras, including the LSO…\nWorking with the LSO was and still is great. You feel very welcome with this orchestra – they are wonderful musicians and there's a great atmosphere. Through Haitink I worked a lot with the Royal Concertgebouw, Chicago Symphony and Berlin Philharmonic Orchestras. Each orchestra has its own character or mentality, and it's very interesting to compare them.\nCould you give us a flavour of their characters?\nFor instance the Concertgebouw has a beautiful, clear sound, but it's also round and elegant. The LSO is very clear – you hear everything, every detail. It’s professional, strong and has a lot of energy inside. The Chicago Symphony's sound is darker, more round. Except the brass – under Georg Solti it became famous for its bright, brass sound. Although when Daniel Barenboim and Haitink were principal conductors, they changed the sound. It became darker, more European somehow. If you have a chance as a young conductor to be in contact with these sound characters and qualities, it's a wonderful gift.\nInterview by Rebecca Franks"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:1a77a82d-98ef-4852-80ba-104b0af50a9b>","<urn:uuid:15df5527-e25f-4b88-8c03-37c899ae3d36>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Which material retains a sharper edge longer: carbon steel or basic stainless steel knives?","answer":"While basic stainless steel doesn't hold an edge for long, carbon steel actually stays sharp for less time compared to some more advanced steel alloys. Carbon steel knives require more frequent resharpening, though they are very easy to sharpen even with simple means. Basic stainless steel resists corrosion and is tough, but its edge retention is poor. The trade-off is that carbon steel knives can be quickly and easily resharpened, unlike some stainless steels which stay sharp longer but are much more difficult to sharpen.","context":["Besides a gun or bow, a knife is one of the most essential tools of the hunter’s trade. Without it, the game meat would never make it from field to table—and there are a host of other jobs around camp and in the woods that make a knife absolutely essential. But stroll into the sporting goods store to pick out your next blade and you’ll likely be dumbfounded because of an overabundance of choices. There are locking blades or fixed blades, straight or serrated edges and they come in all shapes and sizes.\nThere’s no right answer as to what the perfect knife is—it really depends on what you plan to use it for—but there are some basic considerations to keep in mind the next time you’re in the market for this vital outdoorsman’s tool.\nTo start, hunting knives are divided into three basic styles:\nFixed Blade Knives\nAs the name implies, a fixed blade knife is built as one piece, with the blade always open and exposed, and it is affixed to a sturdy handle. As such it is carried in a sheath to protect you from the blade when it’s not in use. A fixed blade is generally stronger since it’s a single piece with no moving parts to weaken the design. Benefits of the fixed blade, besides its strength, are that they are always open and ready for quick use. Negatives are they are larger and remain extended, which means they can take a little more space in a pack or can get caught up on brush.\n- <h2>Helle Temagami Fixed Blade</h2>The fixed blade knife is the best option for tough jobs that require rigidity and durability. Since the blade and handle are one solid piece of metal, it can take a beating without breaking. <p> An exceptional, all-purpose fixed blade is the <a href=\"http://www.helle.no/products/knives/temagami/\" target=\"_blank\">Helle Temagami</a>, a Norwegian-made knife that is built to handle the toughest conditions. The Temagami, like all Helle knives, is built to work, and is proudly endorsed by the Survivorman himself, Les Stroud. <p> <strong>Price: $180</strong>\nFolding Blade Knives\nThese blades are considered the safest to carry because the blade folds compactly into the handle of the knife. They are also more compact, sliding easily into a pocket or pack. Blades are generally held in place when by a locking mechanism, which prevents them from folding up and cutting the user. As a major benefit, this style of knife is compact and safe. On the other hand, they are not as solid for tough jobs like a fixed blade knife would be.\nBasically the only difference between these knives and folding knives is that clip knives easily fasten to the inside of a pocket or pants for more convenient carrying and access. As a benefit, clip knives are convenient to carry and great for general use. Negatively, the compact design can make them less sturdy and easier to lose because they can be knocked off the edge of your pants or pocket.\nUnderstanding Blade Materials\nThis one can be tricky since there are a lot of different materials for making knife blades, all of them delivering varying degrees of strength or ductility (how well the blade can be battered without shattering), the ability to keep an edge and resistance to corrosion. There are others, but these are the three most important characteristics for most sportsmen. Many modern blade materials are simply alloyed stainless steel of varying degrees, designed to deliver a balance of these three qualities.\nBasic stainless steel resists corrosion and is tough, but it doesn’t hold an edge for long. Carbon steels, on the other hand, tend to keep a great edge. Negatively, it tends to rust with the slightest amount of moisture. To save time on research, stick with one of the modern stainless steels. You won’t have to put much care in your knife and the blade will hold an edge and sharpen easily.\nUnderstanding Blade Shape\nClip point, drop point, tanto point, sheepsfoot, dagger point, trailing point, spear point and gut hook are among more than a dozen blade shapes available. However, for the sportsman, there are four of particular importance.\nDrop Point: A drop point blade boasts a sturdy, thick point for strength. It’s also less prone to puncturing materials, such as hides or vitals when skinning.\nClip Point: A clip point blade has a thinner tip than a drop point and can be used to make initial cuts easier because of the pointier tip. As a downside, it can also break more easily.\nTrailing Point: A trailing point blade falls between the clip point and drop point designs. It is stronger than clip point and has a back edge that trails upward, allowing for a larger curve to the cutting edge for more slicing surface. This is a great blade shape for cutting meat.\nGut Hook: More of a convenience than a necessity, the gut hook has a sharpened notch or “hook” cut into the topside of the blade that makes it easier to open an animal or bird’s abdominal cavity when you need to remove the vitals.\nSerrated vs. Plain Blades\nSerrated blades, with little cuts or teeth in them, have become more popular in recent years and are one more blade consideration a hunter must keep in mind. The traditional straight edged or plain blade allows for better precision and control when cutting. It’s best for push cuts as opposed to slicing cuts, such as cutting apples or potatoes, but I also like them better for precise jobs such as skinning.\nSerrated blades work best with slicing cuts since the blade’s teeth help act like a saw and can cut through tough hide and sinew when cleaning game. Because most cuts used when field dressing and butchering game involves slicing cuts over push cuts, the serrated blades are becoming more popular among sportsmen.\nUnderstanding Handle Ergonomics\nKnife handles are designed to provide comfort and grip to the user, some boasting contours, checkered surfaces or even a broader front near the blade to prevent your hand from slipping toward the cutting surface.\nWhen choosing a knife, find one that fits your hand well and feels good when you grip it. It’s really just a matter of personal preference. The most important thing is you don’t want one that will slip in your hand when using it.\nDoes Blade Size Matter?\nFor most hunters, the ideal blade length should fall between three and six inches. Any longer and the knife can become unwieldy when performing precision cuts—causing cuts where you don’t want them—but any shorter and it can be difficult to maintain a suitable grip and maintain leverage when making cuts.\nThink of the most common jobs you plan to use your knife for and consider these six elements and your own personal preferences to select your next perfect hunting knife.","Carbon steel is a popular choice for outdoor knives. Brands like KA-BAR, ESEE and TOPS are known for their good carbon steel outdoor knives. But what makes carbon steel so special? And what are its disadvantages? We’ll take a closer look at these questions below.\nAlthough nowadays, almost everyone thinks directly of stainless steel or “stainless steel”, this material is actually quite a new invention in the field of knives. For hundreds of years, all knives were made of carbon steel. Stainless steel has been around since the beginning of the 20th century. But it wasn’t until after World War II that tool steel grades like D2 steel or other alloys really became popular. In the 60s and 70s, there was a kind of turning point where stainless steel grades even became mainstream.\nWhat is Carbon Steel?\nWe use the term “carbon steel” to refer to steel with a high carbon content and a low content of chromium or other alloying elements that make the steel more rust-resistant. Then there is tool steel, which contains a little more of these elements. Just not enough to make the steel completely stainless. In fact, stainless steel contains more chromium – often 15% or more. Note: We are always talking about stainless steel, not non-stainless steel. Even stainless steel can form rust if handled incorrectly.\nSome examples of popular carbon steel grades for outdoor knives are 1095 carbon steel, O1, 1075 carbon steel, and Böhler K720.\nThe Advantages of Carbon Steel\nFortunately, there are many manufacturers and users who know the advantages of carbon steel. Especially in the area of outdoor knives. The beauty of carbon steel is that it is often tougher than stainless steel. The alloying elements in stainless steel make it a bit more brittle compared to carbon steel. Carbon steel is simple. Outdoor knives also use carbon steel of a lower hardness grade. This causes the carbon steel to bend before it breaks. In the field, this feature can be very handy, as you naturally get more out of a bent knife than a broken one.\nEasy to sharpen\nAnother great advantage of carbon steel is that it is very easy to sharpen. In the process, it also becomes very sharp. Even with simple means. We sometimes jokingly say that you could sharpen an average carbon steel knife even on a brick. That’s a bit exaggerated, of course, but I’m sure you understand what we mean. Carbon steel offers the advantage of outdoor knives that you can keep your knives sharp on the go with relatively simple means. You don’t necessarily need a set of five stones, a good double-sided stone is enough to get you going.\nA cost-effective Option\nPrice can also be a very convincing argument for choosing carbon steel. As a raw material, carbon steel is relatively inexpensive, and in addition, processing and heat treatment can also be carried out relatively cost-effectively. Of course, there are exceptions, but if you have a limited budget, it is certainly worth taking a closer look at knives made of this material.\nThe disadvantages of Carbon Steel\nOf course, not all that glitter is gold. The carbon steel also brings disadvantages. The main one is the formation of rust. No matter which surface treatment you select, with or without coating, carbon steel always carries the risk of rusting. The pure composition of the steel, in which there are hardly any alloying elements, also means that there is hardly any corrosion resistance.\nTherefore, carbon steel knives require a bit more care than stainless steel knives. Cut an apple and just put the knife aside? That will result in rust spots forming on the blade in no time. Also, use in a marine environment will sooner or later lead to the formation of rust. That’s why it’s important to regularly rub the blade with a few drops of oil.\nEven if you clean the knife immediately after its use, the steel will discolor. Mostly bluish, which reminds me a bit of an oil stain. This is called patina. Even coated knives are not completely immune to this. The cutting edge is exposed eventually, despite the coating, plus any coating wears off with use. No matter how hard or thick it is. Laser engravings on a coating are also susceptible to rust.\nSince outdoor knives made of carbon steel are usually somewhat softer, they also stay sharp for correspondingly less time. So on average. Just from cutting a piece of wood, a knife practically never becomes dull, but compared to some nobler alloys, you need to resharpen a little faster. Fortunately, we had already established that in this case, it is very quick and easy. Unlike some stainless steels, which stay sharp longer, but are much more difficult to sharpen.\nCarbon Steel for Kitchen Knives\nCarbon steel knives can also be found in the kitchen. Only partly, for different reasons. Ease of sharpening is also a plus for carbon steel in the kitchen, but in this application, carbon steel knives tend to be even more fragile than their stainless counterparts. This is because they mostly have an extremely high degree of hardness. This means they stay sharp for a long time and can be ground thin – but at the same time, this definitely makes them more vulnerable. In this sense, carbon steel is a strangely contradictory material – extremely tough for outdoor knives, but very hard and brittle for kitchen knives. A characteristic that must be taken into consideration.\nRust formation and low sharpening resistance set alarm bells ringing for many. We hope you’ve now learned enough about the benefits of this particular yet very common steel. We are absolutely fans of carbon steel. The character of a natural patina simply tells a story. And it’s about where you’ve been with the knife. And what you experienced with it. That alone is worth its weight in gold."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:734d83f6-17c9-49d3-a679-7140491290d7>","<urn:uuid:5ee31508-a343-40af-80a6-de23ea72930d>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the essential financial planning aspects of a business plan, and what money-related challenges do entrepreneurs typically encounter during startup?","answer":"A business plan's essential financial planning aspects include detailed financial projections, cost estimates, projected revenue, payback period, breakeven point analysis, and formal funding requests. It helps entrepreneurs assess the feasibility of their ideas and determine if the business can become sustainable over time. As for startup money challenges, entrepreneurs typically face several issues: securing adequate startup capital, with many underestimating starting expenses and overestimating sales growth; managing negative cash flows during early months; ensuring proper budgeting for expenses like employee salaries, marketing, and operating costs; maintaining sufficient cash flow while waiting for customer payments; and developing a solid, stable customer base to generate consistent sales. Additionally, they must handle accounting responsibilities and make strategic decisions about resource allocation.","context":["Whether you’re seeking investors, applying for loans or developing a new product line, a business plan is an essential tool. A well-drafted plan will provide valuable information that will help you remain on track.\nDespite a common perception that business plans are outdated and primarily needed for VCs or bank loan officers, bootstrappers still use these plans to foster internal alignment. Here are the key reasons why you should too.\n1. It’s a roadmap\nA business plan is an entrepreneur’s way to make sure they have all their ducks in a row before launching a new company. It reassures investors, partners, and creditors that they are serious about their idea and that they have spent hours thinking of it, fleshing out growth tactics, and calculating financial projections.\nIt also helps entrepreneurs set their long-term objectives and gives them strategic direction so that fewer outcomes are left to chance. For example, if an entrepreneur is considering hiring new employees or investing in a new location, they can refer back to their plan and use the forecasts to determine whether the company has enough cash to cover those expenses.\nHaving a business plan is especially important for startup companies, but it’s also useful for established businesses that want to improve their bottom line and grow. Regardless of the size or nature of the business, entrepreneurs should revisit and update their plans on a regular basis. That way, they can identify red flags early and reduce the risk of failure by avoiding bad business ideas. By taking the time to write a business plan, entrepreneurs can also get valuable feedback from others.\n2. It’s a tool for decision-making\nWhen an entrepreneur isn’t guided by a business plan, many decisions are left up to chance. This can lead to unforeseen results that can derail the company’s growth. The process of creating a business plan forces entrepreneurs to consider the various outcomes and decide how best to proceed.\nA business plan can help a company avoid making unwise decisions that may result in financial losses. For example, if an entrepreneur is considering a new product, they can use their business plan to determine whether it’s a marketable product and whether the demand is strong enough to support a profitable company.\nA well-written business plan also helps companies attract top talent by clearly defining the company’s mission, goals, and objectives. It should include details about the products and services that a company intends to offer, its marketing strategies, and its financial projections (e.g., cost estimates, projected revenue, payback period, breakeven point). This information is particularly important for attracting investors and other stakeholders who want to see clear and detailed financial projections before they’ll invest in a company. A good business plan also includes a formal funding request. This can be useful when seeking venture capital, a loan from a bank, or an investment from a private investor.\n3. It’s a guide for investors\nInvestors are always looking for the next big thing, and a business plan is an excellent way to prove that your grand idea has legs. It also helps a company define and reach important milestones. For example, a business plan can help you set budgets and revenue goals. It can even help you develop contingency plans for when things go wrong.\nA well-written business plan will cover all the major components of your company, including human resources, marketing, finance, operations and intellectual property. It will also include a five-year forecast of profitability and a detailed description of the company’s current assets. Finally, it will outline the company’s management team and the experience and competence of its key leaders.\nA business plan is a great tool for attracting investors, but it is not a magic bullet. A business plan needs to be reviewed and updated regularly, based on success, failure, industry trends, and other new information. This will make it a more effective tool for making decisions and providing strategic direction, so that fewer outcomes are left to chance. Moreover, it will help you avoid making decisions on the fly, which can lead to costly mistakes.\n4. It’s a tool for management\nA business plan lays out the specifics of an enterprise, including the goals and objectives it’s going to pursue. It provides a blueprint based on which the business will operate and it governs all functions, especially decision-making. It also helps managers get everyone on board with the vision and direction of a company. This is done by sharing the plan with employees, so they’re aware of the long-term goals and what the company stands for.\nWhen a plan is shared, people can contribute ideas to make the business better and they can see what steps are needed to reach those goals. It also gives them a clear idea of what type of help the business needs from its partners, investors, and suppliers. It can even be used to attract funding because it proves to potential investors that the entrepreneur is serious about the business and will put in the work.\nA good business plan also includes an executive summary, a company description, a marketing plan, and financial projections, among others. It should also include a contingency plan that defines the ways in which the business will respond to unforeseen risks and threats. It will also contain a thorough market research section, which is very useful in identifying potential customers, analyzing the competition, and proving that there is a demand for a new product or service.\n5. It’s a tool for resource management\nEntrepreneurs need to be able to assess the feasibility of their ideas. A business plan is a tool that can help them determine whether their business will work financially and if it can become sustainable over time. It also helps them identify risks and opportunities early on, so they can take steps to manage these potential outcomes. However, it is understandble that it might be hard to formulate a business plan alone, that is why Pro Business Plans is at your service.\nMost entrepreneurs will require outside capital to fund their new business, and a well-written business plan is crucial for maximizing the likelihood of raising those funds. A business plan can help an entrepreneur set the stage for a conversation with investors by showing them the financial and operational strengths of their business. It can also help them answer key questions such as how much money they need to raise, what the best way is to spend that capital and how long it will take for the company to reach breakeven.\nA business plan is a document that should be shared with all stakeholders, including employees, project partners, investors, suppliers and major clients. Making these people aware of the business plan will encourage them to align their actions with the company’s goals and objectives, which can lead to better performance and a stronger sense of ownership within the company.\n6. It’s a tool for marketing\nCreating a business plan will also help you identify and allocate your resources. This is important because it will help you to better understand the impact of changes such as opening new offices, hiring fresh employees, introducing new products, and other such decisions on the financial status of your company.\nMoreover, you’ll be able to use your business plan to communicate and sell the vision of your business to potential investors, project partners, suppliers, key employees, and major clients. For example, you can use your business plan to illustrate the current and future market potential of your product or service, your projected profits and growth, and the current and estimated value of the firm.\nOften, a business plan is required for securing funding from banks, lending institutions, venture capitalists, and other sources of financing. However, even if your business plan doesn’t require you to solicit external funding, it is essential for the purposes of fine-tuning the vision of your company and identifying areas of weakness or failure that you can address. Benjamin Franklin’s famous quote “Failure to plan is planning to fail” still holds true today. A business plan will help you avoid such failures and succeed in achieving your long-term goals.\n7. It’s a tool for exit planning\nA business plan is the ultimate document that defines an entrepreneur’s vision, approach and objectives. It outlines how the company will achieve its goals and what its future potential is. Ultimately, the business plan helps determine the most advantageous way for the owner to exit the company. This can be through sale, transfer or liquidation.\nWhether you’re seeking debt financing from a bank or financial institution or equity capital from investors, a well-written and compelling business plan is the key to your success. Investors and lenders look for information on a business’s risk, its earning potential and its cash flows that will pay off the investment over time. They’ll also want to know the financial projections and forecasts such as expected revenue and costs, a break-even point, payment schedules, etc.\nWithout a business plan, entrepreneurs who wish to make a favorable exit for themselves, their heirs or their employees may find that their options are limited and the process much more difficult. Creating an exit strategy is like climbing to the crest of a mountain – you can’t experience the exhilaration of the summit if you don’t train for the climb beforehand. Without a business plan, that’s often the case.","Entrepreneurs face daunting challenges when starting down the road to build their dream business. The problems facing entrepreneurs fall into three categories: money, people and personal.\nUnderstanding Money Issues\nCash is a vital concern for any business, especially startups.\nStartup capital: Having enough capital to start a business is usually the first problem of entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurs tend to underestimate starting expenses and overestimate growth of sales. Businesses will typically run negative cash flows during the early months that will consume startup capital.\nEven after the business begins to generate positive cash flow, the owner has to make sure that money goes for the right expenses and does not get wasted.\nSales: Nothing happens without sales. Developing a solid, stable customer base is essential when starting to build a foundation for growth. Identifying and reaching the right audience takes focus and effort. It takes time to strategize and create a campaign to attract the target market. Even when you have the best products or services, it is still possible to fail if you do not have a loyal customer base.\nMarketing: Figuring out what is going on in the minds of consumers is always a bit of guesswork. Designing a marketing strategy with this much uncertainty is a challenge. Doing the research to find the best way to position products is essential to have a chance at success.\nSocial media: This is a new age. Consumers are more connected with a variety of social media platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. Entrepreneurs have to learn how to use social media to promote their products and get the message out to potential customers. Failures of management strategies will get reported and quickly spread across the internet.\nAccounting: Nobody likes to do bookkeeping, but it has to be done. Just mentioning doing the books makes most small business owners anxious. This is a good task to outsource to an accounting service.\nCash flow: Life for entrepreneurs would be perfect if sales just rolled in and customers paid their bills on time. Unfortunately, reality does not work that way. Expenses still have to be paid, even if sales are down and some customers are slow to pay. Managing cash flow and keeping enough cash in the bank is always stressful.\nBudgeting: Every entrepreneur struggles with budgeting. Selling is much more fun, but someone has to figure out where the money is going to come from and where it should be allocated. How much to pay to attract the best employees? What amount should be spent on marketing and on which media? What are the controls on operating expenses, cost of materials, insurance, legal fees, etc.?\nA functioning budget should lay out a plan on how the business will operate to make a profit. Which products will be sold and how much gross profits will they produce? How much are the fixed expenses?\nThe Right People\nRecruiting: Business owners can not do everything themselves and will eventually need to hire employees. Bringing on people with specific skills and paying them enough without breaking the budget is a challenge. One solution could be to hire part-timers or freelancers until the business builds up its cash flow.\nIn the beginning, owners feel they can handle everything themselves. While the ability to multitask with many skills is admirable, the execution may be lacking. A smooth start needs people who are well-trained and skilled to shoulder the responsibilities.\nAn owner trying to do everything can create issues for the business with slow responses to customers and poor execution of normal business activities.\nEmployee retention: With unemployment rates at historic lows, recruiting qualified employees is difficult, but retaining them can be even more challenging. A company has to offer competitive benefits and make sure that employees are satisfied and productive with their jobs. Happy employees need recognition, days off and the belief that they will also receive promotions and benefits with the growth of the company.\nJust like the business, employees need nurturing.\nDelegating: At some point, an entrepreneur has to pass responsibilities to the employees. The owner has to come to the realization that not everything can be done by the owner. If the business is to grow, the owner must hire the best employees, train them and let them do their jobs.\nThe change from a do-everything owner to a manager of people is a crucial transition for an entrepreneur trying to develop and grow a business.\nPersonal Issues at Play\nBeing your own boss is the dream of most entrepreneurs, but it comes with a price. The freedom of not having to answer to someone else becomes the obligation of having to answer to the needs of the business. In this sense, the business is the new boss.\nWork-life balance: Starting a business will consume a lot of time, energy and commitment. Not letting the business prevent you from having personal time is a challenge. An entrepreneur needs to set aside time in the workweek to spend time outside the business and stick to it.\nThe failure to deliberately manage a work-life balance can lead to burnout, health problems and lost relationships with family and friends.\nWhere to start: Starting a business requires a seemingly endless list of things to do; it can be overwhelming and lead to paralysis and inaction. The best approach is to organize the tasks, pick one and get started.\nManaging growth: After making the first sale, the next challenge is to manage growth which will require more money, time and employees.\nMaking decisions: Since you are the owner, you have the final decision. The business, in the beginning, will not have a management team to consult with. The decisions all belong to the owner, and this can be a daunting feeling of responsibility, knowing that you alone have to bear the consequences of your decisions. The employees expect the owner to take charge and direct the troops.\nSelf-doubt and criticism: In the beginning, customers and competitors will not take a budding entrepreneur seriously. Everyone will be quick to share their opinions on what you are doing wrong and why it will not work. The truth is, outside of immediate family and close friends, nobody will be rooting for your success.\nWith this ocean of negativity, self-doubt will start to creep in. Maybe they are all right. Maybe starting this business was a bad idea. If you have done your homework, this is the moment to overcome the fear of failure and have the confidence in yourself to keep going.\nStarting a Business Is not Easy\nIf you ask entrepreneurs what problems they faced when starting a business, the answers will usually be the same: money, employees and personal issues.\nAll businesses need enough equity capital to survive startup and growth with sufficient cash flow coming in to pay the bills. Employees will consume a large portion of that cash flow, but they are part of the growth of a business.\nIn the meantime, the owner has to maintain enough self-confidence to persevere through the negativity and huge challenges and not lose the belief that the business will undoubtedly succeed.\nSo, what is the first thing to do when starting a business? No simple answer exists for this question. An aspiring entrepreneur must address all of these challenges at the same time. However, being able to successfully handle all of these problems is the gratification for starting the business in the first place."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"content_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:492d84d2-3b0f-48b1-ae56-922138f738d1>","<urn:uuid:92a6ba47-010c-4cf0-ae9b-493ce1da4943>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What power requirements does a boat engine need from its starting battery, and how do different battery types impact environmental sustainability?","answer":"For boat engines, starting power requirements vary by size: engines under 50 HP need at least 70 cold cranking amps (CCA), while larger engines over 50 HP require 100 CCA or more. Most outboard motors need a 12-volt marine battery designed to withstand harsh water conditions. Regarding environmental sustainability, battery production has significant impacts. Cell manufacturing is particularly energy-intensive, consuming about twice the energy of raw material production. The battery manufacturing process requires substantial water resources, with battery production contributing to 5-10% of total water consumption in vehicle lifecycle. Importantly, environmental impacts vary by battery chemistry - for instance, Nickel-Manganese-Cobalt (NMC) cathode production can be two to three times more energy-intensive than other cathode materials like LMO and LFP.","context":["There are many types of batteries out there, and it can be tricky to know which one is best for your needs. If you’re looking for a battery for your boat, you might be wondering if a deep cycle battery is a good option. Deep cycle batteries are designed for devices that require a large amount of power over an extended period of time, so they’re perfect for things like trolling motors.\nHowever, they’re not ideal for starting engines, so you’ll need to use a different type of battery for that purpose.\n- First, identify the make and model of your boat’s engine\n- Next, consult your boat’s owner’s manual to find the specifications for the recommended battery type and size\n- Once you have determined the appropriate battery type and size, purchase a deep cycle battery that meets those specifications\n- Install the deep cycle battery in your boat according to the manufacturer’s instructions\n- Finally, connect the negative terminal of the deep cycle battery to the ground wire on your boat’s engine\nAre Deep-Cycle Marine Batteries Good for Starting?\nThere is a lot of debate on whether deep-cycle marine batteries are good for starting engines. Some say that they are, while others claim that they are not. The truth is, it really depends on the battery and the engine.\nDeep-cycle marine batteries are designed to provide a steady flow of power over long periods of time, making them ideal for applications such as trolling motors or electric winches. However, this also means that they may not have enough power to start an engine quickly. It is important to check with the manufacturer of both the battery and the engine to see if a deep-cycle marine battery is recommended for starting.\nIn some cases, it may be necessary to use a different type of battery for starting purposes.\nWhat is the Difference between a Marine Starting Battery And a Deep Cycle Battery?\nStarting batteries are designed to provide a high amperage for a short period of time in order to start an engine. A deep cycle battery is designed to provide a lower amperage over a longer period of time and can be discharged and recharged many times without damaging the battery.\nWhat Kind of Battery Do I Need to Start My Outboard Motor?\nOutboard motors are a popular choice for many boat owners because they are relatively easy to install and maintain. Most outboard motors will require a 12-volt battery to start. This type of battery is also known as a marine battery.\nMarine batteries are designed to withstand the harsh conditions that are common on the water. They are also less likely to leak than other types of batteries. If you are unsure of what type of battery to purchase, it is always best to consult with your outboard motor’s manufacturer or an authorized dealer.\nThey will be able to advise you on the best type of battery for your particular model of outboard motor.\nWhat is a Good Cranking Battery for a Boat?\nThere are a few things to consider when choosing a cranking battery for your boat. The size of the engine, the type of boat, and how often you use the boat are all important factors.\nThe most important factor is probably the size of your engine.\nA small outboard motor will need a much smaller battery than a large inboard motor. The next thing to consider is the type of boat you have. A pontoon boat or other pleasure craft will have different power needs than a fishing boat or other workboat.\nFinally, think about how often you use your boat. If you only take it out on weekends, you won’t need as big of a battery as someone who uses their boat every day. Here are some general guidelines to help you choose the right cranking battery for your boat:\n-For boats with small engines (under 50 HP), look for a battery that has at least 70 cold cranking amps (CCA). -For larger engines (over 50 HP), look for a battery with 100 CCA or more. -If you have a pontoon or other pleasure craft, you can get away with a smaller battery since they don’t require as much power to start up.\nJust make sure it has enough CCA to start your engine reliably. -If you have a fishing or workboat that is used regularly, go with the largest and most powerful battery you can afford so that it can handle the constant starting and stopping without any issues.\nDeep cycle battery or starting battery?\nMarine Starting Battery Vs Deep Cycle\nIf you have a boat, you know that there are two main types of batteries – marine starting batteries and deep cycle batteries. But what’s the difference between the two? And which one is right for your boat?\nMarine starting batteries are designed to provide a large amount of power for a short period of time. They’re perfect for starting your boat’s engine, but they don’t have a lot of reserve power for running accessories or powering your boat’s trolling motor. Deep cycle batteries, on the other hand, are designed to provide a steady stream of power over a long period of time.\nThey’re perfect for running accessories or powering your boat’s trolling motor, but they don’t have enough power to start your boat’s engine. So, which battery is right for your boat? It depends on how you plan to use your boat.\nIf you only use your boat for occasional weekends on the lake, a marine starting battery might be all you need. But if you use your boat more frequently or for longer periods of time, you’ll need a deep cycle battery (or two) to keep things running smoothly.\nYou may have heard that you can use a deep cycle battery for starting your boat. And while it’s true that deep cycle batteries can be used for this purpose, there are some things you should know before you make the switch. For starters, deep cycle batteries are designed to provide a steady stream of power over a long period of time.\nThis makes them ideal for applications like trolling motors, where you need a consistent level of power for extended periods of time. Starting your boat, on the other hand, requires a high burst of power to turn over the engine. Deep cycle batteries can provide this burst of power, but they’re not designed to do so repeatedly.\nSo if you use a deep cycle battery for starting your boat, it will likely only last for one or two seasons before needing to be replaced. In contrast, a dedicated starting battery will usually last 3-5 years with proper care. Another consideration is cost.\nDeep cycle batteries typically cost more than twice as much as starting batteries. So if you’re only going to use it for starting your boat, it might not be worth the investment. If you decide to use a deep cycle battery for starting your boat, just be sure to keep an eye on its condition and replace it when necessary.","Life-Cycle Assessment Considerations for Batteries and Battery Materials\nThis is a summary (plus, a few of my own thoughts) of the review article “Life-Cycle Assessment Considerations for Batteries and Battery Materials” (2021) by J. Porzio and C. D. Scown.\nTypes of battery life-cycle assessment\nThere are two main types of battery life-cycle assessment (LCA): “cradle-to-gate” and “cradle-to-grave”.\nCradle-to-gate (factory gate is assumed here). The example metric is CO2e/kWh of battery capacity produced. In a truly use-agnostic LCA, the system boundary may need to be set at the module assembly stage, since the assembly of the pack or rack (including such components as thermal management and electrical control) will differ substantially depending on how the battery will be used.\n“Cradle-to-gate and use” is a variation that incorporates battery manufacturing and lifetime of usage, but not end-of-life recycling.\nCradle-to-grave LCAs consider how batteries will be used and treated at their end of life including collection, recycling and/or disposal.\nThe term cradle-to-cradle has been used to refer to systems that include recycling, but is generally meant to suggest a zero-waste process and thus is not commonly used to refer to battery life cycles, even if they include recycling.\nMidpoint and endpoint metrics in life-cycle impact assessment\nMidpoint and endpoint impact categories (or metrics, but not all impact categories can be converted into metrics) are the concepts in the area of life-cycle assessment studies.\nMidpoint impacts are precursors to some endpoint impacts that we care about. For example, greenhouse gas emissions are a midpoint impact that leads to climate change and, ultimately, to human loss of life due to food shortage, flooding, wildfires, and other catastrophic events, as well as loss of animal life and entire animal and plant species (endpoint impacts). For another example, ozone depletion is midpoint impact and increased cancer rates (because less UV radiation from the sun is blocked) is an endpoint impact.\nSome impacts could be considered both midpoint and endpoint, e. g. loss of ecosystems is both an endpoint impact in itself, but also decreases the quality of life, prosperity, or even leads to famine among people who lived off these ecosystems.\nThe impact categories of raw material production for batteries\nThere are three aspects of raw material assessment of batteries that can’t be reduced to each other and therefore should not be integrated into a single metric: resource depletion, supply chain risk, and environmental and social impacts of mining.\nOlivetti et al. synthesized the available data on consumption rates relative to available reserves for nickel (Ni), manganese (Mn), cobalt (Co), lithium, (Li), and natural graphite. They found that the ratio of known reserves to primary mine production (also known as the static depletion index) has increased for Co, Li, and natural graphite, suggesting that continued demand has resulted in additional exploration and extraction. Mn and Ni did not show an upward or downward trend, indicating that the ratio of production to known reserves has remained relatively constant.\nInterestingly, lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries are often praised to be better than batteries with Nickel-based cathodes because they only require “earth-abundant” materials. However, if we are to produce 2 TWh of LFP batteries per year by 2030, with 500 Wh/kg of cathode energy density of LFP, and Phosphorous being 19.6% of LFP cathode by mass, 784,000 metric tonnes of phosphorous will go yearly into batteries alone. This is comparable to 910,000 tonnes produced presently. Could this contribute to the problem of peak phosphorous? I didn’t find any discussion of this whatsoever. Phosphorous is abundant in the rocks all over the Earth but is not economical to extract to produce fertilisers. Maybe this is not a problem for batteries, because they can easily withstand become several times more expensive without affecting the total cost of batteries much? Even if so, there could be a market-driven risk here: LFP manufacturers will use cheaper phosphates in the short term, making the future phosphate shortage problem for fertiliser production more acute.\nSupply chain risk is a geopolitical risk associated with highly concentrated production, which can lead to conflict, price instability, and artificial shortages. Cobalt reserves and mining production are concentrated in DR Congo, but 95% of cobalt refining happens in China. China also produces 64% of the world’s graphite and 55% of aluminium. Morocco has 70% of the world’s phosphate reserves.\nEnvironmental and social impacts of mining\nIn DR Congo, there have been serious environmental and social consequences of copper and cobalt mining, ranging from child labour to human exposure to heavy metals, particularly from unregulated artisanal and small-scale mining operations.\nCell manufacturing is about two times more energy-intensive than mining and production of the raw materials for the cells\nIn other words, cell manufacturing accounts for two-thirds of energy consumption in cradle-to-gate LCA assessment for cells (source).\nEvaporating the NMP solvent (after coating cathode slurry on the current collector foil) and maintaining the facility’s dry room conditioning together consume about 80% of energy spent during cell manufacturing. However, the energy usage estimates for dry room conditioning were obtained on small-scale facilities and can drop by an order of magnitude on a very high-throughput cell production line.\nNickel-Manganese-Cobalt (NMC) cathode production can be two to three times more energy-intensive than the production of other cathode materials (LMO and LFP), and therefore also become a major contributor to the total energy spent during cell manufacturing.\nEnergy stored on energy invested (ESOI)\nEnergy stored on energy invested is a metric that has been proposed by Barnhart and Benson for “cradle-to-gate and use” and “cradle-to-grave” life cycle assessments of energy storage technologies:\nFor recyclable batteries, I think that a metric like cradle-to-grave energy efficiency would be more convenient because it could be directly used in downstream calculations such as assessing energy efficiency or EROI (energy return on investment) of renewable or nuclear power installations with accompanying energy storage for daily power balancing and manoeuvring, as well as in lifecycle greenhouse gas emission comparisons between internal combustion, hybrid, and fully electric vehicles for different carbon intensities of the grids in different countries.\nThere are several factors that make it difficult to estimate battery’s ESOI or cradle-to-grave efficiency:\n- The fact that different batteries are used differently (e. g., charged and discharged slower or faster, different number of hours per day, with different shelf life before they begin operation, at different ambient temperatures, etc.) directly affect the expected lifetime and the round-trip efficiency of the battery.\n- Most batteries originally manufactured for electric vehicles are expected to enter a second-life phase in energy storage with a very different usage pattern, but the exact moment when it happens is uncertain.\n- Battery’s capacity and internal resistance change during its lifetime. The internal resistance affects the round-trip efficiency directly, and the capacity can affect the usage pattern.\nAs of 2021, there are many things to improve in lifecycle assessments of batteries, both in literature and industry\nLCAs should start using country-specific raw material production impacts rather than the industry averages (or, even worse, the current industry’s state-of-the-art or best-practice impacts). They should also consider the differences between average, marginal, and incremental sources of key material inputs, in conjunction with projections of the global demands for these materials, as the global Li-ion battery production quickly rumps up. We should also create and use methods for capturing the effect of outliers and “superemitters”/”superimpactors” in mining and material processing.\nThe assessments should correctly present the uncertainty. A single-number metric value conveys false precision. (Steve McConnell advises for exactly the same in his book about software estimations.)\nWe strongly recommend that future LCAs make an attempt to separate impacts tied to energy use with those tied to other activities. If facilities shifting their fuel use to lower-emission alternatives (e.g., from coal to natural gas, or natural gas to renewable fuels), making this distinction in published LCAs will make it easier to adjust the results accordingly.\nWater consumption and withdrawals associated with battery production can be substantial, yet it is often overlooked in LCAs. Battery electric vehicles are associated with over 50% more water use relative to internal combustion engine vehicles over the course of their lifetime. This is mostly associated with the electricity use associated with vehicle charging, but a large contribution of water consumption is attributable to the LIB itself, consisting of 5–10% of the total water consumption depending on the battery chemistry.\nAs long as underlying assumptions about cycle life are clearly documented, the authors suggest that life cycle assessments would be well served to report results normalised both per kWh of battery capacity and per kWh of lifetime throughput.\nOn including a few most important impact metrics in lifecycle assessments vs. categorising all metrics\nIf a particular assessment doesn’t cover some impact (aspect, dimension), it should still mention this explicitly. Omitting an impact category may lead readers to believe it is not important.\nOn the other hand, comprehensiveness comes at a cost. Selecting life-cycle inventory, midpoint, and/or endpoint metrics that are likely to yield the greatest insights (and have sufficiently high-quality data to support those conclusions) will make LCAs more interpretable and impactful.\nCounterfactual life-cycle assessment of batteries and electric vehicles vs. internal combustion engine vehicles and fossil fuel power generation\nExhaustive, overly-pedantic categorisation of all the impacts of battery production and use can also confuse the public towards thinking that batteries are actually very “dirty” in production and recycling compared to the lifetime of fossil fuel combustion in ICE cars. Fossil fuel advocates could also refer to these comprehensive battery assessments to spread FUD instead of comparing them counterfactually with the effects of keeping internal combustion vehicles and gas power generation running.\nSo, I think it’s valuable to include counterfactual comparisons with fossil fuel alternatives in battery and other clean energy LCAs as a protection against such abuse.\nThis summary was originally posted on Substack."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:fb0d88a8-54c8-4694-a1f9-f530e596044f>","<urn:uuid:696a38d0-8b90-4f1d-8afb-8f2b095542c8>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do Fringe Projects and America's Cultural Treasures differ in their funding distribution approaches?","answer":"Fringe Projects uses an open call format where artists submit proposals for temporary public artworks in Miami, with projects varying from single events to months in duration. In contrast, America's Cultural Treasures distributes funding in two phases: first providing $7 million in unrestricted grants of at least $500,000 to ten established arts organizations over five years, and second through a $5.6 million Seeding Cultural Treasures program supporting Black, Indigenous, Latinx, and Asian American artists and cultural organizations across multiple states.","context":["Fringe Projects Brings Public Art\nto Downtown Miami and Beyond\nPhotographs by Gesi Schilling | Courtesy of Fringe Projects\nThis Thursday, from 6 to 8 pm, Fringe Projects will premiere Site of Sound, an interactive underwater performance by artist Cara Despain in partnership with EXILE Books. This new soundscape created by Cara Despain will be experienced in the pool at The Standard Spa. The work creates a soundtrack for the city using found sounds in the storm drains of Miami, serving as a commentary on an issue that the city has struggled with for years: surrounded by water, the heralded growth of Miami is at odds with sea level rise. In a constant battle with storm surges and temporary flooding, invasive water could become a permanent part of Miami’s not-too-distant future.\nSite of Sound is the most recent project funded by Fringe Projects. Started in 2012 in tandem with DWNTWN Art Days, Fringe Projects is a commissioning organization that funds temporary public artworks in the city of Miami. Using an open call format, artists submit their ideas under a request for proposal and selected projects are shown for a period of time – from a single event to months in duration. The objective is to engage Miami residents and challenge artists to use the city of Miami as a starting point for their work.\nThe recent growth of the organization is in no small part due to the appointment of Amanda Sanfilippo as curator in 2013. Sanfilippo sees Fringe Projects as a way to use the whole city as an artistic platform, “Commissioning is so key to contemporary art, so Fringe is really about exploring that, alongside asking the question, ‘What does it mean to produce large-scale experimental work that is open-ended?’ Public works can have such an impact on a city.”\nHer vision reflects her training as a curator. Her own relationship with large scale public art developed in the graduate program at the Sotheby’s Institute of Art, London. It was there that she became interested in the idea of how to ask an artist to use a city as a platform. That led to positions at Creative Time, the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York, NY and the BCA Center in Burlington, VT. In addition to serving as curator for Fringe Projects, she is currently the development director at Locust Projects, non-profit exhibition space in the Design District that works with local and international artists.\nTo date Fringe Projects has worked with roster of artists, commissioning works with Miami artists Nicholas Lobo, Emmett Moore, Domingo Castillo and Jillian Mayer. The increasing scale of the pieces has garnered the organization attention: In 2015, Fringe Projects was awarded both a Knight Arts Challenge Grant and a Wavemaker Grant. “The grants will help us expand both the scope and duration of our projects in the future,” says Sanfilippo.\nShe references public art organizations such as Creative Time, New York and Artangel, London, as inspiration, noting that Fringe Projects takes measures to support artist’s ideas and encourage experimentation, alongside field-work and research.\nAs for what Fringe could be in the future? Sanfilippo says, “Miami could be a major biennale city and we’re two steps away.”","(May 18, 2021 — Minneapolis, Minn.) — A $12.6 million regional initiative of America’s Cultural Treasures will provide new funding for Black, Indigenous, Latinx, and Asian American-led arts organizations. The funding, to be distributed in two phases, is made possible by a collaboration of the McKnight, Ford, Bush and Jerome Foundations.\nPhase 1: Regional Cultural Treasures\n$7 million, provided by Ford & McKnight Foundations\nIn phase one, ten arts organizations in Minnesota — designated Regional Cultural Treasures - each will receive unrestricted grants of at least $500,000, to be distributed over the next five years or more. የ Regional Cultural Treasures program honors organizations that have made a significant impact on our cultural landscape over decades. The ten organizations are:\n- American Indian Community Housing Organization Arts Program\n- Ananya Dance Theatre\n- የተወላጁ ስሮች\n- Juxtaposition ጥበብ\n- የፓንገር ዓለም ቲያትር\n- የሶማሊ ሙዚየም\n- ቲያትር ሙ\n“We use the term ‘Cultural Treasures’ with intention, to honor the diversity of expression and artistic excellence that these organizations contribute to the cultural vitality of our state, despite having historically experienced under-investment,” said Tonya Allen, president of the McKnight Foundation. “As our arts institutions prepare to safely re-open after the pandemic, we’re thrilled to shine a spotlight on these remarkable organizations.”\nየ following criteria informed the selection of the ten Regional Cultural Treasures:\n- Regionally recognized for stewarding and sustaining a cultural/aesthetic tradition rooted in a community of color;\n- Regionally, nationally or internationally recognized for excellence in artistic/cultural practice;\n- Has had a significant legacy of impact for more than one decade;\n- Serves as a training ground for succeeding generations of artists and cultural leaders;\n- Recognized as a critical hub for a larger network of allied organizations or efforts;\n- Contributes to McKnight Foundation’s mission to advance a more just, creative, and abundant future where people and planet thrive.\nThe Minneapolis Foundation will administer the Regional Cultural Treasures grants.\nPhase 2: Seeding Cultural Treasures\n$5.6 million provided by Ford, McKnight, Bush and Jerome Foundations\nIn the second phase, the Seeding Cultural Treasures program will award grants to grow the future of Black, Indigenous, Latinx, and Asian American artists and cultural organizations in Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, and the 23 Native Nations that share the same geography.\n“We believe that supporting established Black, Indigenous, Latinx, and Asian American-led organizations with impressive track records, as well as individual artists and younger organizations, will make our communities better places to live,” said DeAnna Cummings, McKnight Arts program director. “We also hope this funding catalyzes greater recognition and increased investment in these vital arts organizations and their leaders who are meeting this moment with imagination, persistence, and creativity.”\nፕሮፔል Nonprofits እና Metropolitan Regional Arts Council will administer the program, engaging artists and community stakeholders to co-create it.

In Minnesota, the McKnight Foundation answered that call to serve as the lead regional partner and matched an initial contribution of $5 million from the Ford Foundation. The Bush and Jerome Foundations contributed an additional $2.6 million to bring the fund to $12.6 million. Both programs invite additional funding partners to increase the resources for the arts and culture rooted in communities of color in our region.\n“We’re thrilled to partner with the McKnight, Bush, and Jerome Foundations to celebrate arts organizations that are adding to the richness and diversity of the American cultural fabric,” said Darren Walker, president of the Ford Foundation. “These treasures are a symbol of the excellence present in Black, Indigenous, Latinx, and Asian American-led arts organizations and we hope to inspire continued investment in communities of color in the years to come.”\nKathy Graves, Parenteau Graves"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:32b1c78f-bf36-4dad-875e-49669cf449b9>","<urn:uuid:7c6668be-061e-414b-9b2c-cd9cc439d951>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Can anyone explain how Ricimer managed to control Italy without being emperor? Would love to understand his power structure!","answer":"Ricimer controlled Italy by accumulating several sources of power while avoiding the title of king. He amassed treasures, formed a separate army, negotiated private alliances, and ruled Italy with independent and despotic authority. His dominion was bounded by the Alps. Although he installed puppet emperors like Libius Severus, the actual governance was in Ricimer's hands. He exercised the same type of independent authority that would later be used by Odoacer and Theodoric.","context":["« ForrigeFortsett »\nsociety of his friends, he could indulge his taste for pleas. antry, without degrading the majesty of his rank.” It was not, perhaps, without some regret, that IRicimer sacrificed his friend to the interest of his ambition; but he resolved, in a second choice, to avoid the imprudent preference of superior virtue and merit. At his command, the obsequious senate of Rome bestowed the Imperial title on Libius Severus, who ascended the throne of the West without emerging from the obscurity of a private condition. History has scarcely deigned to notice his birth, his elevation, his character, or his death. Severus expired, as soon as his life became inconvenient to his patron ; \" and it would be useless to discriminate his nominal reign in the vacant interval of six years, between the death of Majorian and the elevation of Anthemius. During that period, the government was in the hands of Ricimer alone; and, although the modest Barbarian disclaimed the name of king, he accumulated treasures, formed a separate army, negotiated private alliances, and ruled Italy with the same independent and despotic authority, which was afterwards exercised by Odoacer and Theodoric. But his dominions were bounded by the Alps; and two Roman generals, Marcellinus and AEgidius, maintained their allegiance to the republic, by rejecting, with disdain, the phantom which he styled an emperor Marcellinus still adhered to the old religion; and the devout Pagans, who secretly disobeyed the laws of the church and state, applauded his profound skill in the science of divination. But he possessed the more valuable qualifications of learning, virtue, and courage; * the study of the Latin liter ature had improved his taste; and his military talents had recommended him to the esteem and confidence of the great Aëtius, in whose ruin he was involved. By a timely flight, Marcellinus escaped the rage of Valentinian, and boldly asserted his liberty amidst the convulsions of the Western empire. His voluntary, or reluctant, submission to the authority of Majorian, was rewarded by the government of Sicily, and the command of an army, stationed in that island to oppose, or to attack, the Vandals; but his Barbarian mercenaries, after the emperor's death, were tempted to revolt by the artful liberality of Ricimer. At the head of a band of faithful followers, the intrepid Marcellinus occupied the province of Dalmatia, assumed the title of patrician of the West, secured the love of his subjects by a mild and equitable reign, built a fleet which claimed the dominion of the Adriatic, and alternately alarmed the coasts of Italy and of Africa.” AEgidius, the master-general of Gaul, who equalled, or at least who imitated, the heroes of ancient Rome,” proclaimed his immortal resentment against the assassins of his beloved master. A brave and numerous army was attached to his standard: and, though he was prevented by the arts of Ricimer, and the arms of the Visigoths, from marching to the gates of Rome, he maintained his independent sovereignty beyond the Alps, and rendered the name of AEgidius respectable both in peace and war. The Franks, who had punished with exile the youthful follies of Childeric, elected the Roman general for their king: his vanity, rather than his ambition, was gratified by that singular honor; and when the nation, at the end of four years, repented of the injury which they had offered to the Merovingian family, he patiently acquiesced in the restoration of the lawful prince. The authority of Ægidius ended only with his life, and the suspicions of poison and secret violence, which derived some countenance from the character of Ricimer, were eagerly entertained by the passionate credulity of the Gauls.” The kingdom of Italy, a name to which the Western empire was gradually reduced, was afflicted, under the reign of Ricimer, by the incessant depredations of the Vandal 50 Procopius de Bell. Vandal. 1. i. c. 6, p. 191. In various circumstances of the life of Marcellinus, it is not easy to reconcile the Greek historian with the Latin Chronicles of the times. - to I must apply to AEgidius the praises which Sidonius (Panegyr. Majorian 553) bestows on a nameless master-general, who commanded the rear-guard of Majorian. Idatius, from public report, commends his Christian piety; and Priscus mentions (p. 42) his military virtues. c1 Greg. Turon. l. ii. c. 12, in tom. ii. p. 168. The Père Daniel, whose ideas were superficial and modern, has started some objections against the story of Childeric (Hist. de France, tom. i. Preface Historique, c. lxxvii., &c.) : but they have been fairly satisfied by Dubos (Hist. Critique, tom. i. pp. 460–510), and by two authors who disputed the prize of the Academy of Soissons (pp.131-177, 310 –339). With regard to the term of Childeric's exile, it is necessary either to propirates.” In the spring of each year, they equipped a for. midable navy in the port of Carthage; and Genseric himself, though in a very advanced age, still commanded in person the most important expeditions. His designs were concealed with impenetrable secrecy, till the moment that he hoisted sail. When he was asked, by his pilot, what course he should steer, “Leave the determination to the winds, (replied the Barbarian, with pious arrogance:) they will transport us to the guilty coast, whose inhabitants have provoked the divine justice; ” but if Genseric himself deigned to issue more precise orders, he judged the most wealthy to be the most criminal. The Vandals repeatedly visited the hoasts of Spain, Liguria, Tuscany, Campania, Lucania, Bruttium, Apulia, Calabria, Venetia, Dalmatia, Epirus, Greece, and Sicily: they were tempted to subdue the Island of Sardinia, so advantageously placed in the centre of the Mediterranean; and their arms spread desolation, or terror, from the columns of Hercules to the mouth of the Nile. As they were more ambitious of spoil than of glory, they seldom attacked any fortified cities, or engaged any regular troops in the open field. But the celerity of their motions enabled them, almost at the same time, to threaten and to attack the most distant objects, which attracted their desires; and as they always embarked a sufficient number of horses, they had no sooner landed, than they swept the dismayed country with a body of light cavalry. Yet, notwithstanding the example of their king, the native Vandals and Alani insensibly declined this toilsome and perilous warfare; the hardy generation of the first conquerors was almost extinguished, and their sons, who were born in Africa. enjoyed the delicious baths and gardens which had been acquired by the valor of their fathers. Theil place was readily supplied by a various multitude of Moors and Romans, of captives and outlaws; and those desperate wretches, who had already violated the laws of their country, were the most eager to promote the atrocious acts which disgrace the victories of\nbo Sidonius gives a tedious account (l. i. epist. xi. pp. 25–31) of a supper at Arles. to which he was invited by Majorian, a short time before his death. He had no intention of praising a deceased emperor : but a casual disinterested remark, “Subrisit Augustus; uterat, auctoritate servatā, cum se communioni dedisset, joci plenus,” outweighs the six hundred lines of his venal panegyric.\n57 Sidonius (Panegyr.

In the treatment of his unhappy prisoners, he sometimes consulted his avarice, and sometimes indulged his cruelty; and the massacre of five hundred noble citizens of Zante or Zacynthus, whose mangled bodies he cast into the Ionian Sea, was imputed, by the public indignation, to his latest posterity. Such crimes could not be excused by any provocations; - but the war, which the king of the Vandals prosecuted against the IRoman empire, was justified by a specious and reasonable motive. The widow of Valentinian, Eudoxia, whom he had led captive from Rome to Carthage, was the sole heiress of the Theodosian house; her elder daughter, Eudocia, became the reluctant wife of Hunneric, his eldest son; and the stern father, asserting a legal claim, which could not easily be refuted or satisfied, demanded a just proportion of the Imperial patrimony. An adequate, or at least a valuable, compensation, was offered by the Eastern emperor, to purchase a necessary peace. Eudoxia and her younger daughter, Placidia, were honorably restored, and the fury of the Vandals was confined to the limits of the Western empire. The Italians, destitute of a naval force, which alone was capable of protecting their coasts, implored the aid of the more fortunate nations of the East; who had formerly acknowledged, in peace and war, the supremacy of Rome. But the perpetual division of the two empires had alienated their interest and their inclinations; the faith of a recent treaty was alleged; and the Western Romans, instead of arms and ships, could only obtain the assistance of a cold and ineffectual mediation. The haughty Ricimer, who had long struggled with the difficulties of his situation, was at length reduced to address the throne of Constantinople, in the humble language of a subject; and Italy submitted, as the price and security of the alliance, to accept a master from the choice of the emperor of the East.” It is not the purpose of the present chapter, or even of the present volume, to continue the distinct series of the Byzantime history; but a concise view of the reign and character of the emperor Leo, may explain the last efforts that were attempted to save the falling empire of the West.” Since the death of the younger Theodosius, the domestic repose of Constantinople had never been interrupted by war or faction. Pulcheria had bestowed her hand, and the sceptre of the East, on the modest virtue of Marcian : he gratefully reverenced her august rank and virgin chastity; and, after her death, he gave his people the example of the religious worship that was due to the memory of the Imperial saint.” Attentive to the prosperity of his own dominions, Marcian seemed to behold, with indifference, the misfortunes of Rome; and the obstinate refusal of a brave and active prince, to draw his sword against the Vandals, was ascribed to a secret promise, which had formerly been exacted from him when he was a captive in the power of Genseric.” The death of Marcian, after a reign of seven years, would have exposed the East to the danger of a popular election; if the superior weight of a single family had not been able to incline the balance in favor of the candidate whose interest they supported. The patrician Aspar might have placed the diadem on his own head, if he would have subscribed the Nicene creed.\" During three generations, the armies of the East were successively commanded by his father, by himself, and by his son Ardaburius; his Barbarian guards formed a military force that overawed the palace and the capital; and the liberal distribution of his immense treasures rendered Aspar as popular as he was powerful. He recommended the obscure name of Leo of Thrace, a military tribune, and the principal steward of his household. His nomination was unanimously ratified by the senate; and the servant of Aspar received the Imperial crown from the hands of the patriarch or bishop, who was permitted to express, by this unusual cere. mony, the suffrage of the Deity.” This emperor, the first of the name of Leo, has been distinguished by the title of\n* The poet himself is compelled to acknowledge the distress of Ricimer:—\nPraeterea invictus Ricimer, quem publica fata\nItaly addresses her complaint to the Tiber, and Rome, at the solicitation of the river god, transports herself to Constantinople, renounces her ancient, claims, and implores the friendship of Aurora, the goddess of the East.

{"question":"How do researchers use fruit flies to study the progression of Huntington's disease?","answer":"Researchers created a fruit fly model by expressing the mutated huntingtin gene only in fruit fly neurons. They observe the flies' health through a 'climbing assay' where healthy flies climb upward when their test tube is tapped. The flies start showing signs of neurodegeneration at midlife (2 weeks of age) through motor impairments that progressively worsen. This model is beneficial because disease manifestation occurs in days rather than months or years, and the flies' neurons display characteristic huntingtin protein clumping similar to human patients.","context":["Neurological diseases are typically associated with a multitude of molecular changes. But out of these thousands of changes in gene expression, which ones are actually driving the disease? To answer this question, a team of scientists has developed a high-throughput, multi-pronged approach that integrates laboratory experiments, data from published literature and network analysis of large datasets. When the scientists applied their new approach to Huntington’s disease, they uncovered the functional significance of various molecular changes. This information not only provided a better understanding of the disease but also suggested new directions for developing therapeutic interventions. The study appears in the journal Cell Systems.\n“In this study we looked at gene expression data from numerous studies in Huntington’s disease,” said corresponding author Dr. Juan Botas, professor of molecular and human genetics and molecular and cellular biology at Baylor College of Medicine. “Previous studies had been conducted in different mouse models or different patient samples, sometimes with differing results. But this is actually a good thing; by comparing the genes that were affected repeatedly in different models, we were able to narrow down the set of genes to study from a few thousand to a few hundred.”\nBotas and his colleagues selected 312 genetic changes for a more detailed study. They then developed a setup that would allow them to test the effect of not a few, but many gene expression changes in a relatively short time. That’s when the fruit fly model came in.\nThe fruit fly is key\nThe researchers worked with a fruit fly model of Huntington’s disease they had previously developed by expressing, only in fruit fly neurons, the mutated huntingtin gene that causes the condition in people. The flies carrying the human mutated huntingtin gene are healthy when they are young, but at their midlife (2 weeks of age) they start to show signs of neurodegeneration that manifest as motor impairments that become progressively worse as the flies get older.\n“We measured the severity of the flies’ motor impairments in a ‘climbing assay’: tap a test tube with a dozen flies in it, and healthy flies will climb upward,” Botas said. “Flies whose neurons are sick can’t do this test very well. The benefit of fruit flies as an experimental model is that they’re easy to study in this way, and their short lives mean disease manifests in a matter of days rather than months or years, as it would in a mammalian model. In addition, the neurons of these fruit flies present with the characteristic clumping of huntingtin that also is present in people with the condition.”\nIn this fruit fly model, the researchers tested the 312 changes in gene expression they had selected. They reproduced and/or tried to counteract these changes, one by one, and determined their effect on the progression of the disease in the climbing test and on the level of huntingtin protein accumulated inside fruit fly neurons.\nThis strategy revealed interesting results, some of them totally unexpected. The researchers found that changes in the expression of genes involved in either inflammation or in building the architecture of cells drove the disease forward, while changes in genes involved in calcium signaling and homeostasis counteracted the disease. Interestingly, they discovered that genetic changes that aggravated the disease mediated their effect by making the huntingtin protein more stable inside neurons, which led to more protein accumulation and neurotoxicity. Counteracting the accumulation of huntingtin improved the health of the Huntington disease flies.\n“One of the findings that surprised us was that changes in the expression of genes involved in either inflammation or the cell’s architectural organization increased the accumulation of huntingtin inside neurons,” Botas said. “We were not expecting that those genes were involved in protein stability or turnover, but now we are encouraged to look for ways to improve the condition by interfering with those proteins to reduce the levels of huntingtin accumulation and neurotoxicity.”\nAlthough the researchers applied their novel strategy to study gene expression changes in Huntington’s disease, their approach also can be applied to investigate molecular alterations in many other neurological diseases."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"advanced_reasoning"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:d343e5e1-e357-4405-8605-e290f30e57bd>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do oxygen-based net community productivity (NCP) measurements compare with carbon-based photosynthetic pathways in terms of their environmental conditions and measurement methodologies?","answer":"Oxygen-based NCP measurements and carbon-based photosynthetic pathways use different approaches and operate under different conditions. NCP measurements use O2/Ar ratios in the surface ocean to estimate the balance between photosynthesis and respiration, with net autotrophy leading to oxygen increase and carbon decrease in the mixed layer. This is measured continuously using specialized equipment like Equilibrator Inlet Mass Spectrometry. In contrast, carbon-based photosynthetic pathways (C3, C4, CAM) are distinguished by their initial carbon fixation products and cellular organization, with specific temperature requirements - C3 plants operate best at 15-25°C, C4 at 30-40°C. While NCP measurements focus on community-level productivity in marine environments, carbon pathway measurements examine individual plant-level processes in terrestrial or aquatic environments.","context":["Net Community Productivity: in situ O2/Ar Measurements\nIn the surface ocean, net community productivity (NCP) is a function of photosynthesis and community respiration according to the following approximate stoichiometry,\n(1) 106 CO2 + 16 HNO3 + H3PO4 + 122 H2O ↔ (CH2O)106(NH3)16H3PO4 + 138 O2\nNCP can be estimated from the net change in the inventories of several upper ocean properties, notably of oxygen, organic and inorganic carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus. In equation (1), if the forward reaction (photosynthesis) exceeds the reverse reaction (respiration), the system is net autotrophic, which leads to an increase in oxygen and a decrease in inorganic carbon within the mixed layer. This net autotrophy is characterized by a net accumulation and sinking of organic carbon, in the form of particulate and dissolved organic carbon. On the other hand, if heterotrophy exceeds autotrophy within the mixed layer, oxygen decreases and inorganic carbon increases. Because oxygen and inorganic carbon have a gaseous component, a gas exchange flux component must be included in their mass balance budgets.\nNCP from oxygen mass balance\nBecause of the central role O2 plays in biological redox reactions in the surface ocean, the biological oxygen budget first and foremost reflects the net energetic balance. An ecosystem where the photochemical energy input is greater than the loss of potential energy from organic matter oxidation has a positive internal energy change. The oxygen balance also mirrors net organic carbon production because of the stoichiometric coupling of oxygen and carbon.\nOxygen in the mixed layer is however also influenced by physical processes such as bubble injection, temperature and pressure changes. Because argon (Ar) has similar solubility properties as oxygen, the oxygen derived from physical processes can be estimated from the argon concentration relative to its saturation ([Ar]sat). The oxygen derived from biology ([O2]b) is equal to the total oxygen minus the oxygen derived from physical processes ([O2]p):\n(2) [O2]b = [O2] – [O2]p ≈ [O2] – ([Ar]/[Ar]sat) = ([Ar]/[Ar]sat) [O2]sat Δ(O2/Ar)\n(3) Δ(O2/Ar) = [(O2/Ar)/(O2/Ar)sat-1]\nand is defined as the biological oxygen supersaturation. Analogous to the apparent O2 utilization (AOU), [O2]b is a synthetic tracer of biological activity within the mixed-layer, and can be negative if the mixed-layer is net heterotrophic.\nNeglecting vertical mixing, the biological oxygen net flux within the mixed-layer of the ocean is a function of the mass balance between net community oxygen production and exchange of biological oxygen with the atmosphere,\n(4) MLD d[O2]b/dt = NCP – kO2[O2]b\nwhere MLD is the mixed-layer depth, and kO2 is the gas exchange coefficient for oxygen (aka piston velocity). Substituting [O2]b in Eq. (4) with the term on the right-hand side of the equality sign in Eq. (2), NCP under steady-state conditions can be approximated by\n(5) NCP ≈ kO2 [O2]sat Δ(O2/Ar) ([Ar]/[Ar]sat) ≈ kO2 [O2]sat Δ(O2/Ar)\nWe ignore the argon saturation in Eq. (5) because it is close to one; it does not significantly alter the NCP estimates and is within the measurement errors. Under net auto (hetero)-trophic mixed-layer conditions, the net oxygen flux is out (in) of the ocean.\nBased on Eq. (5), NCP can be derived from 1) the oxygen concentration at saturation ([O2]sat), 2) a gas exchange coefficient (kO2), and 3) the biological oxygen supersaturation (Δ(O2/Ar)). We calculate the oxygen solubility from atmospheric pressure, temperature, and salinity measurements. The piston velocity for oxygen is estimated based on a windspeed reanalysis or satellite dataproducts and a windspeed parameterization. The piston velocity is weighted for the windspeed history at the collection site. Finally, the oxygen biological supersaturation is measured continuously by Equilibrator Inlet Mass Spectrometry (EIMS), a method previously described by Cassar et al. (2009). Briefly, seawater from the ships underway system is pumped through a gas equilibrator, the headspace of which is connected to a quadrupole mass spectrometer for continuous elemental O2/Ar ratio measurements, from which the biological oxygen supersaturation is estimated. From the O2/Ar supersaturation, the piston velocity, and the oxygen concentration at saturation, the net biological oxygen flux across the ocean surface is estimated based on Eq.(5).\nWith collaborators, we measure NCP in the world’s ocean to 1) constrain the magnitude, 2) assess the variability and 3) investigate the controls on productivity and carbon cycling in the surface ocean. See some of our publications for more information.\nSatellite estimates of NCP\nWe derived two statistical algorithms for predicting global oceanic NCP from satellite observations. To calibrate these two algorithms, we compiled a large dataset of in situ O2/Ar-NCP and remotely-sensed observations, including Sea Surface Temperature (SST), Net Primary Production (NPP), phytoplankton size composition, and inherent optical properties. The first algorithm is based on genetic programming (GP) which simultaneously searches for the optimal form and coefficients of NCP equations. We find that several GP solutions are consistent with NPP and SST being strong predictors of NCP. The second algorithm uses support vector regression (SVR) to optimize a numerical relationship between O2/Ar-NCP measurements and satellite observations. Both statistical algorithms can predict NCP relatively well, with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.68 for GP and 0.72 for SVR, which is comparable to other algorithms in the literature. However, our new algorithms predict more spatially uniform annual NCP distribution for the world’s oceans and higher annual NCP values in the Southern Ocean and the five oligotrophic gyres. We have used also used other machine learning methods (artificial neural networks; self-organizing maps; Bayesian hierarchical model) to derive algorithms at basin scales, and applied these products to understand controls on NCP at global, basin, and regional scales (e.g. Southern Ocean & Western Antarctic Peninsula). See some of our publications for more information.\nGross Primary Productivity: Dissolved Oxygen Triple Isotopes\nWe estimate gross primary productivity (GPP) in the oceanic mixed-layer based on the triple isotope composition of dissolved O2. Oxygen in the surface ocean has two main sources: the atmosphere and the photosynthetic splitting of water. These sources have distinct isotopic signatures. Atmospheric oxygen has a characteristic isotopic signature derived from a stratospheric reaction with a mass independent fractionation between O2, CO2, and ozone. Mass-independent fractionation is manifested in a non-zero 17Δ:\n(6) 17Δ = ln(0.001 δ17O + 1) – 0.516ln(0.001 δ18O+1) ~ δ17O – 0.516 δ18O\nThe overall isotopic signature of oxygen in the surface ocean thus depends on the weighted abundance of atmospheric and photosynthetic oxygen. The sinks for dissolved O2 in the surface ocean are respiration and gas exchange. These processes fractionate O2 mass dependently and therefore do not change 17Δ. GPP is the rate of photosynthetic O2 production required to maintain the observed departure of 17Δ from atmospheric equilibrium against dissipation from gas exchange.\nAtmospheric O2/N2 and Ar/N2 measurements\nMeasurements of atmospheric O2/N2 ratios provide a unique insight into the sinks of fossil fuel CO2, marine carbon cycling, productivity fluxes, and ocean circulation. For example, the seasonal cycle in “atmospheric potential oxygen”, a synthetic tracer combining the atmospheric O2 and CO2 signals and which is for all intent and purposes conservative with respect to the land biosphere, reflects the balance between marine net community productivity and ventilation of deep waters.\nConcurrent measurements of atmospheric O2 and CO2 can also be used to assess the partitioning of anthropogenic CO2 uptake between the land biosphere and the oceans. The observed increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration is less than predicted based on anthropogenic fossil fuel emissions. The difference between the predicted and the observed CO2 concentration represents a global CO2 sink, attributed to increases in land biosphere biomass and oceanic CO2 solubility. The atmospheric CO2 signal is obviously affected by both of these processes and by fossil fuel burning. On the other hand, the atmospheric oxygen signal only represents changes in the land biosphere biomass and fossil fuel burning.\nThe atmospheric ratio of argon to nitrogen (Ar/N2) varies seasonally because, in part, solubilities of these gases change with temperature. Since Ar is approximately twice as soluble as N2, the atmospheric Ar/N2 ratio increases as the surface oceans warm (i.e., spring, summer) and degas. The opposite occurs during cooling (i.e., fall, winter). At a given atmospheric sampling site, the Ar/N2 seasonal amplitude is a function of the oceanic temperature change, the air-sea gas exchange rate, and the dilution of the Ar/N2 signal by atmospheric transport and mixing. In this respect, atmospheric Ar/N2 is a valuable tracer of the complex interplay of upper ocean heating, air-sea gas flux kinetics, and atmospheric transport dynamics. Temporal (e.g., interannual) variability in these processes should be reflected in the atmospheric Ar/N2 record, and differences between sampling sites may highlight spatial variations in these processes. Furthermore, the rise in sea surface ocean temperature associated with global warming should manifest itself as a secular increase in the Ar/N2 ratio in air. The latter is difficult to observe because of the large noise to signal ratio. Comparing Ar/N2 observations with simulations from paired ocean-atmosphere models tests the robustness of simulations of upper ocean mixing, air-sea heat fluxes and atmospheric transport.\nWe investigate several aspects of algal physiology with implications for the biogeochemical cycle of carbon in the ocean, global climate change, and paleoceanography. Some of our current research interests include carbon-concentrating mechanisms (CCMs) and β-carboxylation in marine phytoplankton and their potential influence on photosynthetic carbon isotope fractionation, iron limitation, and diatom morphometrics.\nCarbon Assimilation in Marine Phytoplankton\nImportant but controversial laboratory and field studies suggest that marine primary productivity could be enhanced in response to increasing atmospheric CO2. Although inorganic carbon is abundant in seawater, most of it is in the form of bicarbonate (HCO3–) and carbonate (CO32-), which are not readily available to marine photoautotrophs. Ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase (RubisCO), the principal enzyme that fixes inorganic carbon during photosynthesis, is less than half saturated at normal seawater CO2 concentration. Hence, if phytoplankton species are unable to access inorganic carbon pools other than CO2, they could in fact be CO2 limited. Many phytoplankton species have evolved carbon-concentrating mechanisms to compensate for RubisCO’s catalytic inefficiency. Active uptake of HCO3– and CO2 through the cell membrane, active transport of inorganic carbon from the cellular membrane to the chloroplasts, and active, conversion of HCO3– to CO2 by a carbonic anhydrase-like mechanism are putative CCMs. We can gain insight into these various pathwayswith cellular energy minimization models, enzymatic assays, stable and radio-isotope carbon isotope fractionation and disequilibrium experiments. Most of our experiments are performed on chemostats under various CO2 concentrations. In a nutrient limited chemostat, the phytoplankton growth rate at steady state is equal to the dilution rate of the growth chamber.The partial pressure of CO2 in the gas used to aerate the growth chamber is controlled using mass-flow controllers to adjust the flow rates of tank CO2 and CO2-free medical air.\nCarbon Isotopes in Marine Phytoplankton\nDuring the photosynthetic process, marine phytoplankton preferentially fix 12C relative to 13C. The extent of fractionation between 12C and 13C is dependent on CO2 availability. As a result, the isotopic signature of phototrophic organic matter in marine sediments, such as δ13C37:2 of alkenones produced by some coccolithophores, can potentially be used to reconstruct atmospheric CO2 concentration over geological timescales. Unfortunately, a multitude of confounding factors may influence the dependence of photosynthetic carbon isotope fractionation (εp) on CO2. Variations in the degree of dependence of fractionation on CO2 call for more laboratory work. Few studies have looked at carbon-concentrating mechanisms (CCMs) in haptophytes and how these mechanisms affect εp. The contribution of inducible CCMs to εp in E. huxleyi can be further investigated by performing radiocarbon isotope disequilibrium experiments in conjunction with stable carbon isotope fractionation measurements on continuous growth cultures of E. huxleyi. A quantitative understanding of the still rather elusive physiological parameters that modulate εp is mandatory before the sedimentary carbon isotope record can be confidently interpreted for paleo-CO2 reconstruction. See some of our publications for more information.\nEquilibrator Inlet Mass Spectrometry (EIMS)\nWe designed a new method for continuous shipboard measurements of O2/Ar by equilibrator inlet mass spectrometry (EIMS). From these measurements and an appropriate gas exchange parameterization, NCP can be estimated at unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution. This new instrument has now been deployed successfully several times in the Southern Ocean, Bering Sea, and the Pacific and Atlantic Ocean.\nIn the EIMS configuration, seawater from the ship’s continuous intake flows through a cartridge enclosing a gas-permeable microporous membrane contactor. Gases in the headspace of the cartridge equilibrate with dissolved gases in the flowing seawater. A fused-silica capillary continuously samples headspace gases, and the O2/Ar ratio is measured by mass spectrometry. The ion current measurements on the mass spectrometer reflect the partial pressures of dissolved gases in the water flowing through the equilibrator. Calibration of the O2/Ar ion current ratio (32/40) is performed automatically every 2 h by sampling ambient air through a second capillary. N2/Ar and pCO2 may potentially also be measured by EIMS.\nEIMS. The large seawater reservoir (A) sits in a sink. After going through an inline coarse filter (500 μm pore size), seawater flows into the inner reservoir (B) at a rate of 3-5 L min-1 (large arrow). Most of the water running into B overflows into A, which is for thermoregulation of the system. A small fraction (100 mL min-1) of the high flow rate is pulled with a gear pump through a filter sleeve (C), with 100 and 5 μm pore size on the outside and inside, respectively. From the gear pump, the seawater flows through the equilibrator (D). The equilibrator sits in reservoir A to keep its temperature identical to that of the incoming seawater. A capillary, attached to the headspace of the equilibrator, leads to a multiport Valco valve. This valve alternates between admitting gas from the equilibrator and ambient air to the quadrupole mass spectrometer. An optode (not shown) in container B measures total oxygen saturation. Also not shown is a water flow meter located downstream of the equilibrator and thermocouples monitoring temperatures throughout the system.\nDual Isotope Cavity Ring-Down Laser Absorption Spectroscopy\nIn collaboration with Kuan Huang (Picarro), Michael Bender (Princeton University) and other collaborators, we have developed a new method for continuous measurement of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). The method is based on dual isotope dilution and cavity ring-down spectroscopy (DID-CRDS). In this method, seawater is continuously sampled and mixed with a flow of NaH13CO3 solution that is also enriched in deuterated water (the spike). The isotopic composition of CO2 (δ13Cspiked_sample) derived from the DIC in the mixture, and the D/H ratio of the mixed water (δDspiked_sample), are measured by CRDS analyzers. See Huang et al. (2015) for more information.\nARACAS: N2 fixation in terrestrial environments\nThe most common currency for estimating N2 fixation is acetylene reduction to ethylene. Real-time estimates of nitrogen fixation are needed to close the global nitrogen budget and remain a critical gap in both laboratory and field experiments. We present a new method for continuous real-time measurements of ethylene production: Acetylene Reduction Assays by Cavity ring down laser Absorption Spectroscopy (ARACAS). In ARACAS, air in the headspace of an incubation chamber is circulated with a diaphragm pump through a cavity ring-down ethylene spectrometer and back to the incubation chamber. The new approach offers several benefits compared to the conventional detection of ethylene by flame ionization detector gas chromatography. First, the detection of acetylene reduction to ethylene is non-intrusive and chemically non-destructive, allowing for real-time measurements of nitrogenase activity. Second, the measurements are made instantaneously and continuously at ppb levels, allowing for observation of real-time kinetics on time intervals as short as a few seconds. Third, the instrument can be automated for long time periods of measurement.\nWe illustrate its use for measuring N2 fixation using two species, the diazotrophic bacterium Azotobacter vinelandii and the lichen Peltigera praetextata. Using ARACAS, we also characterize short-term kinetics of N2 fixation by cyanobacteria on moss carpets from warm and cold temperate forests. We report the identification of a heretofore unknown multispecies true-moss-cyanobacteria diazotrophic association. We demonstrate that short-term change in abiotic variables greatly influences N2fixation. We also show that difference in relative proportion of two epiphytic diazotrophs is consistent with divergent influences of temperature on their N2 fixation kinetics. See some of our publications for more information.\nFARACAS: N2 fixation in freshwater and oceanic environments\nBecause of the difficulty in resolving the large variability of N2 fixation with current methods which rely on discrete sampling, the development of new methods for high resolution measurements is highly desirable. We present a new method for high-frequency measurements of aquatic N2 fixation by continuous flow-through incubations and spectral monitoring of the acetylene (C2H2, a substrate analog for N2) reduction to ethylene (C2H4). In this method, named “Flow-through incubation Acetylene Reduction Assays by Cavity ring-down laser Absorption Spectroscopy” (FARACAS), dissolved C2H2 is continuously admixed with seawater upstream of a continuous-flow stirred-tank reactor (CFSR) in which C2H2 reduction takes place. Downstream of the flow-through incubator, the C2H4 gas is stripped using a bubble column contactor and circulated with a diaphragm pump into a wavelength-scanned Cavity Ring Down laser absorption Spectrometer (CRDS). Our method provides high-resolution and precise mapping of aquatic N2 fixation, its diel cycle, and its response to environmental gradients, and can be adapted to measure other biological processes. The short-duration of the flow-through incubations without preconcentration of cells minimizes potential artefacts such as bottle containment effects while providing near real-time estimates for adaptive sampling. We expect that our new method will improve the characterization of the biogeography and kinetics of aquatic N2 fixation rates. See some of our publications for more information.","The assimilation of carbon dioxide from the sunlight, for the process of photosynthesis and then converting it to glucose (energy) synthesizing different product is the key difference between the three. So during the CO2 fixation, when the photosynthetic plants produce 3-phosphoglyceric acid (PGA) or 3- carbon acid as the first product is called C3 pathway.\nBut when the photosynthetic plant, prior going to the C3 pathway, produces oxaloacetic acid (OAA) or 4 -carbon compound as their first stable product is called as C4 or Hatch and Slack pathway. But when the plants absorb the energy of the sunlight at the day time and use this energy for the assimilation or fixing the carbon dioxide at night time is called as crassulacean acid metabolism or CAM.\nThese procedures are followed by plants, certain species of bacteria and algae for the production of energy, independent of their habitat. The synthesis of energy, using carbon dioxide and water as the primary source to gain nutrients from air and water is termed as photosynthesis. This is the prime process for the living being which produces food on their own\nIn this content, we will be considering the essential difference between the three types of pathways followed by plants and few microorganisms and a small description about them.\nContent: C3, C4, and CAM pathways\n|Basis for Comparison||C3 pathway||C4 pathway||CAM|\n|Definition||Such plants whose first product after the carbon assimilation from sunlight is 3-carbon molecule or 3-phosphoglyceric acid for the |\nproduction of energy is called C3 plants, and the pathway is called as the C3 pathway.

They grow best at an optimum temperature between 65 to 75°F with the soil temperature suited at 40- 45°F. These types of plants show less efficiency at high temperature.\nThe primary product of C3 plants is 3-carbon acid or 3-phosphoglyceric acid (PGA). This is considered as the first product during carbon dioxide fixation. The C3 pathway completes in three steps: carboxylation, reduction, and regeneration.\nC3 plants reduce into the CO2 directly in the chloroplast. With the help of ribulose biphosphate carboxylase (RuBPcase), the two molecules of 3-carbon acid or 3-phosphoglyceric acid are produced. This 3- phosphoglyceric justifies the name of the pathway as C3.\nIn another step, NADPH and ATP phosphorylate to give 3-PGA and glucose. And then the cycle again starts by regenerating the RuBP.\nThe C3 pathway is the single step process, takes place in the chloroplast. This organelle act as the storage of sunlight energy. Of the total plant present on earth, 85 percent uses this pathway for the production of energy.\nThe C3 plants can be perennial or annual. They are highly proteinaceous than the C4 plants. The examples of annual C3 plants are wheat, oats, and rye and the perennial plants include fescues, ryegrass, and orchardgrass. C3 plants provide a higher amount of protein than the C4 plants.\nDefinition of C4 pathway or Hatch and Slack pathway.\nPlants, especially in the tropical region, follow this pathway. Before Calvin or C3 cycle, some plants follow the C4 or Hatch and Slack pathway. It is a two step process where Oxaloacetic acid (OAA) which is a 4-carbon compound is produced. It occurs in mesophyll and bundle sheath cell present in a chloroplast.\nWhen the 4-carbon compound is produced, it is sent to the bundle sheath cell, here the 4-carbon molecule further get splits into a carbon dioxide and the 3-cabon compound. Eventually, the C3 pathway starts to produce energy, where the 3-carbon compound act as the precursor.\nC4 plants are also known as warm-season or tropical plants. These can be perennial or annual.The perfect temperature to grow for these plants is 90-95°F. The C4 plants are much more efficient in utilizing nitrogen and gathering carbon dioxide from the soil and atmosphere. The protein content is low as compared to C3 plants.\nThese plants got their name from the product called as oxaloacetate which is 4 carbon acid. The examples of perennial C4 plants are Indian grass, Bermudagrass, switchgrass, big bluestem and that of annual C4 plants are sudangrasses, corn, pearl millet.\nDefinition of CAM plants\nThe noteworthy remark which distinguishes this process from the above two is that in this type of photosynthesis the organism absorbs the energy from the sunlight at the day time and uses this energy at the night time for the assimilation of carbon dioxide.\nIt is a kind of adaptation at the time of periodic drought. This process permits an exchange of gases at the night time when the air temperature is cooler, and there is the loss of water vapor.\nAround 10% of the vascular plants have adapted the CAM photosynthesis but mainly found in plants grown in the arid region. The plants like cactus and euphorbias are the examples. Even the orchids and bromeliads, adapted this pathway due to an irregular water supply.\nIn the day time, malate gets decarboxylated to provide CO2 for the fixation of the Benson-Calvin cycle in closed stomata. The main feature of CAM plants is an assimilation of CO2 at night into malic acid, stored in the vacuole. PEP carboxylase plays the main role in the production of malate.\nKey Differences of C3, C4 and CAM plants.\nAbove we discuss the procedure for obtaining the energy of these different types, below we will discuss the key differences among three:\n- C3 pathway or C3 plants can be defined as those kind plants whose first product after the carbon assimilation from sunlight is 3-carbon molecule or 3-phosphoglyceric acid for the production of energy. It is most commonly used by plants; While plants in tropical area, convert the sunlight energy into C4 carbon molecule or oxaloacetic acid, this cycle takes place before the C3 cycle and then with the help of enzymes it carries the further process of getting nutrients, is called C4 plants and pathway is called as C4 pathway. This pathway is more efficient than the C3 pathway. On the other hand, the plants which store the energy from the sun at day time and then convert it into energy at night follows the CAM or crassulacean acid metabolism.\n- Cells involved in a C3 pathway are mesophyll cells and to that of the C4 pathway are mesophyll cell, bundle sheath cells, but CAM follows both C3 and C4 in same mesophyll cells.\n- An example of C3 are Sunflower, Spinach, Beans, Rice, Cotton, while the example of C4 plants is Sugarcane, Sorghum, and Maize, and Cacti, orchids are the example of CAM plants.\n- C3 can be seen in all photosynthetic plants, while C4 is followed by tropical plants and CAM by Semi-arid condition plants.\n- Types of plants using C3 cycle are mesophytic, hydrophytic, xerophytic but C4 is followed in mesophytic plants and Xerophytic follows CAM.\n- Photorespiration is present in the higher rate while it is not easily detectable in C4 and CAM.\n- 12 NADPH and 18 ATPs in the C3 cycle; 12 NADPH and 30 ATPs in C4 and 12 NADPH and 39 ATPs are required for the production of glucose.\n- 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PGA) is first stable product of C3 pathway; Oxaloacetate (OAA) for C4 pathway and Oxaloacetate (OAA) at night, 3 PGA at daytime in CAM.\n- Optimum temperature for photosynthesis in C3 is 15-25 ° C; 30-40 ° C in C4 plants and > 40°C in CAM\n- Carboxylating Enzyme is RuBP carboxylase in C3 plants, but in C4 plants it is PEP carboxylase (in mesophyll) and RuBP carboxylase (in bundle sheath) while in CAM it is PEP carboxylase (in the dark) and RuBP carboxylase (in light).\n- CO2: ATP: NADPH2 ratio 1:3:2 in C3, 1:5:2 in C4 and 1:6.5:2 in CAM.\n- The initial CO2 acceptor is Ribulose-1,5-biphophate(RuBP) in a C3 pathway and Phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) in C4 and CAM.\n- Kranz Anatomy is present in the C4 pathway only, and it is absent in C3 and CAM plants.\n- The CO2 compensation point (ppm) is 30-70 in C3 plant; 6-10 in C4 plants and 0-5 in the dark in CAM.\nWe all are aware of the fact that plants prepare their food, by the process of photosynthesis. They convert atmospheric carbon dioxide into plant food or energy (glucose). But as the plants grow in the different habitat, they have different atmospheric and climatic condition; they differ in the process of gaining energy.\nLike in case C4 and CAM pathways are the two adaptations arose by natural selection, for the survival of the plants of high temperature and arid region. So we can say that these are the three distinct biochemical methods, of plants to obtain energy and C3 is the most common among them."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:43994d8f-c6dc-424b-b2cc-33fc303bb4db>","<urn:uuid:dfede0e3-f798-46bd-bb1f-508396583cc3>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the benefits of using controlled environments for plant growth, and how do their energy requirements compare to those of digital assets in terms of U.S. electricity consumption?","answer":"Controlled environments for plant growth, like glass containers for rhododendron seedlings, offer significant benefits including precise humidity control, protection from harmful fungi through the use of sphagnum moss, and efficient nutrient delivery. These setups require minimal energy input, needing only basic artificial lighting (40 watts) during dark periods. In contrast, digital assets consume substantially more electricity - crypto-asset operations use about 0.9% to 1.7% of total U.S. electricity usage, comparable to all home computers or residential lighting in the country. While the plant growing system is self-sustaining and can function for months with minimal intervention due to the natural properties of sphagnum moss, crypto-asset mining requires constant, intensive energy input and has raised concerns about grid reliability and environmental impact.","context":["Growing Rhododendron Seedlings in Glass Containers\nJohannes Hedegaard, Lyngby, Denmark\nAn easy and nearly infallible method to grow rhododendrons from seed, is to sow in preserving glasses, or in small aquariums with a piece of glass as a lid.\nThe sowing medium is fine cut, living, green sphagnum moss, which has the advantage of being nearly free from injurious fungi: further it is tremendous in respect to holding water, and with a pH about 3.5.\nThe process begins by placing a layer, say 2 inches of coarsely cut green sphagnum on the bottom, saturated with rainwater, or other water free of lime. This is covered, ½ to 1 inch with very finely cut green sphagnum. In this last operation use only the green parts, but avoid the tops themselves, because those can overgrow the seeds before the seedlings have developed.\nNow, pack the sphagnum down fairly tightly and sow on the surface; do not cover the seeds, but put on the glass lid for closing the container. Put it in a place where the temperature will reach 70° F. inside the glass. Never leave it in the sun, where the temperature will increase disastrously, but in very good light.\nThe conditions needed for germination are: heat, water, and oxygen. In the closed container, with the wet moss, the humidity will soon increase, and soften the seed shells making them permeable. The oxygen, released by the photosynthesis in the green leaves of the moss, will speed up hormone and enzymatic activity, inside the embryo.\nThe germination commonly takes place in 10 to 14 days, during which time the lid must not be opened. When the germination is well advanced, not more than room temperature is needed, and one can now open the lid daily, beginning with about 10 minutes a day. It is, on the other hand, possible to leave the seedlings, under these conditions, without any attention for a long time, because the moss contains a lot of feeding materials, such as: Mg, K, N, Ca, Phosphate and Nitrate. I have held R. schlippenbachii myself in this way for several months, and without opening the lid at all.\nPricking-off time is when 3 to 4 pairs of leaves have developed, not earlier in this technique. Pricking-off medium is, 1 part Dutch peat, 1 part coarse sand, (best is fine granulated granite) and 1 part of shredded green sphagnum. The easiest way to mix these materials is under dry conditions, and afterwards water in as necessary.\nThe seedlings, now pricked-off in boxes, are placed in an atmosphere of medium high humidity, under a plastic tent or something like that, and hardened off the following 14 to 20 days.\nI normally sow in the middle of October, and am ready for the first pricking-off in January. During the dark wintertime the plants must have artificial light, not very much, about 40 watts approximately 18 inches above for 16 to 18 hours. I use, for this purpose, the American product, \"Gro-Lux\" fluorescent lamps, which in my opinion is the very best I can get hold of here in Denmark.","FACT SHEET: Climate and Energy Implications of Crypto-Assets in the United States\nClimate change is one of the most pressing problems confronting our nation and our world, and President Biden has taken bold steps to address it with legislation and policy. Among the President’s commitments are: protecting communities from pollution, reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2030, achieving a carbon pollution-free electricity grid by 2035, and reaching net-zero greenhouse gas emissions no later than 2050.\nTo achieve these ambitious goals, we must ensure that emerging technologies contribute to a net-zero, clean energy future. The use of digital assets based on distributed ledger technology (DLT) is expanding. Digital assets are a form of value, represented digitally. As an emerging technological innovation, digital assets have provided some benefits and value for some residents and businesses in the United States, and have the potential for future benefits with emerging uses.\nCrypto-assets are digital assets that are implemented using cryptographic techniques. Crypto-assets can require considerable amounts of electricity usage, which can result in greenhouse gas emissions, as well as additional pollution, noise, and other local impacts to communities living near mining facilities. Depending on the energy intensity of the technology and the sources of electricity used, the rapid growth of crypto-assets could potentially hinder broader efforts to achieve U.S. climate commitments to reach net-zero carbon pollution.\nIn March, in Executive Order 14067 on Ensuring the Responsible Development of Digital Assets, President Biden made clear that the responsible development of digital assets includes reducing negative climate impacts and environmental pollution. The Executive Order directed the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), in coordination with other federal agencies, to produce a report on the climate and energy implications of crypto-assets in the United States. OSTP assembled an interdisciplinary team of experts to assess and extend existing studies with new analysis, based on peer-reviewed studies and the best available data.\nToday, OSTP published its report, examining the challenges and opportunities of crypto-assets for the United States’ clean energy and climate change goals, and providing a set of recommendations to further study and track impacts of the sector, develop potential performance standards, and provide tools and resources to reduce negative impacts. This report’s assessment and recommendations align with federal actions that reduce greenhouse gas emissions to protect public health and welfare, grow a clean energy economy with good-paying jobs, and improve environmental justice.\nCrypto-Assets Can Be Energy-Intensive, and the United States Has a Major Crypto-Asset Sector\nFrom 2018 to 2022, annualized electricity usage from global crypto-assets grew rapidly, with estimates of electricity usage doubling to quadrupling. As of August 2022, published estimates of the total global electricity usage for crypto-assets are between 120 and 240 billion kilowatt-hours per year, a range that exceeds the total annual electricity usage of many individual countries, such as Argentina or Australia. This is equivalent to 0.4% to 0.9% of annual global electricity usage, and is comparable to the annual electricity usage of all conventional data centers in the world.\nNearly all crypto-asset electricity usage is driven by consensus mechanisms: the DLT used to mine and verify crypto-assets. The dominant consensus mechanism is called Proof of Work (PoW), which is used by the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains. Bitcoin and Ether combined represent more than 60% of total crypto-asset market capitalization. The PoW mechanism is designed to require more computing power as more entities attempt to validate transactions for coin rewards, and this feature helps disincentivize malicious actors from attacking the network. As of August 2022, Bitcoin is estimated to account for 60% to 77% of total global crypto-asset electricity usage, and Ethereum is estimated to account for 20% to 39%.\nThe energy efficiency of mining equipment has been increasing, but electricity usage continues to rise. Other less energy-intensive crypto-asset ledger technologies exist, with different attributes and uses. Switching to alternative crypto-asset technologies such as Proof of Stake could dramatically reduce overall power usage to less than 1% of today’s levels.\nThe United States is estimated to host about a third of global crypto-asset operations, which currently consume about 0.9% to 1.7% of total U.S. electricity usage. This range of electricity usage is similar to all home computers or residential lighting in the United States. Crypto-asset mining is also highly mobile. The United States currently hosts the world’s largest Bitcoin mining industry, totaling more than 38% of global Bitcoin activity, up from 3.5% in 2020. Despite the potential for rapid growth, future electricity demand from crypto-asset operations is uncertain, demonstrating the need for better data to understand and monitor electricity usage from crypto-assets.\nCrypto-Assets Can Have Significant Environmental Impacts\nGlobal electricity generation for the crypto-assets with the largest market capitalizations resulted in a combined 140 ± 30 million metric tons of carbon dioxide per year (Mt CO2/y), or about 0.3% of global annual greenhouse gas emissions. Crypto-asset activity in the United States is estimated to result in approximately 25 to 50 Mt CO2/y, which is 0.4% to 0.8% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. This range of emissions is similar to emissions from diesel fuel used in railroads in the United States.\nBesides purchased grid electricity, crypto-asset mining operations can also cause local noise and water impacts, electronic waste, air and other pollution from any direct usage of fossil-fired electricity, and additional air, water, and waste impacts associated with all grid electricity usage. These local impacts can exacerbate environmental justice issues for neighboring communities, which are often already burdened with other pollutants, heat, traffic, or noise. The growth of energy-intensive crypto-asset technologies, when not directly using clean electricity, could hinder the ability of the United States to achieve its National Determined Contribution under the Paris Agreement, and to avoid the most severe impacts of climate change. Broader adoption of crypto-assets, and the potential introduction of new types of digital assets require action by the federal government to encourage and ensure responsible development. This includes minimizing negative impacts on local communities, significantly reducing energy intensity, and powering with clean electricity.\nDistributed Ledger Technologies May Help with Climate Monitoring or Mitigation\nDLT may have a role to play in enhancing market infrastructure for a range of environmental markets like carbon credit markets, though other solutions might work as well or better. The potential benefits of DLT would need to outweigh the additional emissions and other environmental externalities that result from operations to merit broader use, relative to the markets or mechanisms that DLT displaces. Use cases are still emerging, and like all emerging technologies, there are potential positive and negative use cases yet to be imagined. Responsible development of this technology would encourage innovation in DLT applications while reducing energy intensity and minimizing environmental damages.\nKey Recommendations of the Report\nTo help the United States meet its climate objectives, crypto-asset policy during the transition to clean energy should be focused on several objectives: reduce greenhouse gas emissions, avoid operations that will increase the cost of electricity to consumers, avoid operations that reduce the reliability of electric grids, and avoid negative impacts to equity, communities, and the local environment.\nTo ensure the responsible development of digital assets, recommendations include the following actions for consideration:\n- Minimize greenhouse gas emissions, environmental justice impacts, and other local impacts from crypto-assets: The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Department of Energy (DOE), and other federal agencies should provide technical assistance and initiate a collaborative process with states, communities, the crypto-asset industry, and others to develop effective, evidence-based environmental performance standards for the responsible design, development, and use of environmentally responsible crypto-asset technologies. These should include standards for very low energy intensities, low water usage, low noise generation, clean energy usage by operators, and standards that strengthen over time for additional carbon-free generation to match or exceed the additional electricity load of these facilities. Should these measures prove ineffective at reducing impacts, the Administration should explore executive actions, and Congress might consider legislation, to limit or eliminate the use of high energy intensity consensus mechanisms for crypto-asset mining. DOE and EPA should provide technical assistance to state public utility commissions, environmental protection agencies, and the crypto-asset industry to build capacity to minimize emissions, noise, water impacts, and negative economic impacts of crypto-asset mining; and to mitigate environmental injustices to overburdened communities.\n- Ensure energy reliability: DOE, in coordination with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation and its regional entities, should conduct reliability assessments of current and projected crypto-asset mining operations on electricity system reliability and adequacy. If these reliability assessments find current or anticipated risks to the power system as a result crypto-asset mining, these entities should consider developing, updating, and enforcing reliability standards and emergency operations procedures to ensure system reliability and adequacy under the growth of crypto-asset mining.\n- Obtain data to understand, monitor, and mitigate impacts: The Energy Information Administration and other federal agencies should consider collecting and analyzing information from crypto-asset miners and electric utilities in a privacy-preserving manner to enable evidence-based decisions on the energy and climate implications of crypto-assets. Data should include mining energy usage and fuel mix, power purchase agreements, environmental justice implications, and demand response participation. OSTP could establish a National Science and Technology Council subcommittee to coordinate with other relevant agencies to assess the energy use of major crypto-assets.\n- Advance energy efficiency standards: The Administration should consider working with Congress to enable DOE and encourage other federal regulators to promulgate and regularly update energy conservation standards for crypto-asset mining equipment, blockchains, and other operations.\n- Encourage transparency and improvements in environmental performance: Crypto-asset industry associations, including mining firms and equipment manufacturers, should be encouraged to publicly report crypto-asset mining locations, annual electricity usage, greenhouse gas emissions using existing protocols, and electronic waste recycling performance.\n- Further research to improve understanding and innovation: For improved analytical capabilities that can enhance the accuracy of electricity usage estimates and sustainability, the National Science Foundation, DOE, EPA and other relevant agencies could promote and support research and development priorities that improve the environmental sustainability of digital assets, including crypto-asset impact modeling, assessment of environmental justice impacts, and understanding beneficial uses for grid management and environmental mitigation. Research and development priorities should emphasize innovations in next-generation digital asset technologies that advance U.S. goals in security, privacy, equity, and resilience, as well as U.S. climate goals."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:9b066210-08d7-41e9-a876-ca63e5400518>","<urn:uuid:c2b3e9e1-0ef3-465d-9a23-92fdbe2309a6>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do cooling system problems like low coolant compare to head gasket failure in terms of symptoms - can you tell them apart?","answer":"While cooling system problems and head gasket failure share some symptoms, head gasket failure typically presents more diverse and severe indicators. Simple cooling issues like low coolant mainly show through overheating and can be resolved by topping up fluid levels. However, head gasket failure exhibits multiple distinctive symptoms including white exhaust smoke, milky coolant, bubbling in the cooling system, external oil/coolant leaks, poor engine performance, and persistent coolant loss without visible leaks. Additionally, head gasket failure can cause fluid mixing (oil and coolant) and allow combustion gases to escape into the cooling system - symptoms not typically seen with basic cooling system problems.","context":["6 Common Reasons for an Overheating Engine\nAn overheating engine is a huge problem and can have the potential for automotive disaster. Being out and about driving and suddenly finding that steam is pouring from your engine will no doubt scare you. There could be a whole host of reasons as to the cause of such an issue, from something quite simple to something far more dangerous.\n1 – The Thermostat\nIf the thermostat in the engine is running correctly, the engine heat will be dissipated and distributed properly and the temperature gauge will register within its normal parameters. If the thermostat quits working or fails to open at the appropriate time, the coolant flow will become blocked and prevent the coolant fluid from circulating in the engine system. That can cause your vehicle engine to overheat.\n2 – Faulty Sensor\nIf there are no visible signs of the engine over heating, but your temperature gauge is indicating otherwise, you might take a look at the coolant sensor. If any sensor is faulty it will give out false readings and information and in this case will fool your car into believing it is over heating, when it fact it isn’t.\n3 – Cooling Fan Issues\nAn inefficient or faulty cooling fan on your vehicle will inevitably cause over heating issues. When your vehicle uses the coolant through the system the heat it consumes it has to be exhausted somehow. In order for the radiator to perform its function properly, the cooling fan needs to be working at its optimal capacity.\n4 – Low Coolant level\nIt is not just the water in your system that helps cool the engine. Coolant is vital throughout the year to help regulate inner temperatures. Throughout winter the coolant helps keep the engine from icing and in summer, from overheating. Low coolant levels can cause overheating. You can temporarily top up with water if you are stuck without coolant but you should replace the balance as soon as you can.\n5 – Water Pump Issues\nA faulty water pump is a sure sign your vehicle will overheat. If the pump fails to pump, the water fails to circulate and cool the system. If the water is not cooling the system, the heat will have nowhere to escape to and will therefore find other means of releasing. You will definitely see signs of overheating in your engine if your water pump is busted.\n6 – Radiator Cap\nYou might think it is an odd thing to consider, but, if your radiator cap is not screwed down tightly, steam will escape from it and water too. When the water in your engine reaches boiling point it will bubble over and hit the hot metal on the outside, causing steam to escape out of the hood of the car. The best course of action is to stop, turn off the engine, let it cool down for at least 15 minutes and then top the water up, replace the cap correctly and start the engine again.","Last Updated on July 5, 2021\nWith time, aging internal combustion engines become prone to a number of possible failures. While some of these failures are quite minor in scope, others can lead to severe drivability issues, which often necessitate costly repair. This, of course, is never a desirable situation.\nOf these more severe issues, few are as despised as a blown head gasket. A blown head gasket is high on the list of troubling issues encountered by motorists, whose engines have begun to show their age. Unfortunately, head gasket repair is seldom simple, or cheap. This fact alone is a common source of concern for those facing such issues.\nWhile blown head gaskets are not extremely common, failures of this type do occur often enough to place increased importance upon recognizing the symptoms of such a condition. By quickly identifying these symptoms, a repair can be promptly initiated, thereby getting your vehicle back on the road in record time.\nRead on to learn more about the role of an engine’s head gasket, as well as the various symptoms that accompany a blown head gasket.\nWhat is a Head Gasket?\nA head gasket is the specialty seal that lies between an internal engine’s block and cylinder head(s). This seal prevents combustion gasses from escaping an engine’s cylinders, while also preventing the transfer of coolant and oil into an engine’s combustion chambers.\nEach engine has 1-2 head gaskets, depending upon the exact arrangement of a particular engine’s cylinders. Inline engines feature only one cylinder head and therefore possess only one head gasket. On the contrary, “V” configuration engines feature two individual cylinder heads and therefore feature a total of two head gaskets.\nSee Also: V6 vs V8 engine\nIn the past, copper head gaskets were quite common among production engines, as were various composite gaskets, which typically consisted of graphite or asbestos. Today, most production head gaskets are of a Multi-Layer Steel (MLS) design. These gaskets feature 2-5 layers of thin steel, which are commonly coated in a rubberized coating.\nAn engine’s head gasket(s) are sandwiched in place between an engine’s block and heads, with the use of precisely torqued head bolts. In many cases, these bolts are of the torque-to-yield variety and stretch when tightened to provide the best possible clamping seal.\nAn engine’s head bolts are also torqued in a specific manner, which often involves working outward from each head’s centermost bolts.\nWhat Does it Mean to “Blow” a Head Gasket?\nThe term “blown head gasket”, is used to describe a head gasket that has been structurally compromised. This compromised segment of a head gasket prevents a proper sealment between an engine’s block deck/cylinder heads. This creates a leak, which can manifest in several different ways.\nDepending upon the exact point of failure within a head gasket, several different issues can present themselves. Coolant or oil can be displaced into one or more of an engine’s cylinders, or be purged externally. Additionally, oil and coolant can be displaced into one another, leading to the mixing of fluids.\nA leaking head gasket can also allow combustion gases to escape into an engine’s cooling system or into the crankcase itself. Alternatively, a blown head gasket can allow combustion gases of a particular cylinder to escape externally, or into an adjacent cylinder.\nHead gasket leaks of any type can lead to a number of drivability related issues, which can compound as the severity of such a leak progresses. Some of the most serious secondary issues related to a blown head gasket include overheating and compression loss.\nSigns of a Blown Head Gasket\nA blown head gasket can present many symptoms, which can aid in diagnosis. The prevalence of these symptoms typically varies on a case by case basis and is largely dependent upon the exact portion of the head gasket that has been affected.\nThe following are several of the most common symptoms of head gasket failure.\n#1 – White-Colored Exhaust Smoke\nIf a blown head gasket allows coolant to enter one or more of an engine’s cylinders, white exhaust smoke is likely to be noticed.\nThis comes as a byproduct of coolant that is burnt during combustion and downstream travel through a vehicle’s exhaust system.\n#2 – Continual Coolant Loss\nIf your car appears to be losing coolant at a consistent rate, without any visible leaks, there is a good chance that your engine’s head gasket is to blame.\nDue to the internal nature of a head gasket leak, coolant is often burnt, without ever being visually expelled.\n#3 – Bubbling In Cooling System\nA slow, steady bubbling of coolant within a vehicle’s radiator or surge tank is often a sign of ill-directed combustion gases. A specialized combustion gas detector can be used to confirm such a condition with relative ease.\n#4 – Milky Coolant\nA head gasket leak often manifests as the swapping of oil and coolant. This often leads to a drastic change in coolant conditions. When this occurs, coolant often takes on a grey or brown coloring and appears milky in state.\nRelated: Different Types of Coolant\n#5 – External Oil/Coolant Leaks\nIn certain instances, a blown head gasket can cause a visually evident coolant or oil leak. This leak will be present at the mating point between an engine’s block and the cylinder head above.\nIn rare cases, small bubbles can be observed in leaking fluids of this nature, as small amounts of compression are also purged.\nRead Also: Valve Cover Gasket Leak Symptoms\n#6 – Engine Overheating\nA blown head gasket commonly leads to engine overheating. This occurs for several different reasons, the most common of which relate to coolant loss.\nAdditionally, the escape of combustion gases into an engine’s cooling system can also play a part in overheating.\n#7 – Poor Engine Performance\nIn instances where compression is lost through a compromised head gasket, an engine’s performance will almost certainly suffer.\nThis tends to be especially true when a head gasket is blown between two individual cylinders, as compression is allowed to escape through open valves of an adjacent combustion chamber.\nWhat Causes a Head Gasket to Fail?\nA head gasket can fail for several different reasons. However, none are as pronounced as overheating. Engine overheating, such as that caused by a significant coolant leak, can lead to the sudden onset of head gasket related issues.\nOverheating destroys a head gasket due primarily to the sudden expansion of metal along an engine’s critical surfaces. The more severe an episode of overheating is, the higher the chance of head gasket failure becomes.\nSignificant expansion of an engine’s cylinder heads or block deck creates a separation between both surfaces, which can ultimately compromise a head gasket’s seal. Even if a single episode of overheating does not cause immediate head gasket failure, the integrity of this seal will forever be weakened.\nDetonation, or the sudden ignition of fuel/air outside of the flame front, can also lead to eventual head gasket failure. This stems from the fact that detonation causes damage to a head gasket’s firing rings, which ultimately allows compression seepage.\nCan You Drive With a Blown Head Gasket?\nIn most cases, a vehicle can be driven with a blown head gasket, though doing so is not recommended. The seal between an engine’s block and cylinder head(s) is critical to engine performance. Therefore, the degradation of this seal will ultimately lead to a number of drivability-related issues.\nIn most cases, a leaking head gasket will eventually lead to further overheating issues. Many head gasket leaks lead to coolant loss, whether through external leakage or by way of escape into a specific cylinder.\nWith time, this loss in coolant will drastically reduce your cooling system’s ability to regulate engine temperatures.\nIn certain cases, a head gasket leak will allow coolant to mix with an engine’s lube oil. When this occurs, oil dilution is inevitable. This loss in oil viscosity can quickly wreak havoc on an engine’s critical bearings.\nAs a result, a leaking head gasket can eventually necessitate a complete engine overhaul.\nBlown Head Gasket Repair Cost\nHead gasket replacement is never cheap. However, the exact cost associated with such repairs can vary substantially from one model of vehicle to the next.\nThis variance in cost can be attributed to the price difference between particular gaskets, as well as the amount of labor required to replace the head gasket(s) found on a particular engine.\nOn average, one can expect to pay between $1,200 and $2,000 for complete head gasket replacement. The lower end of this price range is reflective of replacement in an inline-style engine, while the higher end of the price spectrum correlates to most high-end “V” configuration engines.\nPreventing Head Gasket Failure\nThe single biggest way to prevent head gasket leaks involves keeping a close eye on your vehicle’s cooling system. This involves checking the condition of all coolant and heater core hoses, as well as periodically inspecting your engine’s water pump and thermostat housing seals for fluid loss.\nIf any issues relating to cooling system integrity are noted, repair should be conducted as soon as possible. Delaying such repairs can lead to an overheating issue at a moment’s notice, which in turn can put your engine at risk for head gasket failure.\nBlown Head Gasket vs Cracked Head\nThough somewhat rare, an engine’s cylinder head can crack, posing similar symptoms to those associated with head gasket failure. However, a cracked head requires much more than head gasket replacement to remedy.\nSince cylinder heads are vital structural components of any engine, such failures require head repair or total replacement. During these repairs, an engine’s head gaskets will also be replaced.\nIdentifying the difference between a cracked head and a blown head gasket can be quite difficult. Each issue makes it possible for both combustion gases and fluid to end up where they would not otherwise be found.\nHowever, many issues related to a cracked cylinder head will appear to clear up as an engine reaches operating temperature, and the crack itself swells shut.\nIf any doubt exists as to a cylinder head’s integrity, the head in question should be taken to a machine shop, where further testing can be conducted. As standard procedure, most machine shops “hot tank” suspect heads, in order to visually identify cracks in cylinder heads that would otherwise go unnoticed."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"advanced_reasoning"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:61e379e3-9977-4001-adef-3e4901137b86>","<urn:uuid:6b66df10-2595-49e4-a9ed-6a0ab818bc37>"],"error":null}

In terms of modern energy initiatives, the city has implemented innovative solar technology, with a solar concentrator farm that generates eco-friendly heat from concentrated sunlight. This installation, covering 1100 m² of parabolic reflectors, can replace 500 MWh of gas consumption annually and produces three times more energy per installed square meter than photovoltaic systems. The technology allows heat storage for nighttime use and can reach temperatures up to 400°C for industrial applications.","context":["Bart Albert De WeverБиография\nAntwerp first experienced an economic boom in the 12th century, when the rival port of Bruges started silting up. By the first half of the 14th century, the city had become the most important trading and financial centre in Western Europe, its reputation based largely on its seaport and wool market.\nIn 1356, Antwerp, which had been part of the Holy Roman Empire, was annexed to the County of Flanders and lost lots of its privileges, partly to Bruges' advantage. 50 years later, the political and economic tide turned again and as the Golden Age unfolded Antwerp became a world-class metropolis.\nAntwerp was the focus of politico-religious struggles between the Protestant North and Catholic South (Spain), which led to the River Scheldt being closed, by the second half of the 16th century. From an economic point of view, this was a disaster. Thanks to painters like Rubens, Anthony Van Dyck, Jordaens and Teniers, yet the city continued to flourish culturally until the mid-seventeenth century.\nFrom 1650 until the 19th century, the city went into serious decline, as the Scheldt remained closed and became little more than a provincial town. Only after the fall of Napoleon at Waterloo in 1815 did Antwerp enter a short period of prosperity, which ended with the Belgian Revolution in 1830 and once again the closure of the Scheldt. In 1863 the river was finally reopened for good, helping Antwerp to return to its former glory.\nApart from interruptions during the two world wars, Antwerp has experienced steady economic growth since the start of the 20th century and is now home to the second-largest European port, as well as the world hub for uncut diamonds.\nAntwerp is the capital of Antwerp province in Flanders. With a population of 520,504 (November 2017), it is the most populous city proper in Belgium. Its metropolitan area houses around 1,200,000 people, coming at second place after Brussels.\nAntwerp is situated on the River Scheldt, linked to the North Sea by the Westerschelde estuary. It is about 40 kilometres north of Brussels, and about 15 kilometres from the Dutch border.\nGrote Markt 1\nThe port of Antwerp is one of the biggest in the world and second in Europe. It handles big volumes of economically attractive general and project cargo, as well as bulk cargo. There is also a wind farm in the northern part of the port area.\nAnother great mainstay of Antwerp is the diamond trade that takes place largely within the diamond district. The city has 4 diamond bourses.\nAntwerp also known as the cultural capital of Flanders is an outstanding historic centre for Belgian craftwork and artistry. In the past the city was home to such famous artists as Rubens, van Dyck, and Jordaens. In the same time, centuries of prosperity have bequeathed an inheritance of architectural beauty, which includes the magnificent cathedral, the town hall, and many other historical buildings in the old town center.\nAntwerp's excellent museums are a must-visit places. In particular, the city's paintings - an incomparable collection of 15th- to 17th-century masterpieces from a time when the work of artists of the South Netherlands school attained extraordinary heights - is a highlight of any visit.","- About us\n- IBJ Awards\n- Free Sample\n- Contact us\nAntwerp feels the solar heat\n(Posted on 28/10/19)\nThe first solar concentrator farm in the European process industry has been inaugurated in the Port of Antwerp. The pioneering energy technology generates eco-friendly heat from concentrated sunlight that can be used by industrial companies. The plant was installed for Adpo by the Genk-based energy company Azteq as part of a pilot project co-financed by the Flemish government.\nIndustrial companies normally obtain heat for their processes from combustion of fossil fuels such as natural gas. Concentrated Solar Thermal energy (CST) is an innovative technology in which sunlight is concentrated by parabolic mirrors and so converted directly to heat. The temperatures reached can be as high as 400°C, thus providing high-grade heat that can be used in industrial processes. The technology produces three times as much energy per installed square metre than a photovoltaic system. Furthermore the heat can be stored in insulated containers so that it is also available for use at night. The technology is an entirely eco-friendly alternative for industrial heating requirements and so can make a significant contribution toward reducing CO2 emissions.\nThe Ghent-based energy company Azteq has in the past few months installed a CST farm with 1100 m² of parabolic reflectors on the site of the logistics company Adpo (Antwerp Distribution and Products Operations) in Beveren. Until now Adpo has used gas to produce the steam that it uses for cleaning and heating tanks and containers. This requires temperatures of more than 140°C, well within the capabilities of CST technology. The CST farm that will replace 500 MWh of gas consumption annually is installed above the company's car park, above a railway line and underneath a high voltage line, thus providing an excellent example of double use of ground area. The solar reflectors, each 5 m long and installed in lines of 120, follow the path of the sun and focus the incident sunlight on collector tubes. The plant is the first industrial CST project in Europe.\n\"Investing in the transition to sustainable, renewable energy is in our DNA,\" declared Filip De Dijcker, managing director of Adpo. \"The current project is not our first foray into sustainable energy. We already generate 700 MWh of electricity per year from solar panels, and the first LNG/CNG gas station was built on our terminal five years ago. We are also making our contribution to the modal shift: thanks to a new container quay we transport 10,000 containers per year by water instead of by road, and we have made significant investments in a rail connection and a direct pipeline connection for two of our companies.\"\nThe plant in the port of Antwerp forms part of a project in which three pilot installations with solar reflectors are being set up in Flanders. The three plants in Beveren, Ostend and Genk respectively will generate between 1,390 and 1,260 MWh of eco-friendly heat annually. Between them these plants will cost a total of 1.425 million euros, of which 819,000 is being financed by the Flemish government.\nKoen Vermout, CEO of Azteq, commented: \"With this technology we aim to decarbonise a significant part of industrial energy requirements by 2030. This initiative in the port is one of the pilot projects that we are able to put into practice thanks to support from the Flemish government. We want in particular to demonstrate the feasibility of this technology and to establish it here. In addition to Flanders there are also plans for projects in the Netherlands, France, Germany, Austria and Spain. Making the supply of heat for industry more eco-friendly not only leads to significant reductions in CO2 emissions but also to technical progress and job creation in a future-oriented circular economy.\"\nPort of Antwerp CEO Jacques Vandermeiren: \"As Port of Antwerp we have a pioneering role to play in the energy transition. Together with industry we are working to reduce CO2 emissions and make the transition to alternative energy sources, so as to become a CO2-neutral port. We aim to accomplish this by means of ambitious transition projects, using methanol, hydrogen, wind power etc. We want to be a testbed for technological innovation that helps us on the way to a sustainable future. I am therefore proud that this promising technology is being tested first in Port of Antwerp.\"\nThe first spade has gone into the ground for the new 800-metre-long quay at Quarleshaven in East Vlissingen...

{"question":"What are the practical benefits of subsurface drip irrigation for water conservation, and what components are essential for its implementation?","answer":"Subsurface drip irrigation offers significant water conservation benefits, achieving 92% efficiency and saving 8.8 acre feet per year in documented cases. Since water is applied underground, there is no evaporation or runoff, and the dry zone above allows rainwater to soak in rather than run off. For implementation, essential components include a water pump, filter unit (with options like hydrocyclone, media, and screen filters), mainline and sub-mainline pipes, lateral pipes, drippers (both online and inline types), and control elements such as valves, pressure gauges, and fertilizer tanks. The system requires proper filtration to prevent dripper clogging and maintain long-term functionality.","context":["Tim and Sherlyn Nikkel, Inman, were recognized with the 2016 Bankers Award for water conservation at the McPherson County Soil Conservation Annual Banquet and Meeting, Jan. 23.\nTim Nikkel operates a grain farm northeast of Inman where he grows wheat, corn and soybeans. His experience with irrigation is life-long. His grandfather, Abe Nikkel, began irrigating in the late 1960s to early 1970s when farmers in the neighborhood realized the water potential that was underneath their feet in the Equus Beds. His father, LaVerne Nikkel, continued irrigating. Like most farmers, Tim Nickel grew up with flood irrigation, eventually changing to pivot systems on some of his irrigated land. Three years ago, he installed subsurface drip irrigation on the field for which he is being recognized.\nIt’s a move that has been nothing but positive, he said.\n“I’m extremely happy,” Tim Nikkel said. “This is the most fun irrigating I’ve had in my life.”\nThe 40-acre field he converted to subsurface from flood had been problematic for efficient use of water. The field borders on the Blaze Fork and the low, flat ground is prone to flooding, and it was difficult to get the water through the furrows. When the ground is saturated with irrigation water and then receives a big rain, the crop is starved for oxygen. The field shares a water well with a field farmed by LaVerne Nikkel with a pivot system. Water was piped one direction across the field to the pivot and in the opposite direction to the flood field. Managing the water so the pivot and the flood systems both had enough water at the most beneficial times often meant coordinating what was planted each year. For instance, it was difficult if both fields were planted to corn and had maximum water demands at the same time. Managing the tail water on the flood field also posed some problems, Nikkel said.\nTim Nikkel considered a pivot system, but the configuration of the field seemed to be better suited to subsurface system. Funding through the Agricultural Water Enhancement Program made the expensive conversion more affordable.\n“I’m thankful that (NRCS) cares about our practices and helps with the costs,” he said.\nTim Nikkel has changed his farming practices over the last five to seven years to become more conservation friendly, moving from full tillage to minimum till and strip till on much of his ground. Strip till works well with subsurface irrigation, especially since fertilizer and other chemical can be put on through the subsurface pipe, without disturbing the surface residue. He applies the water in three zones of 13.3 acres each. Water rotates between the zones and is controlled through a computer system to ensure that water is put on equally in each zone.\nThe benefits of the subsurface system have been many. Because water is put on underground, rather than on the surface, there is no evaporation or runoff. When it does rain, there is a dry zone above the irrigation zone allowing water to soak in rather than run off. According to NRCS records, the Nikkels are experiencing an 8.8 acre feet per year savings in water, which is significant and represents a 92 percent efficiency use of the water.\n“The potential water savings was a big factor in the decision to go with the subsurface. We don’t want to end up like the Ogallala,” Tim Nikkel said.\nThe more efficient watering has resulted in record yields for that particular field in all three crops he has grown since the system was put in. He believes the subsurface irrigation has improved the yield potential of the ground. And, it allows both his father’s pivot irrigated field and his field to be watered at the same time.\nBut there is more to subsurface than water efficiency and higher yields. It also provides a benefit in time management. Tim Nikkel noted that time is no longer spent on furrowing or daily changing of gates when irrigating. There is a learning curve to learning a new system, but he feels the benefits are worth it. His experience with subsurface drip irrigation has been so positive he is hoping to convert more of his irrigated ground to the system.\n“It just irrigates so nice and takes much less time to manage,” he said.\nFor photos, click here.","This Guide will teach you everything you need to know about Drip Irrigation.\nComponents Of Drip irrigation system\nCost of installation\nAnd Guidelines For Maintenance and much other valuable information that I’ve never shared anywhere else before.\nLet’s get started…\nThe available water for agriculture decreases day by day due to the increase in population, industrialization, and short rainfall. It has become essential to use modern irrigation technologies like Drip irrigation, sprinkler irrigation in agriculture.\nDrip irrigation means providing the required quantity of water directly to Crop plants’ root zone through a network of small pipes; this is also called micro-irrigation or trickle irrigation.\nThis is the most efficient irrigation technique.\nIn the Drip irrigation system, water supplies to plant roots through a collection of plastic pipes, lateral tubes, and valves. These components, controlled with the help of a dripper and water pump. With the help drip irrigation system, it is easy to provide liquid fertilizer to the plant root system.\nDrip Irrigation Advantages\n- Drip irrigation Saves water around 30% – 60% as compared to flood irrigation.\n- It is observed that crop yield increase up to 230%.\n- Fertilizer use efficiency increase by 30 percent\n- Reduce Weed growth\n- Save Labour and electricity cost is much significantly less than other irrigation methods.\n- For drip irrigation, Field leveling isn’t vital.\n- Easy to maintain Moisture near the root zone\n- Water supply is extremely optional, controlled by way of each nozzle.\n- Help to reduce Soil erosion.\n- Enable the use of saline water for irrigation\nComponents Of Drip irrigation system\nThe drip irrigation system comprises the water pump, filter unit, mainline, sub-mainline, lateral pipes, dripper, and other accessories such as control valves, pressure gauge, Fertilizer tank/venturi, end cap, etc.\n1) Water Pump\nA pump of a suitable capacity Water pump is used to supply water through the drip irrigation system components at a specific level of pressure.\nIf the source of a water supply is a bore well, open well, or a Canal, there is the possibility of organic and inorganic foreign bodies in the water. In this case, use the suction filter to get relatively clean water.\nThe electric motors or diesel engines are the common prime mover of the pump. Recently the solar pump is being used to popularize it for drip irrigation purposes.\n2) Filter unit\nThere should be a good quality filter in the control head installation of a drip system. The filter uses to clean the suspended impurities of water supplied by the pump before it reaches to drippers. Impurities in irrigation water may cause blockage of the holes and passage of drippers.\nThe success of drippers greatly depends on the performance of the filter.\nA filter unit cleans irrigation water impurities that are suspended and prevent blockage of holes. There is various type of filter available in the market.\nThere are Three Types of filters: Hydrocyclone Filter, Media filter, and Screen or Disk filter.\nSuitable filters are installed according to the impurities found in the source of water.\nIf the water source is a bore well with less physical impurities, you can install only a screen filter.\nIf the water source is an open well or a Canal install screen or disc filter along with sand filter and Hydrocyclone Filter.\nTo work the drip irrigation system properly two-stage filter unit is used.\na) Media (Sand/ Garval) Filters\nThese filters come as the primary filter unit, and this is powerful against inorganic suspended solids, biological materials, and other organic substances.\nMedia Filter consists of fine gravel and sand of selected sizes placed in a pressurized tank. It helps to remove organic substances such as algae and other vegetative substances present in the water.\nThe filters are made up of a circular tank filled with layers of coarse sand and different gravel sizes with a provision of valves or flushing the filter assembly in case of clogging.\nThe media filters are available in different sizes ranging from 500 to 900 mm diameter with an output of 15 to 50 Cu.M., respectively.\nA gravel filter or sand filter is vital for the open reservoir, even where algae growth occurs in the water source.\nb) Hydrocyclone Filter\nIf the irrigation water contains more sand particles, hydro-cyclone type filters are removed this sand particle by creating centrifugal force and spins out sand from water.\nThe Hydro-cyclones Filter generates a spinning activity causing the sand particles to separate the water and be trapped in a storage tank at the bottom of this device.\nHydro-cyclone type filters are produced in various sizes for different discharge capacities.\nc) Screen Filter:\nIn general, the screen filter consists of a single or double perforated cylinder placed in a plastic or metallic container\nfor removing the impurities.\nGenerally, 100 to 200 mesh screens are used in this type of filter. It must be cleaned and inspected periodically for satisfactory operation of any drip system.\nScreen filer is installed with or without a gravel filter, depend upon the quality of irrigation water. The screen filter is made up of non-corrosive plastic or metal substance.\nc) Disc Filter:\nDisc filter comes as part of the secondary filter unit. Multiple circular discs filter water. it is made up of high-quality plastic material\nThe mainline transfers the total amount of water for the irrigation system. It connects the different sub-mains to a water source. The main pipes are commonly made of flexible materials such as PVC (polyvinyl chloride) or plastics.\nThe mainline pipe passes water from the filtration unit to the sub-main pipe. This pipe’s diameter depends upon drips irrigation system flow capacity, normally 2.5 – 4 Inch diameter PVC pipe used as main-line.\nMainline & sub-main should be installed in a Telescopic manner; that is, the pipe with a larger diameter should be connected first, followed by pipes with a smaller diameter. This arrangement helps to maintain uniform pressure in the system.\nThe Mainline should be buried at least 45 centimeters to prevent them from getting damaged during cultural operation.\nThe sub-main feed to the laterals on one or both sides. It is made of either medium-density polyethylene (PE) or PVC. There should be a balance between the diameter of the main and sub-mains.\nThese are determined in consideration of the rate of discharge, number of sub-mains, and friction losses in pipes\nLaterals are made up of low-density polyethylene (LDP) or linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) material and are available in different sizes, 12 mm, 16mm, and 20 mm.\nBased on the availability of water, crop, and spacing, 12 millimeter 16-millimeter laterals install.\nDrippers are also called emitters. The dripper is discharging water from the lateral pipe to the soil.\nDrippers are generally manufactured from polypropylene materials.\nMainly, two types of drippers are available in the market. Online Dripper and Inline Dripper\na) Online Dripper:\nIn this type of dripper, they are placed on the lateral, called an online dripper. these drippers are fixed on the lateral by punching suitable size holes in the pipe\nThis type of dripper uses mostly for Orchard Crops like coconut, pomegranate, guava, etc., the capacity to discharge water available is 2L/hour, 4L/hour, and 8L /hour.\nb) Inline Dripper:\nIn this type, the dripper is placed inside the lateral pipe. The distance between the two drippers is the same. There are three types of available inline drippers.\nNon-Pressure Compensating Drippers (NPC): This is a very simple dripper, which does not maintain uniform pressure\nPressure Compensating Drippers (PC): This dripper is more advanced; it maintains uniform pressure in all drippers. It mostly uses for the greenhouse crop, the price of this dripper is slightly high.\nNon-Draining Drippers: This dripper is mainly used in a soilless-like mediums like cocopits, Perlite, and Vermiculite.\n7) Fertilizing Unit\nThe direct application of fertilizer through drip irrigation has increased the efficient use of fertilizer and saving in labour and money.\nWith this fertilizing unit’s help, liquid fertilizer is provided to the plant through a drip irrigation system.\nApplication of fertilizer into irrigation system is made by either a by-pass pressure tank or by venture pump or direct\nIt is used to determine water pressure in the drip irrigation system.\n8) Controls Valves\nThis value is used to control water flow. They made up of plastic and iron material\n9) Flush Valve:\nThe flush valve is placed at the end of the sub-Maine pipe it uses to flush out dirt.\n10) Non-Return Valve\nNon -return valve is useful to stop return water toward the water pump.\n11) Air valve\nIt helps prevent the sucking of mud by the drippers and release air into the drip irrigation system.\nThe end cap is used to close one end of the lateral pipe; they remove it at the cleaning time.\nTypes of Drip Irrigation System\nTheir many types are available in drip irrigation here. Only two popular types are explained.\n1) Surface drip system\nIn the surface drip system, the emitter and lateral pipe are placed on the soil surface. This is the most common and popular type of drip system.\nIt is suitable for wide-spaced plants as well as for row crops. It is easy to use a surface drip to observe and inspect, change, clean the emitters, observe surface moisture patterns, and measure individual emitter discharge rates.\n2) Sub-surface drip system\nin a subsurface drip irrigation system, the lateral is placed below the ground and near the plant root zone area. In this system, water is slowly applied below the surface through the emitters.\nSub-surface drip systems have gained wider acceptance due to removing earlier problems of clogging to a large extent.\nDue to the sub-surface drip method, there is less intervention in agriculture or any cultural practices and possibly more operational life.\nSub-surface drip system provides little interference with cultivation or any cultural practices and possibly longer operational life.\nDrip Irrigation System suitable for this crop\n|Vegetables||Tomato, Capsicum, Cabbage, Chilly,|\nCauliflower, Onion, Brinjal, Bitter Gourd,\nRidge Gourd, Peas, Cucumber, Pumpkin,\n|Cash Crops||Sugarcane, Tobacco, Cotton|\n|Poyhouse crop||Gerbera, Dutch rose, Carnation, Anthurium,|\nLily, Orchids, Strawberry, etc\n|Plantation Crop||Coffee, Coconut, Tea, Rubber, etc|\n|Orchard Crops||Banana, Grapes, Citrus, Orange,|\nPomegranate, Mango, Guava,\nPineapple, Cashewnut, Coconut,\nPapaya, Watermelon, Muskmelon,\nLitchi, Lemon, etc\nDrip Irrigation System Cost\nThe Cost of drip irrigation system installation depends upon various factors, like what kind of crop you are sowing, type of terrain, quality of soil, sowing pattern, water quality, quality of drip material, manufacture company of drip irrigation system, and design of the drip irrigation system.\nDrip irrigation system cost per acre For vegetable crop will come around Rs. 50,000–65,000 per acre approximately and For fruits crop, if planted in the 3X3 pattern cost per acre for drip irrigation system come around 35,000- 40,000 approximately.\nGovernment Suggestive cost of drip irrigation system:\nSuppose you are using non-ISI material; your initial cost for one acre comes around 20,000-25,000 rupee for the vegetable crop, but the life of non-ISI material for 2-3 years with high maintenance cost. At the same time, the life of ISI material is 7-10 years with low maintenance.\nGovernment subsidy for drip irrigation\nThe subsidy is available for Drip irrigation in India under Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY). The government of India gives subsidies per beneficiary up to 5 hectares. There has been financial assistance under different categories and depending upon States’ categories for dessert, drought, hilly, and other regions of the country. For more detail, check the PMKSY website or contact the nearest agriculture office.\nList of Top Drip irrigation companies\nThese are the Top Drip irrigation manufacturer company in India.\nGuidelines For Maintenance Of Drip irrigation system\nDrip irrigation is a mechanical system, which performs at a specific pressure of water; if the system has to perform well for a long time, the pressure should be properly maintained.\nEven if good quality materials are used and installed scientifically, there is a possibility of failure. If the field maintenance is not proper and regular, therefore, the drip irrigation system’s management is very important.\nFollow these guidelines to maintain drip irrigation system –\nA. General care\n- Check all Working emitters or Dripper, Inspect the water leakage, and make sure that water is uniformly distributing all of the corners of this plot/field.\n- Check the water dispensation area. If their dry patches are found, increase drip irrigation operation time.\n- If a twist, fold, cut, puncher is observed on the lateral, sub-main, valve correct it immediately.\nB. Clean the filters.\nThe filter is the main part of the drip irrigation set. If the filter is not working properly, there is a major chance of complete drip irrigation system Failure.\n1. Sand filter:\nClean sand filter after every week. The backwashing facility available in the sand filter uses this by allowing water to flow through the lid instead of the water valve and stir the sand in the filter. So, the waste which is sitting at the bottom will come and go out of the water\n2. Screen Filters/ dice filter:\nOpen the lid and remove the mud and garbage trapped. Open the filter and remove the filings and rubber seals and clean it on both sides.\n3. Submain pipe and Laterals tubes:\nSometimes a fine particle, dirt passes through the filter and store in the main and sub-main tubs, Laterals; therefore, to clear these tubes, remove the end cap, Flush Valve and let the water flow. Do this until the clean water come.\nC. Chemical Treatment:\nThe drippers are stopping working due to various alkali\nIf the amount of carbonate, bicarbonate, chlorides, sulfur, manganese, and calcium, sulfur sulfate is higher in water, yellowish dots appear, and the reddish dots appear dripper, and if the amount of iron is high red spot appear on the dripper following treatment carried out.\n1. Acid Treatment:\nAcid treatment is useful for though dripper and laterals blocked by various chemical impurities, including fertilizer residue. This impurity can be removed by treating the system either with hydrochloric acid or sulphuric acid or nitric acid. This hydrochloric acid at 25% is best for acid treatment.\nTake the required amount of hydrochloric acid in water. Inject it into the system through the Venturi or fertigation tank. The system is filled with water allows acid solution into the system until the pH of 4. A check pH with litmus paper for both at the starting and the last dripper. Close the system for 24 hours.\nThe acidified water in the system reacts with the salts deposited in the system and dissolves it. After 24 hours, they acidify water along with the dissolved solids coming out of the system by flashing.\n2. Chlorine treatment:\nChlorination is useful to remove the biological impurities collected in the drip irrigation system. Chlorination can be done either using calcium hypochlorite, sodium hypochlorite, chlorine or calcium hydrochloride, or bleaching powder.\nDissolve the required quantity of bleaching powder in water one day before treatment. This solution is let into the system through Venturi or fertigation tank and allows it to stay in the system for 24 hours. after that, open the end caps of the lateral and run the system for about an hour so that the impurities are thrown out of the system\nDrip Irrigation Disadvantages/ Limitation\nDespite observed successes, some problems have been encountered in applying water with drip equipment for some soils, water qualities, and environmental conditions. Some important limitations are described below:\n1) Persistent Maintenance Requirements\nDripper clogging is considered the most serious problem in Drip irrigation unless preventive measures are taken. It is, therefore, necessary that water should be filtered properly.\nBesides this, salts and chemical deposits can be deposited in an emitter or lateral pipe. This leads to Clogging. It will adversely affect the rate and uniformity of water application, increase maintenance costs, and result in crop damage and decreased yield if not detected early and corrected timely.\nOther maintenance problems include pipeline leaks and cracking of the tubes. Rodents, coyotes, rabbits, and dogs can chew and damage dripline, and ants and other insects occasionally have enlarged openings in drip tubings.\n2) Economical – Initial cost\nAs the equipment requirements are numerous with drip irrigation, initial investment and annual costs may be high compared to surface or portable sprinkler irrigation systems.\nThe actual prices of drip irrigation system equipment will vary greatly depending on the types of crops, grades of pipelines, filtration equipment, and fertilization equipment, etc.,\n3) Salinity Hazards\nIf the drip system is used under saline conditions, it should be taken extra care to manage drip irrigation work properly.\n4) Technical knowledge\nHigh skill is required for drip irrigation system design, installation, and subsequent operation.\nTechnical improvements in the designs of emitters, fittings, filters, etc., have been necessary;\nThe development procedures for preventing or correcting emitter clogging and equipment failure have been difficult, and the development of the proper methods for injection of fertilizers and other chemicals has sometimes been a\nA higher level of design management and maintenance is required with drip than other irrigation methods.\nImage source :"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:7dd17dcf-93d7-4291-afb9-964afd48e051>","<urn:uuid:985313b8-574b-4533-abaa-a71d7519e156>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How does Shallow Water Blackout (SWB) happen in swimmers? I want to understand the mechanism! 🏊","answer":"Shallow Water Blackout (SWB) occurs through brain hypoxia when underwater. During this event, the body's CO2 levels drop, often due to mild hyperventilating. This causes the cerebral blood vessels to narrow, which impairs the swimmer's breathing inhibition. This leads to a rapid decrease in blood oxygen saturation (hypoxia), ultimately resulting in unconsciousness. SWB drownings are particularly dangerous as they can cause death and brain damage in just 2-3 minutes, compared to 6-8 minutes in normal drownings.","context":["Nina Peloso, Year 2 Engineering\nWhile more than one hundred thousand annual deaths are attributed to drownings worldwide, Shallow Water Blackout (SWB), a leading subset, is often overlooked. Thus far, efforts have largely consisted of awareness organizations and small-scale campaigns; although the feasibility of a wearable device has been explored in the prevention of freediving blackout, the applicability to pool-wear remains limited. This paper looks at the possibility of utilizing a wearable MAX30100-based circuit to provide a real-time alert when SWB occurs. The circuit incorporated an LED ‘alert’ and was based in an Arduino nano; but was not completed due to obstacles in i.c. design. Further work must be done to investigate the viability of a real-time alert in the detection of SWB using a circuit of common products to ensure a low-cost and the achievability of commercial use.\nShallow Water Blackout (SWB) describes the loss of consciousness underwater via brain hypoxia. During the event, the body’s co2 levels drop, often as a result of mild hyperventilating which begets the narrowing of the cerebral blood vessels and impairs the swimmer’s inhibition to breathe; spurring a rapid fall-off in blood oxygen saturation (hypoxia), and unconsciousness. (Swimming Canada, “Shallow Water Blackout (SWB)”). According to Swimming Canada, of the more than 140,000 annual deaths due to accidental drownings worldwide, SWB cases account for roughly 20% (Swimming Canada, “Shallow Water Blackout (SWB)”). So far, much of the effort around reducing SWB has focused on raising awareness and ameliorating the risks through encouraging ‘safe swimming behaviors’ such as swimming with a partner, avoiding overexertion, and refraining from breath-holding for extended periods of time (Shallow Water Blackout Prevention, “How it Happens”). Elite and novice swimmers find themselves at the crossroads of these risk factors, and must be kept in mind when measuring the efficacy of preventative devices.\nFigure 1: Freediver protective vest supporting a diver (Maas, “The Case for a Device to Manage Freediving Blackout”)\nPresently, one device exists in the form of a “freediver protective vest” (Figure 1) (Maas, “The Case for a Device to Manage Freediving Blackout”). The vest uses depth and time sensors to detect when a diver is too deep or has been underwater for longer than the time set-up by the diver, at which point the vest inflates and pulls them towards the surface. However, one problem with the device is the lack of applicability to pool drownings, where a bulk of SWB cases occur (Boyd et al., 2015; in such shallow water the depth counter is rendered ineffective. Finally, relying on the time counter is especially risky given than SWB drownings are shown to induce death and brain damage in a fraction of the time of normal drownings, where 6-8 minutes might become 2-3 (Bart & Lau, 2021) (Bowman, “Shallow Water Blackout) (Boyd et al., 2015). When a time counter is utilized, thresholds can be difficult to gauge, as tolerances often depend on the athlete, individual, or even specific occurance. The aim of this project is to investigate a method of creating a arduino-based wearable device which mitigates these issues, with the ability to produce a real-time alert if the wearer experiences oxygen/and or blood co2 deprivation levels that put them at a risk of blacking out, thus reducing the propensity for SWB in novice and elite swimmers.\nMaterials & Methods\nThe circuit was structured around an integrated pulse oximetry and heart-rate unit, the MAX30100 (Walfront/Amazon). In this case, pulse oximetry records a wearer’s ‘SpO2’, or the percentage of oxygen-carrying hemoglobin present in the bloodstream divided over the total functional hemoglobin in the patient’s bloodstream (Mayo Clinic, 2018) called peripheral oxygen saturation, similar to SaO2 (or arterial oxygen saturation), which takes into account the functional and the non-functional hemoglobin (Hafen & Sharma, 2021)(Mayo Clinic, 2018). The instrument calculates an SpO2 reading by calculating the differential between the red/infrared light received after passing through the wearer’s extremity from a corresponding light emitting diode (LED) situated within each sensor (Philips Medical Systems, 2016); this is possible as oxygenated hemoglobin absorbs more infrared light than red light while deoxygenated hemoglobin responds inversely (University of Iowa, 2017.) Although much of the emittance is absorbed by bone, soft tissue and venous blood, the oscillating values of arterial blood (due to pulsation) (Philips Medical Systems, 2016) allows a measurement that may be used in the detection of peripheral oxygen saturation, and in tissue hypoxia by extension (Hafen & Sharma, 2021)(Philips Medical Systems, 2016).\nUsing this mechanism, the circuit incorporated a MAX30100 integrated circuit, an LED, and three 470 Ω resistors for use with the Arduino nano (Arduino), selected with wearability in mind. Pictured in Figure 2, 3, are the circuit and schematic respectively (modeled in TinkerCAD). In the schematic/model, the MAX30100 is an 8-pin header denoted with the notes tool while an Arduino uno was used in place of an Arduino nano due to the limited selection of TinkerCAD components. However, in the case of the latter, there is no meaningful difference in this instance as they are identical in terms of computational capacity in the hardware and peripherals, given that they both rely on the reduced instruction set computer (RISC) ATMEGA328P-NP microcontroller (Atmel, “ATMEGA328P Datasheet”).\nFigure 2: Photograph of the designed circuit/prototype\nIn accordance with the processor (ATMEGA328P-NP), the MAX30100 module operates on a I2C interface, a protocol for sending and receiving data, also called “two-wire protocol”. Specifically, the circuit utilizes the serial clock-pin (SCL) to send ‘bits’ of information at set intervals to the i.c.’s serial data-pin (SDA) which decodes the resultant sequence of bits (Zambetti, 2022). On the Arduino nano, analog pin 4 and 5 may function as the data and clock lines respectively (Dannegard, 2022), which can be achieved through the use of the “Wire.h” library shown to preface the program in Figure 4. Coupled with the “MAX30100_PulseOximeter.h” library, the program calls upon the SCL and SDA pins to read the values of red/infrared light perceived by the i.c. periodically. Thus, the SpO2 and heart rate is meant to be read by the device, in future iterations the SpO2 reading may be converted to a float value and made to dictate a conditional which controls the LED, or the ‘alert’; that is, if SpO2 % > 95 % (or ± 0.10) (as per medical convention (Mayo Clinic, 2018)), then “digitalWrite (3, HIGH)” where digital-pin ‘3’ functions as the output for the LED. The modified source-code (How To Electronics, “Interfacing MAX30100 Pulse Oximeter Sensor with Arduino”) uses a midrange ‘reporting period’ of 1000 milliseconds, which denotes the rate at which the period timing occurs, characteristic to I2C protocol.\nFigure 3: Schematic of design, modeled in TinkerCAD.\nFigure 4: Modified source-code of the device (How To Electronics, “InterfacingMAX30100 Pulse Oximeter Sensor with Arduino”)\nHowever, the resultant circuit encountered impassable issues in the internal functionality of the i.c. module; efforts to amend the design are present in the external resistors (470 Ω).\nFigure 5: The MAX30100 i.c. was modified in an attempt to assuage voltage disparities, (left) the unmodified module versus the module with internal resistors removed (right) to be relocated externally, onto the circuit.\nAlthough the initial aim was to investigate a method of developing a wearable device capable of real-time alert for SWB cases; no tangible device was produced. Since the original MAX30100 i.c. includes a trio of 470 Ω resistors in parallel, the i.c.’s voltage regulators ensure a 1.8 V voltage through each, and thus they are unable to pull-up or down due to incompatibility with the 3.3 V of the ATMEGA328 microcontroller of the Arduino nano. (See Figure 5) to mitigate the issue, the module’s internal resistors were unsoldered, and three 470 Ω resistors were instead incorporated into the (external) circuit design. However, this design yielded no difference to the functionality of the module. Rather, the design and background provide a direction of research for future development in the mitigation of SWB through wearable means, as well as a survey of potential obstacles when producing a MAX30100-based device.\nPulse oximeter integrated circuit devices akin to, or at the production level of, theMAX30100 are desirable in compactness, availability and price point. However, usability is a crucial factor in developing a medical device with the goal of real-time alert; thus, this design may act as a point of reference for future prototypes in the interest of realtime alerts using the MAX30100, or those that target SWB alerts through arduino-based devices.\nFuture research could develop the concept of a wearable arduino-based device through the utilization of a commercial pulse oximeter’s internal mechanism; and therein optimizing the device with SWB in mind. Prioritizing not only the accuracy and speed of the alert, but comfortability/sleekness of the device, positioning of sensors/emitters and\nSince pulse oximeters work by emitting through rad/infrared LEDs from one side and receiving on the other, extremities are ideal, the earlobe and forehead are also commonly used (Pantelopoulos & Bourbakis, 2010). Of these places, fingers are usually selected for the ease and acceptable accuracy (Pantelopoulos & Bourbakis, 2010). However, for the application to SWB detection, fingers are undesirable in part because they are instrumental to stroke and hence form during swimming, which is important to maintain given the target audience of elite and novice swimmers. Additionally, since SWB is resultant of cerebral hypoxia, the measurement of hypoxia in extremities may not be as accurate as a closer probe-location (Pantelopoulos & Bourbakis, 2010) (Seifi, et al., 2018). With these issues in mind, studies on the differing probe-locations for SpO2 detection such as Seifi, et al. (2018), found earlobe-probes to be the most accurate in these measurements (Seifi, et al., 2018). A conclusion which is endorsed in hypothermia patients, (Simon & Clark, 2002) patients under anesthesia, (Eberhard, et al., 2002) as well as in the detection of apnea (Lindholm, et al., 2007). In the lattermost case, the superiority of earlobe-probes were attributed to abilities in detecting ‘peripheral hypoxia’, a loss of oxygen in tissues adjacent or beside the site of the probe.\nA successful design could have these considerations in mind to produce a more optimal wearable-device which scans the earlobe for SpO2 deprivation, is comfortable and relies on the principles of SWB drownings discussed in this paper.\nAtmel.

The Butterflies of Indiana. Indiana Academy of Science, 1987.","Butterfly Habitat Needs in Mexico\nContributed by Dr. Bill Calvert\nPopular photos of monarchs overwintering in Mexico suggest that the butterflies are condensed into discreet colonies with well-defined borders at any time of the year. The butterflies appear to be surrounded by a sea of available fir trees. So why do they need so much space?\nThe pictures that we see are misleading to the extent that they are purposely taken to show the tight concentrations which so dazzle us. But the butterflies are not so concentrated in the beginning of the season or at the end. Although they are concentrated at night and during periods when it is too cold for them to fly, at almost all times of the year they use entire watersheds. There they search out nectar and water and, later on, mates. Finally, even within the proper habitat, their choice of sites varies from year.\nIn late October and November, they are spread out over acres and acres of ridge lines. In the end they are distributed along miles of canyons and are flying the length of those canyons every day. Their needs for space change with the seasons:\nAfter an initial period of arrival, and condensation along ridge lines lasting well into December, the colony drops down slope, usually within the shelter of an arroyo (streambed). They seem to time this movement so that they are on relatively steep slopes during the coldest part of the year. The steep slope allows cold air, which has accumulated near the ground, to drain off and be replaced by warmer air from above. These butterflies take clear advantage of microclimatic regimes occurring in the mountain forests.\nBeginning about mid-February, the weather begins to warm up. Surviving the cold is no longer of great concern but desiccation (drying out) and starvation (running out of their lipid reserves) becomes important. Butterfly colonies creep slowly, or occasionally jump quickly, down slope in the direction of water and nectar. The colonies often split up into smaller groups that are spread out along the canyon bottom. Later in March, on warm days with the correct wind direction, a portion of the butterflies spill out of the mouths of the canyon to begin the long journey north.\nAnother concern are the spaces between colonies.

{"question":"Could you compare how monsoons and El Niño each influence global weather patterns?","answer":"Monsoons and El Niño both have significant but different impacts on global weather patterns. Monsoons are seasonal wind shifts that occur in the tropics and subtropics, bringing heavy summer rains and dry winters to regions like India, South Asia, and parts of North America. El Niño, as part of the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), originates in the tropical Pacific but affects global climate patterns by altering ocean temperatures and atmospheric circulation. While monsoons primarily affect regional rainfall patterns, El Niño has broader global impacts, including influencing tropical cyclone activity, causing droughts in Indonesia and Australia, and even affecting winter temperatures in regions as far as the UK.","context":["A monsoon often brings about thoughts of torrential rains, similar to a hurricane or typhoon. But there is a difference: a monsoon is not a single storm; rather, it is a seasonal wind shift over a region. The shift may cause heavy rains in the summer, but at other times, it may cause a dry spell.\nWhat causes a monsoon?\nA monsoon (from the Arabic mawsim, which means \"season\") arises due to a difference in temperatures between a land mass and the adjacent ocean, according to the National Weather Service. The sun warms the land and ocean differently, according to Southwest Climate Change, causing the winds to play \"tug of war\" eventually switching directions bringing the cooler, moister air from over the ocean. The winds reverse again at the end of the monsoon season.\nWet versus dry\nA wet monsoon typically occurs during the summer months (about April through September) bringing heavy rains, according to National Geographic. On average, approximately 75 percent of India's annual rainfall and about 50 percent of the North American monsoon region (according to a 2004 NOAA study) comes during the summer monsoon season. The wet monsoon begins when winds bringing cooler, more humid air from above the oceans to the land, as described above.\nA dry monsoon typically occurs between October and April. Instead of coming from the oceans, the winds tend to come from drier, warmer climates such as from Mongolia and northwestern China down into India, according to National Geographic. Dry monsoons tend to be less powerful than their summer counterparts. Edward Guinan, an astronomy and meteorology professor at Villanova University, states that the winter monsoon occurs when \"the land cools off faster than the water and a high pressure develops over the land, blocking any ocean air from penetrating.\" This leads to a dry period.\nThe winds and rains\nThe monsoon season varies in strength each year bringing periods of lighter rains and heavier rains as well as slower wind speeds and higher wind speeds. The Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology has compiled data showing yearly rainfalls across India for the last 145 years.\nAccording to the data, the intensity of a monsoon varies over an average of period of 30 – 40 years. In each period, the amount of rain received is higher than average resulting in many floods or lower than average resulting in droughts. The long-term data suggest that the monsoon trends may turn from being in a low rain period that began in approximately 1970 to a higher rain period. Current records for 2016 indicate that total rainfall between June 1 and September 30 is 97.3 percent of the seasonal normal.\nThe most rain during a monsoon season, according to Guinan, was in Cherrapunji, in the state of Meghalaya in India between 1860 and 1861 when the region received 26,470 millimeters (1,047 inches) of rain. The area with the highest average annual total (which was observed over a ten year period) is Mawsynram, also in Meghalaya, with an average of 11,872 millimeters (467.4 inches) of rain.\nThe average wind speeds in Meghalaya during peak summer monsoon season average 4 kilometers per second and typically vary between 1 and 7 kilometers per hour, according to Meteoblue. During the winter months, wind speeds typically vary between 2 and 8 kilometers per hour with an average of 4 - 5 kilometers per hour.\nWhere in the world\nA monsoon forms in the tropics (between 0 and 23.5 degrees latitude north and south) and subtropics (between 23.5 degrees and 35 degrees latitude north and south), according to World Monsoons. The strongest monsoons tend to occur in India and South Asia in the north and Australia and Malaysia in the south. Monsoons also occur in southern parts of North America, in Central America, northern areas of South America, and in western Africa.\nThe North American monsoon\nMonsoon season in North America brings rainfall primarily to northern Mexico, Arizona, and New Mexico, and to a smaller extent to parts of Utah, Colorado, southern California and Baja California, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). While the monsoon in North America is not as strong as those in India due to a lower and smaller plateau, the same patterns are followed.\nA 2004 report was presented by NOAA describing studies on the North American Monsoon System. According to a case study, the North American Monsoon System is the least understood large-scale weather pattern that affects some of the more rapidly growing parts of the United States and Mexico. The researchers aimed to better understand the workings of the monsoon, the patterns, and any additional information that can be gathered to help predict the timing and strength of the seasonal monsoon.\nThe North American monsoon begins between May and June, peaks in July and August, and winds down between September and October, according to the 2004 study, drawing moisture from the Pacific Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico. There are many factors that are being researched in order to determine and predict the onset of the monsoon along with what the study calls the \"flavor of the monsoon,\" which includes the strength and amount of rainfall. The study points to a number of influences that may have an effect on the North American monsoon. These potentially include seasonal occurrences such as hurricanes and other tropical storms, floods, and droughts, as well as El Niño and climate change.\nThe monsoon is important in many areas all around the world. Agriculture in many of these places, such as India, depends heavily on the summer monsoon season, according to World Monsoons. According to National Geographic, hydroelectric plants that produce electricity and the import/export trades are also highly dependent on the monsoon season.\nIn periods of lighter rain, according to World Monsoons, crops don't grow due to drought, farm animals starve, and the income and well-being of many farmers and families dropped significantly. Less electricity is being produced sometimes leading to electricity only being provided to large businesses or the wealthiest families due to increased costs. Because many farmers cannot grow their own food or produce extra to sell, food is imported from other areas of the world.\nAnd with heavier rains comes massive flooding and landslides washing away not only crops and homes but people and animals as well. Diseases such as cholera, dengue, malaria, as well as stomach and eye infections are also more prevalent in the summers with heavier rains according to World Monsoons. Many of these diseases are spread though water systems that have been overloaded and have been unable to clean the water used for drinking, cleaning, and so on.\nThe North American Monsoon System also brings the start of the fire season in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, according to 2004 NOAA report due to the increased amount of lightning brought on by pressure and temperature changes. The amount of lightning, up to tens of thousands of strikes per night in some regions according to the study, not only brings fires to the region but also power disruptions, and severe injuries.\nMonsoons and global warming\nAccording to a study by Yen Yi Loo, Lawal Billa, and Ajit Singh, a group of scientists from Malaysia, published in Geoscience Frontiers in 2015, the effects of global warming on a monsoon can potentially be devastating due to frequent shifts and changes in precipitation levels and timelines. World Monsoons estimates that there will be an increase in rainfall during the summer monsoon seasons in the next 50 to 100 years. Greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, can make warm air hold onto more water only to release it as rain over already soaked areas. During the dry winter monsoon seasons, it is believed that the land will become drier as evaporation increases in warmer temperatures.\nOn shorter timescales, the amount of rainfall during a summer monsoon may be changed year to year by a variety of factors including air pollution, according to World Monsoons. El Niño in the Pacific oceans can also have effects on the monsoon in India on both the short- and long-terms, according to studies from the University of Colorado in Boulder.\nAccording to the above study, the strength of El Niño's warming was believed to be the main influence in the strength of the monsoon seasons. However, it now appears that instead of the strength of El Niño, it is in fact the location of the warming. The researchers compiled data of rainfall in India and satellite observations of the Pacific Ocean and discovered that when El Niño warming was located in:\n- the central Pacific, India experienced droughts.\n- the eastern Pacific, India experienced normal monsoon conditions.\n- The western Pacific, India experienced more rain.\nThere are many factors that can have an effect on a monsoon, including El Niño, and there is a great deal of research going into better understanding these factors and how the monsoon changes. Much of this research is going into how to better predict future and current rainfalls and winds, such as described in an article published in 2015 on Science Daily from the Office of Naval Research. The greater the knowledge about the workings of a monsoon, the more accurately the onset and strength can be predicted.\nWhen approximately half of India's population works in agriculture and agriculture makes up eighteen percent of India's GDP, according to Stratfor, for example, the shifting in both timing of a monsoon and the amount of rain, can lead to big problems. With all of the ongoing research, perhaps the problems can turn into solutions.","What is El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO)?\nWhat is El Niño?\nThe El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a large-scale climatic phenomenon that originates in the tropical Pacific but affects global climate patterns. The warm phase is known as El Niño, and the cold phase is La Niña. El Niño occurs irregularly every two to seven years and peaks in winter.\nThe term El Niño, Spanish for ‘child’ or ‘the Christ child’, was first used by fishermen along the coasts of Ecuador and Peru to refer to a warm ocean current that typically appears around Christmastime and lasts for several months.\nWhat causes an El Niño event?\nIn a normal year, when ENSO is inactive, the equatorial Pacific trade winds blow from east to west. The winds push the warmer water towards the west, and colder water rises up from deeper in the ocean to replace it. This creates an east-west difference in sea surface temperature and hence an east-west difference in sea level pressure that maintains the trade winds and so drives a positive feedback loop.\nDuring an El Niño year, the east-west SST difference weakens, the pressure difference weakens, and the trade winds and their effects on the ocean weaken, so the eastern Pacific warms further. However, during a La Niña year, the opposite happens, the east-west temperature difference strengthens, the pressure difference strengthens, and the trade winds and their effects on the ocean strengthen, so the east Pacific cools further.\nSuch changes in sea surface temperatures affect the atmosphere over vast areas, with local and global repercussions. Locally, the associated atmospheric circulation changes drive increased atmospheric convection and precipitation over the central and eastern Pacific, while rainfall is reduced over the western Pacific. In addition, these changes have remote impacts throughout the tropics and at higher latitudes via the atmosphere, especially when ENSO is at its strongest in winter.\nHow do we measure El Niño?\nA network of ocean buoys measures water temperature, currents and the wind. Satellites also provide surface temperature and current data, providing the ability to monitor ENSO in real-time. We can also predict El Niño months in advance as we can measure the heat content of the upper ocean, one of the precursors for the onset of El Niño and use our climate models to predict its evolution. Although various criteria exist, we usually say an El Niño event is underway when sea surface temperatures in the equatorial Pacific (officially called Niño region 3.4) rise 0.5°C above the historical average for at least three months in a row.\nImpacts of El Niño and La Niña\nThe most substantial impacts are experienced by those countries near the tropical Pacific origin of ENSO. Changes in surface temperatures, winds and moisture affect rainfall intensity and patterns, leading to extreme events such as flooding and drought. During an El Niño event, Peru, Ecuador and the south-eastern parts of South America receive heavy rainfall. In northern Brazil, drier conditions or even drought results. Indonesia, South Asia and parts of Australia are also more likely to experience drought during El Niño. The change in weather patterns associated with El Niño can significantly impact the economy, particularly agriculture, water resources, fisheries and public health. ENSO also strongly influences the occurrence and intensity of tropical cyclones, and Atlantic hurricane activity weakens during El Niño but strengthens during La Niña. In the UK, we experience the socio-economic impacts of an El Niño event, partly through increased food prices. There are effects on the jet stream and European weather, especially in late winter when El Niño increases the chances of cold snaps. La Niña increases the chances of wet and stormy conditions.\nHow does El Niño affect global temperature?\nEl Niño releases heat into the atmosphere and increases subsequent global temperatures. For example, global average temperatures for 2016 were around 1.1°C above preindustrial values and the strong El Niño episode of 2015/2016 partly contributed. However, researchers have concluded that the warming from El Niño is only accountable for about 0.2°C of this overall figure.\nEl Niño and climate change\nBecause of the large event-to-event variations of El Niño, we don’t have enough past years of observations to show a clear impact of climate change on its properties. However, there is now some evidence that the effects of El Niño on rainfall may increase in the future and that we may even see more extreme ENSO events, but these remain active research questions."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:e488463e-bfa2-439c-891d-d746cb6782f6>","<urn:uuid:5c500c11-408a-4bc2-b27d-e1b63643da23>"],"error":null}

The project is supported by the Research Council of Norway, Innovation Norway, and ENOVA under the PILOT-E scheme.\nDecarbonising Yara’s production\nFertiliser giant Yara is involved in several projects to reduce the costs of producing hydrogen from renewable energy sources. The latest news is the cooperation between Yara and NEL, writes E24/energi.\n“Yara’s vision is to use our products to help to feed the world's population on a sustainable and environmentally beneficial basis, and the strategy is to reduce Yara's climate footprint,” says Odd-Arne Lorentsen, head of research of Yara at Herøya Research Park. Today's factories are based on fossil fuels. “But now, ‘green’ hydrogen technology is rapidly being developed worldwide, and two factors in particular make this especially interesting. Access to renewable energy is increasing, and prices have fallen significantly in recent years,” says Lorentsen.\nMaking fertiliser from air, water, wind and sun\nLorentsen describes the brainstorming process in the research department that resulted in the electrolyser project with NEL.\n“All of our fertiliser products are based on ammonia, which consists of hydrogen and nitrogen. I therefore gathered some of our best talent in a team, in order to come up with some good ideas to solve: How to make fertiliser just by using air (nitrogen), water (hydrogen and renewable power), sun, wind and stone. The solution also had to be sustainable, energy-effective and commercially viable over 10-20 years.”\n“As a technology expert, it was a ‘bit disappointing’ that we had to go back in time and retrieve ‘old’ technology as the most promising. We found the electrolyser that we (Hydro and Yara) used right up to 1991 at Yara's factory in Glomfjord, after which the electrolysers were outrun by fossil energy, access and low prices. Conditions have now changed, however, and electrolysis-based hydrogen technology is expected to become competitive in a few years’ time, assuming favourable prices for renewable power.”\nNow, NEL Hydrogen Electrolyser is to develop the electrolyser technology for water-based hydrogen production adapted to the use of various renewable energy sources from water, wind and sun, and to test this technology together with Yara.\nFantastic support scheme to build a new generation of factories\nLorentsen commends the PILOT-E scheme that provides financing for Norwegian business and industry.\n“The main task of the research centre is to develop solutions for a whole new generation of factories, and PILOT-E is a fantastic support scheme backed by the Research Council of Norway, Innovation Norway, and ENOVA. It is particularly good because it includes the entire process, from research and development, to launch in the market.”\nBuilding electrolysers – connecting them to the factory\nWhat are the check points going forward?\n“The first big hurdle for NEL is to develop the flexible 5-MW high-pressure electrolyser, and for Yara to define all the infrastructure and connection to the existing ammonia factory that is necessary to operate the new technology,” says technical project manager Gaute Finstad. “We will then commence a testing and learning period in order to prove that the technology works. Then Yara has to find out how to put this to most effective use in fertiliser production.”\nHerøya as a test site\n“It's interesting to use Porsgrunn and Herøya as a test site because we have all the expertise needed, including R&D and all technical aspects and infrastructure. We can connect test operations directly to the ammonia factory and also reproduce conditions elsewhere. Here, we can simulate all renewable energy sources such as water, sun and wind,” the project manager explains.\nWhen do you expect the technology to be fully tested?\n“We expect to start up pilot runs at the ammonia factory in 2022,” says Finstad. “The foundations and infrastructure are already in place, so that we can be up and running more quickly and less expensively than if we were to build up everything from scratch.”\nBuilding factories to handle “wind and weather”\nWhat is the biggest challenge?\n“Renewable energy means that we need more complex factories to tackle shifts in ‘wind and weather’ conditions,” according to the green fertiliser duo.\nSelling green fertiliser worldwide.\n“We’re good at running factories in stable conditions. It will be a more demanding task to operate factories independently of the variations in energy input due to wind and weather conditions. Part of the job is to learn how to make production more flexible towards this variable energy access, and how to design factory facilities in a variable regime,” they say.\nSelling worldwide is the aim\n“The aim is to produce fertiliser from renewable energy at a price that we can sell at worldwide,” says Lorentsen. “We’ve developed a technical and financial model to design efficient production on new terms, but we also rely on identifying the customer segment interested in buying our CO₂-free mineral fertiliser.”\nAbout “Green fertiliser”\nDevelop technology for emission-free fertiliser production. Build the next-generation factory, 2030.\nSOME OF THE PARTNERS:\nNEL: Leading producer of electrolysers for water-based production of hydrogen for the transport sector and industry.\nSINTEF: Leading research institute in Norway.\nEletrolyser technology, water-based production of hydrogen using renewable energy sources from water, wind and sun, combined with classical ammonia technology.\nModernising the technology, with full process and digital integration to optimise the entire production chain from the raw material, via ammonia and nitric acid, to full fertiliser quality, is a key to success.\nYara stands for the largest share of the financing, but also receives significant combined financing from the Research Council of Norway, Innovation Norway and ENOVA via the Pilot E scheme. The aim of the scheme is for completely new products and services within ecofriendly energy technology to be developed more quickly and put to use in order to contribute to cutting emissions both in Norway and internationally. PILOT-E follows up operators throughout the technology development process – from idea to market.\nDevelopment of the new electrolyser will be completed for delivery from NEL to Yara in 2022. Yara’s research centre is also working with a more ecofriendly nitric acid concept, but it will take a few more years before large-scale testing can take place.\nYara's technology and project organisation has plans to design and build an infrastructure for delivery of hydrogen from NEL's electrolysers to the ammonia factory at Herøya. NEL delivers the electrolyser, while Yara's factory personnel, together with the research unit, will operate and test various operational conditions for the electrolyser, and how it can be integrated into the the ammonia factory.\nSiri Krohn-Fagervoll <siriSPAMFILTER@krohnfagervoll.no>"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:19d4d302-a8d9-4cc4-a2ba-360e2dede670>","<urn:uuid:4b2cdc97-8c3e-4511-996e-3ee7e8b18198>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do wild bees and managed honey bees differ in their agricultural importance and current challenges?","answer":"Wild bees and managed honey bees face different challenges and have distinct roles in agriculture. Only 2% of wild bee species pollinate 80% of bee-pollinated crops worldwide, and while many wild bee populations are declining due to agricultural development and pesticides, these key species can remain abundant in agricultural landscapes. Honey bees, meanwhile, are no longer considered wild in many regions due to intense management, and face significant challenges like colony collapse disorder, which has led to alarming disappearance rates. This has made wild pollination increasingly important for global food security. Both types are crucial for agriculture, with honey bees pollinating one-third of our daily food, while wild bees provide essential backup and stability to pollination systems, particularly as honey bee colonies become more unstable.","context":["Surprisingly Few ‘Busy Bees’ Make Global Crops Grow\nWild bees valued in the billions, roughly equal to honeybees\n- By Basil D.N. Waugh\nA major international study finds that surprisingly few bee species are responsible for pollinating the world’s crops.\nThe paper, published in Nature Communications, suggests that only two percent of wild bee species pollinate 80 percent of bee-pollinated crops worldwide. The study is one of the largest on bee pollination to date.\nWhile agricultural development and pesticides have been shown to produce sharp declines in many wild bee populations, the study shows these “busy bees” can remain abundant in agricultural landscapes.\nThe study gives a powerful economic rationale for conserving wild bees. It calculates the value of wild bee pollination to the global food system at $3,000 per hectare of insect-pollinated agricultural land – an amount in the billions globally, and roughly equal to the value of honey bees.\nBut the findings also offer a warning to conservation advocates hoping that economic arguments can justify the preservation of all species. Moral reasons are still needed, researchers say.\n“This study shows us that wild bees provide enormous economic benefits, but reaffirms that the justification for protecting species cannot always be economic,” says Taylor Ricketts of the University of Vermont’s Gund Institute For Ecological Economics, a study co-author. “We still have to agree that protecting biodiversity is the right thing to do.”\nFifty-eight researchers worldwide conducted the three-year study, led by Professor David Kleijn of the Netherlands’ Wageningen University.\nThe study advances our understanding of wild bees’ crucial role in the global food system. About two-thirds of the world’s most important crops benefit from bee pollination, including coffee, cacao and many fruits and vegetables.\nWild pollination is increasingly important with the growing instability of honey bee colonies. Honey bees are no longer considered wild in many regions due to their intense management.\nThe most important wild bees for agriculture include some of the world’s most common species, including the common eastern bumblebee (Bombus impatiens) in the U.S. and the red-tailed bumblebee (Bombus lapidarius) in Europe, researchers say.\nOne reason to preserve bee biodiversity is securing the future resiliency of global pollination systems, Ricketts says. Previous studies associate biodiversity with more stable pollination services over time.\n“Species and populations can fluctuate significantly as landscapes and climates change,” says Ricketts, who is also a professor in UVM’s Rubenstein School of Environment and Natural Resources. “So protecting a wide variety of our wild bees is crucial.”\nThe paper outlines bee-friendly practices for farmers, including maintaining wildflowers and grass strips, organic farming techniques, and limiting – or delaying – the use of pesticides and other chemicals.\nThe study includes 90 individual studies of nearly 1,400 crop fields across five continents (North America, Europe, Asia, Africa and South America).\nRegular monitoring found nearly 74,000 individual bees from nearly 785 wild bees species on crops. Of 20,000 known bee species, roughly two percent pollinated 80 per cent of crops.\n“Rare and threatened species may play a less significant role economically than common species, but this does not mean their protection is less important,” says Kleijn.\nThe economic benefits to people from nature – such as crop pollination, water purification, and carbon storage – are increasingly known as ecosystem services. The fact that nature provides these services has increasingly been used as a reason to protect the environment and its biodiversity.\nRead the study: Delivery of crop pollination services is an insufficient argument for wild pollinator conservation. Doi:10.1038/ncomms8414.","Farmers’ pollinating friends\nAccording to the USDA, honeybee pollination is responsible for one mouthful out of every three foods that we eat each day. \"The value of honeybee population to U.S. agriculture is more than $14 billion annually, according to a Cornell University study. Crops from nuts to vegetables, and as diverse as alfalfa, apple, cantaloupe, cranberry, pumpkin and sunflower all require pollinating by honeybees,\" wrote Kevin Hackett, ARS national program leader for the USDA (www.ars.usda.gov/is/AR/archive/mar04/form0304.pdf).\nMost farmers know that to procure honeybees for pollination can be difficult, especially in light of the colony collapse disorder, where honeybees are disappearing at an alarming rate. Still, there’s hope because beekeepers who run small honeybee keeping operations will loan their bees to work the small farmers’ fields for pollination purposes.\nHow small apiaries help the local farmer\nTed and Becky Jones of Farmington, Conn., have been in the bee business, called Jones’ Apiaries, LLC, for the past 13 years. They were bee hobbyists for 24 years before becoming entrepreneurs.\n\"Our hobby beekeeping grew over the years, adding hives over time, until we felt that we really wanted to see about the possibility of the bees being a good activity for our early retirement. So, it was a natural step to go into a sideline business of beekeeping.\n\"There was a need for pollination here in Connecticut, our farms being smaller than the mega-farms in other parts of the country. The big migratory beekeepers move hives by tractor trailer and usually deliver at least a half a tractor-trailer load of bees at a time—that is a minimum of 220 hives. No farm here in Connecticut is big enough to need that many hives at once. Our state is still family-run farms, not corporate farms,\" Becky says.\nThe Jones own about 350 hives. They own New World Carniolan (Apis mellifera carnica) and Italian (Apis mellifera) honeybees.\nDon Conlon of South Deerfield, Mass., owns Warm Colors Apiary (www.warmcolorsapiary.com) where he has been a full-time beekeeper for 10 years, and has owned bees for 45 years. He owns 500 honey hives for honey production and 30 for queen rearing.\nConlon went into the pollination business because \"local farms were having difficulty finding willing beekeepers for pollination. It also keeps other beekeepers out of our area, reducing the exposure to new pests and diseases.\n\"Pollination is by contract with local growers. We do not move bees beyond a 30 to 40-mile area from our home yards and do not move our bees frequently during the season as we feel it adds stress and reduces honey production,\" Conlon says.\nKen Hoover, of Shade Tree Apiary (www.shadetreeapiary.com) in west-central Pennsylvania, operates his pollination business with limited customers. He explains, \"As far as pollination, we only do it on a small scale. That involves taking a few hives to local orchards or farm fields and bringing [the bees] back when done. [I work] mostly [with] people too small to be serviced by regular commercial pollinators.\n\"I got into honeybees to provide pollination for my own orchard and crops. Of course, that is the start. Once started, the bees [were] like an addiction. We have members of our [bee] association that have quit four or five times. The ladies [worker bees] are so amazing and fascinating; once involved, it’s the rare individual that can ever completely get out [of beekeeping].\"\nMike Thomas of Bjorn Apiaries (www.bjornapiaries.com) in Lewisbury, Pa, owns between 300 and 500 hives \"depending on the time of year. I breed Russian [Apis mellifera], Carniolans and survivor stock. I do limited pollination and honey production. My main operation is queen and nuc production [the nucleus hive to make new hives]. I started with two hives and within three years and 60 hives later, was a state bee inspector. This helped me transition into a commercial operation.\"\nOrganic is best\nThese beekeepers all agree that limited spraying and organic farming are the best for overall bee health. The Pennsylvania beekeeper says, \"My suggestions for farmers, fruit, vegetable and nut growers [and] homeowners are to not spray more than necessary and to know the safety precautions of the chemicals that you are spraying. Also, try and do your spraying early in the morning or late in the evening. This can be done with a little planning. The indiscriminate spraying done by some people would be like me, a beekeeper, setting my bee hives next to their pets and expecting them not to get stung.\"\nConlon says, \"We will only work with farmers who do not spray during bloom, are organic and will provide bear fencing. In other words, we try to keep our bees in healthy, risk-free environments.\"\nHoover agrees, \"Keeping bees alive is no longer a given. I personally do not treat with chemicals. I use various techniques to reduce mite loads. Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. Support your local beekeeper. Think about honeybees when you are applying pesticides or other chemicals. Remember, the bees need the wildflowers and clovers that grow in fallow fields and edges, too.\"\nThomas adds, \"Think before you spray. Honeybees are only part of the pollination picture. Beneficial insects need to be protected, too.\"\nThe joys of pollinating\nBeekeepers enjoy their work. The Pennsylvania beekeeper says, \"The most rewarding things about beekeeping are watching how the bees work together, how God created them. You can use the bees for many object lessons once you learn how [they] interact with each other. I also enjoy retrieving swarms. Something else I’m doing is mentoring a new beekeeper.\"\nHoover says, \"Just being a beekeeper is rewarding. Seeing well-pollinated crops and fruit is great, knowing [I] had a hand in making it happen.\"\nLike the Pennsylvania farmer, Hoover knows agriculture, which aids in his appreciation of his bees. He says, \"I was born and raised in a rural, agricultural environment. Pollination is just something [I lived] with and was taught about. I have and am still learning and observing the bees. They are born with their college education; we are just students of their behavior. I’m a firm believer in belonging to a local beekeeping association. The help and advice of other beekeepers are invaluable.\"\nConlon says his love of the outdoors correlates with the benefits of beekeeping. \"Working outdoors in beautiful, quiet settings is another reason I enjoy beekeeping. I spend most of my working days on farms and on land rich in its wildlife plants and quiet surroundings. Working with bees is stimulating. You must like solving puzzles and trying new solutions to keep up with the challenges facing our honeybees. It’s difficult work, sometimes discouraging, but always [requires] focus and continued learning. I enjoy working in the agricultural community with independent, self-directed farmers,\" he says.\nAdvice to farmers\nConlon’s best piece of advice to fruit, vegetable and nut growers is, \"Make arrangements early in the winter with a beekeeper. Many farmers call just before bloom, without prearranged contracts, and there are no bees ready for pollination; they are already committed to other farms. Beekeepers struggle to get their colonies through the winter so checking in March to confirm numbers of colonies is also important follow-up. The most important aspects of good pollination is for both the farmer and beekeeper to work together; understand the requirements for the crops targeted for pollination; timing of delivery and removal of bees; and the farmers’ willingness to protect the bees while on their land.\"\nJones adds, \"To the farmers, be sure to do your research and know what your crop needs in terms of pollination. Open and honest communication between beekeepers and farmers are the best way to get a good job done.\"\nDewey M. Caron, professor of apiculture with the University of Delaware and recently retired from that post, has worked with honeybee research for over 40 years. He advises growers \"to work cooperatively to solve the issues. [There] needs to be some professionalism on both sides, such as written contracts to replace the ‘handshake, ‘ but still need to communicate to avoid pesticide kills, good service, etc.\"\nConlon adds, \"Pollination using honeybees is not always effective for all crops. Farmers should look for ways to encourage native bees, to improve habitat and increase populations and use honeybees as a buffer or as an additional pollinator on the farm. This is particularly true for small, diversified farms and organic growers.\"\nPollination is essential to growers, and small bee operations know their bees’ value to the continuation of the food cycle. But, beekeepers agree that limited spraying, organic farming methods and communication with them are the key components to success with each party-the farmer and the beekeeper.\nThe author is a freelance writer based in Ephrata, Pa.

{"question":"What are the key mathematical models used for wind turbine power coefficient estimation, and what impact does wind turbine size have on bird and bat mortality rates?","answer":"Wind turbine power coefficient can be estimated using various mathematical models including exponential, sinusoidal, and polynomial models (particularly fourth-degree polynomial functions), as well as state observers and stochastic probability functions. As for the impact of turbine size on wildlife mortality, studies have shown that the collision risk for both birds and bats increases with increasing size of wind turbines, though this relationship was not found to be statistically significant. The collision rates varied between 0 and more than 50 collisions per turbine per year for both birds and bats.","context":["Main Article Content\nAutoresJosé Genaro González-Hernández, Ph. D. http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2126-2304\nRubén Salas-Cabrera, Ph. D.\nThis paper aims at summarizing various methods used for representing and estimating the power coefficient in wind turbines, such as exponential, sinusoidal and polynomial models, as well as mathematical tools known as state observers. We present an exhaustive bibliographic review of the models used to calculate the power coefficient, given that this type of studies are scarce nowadays. In addition, we propose models that can be satisfactorily used for various analyzes of wind energy conversion systems, such as the representation by a polynomial function of fourth degree and the models based on the stochastic probability function. The relevance of this work is supported by the advantages and disadvantages of the various models and estimators of the power coefficient, which are presented at the end of the article in a comparative table with the purpose of offering to the reader a general summary. Ultimately, this review aims at helping researchers, students, university professors and those who wish to venture into this field, even though they do not have much experience, to establish a quick synthesized understanding of the different models and representations of the power coefficient.\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.\nThe journal authorizes the total or partial reproduction of the published article, as long as the source, including the name of the Journal, author(s), year, volume, issue, and pages are cited.\nThe ideas and assertions expressed by the authors are their solely responsibility and do not represent the views and opinions of the Journal or its editors.\nAll articles included in the Revista Facultad de Ingeniería are published under the Creative Commons (BY) license.\nAuthors must complete, sign, and submit the Review and Publication Authorization Form of the manuscript provided by the Journal; this form should contain all the originality and copyright information of the manuscript.\nThe authors keep copyright, however, once the work in the Journal has been published, the authors must always allude to it.\nThe Journal allows and invites authors to publish their work in repositories or on their website after the presentation of the number in which the work is published with the aim of generating greater dissemination of the work.\n H.

The focus is on wind energy as there is only little information on the impact on birds and bats of other sources of renewable energy. The report aims at better understanding the size of the impact, the potential effects of re-powering (exchanging small old wind turbines by new big turbines), and possible measures to reduce the negative impact on birds by wind turbines. In addition the need for further research is highlighted.\nThe evaluation is based on 127 separate studies (wind farms) in ten countries, most of them in Germany. Most studies were brief (not more than two years) and did not include the preconstruction period. Before-After Control Impact studies that combine data collection before and after, in this case construction of a wind farm, on both the proposed development site and at least one reference site were rare. In only a few cases, would the design of the study and the length of the study period theoretically allow statistically significant effects of wind farms on birds and bats to be found at all. Assessments of impacts, therefore, are usually based on few studies only. This report includes all studies readily available to the authors, irrespective of the length of the study period and the quality of the study design. In order to base the assessments on as many independent samples as possible even rather unsystematic observations were included. The information of the data was reduced to a level that justified the application of sign tests. The compilation of many different individual studies gave the following results:\nThe main potential hazards to birds and bats from wind farms are disturbance leading to displacement or exclusion and collision mortality. Although there is a high degree of agreement among experts that wind farms may have negative impacts on bird populations no statistically significant evidence of negative impacts on populations of breeding birds could be found. There was a tendency waders nesting on open grounds to be displaced by wind farms. Some passerines obviously profited from wind farms. They were probably affected by secondary impacts, e.g. changes in land management or abandonment from agricultural use next to the wind plants.\nThe impact of wind farms on non-breeding birds was stronger. Wind farms had significantly negative effects on local populations of geese, Wigeons, Golden Plovers and Lapwings.\nWith the exceptions of Lapwings, Black-tailed Godwits and Redshanks most bird species used the space close to wind turbines during the breeding season. The minimal distances observed between birds and pylons rarely exceeded 100 m during the breeding season. Some passerines showed a tendency to settle closer to bigger than to smaller wind turbines.\nDuring the non-breeding season many bird species of open landscapes avoided approaching wind parks closer than a few hundred metres. This particularly held true for geese and waders. In accordance with published information disturbance of geese may occur at least up to 500 m from wind turbines. For most species during the non-breeding season, the distances at which disturbance could be noted increased with the size of the wind turbines. For Lapwings this relationship was statistically significant. There was no evidence that birds generally became „habituated“ to wind farms in the years after their construction. The results of the few studies lasting longer than one season revealed about as many cases of birds occurring closer to wind farms (indications for the existence of habituation) over the years as those of birds occurring further away from wind farms (indications for the lack of habituation).\nThe question whether wind farms act as barriers to movement of birds has so far received relatively little systematic scientific attention. Wind farms are thought to be barriers if birds approaching them change their flight direction, both on migration or during other regular flights.\nThere is evidence for the occurrence of a barrier effect in 81 bird species. Geese, Common Cranes, waders and small passerines were affected in particular. However, the extent to which the disturbances due to wind farms of migrating or flying birds influences energy budgets or the timing of migration of birds remains unknown.\nCollision rates (annual number of killed individuals per turbine) have only rarely been studied with appropriate methods (e. g. with controls of scarvenger activities). In particular, such studies are missing for Germany. Collision rates varied between 0 and more than 50 collisions per turbine per year for both birds and bats. Obviously the habitat influenced the number of collisions. Birds were at high risks at wind farms close to wetlands where gulls were the most common victims and at wind farms on mountain ridges (USA, Spain), where many raptors were killed. Wind farms in or close to forests posed high collision risks for bats. For both birds and bats, the collision risk increased with increasing size of the wind turbine. The relationship, however, was not statistically significant.\nGulls and raptors accounted for most of the victims. In Germany the relatively high numbers of White-tailed Eagles (13) and Red Kites (41) killed give cause for concern. Germany hosts about half of the world population of breeding Red Kites and has a particular responsibility for this species. Bird species that were easily disturbed by wind farms (geese, waders) were only rarely found among the victims. Bats were struck by wind turbines mostly in late summer or autumn during the period of migration and dispersal.\nPopulation models created by the software VORTEX revealed that significant decreases in size of bird and bat populations may be caused by relatively small (0,1 %) additive increases in annual mortality rates, provided they are not counter acted by density dependent increases in reproduction rates. Short-lived species with high reproductive rates are more affected than long-lived species with low reproductive rates. The latter, however, are less able to substitute additional mortality by increasing reproductive rates.\nThe effects of „repowering“ (substitution of old, small turbines by new turbines with higher capacity) on birds and bats is assessed by the available data and by simple models. There is no information, however, on the effects of the newest generation of very large wind turbines. According to current knowledge, repowering will reduce negative impacts on birds and bats (disturbance and mortality) if the total capacity of a wind farm is not changed (many small turbines are replaced by few big turbines). In a scenario in which the capacity of a wind farm is increased 1.5 fold, negative impacts start to dominate. In case of a doubling of wind farm capacity, repowering increases the negative impacts of the wind farm. Repowering offers the chance to remove wind farms from sites that are associated with high impacts or risks for birds and bats. New turbines could be constructed on sites that are likely to be less problematic with respect to birds and bats.\nEffective methods of reducing the negative impacts of wind energy use on birds and bats include:\n- choice of the right site for wind farms (avoidance of wetands, woodlands, important sites for sensitive non-breeding birds and mountain ridges with high numbers of raptors and vultures),\n- measures to reduce the attractivness of wind farm sites for potential collision victims,\n- configuration of turbines within wind farms (placement of turbines parallel to and not accross the main migration or flight directions of birds),\n- construction of wind turbines: replacement of lattice towers, wire-cables and overhead power lines.\nMeasures to increase the visibility of wind turbines and to reduce the effects of illumination remain to be studied.\nIn spite of many publications on windfarms and birds there still is a great demand for further research. First of all there is an urgent need for reliable data on collision rates at wind turbines of birds and bats in Germany. This holds true particularly for the new and big turbines which will replace the present generation of wind turbines.\nIt is still unclear whether these big and necessarily illuminated turbines pose a high collision risk to nocturnal migrants which have not yet been greatly affected by smaller turbines. The high collision rates of Red Kites in Germany also merit urgently study. The aim of the research has to be a quick reduction of the collision rates. The sensitivity to wind farms of many other bird species that are of particular nature conservation interest (storks, raptors, Cranes) has not yet been sufficiently studied.\nThere is hardly any information on the impacts of arrays of solar panels on birds and bats. Studies should be initiated as soon as possible."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:cd026faf-4553-4050-b519-583f59924af3>","<urn:uuid:94aae7dd-018c-48dc-b84c-619735491aee>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How does temperature affect tool wear in metal cutting, and what are the recommended preventive measures for heat-related damage? 🌡️","answer":"In metal cutting, about 80% of heat is carried away by chips while 20% transfers to the tool, with heat and temperature being fundamental causes of wear. Temperature-related damage can manifest as thermal cracking from temperature fluctuations, deformation of carbide under extreme heat, and cratering from chemical reactions between steel workpieces and carbide tools. To prevent heat-related damage, several measures can be taken: reducing cutting speed to lower edge temperature, selecting grades with higher thermal shock resistance, using coated tools (particularly PVD coatings or titanium aluminum nitride coatings for heat insulation), and carefully managing coolant application - either ensuring consistent coverage or turning it off completely to avoid temperature fluctuations. Additionally, using materials with better wear resistance and adjusting feed rates can help manage heat generation.","context":["How to judge the wear of the cutting tools and what improvement methods are there?\nIn the metal cutting process, the surface load at the tool/ workpiece interface, the energy, and friction generated by the high-speed sliding of chips along the rake face are converted into heat, and usually 80% of this heat is carried away by chips (the change of this proportion mainly depends on the cutting speed), while the remaining 20% is transferred into the tool. Heat and temperature are the basis of wear and tear of the tool.\nONE: The Judgment of Wear and Tear of Tool\n- The Tool Life Table ( based on the number of the machined workpieces) is used by some high-end equipment manufacturing enterprises or single-product batch production enterprises to guide production. This method is suitable for aerospace, steam turbine, automobile key components such as engines, which are very expensive.\n- If there are intermittent and irregular sparks in the processing process, it turns out that the tool is worn out and should be changed in time according to the average life.\n- Color of the chips. If the color changes, it shows that the temperature has been changed when processing, which may be caused by tool wear.\n- The shape of the chips The serrations appear on both sides of the chips, curl abnormally. The chips become more fine and small. These phenomena are the judgment basis for tool wear.\n- The surface of the workpiece. there are bright marks, but no obvious change of roughness and size, which show that the tool has been worn.\n- The Sound. When vibration intensifies on processing, or when the tool is not sharp, there will be abnormal sound.\n- A load of machine equipment. If there are obvious incremental changes, the tool is worn.\nIn addition, some obvious phenomena such as serious burrs, roughness reduction, change of size, are also the criteria for judging tool wear.\nTWO: Types of Tool Wear and Common Methods to Prevent from Damage\n- Worn cutting edge.\nImprovement measures: Properly reduce cutting speed; use more wear-resistant material; use coated tools.\n- Broken teeth.\nImprovement measures: use material with better toughness; use tools with strengthened cutting edge; check the rigidity of process system.\n- Chip accumulation and breakage.\nImprovement measures: use chucks with overload protection; make the chip groove on the drill bit and improve the groove of machine tap; make the cutting edge sharper.\n- Insufficient precision.\nImprovement measures: Improve the runout of cutting edge about drill bit. Control all runouts of machine taps. If the requirement is high, choose a tool with high precision as much as possible and do not grind repeatedly during use.\nThe continuous development of best tool matrix, coating and cutting edge technology is crucial to limit tool wear and high-temperature resistance when cutting. These factors, together with the chip groove and the radius of the corner arc radius used on the indexable insert, determine the applicability of each tool to different workpieces and cutting processes. The best combination of all these elements can prolong the service life of cutting tools and make cutting more reliable and economical.","Click Image to Enlarge\nCutting tools fail in different ways. The same cutting edge used in two different processes may succumb to two different types of failure. Cutting tool suppliers study these failure modes, but is information about the failure mode really relevant to production? That is, given that the tool user is most interested in knowing when the tool is going to fail, is it also worthwhile for that user to determine just how the tool is failing?\nRobert Sullivan and Don Yordy of Ingersoll Cutting Tools (Rockford, Illinois) both say yes. Knowing the failure mode for a particular tool in a given process is indeed useful. Mr. Sullivan is the manager of coating technologies for Ingersoll Cutting Tools, and Mr. Yordy is the manager of the company’s technical center.\nThey say that one benefit of recognizing the failure mode relates to diagnosis. Certain wear types suggest certain problems, indicating how the tool or process might be changed to improve not just tool life but also cutting performance.\nAnother benefit relates to consistency. Tools fail through different fundamental mechanisms. They include abrasion, heat, mechanical impacts and chemical interaction. These mechanisms lead to the variety of failure modes that are covered in this article. However, one mechanism and its related failure mode are preferable to all others. That failure mode is abrasive wear. This wear type indicates a stable and reliable process, and the gradualness and predictability of abrasive wear can often be leveraged to improve the process’s effectiveness.\nDetermining the failure mode does not have to be difficult, Mr. Sullivan and Mr. Yordy say—just pull the tool. Specifically, pull it at about 30 percent and 70 percent of the tool life you currently expect. Examine the cutting edge at these stages, comparing the wear you see with the photos in this article and the failure mode descriptions below.\nAgain, abrasive wear is the ideal mode of failure. Abrasive wear is caused by the workpiece material rubbing across the primary clearance surface of the tool. For a particular insert number from a particular manufacturer in a given process, abrasive wear tends to be repeatable, and therefore predictable.\nAbrasive wear also tends to telegraph its progress. This is another reason why abrasive wear is preferred. Some clue in the cut will generally make it clear that the abrasive wear is increasing. The clue may be visual, taking the form of burrs on the part or a change in the machined finish. Or it may be audible, such as a gradual change in the sound of the cut. Clues such as these can make it easy to determine when the insert needs to be changed.\nBecause abrasive wear is the ideal wear type, there is little about the process that should be changed when this wear is encountered. However, certain grades and coatings do offer higher resistance to wear, particularly at higher speeds. If the tool is wearing abrasively, switching to one of these grades or coatings may extend the life.\nIn general, the problem known as cratering could refer to any wear that is caused by the workpiece material interacting\nwith the insert’s rake face. The most well-known cratering involves a chemical reaction between a steel workpiece and a carbide tool, in which carbon out of the rake face dissolves into the chip. However, cratering might also be caused by the abrasive action of the chip across the rake face, as when cast iron is cut at high speeds.\nThe danger of cratering is that the cutting edge often remains intact. The tool can keep cutting relatively well until it fails unexpectedly and catastrophically.\nThe possible solutions involve protecting the rake face. They include:\n- Reduce the speed to reduce the cutting edge temperature.\n- Reduce the feed rate to reduce the stress on the insert.\n- Select a coated grade to protect the rake face.\n- Change geometry to reduce the force that is directed to the rake face.\nNotching occurs because something about the surface of the workpiece creates a more difficult cutting condition than what the rest of the tool is experiencing at the full depth of cut. The reason for the difference in cutting conditions at the surface may relate to a workpiece’s surface scale, or it may relate to cold-forming stresses or work hardening. It may also relate to something seemingly more innocuous—for example, paint. Paint on a workpiece surface is prone to have a quenching effect on the cutting edge that obviously isn’t present deeper into the part.\nPotential solutions may relate to whether the notching is caused by chipping or abrasive wear. Depending on this wear type, switching to an insert grade with either higher mechanical shock resistance or higher wear resistance might do.\nOther potential solutions involve increasing the lead angle, for greater shearing action and a thinner chip, or increasing the hone size to increase the edge strength.\nYet another potential solution does not involve a change to the tool. Try varying the depth of cut between passes. A varying depth allows the wear to be concentrated along different parts of the edge.\nMost machine tool users associate thermal cracking with coolant. When the coolant covers the cutting edge inconsistently, the edge temperature may fluctuate. This causes the insert to expand and contract, leading to cracking of the edge.\nHowever, thermal cracking can also set in without coolant. For example, dry milling can involve temperature fluctuations sufficient for fatigue cracking, as the edge moves in and out of the material. In this non-coolant thermal cracking, the cracks in the insert are straight and parallel. By contrast, in thermal cracking involving coolant, the temperature fluctuation is more random, and the resulting non-parallel cracks are prone to produce chipping.\nPotential solutions for thermal cracking include these:\n- Reduce the speed to reduce the cutting edge temperature.\n- Turn the coolant off to reduce the extent of change between high and low temperatures.\n- Select a grade with higher thermal shock resistance.\n- Select a coated grade. In particular, a PVD coating can make it more difficult for cracks to get started, because a coating applied in this way offers a compressive stress to the insert’s surface.\nChipping And Fracturing\nLike thermal cracking, chipping or fracturing is not “wear” per se. This failure mode involves pieces of the cutting edge breaking away because the edge is too fragile to withstand the impact it receives. Either the impact or the edge needs to be addressed.\nPotential solutions include:\n- Select a grade with higher mechanical shock resistance—that is, higher toughness.\n- Increase the lead angle to produce a thinner chip and greater shearing action.\n- Improve system rigidity. This might involve improving the stability of the setup or improving how well the machine is maintained.\n- Increase the hone size for increased edge strength.\nIn a way, built-up edge can be a satisfying problem to solve. The solution can involve increasing the speed, which may result in higher productivity.\nBuilt-up edge occurs because the workpiece material becomes welded to the tool. The chip gets hot enough to become sticky, but then it cools fast enough to adhere to the insert. The potential solutions involve preventing the chip from becoming so hot, or else increasing the heat so that the chip doesn’t cool until after it has left the tool.\nTo prevent the chip from getting hot enough to weld, try applying coolant. Other possible solutions include using a more positive radial or axial rake to decrease the force, or selecting a coated grade. The coating can both decrease friction and decrease the likelihood of a reaction between the tool and work.\nThe opposite approach, getting the chip hotter, is where the speed comes in. Increasing the speed and/or the feed rate may succeed at putting enough extra heat into the chip to prevent the built-up edge from sticking.\nDeformation involves a softening and warping of the insert under the heat and pressure of the cut.\nDeforming a material as hard as carbide may seem strange, but the occurrence of deformation is actually on the rise. There was a time when carbide’s heat resistance was so much better than machine tools’ capabilities that there was practically no danger of deformation under the conditions the machines could apply. Machine tool performance has since advanced, and the highest performing machine tools today can apply tools aggressively enough to deform the tool, under conditions stable enough that the carbide does not fail by fracturing.\nWhen deformation is a danger, the possible solutions include:\n- Reduce the speed to reduce the heat.\n- Reduce the feed rate to reduce the pressure on the tool.\n- Select a grade with higher thermal or wear resistance.\n- Reduce hone size or change to a more positive geometry to reduce the stress and heat on the cutting edge.\n- Select a coated grade. Specifically, use titanium aluminum nitride or an aluminum oxide coating, either of which can be effective at insulating the tool from extreme heat in the cut."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:2c1e2f01-cd49-44e9-8f7f-8fe388222f9f>","<urn:uuid:686b58b8-9e2f-4e33-8948-ddcbc67615b7>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do doctors diagnose and assess the severity of inflammatory arthritis conditions like psoriatic arthritis mutilans?","answer":"Doctors diagnose these conditions through multiple methods. For psoriatic arthritis mutilans, they look for signs and symptoms affecting both skin and joints, although no specific biomarker exists. Diagnostic tools include blood tests to check for inflammation and antibodies, and X-rays to assess joint damage. The severity of bone destruction is also evaluated. When dactylitis (sausage-like swelling of digits) is present, doctors will rule out other potential causes such as insect/spider bites, allergic reactions, or broken bones. They will also consider specific patterns - such as whether the condition affects one or both sides of the body - and ask about other symptoms like psoriasis, joint pain, fevers, or fatigue to determine the specific type of inflammatory arthritis.","context":["Psoriatic Arthritis Mutilans: Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, Risk Factors, Treatment, Prognosis\nPsoriatic Arthritis Mutilans\nPsoriatic arthritis mutilans is a type of psoriatic arthritis, which is the most severe of all its types. It is also known as opera glass hand or telescope finger. It leads to the destruction of bone tissue. Psoriatic arthritis mutilans mostly affects hands and is rarely seen affecting wrist, feet or spine. Let us look at its causes, symptoms, diagnosis, risk factors, treatment and prognosis.\nCauses of Psoriatic Arthritis Mutilans\nPsoriatic arthritis is an autoimmune disorder, i.e. the immune system of the body attacks the healthy cells and tissue. While the exact causes of psoriatic arthritis mutilans are not known, immune system dysfunction is one of the possible reasons. It can also result in inflamed joints and overproduction of skin cells Immune system dysfunction can be genetic or environmental. A family history of psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis also contributes to the cause.\nHowever, there are certain causes that can be contributing causes of psoriatic arthritis mutilans. Bacterial or viral infection can trigger psoriatic arthritis in people with an inherent tendency. Long-term inflammation of the joint can lead to a permanent damage, where the bones of the most frequently joints start eroding, which commonly occurs in psoriatic arthritis mutilans.\nSymptoms of Psoriatic Arthritis Mutilans\nPsoriatic arthritis mutilans, just like other forms of psoriasis is a chronic condition which worsen with time. The patient experiences all the symptom of arthritis. The common symptoms of psoriatic arthritis mutilans include\n- Decreased mobility\n- The stiffness of the joint\n- The affected bone begins to disappear\n- Straightening and bending the joint becomes difficult\n- Shortening of the joint\n- Development of loose skin around the affected area\n- The loose skin appearance in the patient of psoriatic arthritis mutilans makes the nearby organ appear distinctive in shape.\nDiagnosis of Psoriatic Arthritis Mutilans\nThe diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis mutilans is done by the presence of signs and symptoms of skin and the joints affected. There is no such biomarker for psoriatic arthritis or psoriatic arthritis mutilans. However, other investigations may be done to confirm inflammatory condition and assess the severity of the symptoms and extent of joint damage.\nBlood test: After confirming the symptoms of arthritis the doctor can advise a blood test to check for the inflammation and to confirm the presence of antibodies.\nX-ray: It is an imaging test done to assess the joint damage.\nEvaluation of severity of bone destruction also helps to confirm the diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis mutilans.\nRisk Factors of Psoriatic Arthritis Mutilans\nSome of the important risk factors of psoriatic arthritis mutilans include\nHistory of Psoriasis: Suffering from psoriasis is one of the greatest risk factors of psoriatic arthritis mutilans. It is more common in people who have psoriatic lesions on nails.\nFamily history: The condition is more common in individuals who have a parent or a sibling suffering from psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis. Thus family history too is one of the risk factors of psoriatic arthritis mutilans.\nAge: People of any age can develop this condition, it being more common between the ages of 30-50 years.\nTreatment of Psoriatic Arthritis Mutilans\nAs psoriatic arthritis mutilans is a progressive disease, early the condition is diagnosed sooner can treatment start to manage the symptoms. Some of the medications used in the treatment of psoriatic arthritis mutilans include\nDisease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs): These drugs include methotrexate, leflunomide, and sulfasalazine, which help in slowing down the progression of psoriatic arthritis and save the joints and other tissue damage.\nImmunosuppressants: These medications are given to control the disturbance in the immune system, which is the reason for psoriatic arthritis.\nTNF- alpha inhibitors: TNF is an inflammatory substance produced in the body. The TNF inhibitors help reduce pain, swelling, and tenderness in the joints.\nNSAIDs: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the drugs which can help relieve pain and inflammation.\nSteroid injection: These are injected into the affected joint to offer quick relief from inflammation.\nJoint replacement surgery: Treatment of psoriatic arthritis mutilans, in some cases, may also include surgery. The joints which are severely damaged because of psoriatic arthritis mutilans are replaced with artificial prostheses.\nPhysical therapy: Early physical therapy can help delay or prevent psoriatic arthritis mutilans from joint destruction.\nPrognosis of Psoriatic Arthritis Mutilans\nPsoriatic arthritis mutilans is a rare of all the types of psoriatic arthritis. The progression is non-predictable. Appropriate and timely treatment of psoriatic arthritis mutilans can slow down disease progression and can improve the quality of life of the patient.\n- Hip Joint Psoriatic Arthritis: Causes, Symptoms, Treatment, PT, Surgery\n- Psoriatic Arthritis: Types, Causes, Symptoms, Treatment- Analgesics, DMARDs, Surgery\n- Elbow Psoriatic Arthritis: Types, Causes, Symptoms, Treatment, Prognosis, FAQ\n- Exercises for Psoriatic Arthritis|Therapeutic Exercises|Strength Training & Range of Motion Exercises\n- How is Psoriatic Arthritis Connected with Psoriasis?","Jeffrey R. Carlson, MD\nDactylitis is a symptom that is most often seen in patients who have inflammatory Psoriatic or Rheumatoid arthritis, which are auto-immune diseases. It is also known as “Sausage Finger” or “Sausage Toe” because of the localized, painful swelling that causes digits to look like sausages. The fingers or toes may also be warm and difficult to move due to the swelling. In this article, I will discuss how Dactylitis is treated, based on the underlying disease that causes the symptom.\nWhen a patient experiences extreme swelling in their finger(s), toe(s), hand(s) or feet, they usually head for medical care right away. When the usual suspect causes are ruled out, such as an insect/spider bite, allergic reaction, or a sprain or broken bone, a physician may begin to suspect another, more serious culprit is at play. The treating physician will order a battery of tests, diagnostic imaging, extensively question the patient and will likely find the root cause of Dactylitis. There are also clues, such as only one hand or finger being affected, vs. both hands and multiple fingers. Does the patient have psoriasis? Joint pain, fevers or fatigue? The answers to these questions help the physician make a diagnosis.\nOnce the underlying cause is determined, treatment can be administered. For most patients, inflammatory arthritis is the culprit. There are other less common causes, such as Sickle Cell Anemia, Tuberculosis, Sarcoidosis, Reactive Arthritis (caused by a bacterial infection) or Syphilis, which I will not address.\nPsoriatic Arthritis (PsA) is an inflammatory, auto-immune disease which severely affects joints, tendons and connective tissues and is seen in 30% of patients with psoriasis. They may have severe psoriasis or barely any skin symptoms. Patients experience pain, fatigue, depression, dry skin and eyes and other body issues. Dactylitis is a common symptom of this disease, seen in about half of the people who have PsA. With PsA, there is typically no symmetry in the disease, which means only one hand or finger on one side of the body may be affected with the swelling and stiffness, but not the other. PsA is treated with prescription anti-inflammatory medications, corticosteroids, DMARDS (Disease Modifying AntiRheumatic Drugs), or Biologic drugs, injectable medications that alter the patient’s immune system. Although there is no cure for PsA, the Dactylitis will subside or completely resolve as the root condition is brought under better control.\nRheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is an inflammatory, auto-immune disease that causes major damage to joints, organs and body systems, because the body’s immune system attacks them. Patients experience pain, low-grade fevers, fatigue, weight loss and depression. Dactylitis is a less common symptom of this disease. With RA, there is symmetry in the disease, which means both sides of the body are affected equally with swelling and stiffness. RA is treated with prescription DMARDS (Disease Modifying AntiRheumatic Drugs), JAK inhibitors, Biologic drugs (injectable medications that alter the patient’s immune system) or corticosteroids. The Dactylitis will lessen or end totally as the root condition is effectively treated, although there is no cure for RA.\nDactylitis sufferers, from both PsA and RA, can benefit from treatment with a Physical Therapist. The Physical Therapist can help the patient maintain function and movement of the small joints in the hand, fingers, feet and toes. Patients can be taught new, less painful ways of working, and doing daily activities. The Physical Therapist can also use thermal modalities to provide warming pain and swelling relief for the patient’s sore and swollen extremities.\nPatients who suffer from Dactylitis caused by inflammatory Arthritis are also encouraged to eat an anti-inflammation diet, such as the Mediterranean Diet, which constricts sugar, gluten, and alcohol, and encourages eating organic produce, lean meats in moderation, seafood and olive oil. Losing weight is also extremely helpful for those who suffer with Arthritis.\nExercise is also encouraged as a treatment for Dactylitis. Yoga, Tai Chi, water aerobics, swimming, walking or biking are all great, low impact exercises that will help to keep joints mobile and will help to reduce pain. The endorphins released by exercise also help with pain and depression.\nAlthough incurable, as inflammatory arthritis is managed and controlled, the symptom of Dactylitis should lessen or cease entirely. If it develops, it is usually a sign that a person needs medical attention right away. The sooner the underlying root condition is diagnosed and treated, the sooner the symptom of Dactylitis will go away, hopefully for good."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:d480f593-2ffb-40c5-a9fd-6bcf43ca2aa6>","<urn:uuid:d192fd01-5056-495c-b3d8-d498d75b365c>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What's cultural appropriation vs market localization?","answer":"Cultural appropriation is the process where cultures adopt customs and knowledge from other cultures and use them for their own benefit, which local cultures actively try to prevent. In contrast, market localization is a legitimate business practice where companies adapt their content, products, and marketing strategies to suit local cultural preferences and sensitivities. This includes translating content into native languages, understanding local cultural symbols (like color meanings), customizing products for local tastes (like McDonald's adapting menus), and respecting local cultural norms in advertising. The key difference is that localization involves respectful adaptation with cultural understanding, while appropriation involves taking cultural elements without proper context or permission.","context":["3 Local & Popular Cultures A culture is a group of belief systems, norms, and values practiced by a people.A group of people who share common beliefs can be recognized as a culture in one of two ways:The people call themselves a culture.Other people (including academics) can label a certain group of people as a culture.\n4 Local & Popular Cultures Folk culture is small, incorporates a homogeneous population, is typically rural, and is cohesive in cultural traits.Popular culture is large, incorporates heterogeneous populations, is typically urban, and experiences quickly changing cultural traits.Royal Wedding - London, UK.Catherine Middleton, Duchess of Cambridge, enters Westminster Abbey in a wedding gown.

The internet has changed the rules. But there is one rule that has not and will not change: for businesses to succeed in overseas territories, you need convincing translations in your marketing materials and insider knowledge of your target market.\nTechnology may help firms extend your reach, but marketing to an international audience requires an understanding of the language, culture, consumer needs and local marketing and trading laws. This article takes a look at six of the key areas you should address before targeting a foreign audience.\n1. Speak the language\nA report on global consumer buying preferences published by Common Sense Advisory, indicates that most online shoppers prefer to buy from brand that publish content in their native language. Not only that, but overseas consumers are even prepared to pay more for products.\nWe have already discussed how the importance of localising content to your audience in their language cannot be underestimated. But comprehensive marketing campaigns go further than language. Colours, fonts and images also communicate to people and have a different impact on different audiences.\nFor example, in parts of Asia and Africa, white is associated with mourning whereas red is considered as lucky. Subtle changes to the design and product descriptions can make a huge difference to the purchasing decisions of your audience.\nCompanies that hope to achieve success in overseas markets not only need a multi-lingual website, but also need to consider localising content. Use Google analytics to determine which countries are bringing in high volumes of traffic and build a foreign audience gradually.\n2. Foreign search engines\nNot every country favours Google as their search engine. Most people in China use Baidu. The Vietnamese prefer their home-built search engine Coc Coc and 4SouthAmerica.com is designed to target audiences in South America.\nWhen targeting a foreign audience, you should consider registering your website with local search engines. This also requires understanding popular search terms in order to prepare a keyword strategy.\nBecause of the technical detail involved with preparing a website for SEO, it is advisable to work with a professional translation service that has access to marketing specialists that understand your target market.\n3. Video localisation and cultural appropriation\nVideo is the future of online marketing. The majority of online users access the internet using mobile devices – and on a small screen, the easiest media to consume is video. Unfortunately, few marketing ads are universal. A message that works on home soil may not have the same impact on a foreign audience.\nWhen creating a video ad for an international audience, you should consider localising the content for a foreign audience. Also take care not to offend viewers by making a cultural faux pas.\nTo maximize the value of your videos, demonstrate local knowledge from the outset. Failing to take responsibility for the sensitive nature within a culture can prove costly. Just ask Proctor & Gamble. An ad aired in Japan of a man entering a bathroom and touching his wife whilst she was bathing flopped dramatically. The scene was considered an invasion of privacy and poor taste.\nTranslations in marketing do not only involve changing the script and localising slogans so they make sense. In some cases, it’s also beneficial to use local actors and voice-over artists that have genuine accents and share the characteristics of your target audience.\n4. Cultural branding\nA marketing report known as “Cultural Traction” measures the impact brands have on an overseas audience. Value is measured using the VIBE concept; Visionary, Inspiring, Bold, Exciting. At the moment the tech brands like Google, Apple and Samsung are killing it for obvious reasons.\nBut outside the universal language of the tech arena, other brands are making a significant impact by appealing to the sensibilities of home grown audiences. For example, Red Bull has won over consumers in South Korea by combining the country’s favourite national sport, Tae Kwan Do, with the nations thriving and influential K-pop culture.\nIkea are also performing well in emerging markets. The funky furniture makers from Sweden appeal to a worldwide audience due to their trendy designs at affordable prices. But what Ikea do well in international markets is to refresh their brand by using designs that meet cultural tastes.\nCultural branding means staying connected to your audience. Look at your brand from the outside and determine how foreign audiences will adopt your products. Again, native linguists with experience in advertising can provide you with honest feedback.\n5. Customise products for a foreign market\nA report published by University West indicates that product adaptation strategies are considered as an “influential aspect of multinational corporations. In today’s globalised market, product flexibility is a growing requirement to meet the demands of your target audience.\nThe report uses McDonald’s choice to slightly adapt its menu towards foreign audiences. But not only does the fast food chain cater for foreign tastes, executives in overseas countries look to exploit cultural gaps in the market as well.\nFor example, tea and cake is a popular sub-culture of Vietnam. A recent marketing campaign invited local guests over to the “Golden Arches” to enjoy a free piece of cake when you purchase two cups of tea. The campaign not only taps into a sub-culture, but also promotes the typical Vietnamese culture of sharing food.\n6. Understand local laws\nBefore launching a campaign in an overseas market, check the local rules on advertising. What may be permitted in your own country may be restricted in other countries. For example, Germany does not allow marketers to use competitive messaging such as “best” or “better” in promotional ads. Acquiring the services of a local translator with specialist marketing knowledge can help you avoid expensive mistakes.\nBrands thinking of entering foreign markets have much more than language barriers to cross. Understanding the climate in foreign markets before launching campaigns could prove to be critical. And language translation service providers can offer you much more than translations."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:d67507e9-d6d3-4c12-94ac-852cacb41e56>","<urn:uuid:e978c239-c8cc-4e66-8876-aa943426ca81>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the symptoms of poison ivy exposure in humans versus animals, and how does the allergic reaction typically progress?","answer":"In humans, poison ivy exposure typically causes an allergic reaction called contact dermatitis, characterized by an itchy red rash with bumps or blisters. The rash usually lasts 2-3 weeks as damaged skin is replaced by new cells, with areas of greatest exposure breaking out first and thin-skinned areas reacting more quickly than thick skin. Interestingly, only primates are allergic to poison ivy - dogs, cats, cattle, and sheep don't experience reactions to the urushiol oil. However, these animals can still carry the oil on their fur and transmit it to humans, who can develop symptoms through this indirect contact.","context":["Watch out for this plant this summer. Pictured above is an example of poison ivy, also known as Toxicodendron radicans. This is a particularly lush and thriving example, too. Just look how green it is! See those sets of three leaves? That's what you should watch out for.\nRepeat after me-- \"Leaves of three, let them be.\" or \"Leaves of three, stay away from me!\"\nThat's a good start, anway. But poison ivy can vary in appearance---sometimes it grows as a dense shrub, sometimes it can be a climbing or trailing vine.\nYou can encounter poison ivy growing almost anywhere in Illinois. It can be found in forest preserves, bike trails, vacant lots, construction sites, roadsides, campgrounds, even backyards.\nPoison ivy prefers warm and wet conditions where it flourishes in the summer. It can twine around trees or fences, becoming an impenetrable mass of foliage. In the fall, look for red leaves and white or cream-colored berries.\nPoison ivy does not discriminate. Men, women, children --almost everyone is sensitive to the oil in poison ivy. Some individuals are more sensitive than others. You may say, \"Oh, it never bothered me when I was a kid.\" Congratulations! Don't think you are immune.\nPoison ivy is a member of the genus Toxicodendron, which means poison tree. This genus also includes poison oak and poison sumac. You can read more about them here.\nAll these plants contain an oil, urushiol. Urushiol is found it all parts of the plant (leaves, stems, even berries) When this oil gets on the skin, an allergic reaction occurs in most people--an itchy red rash with bumps or blisters. The medical term for this is contact dermatitis. There are other words for it, but I will not use them here!\nUrushiol can be spread by touching or brushing against a leaf, touching clothing or an animal that has come in contact with the oil, even inhaling the smoke if the plant is burned.\nBut you don't have to wear a hazmat suit if you're hiking in the woods. Wear sensible clothing and shoes, and pay attention. For extra protection, there are barrier creams available, which can be applied like sunscreen.\nIf you are working outdoors, the CDC recommends these sensible precautions--\n- wear long sleeves, long pants, boots and gloves.\n- wash exposed clothing separately in hot water with detergent.\n- Barrier skin creams, such as a lotion containing bentoquatum, may offer some protection before contact.\n- Barrier creams should be washed off and reapplied twice a day.\n- After use, clean tools with rubbing alcohol (isopropanol or isopropyl alcohol) or soap and lots of water. Urushiol can remain active on the surface of objects for up to 5 years.\n- Wear disposable gloves during this process.\n- Do not burn plants that may be poison ivy, poison oak, or poison sumac.\n- Inhaling smoke from burning plants can cause severe allergic respiratory problems.\nDO NOT BURN POISON IVY!\nIf you do come in contact with poison ivy--As soon as possible, wash all affected areas with rubbing alcohol, then soap and water. Wash all clothing separately in detergent. Wash anything that may have come in contact with the plants.\nYes, that means pets, too. Although dogs and cats don't seem to be bothered by it, you can pick up the oil just by touching their fur. Use pet shampoo and wear rubber gloves when giving them a bath.\nIf you do get a rash, there are over-the-counter remedies available for milder cases. Antihistamines and calamine lotion can help stop the itch and the urge to scratch. Oatmeal soaks, baking soda and yogurt can also be helpful.\nFor more severe cases, please seek medical attention. There are prescription drugs that can help minimize the duration and spread of the rash.\nWhat else can you do?

Dad fires up the grill, mom finds her green thumb, your kids fetch their ball in the weeds…and the whole family comes down with an itchy rash. That’s right, the poison plants are back. And this summer they promise to send 40 million Americans to the doctor.\nThe three most common culprits—poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac—are native to America and caught European explorers by surprise. Captain John Smith wrote, “The poisoned weed is much in shape like our English ivy, but being touched, causeth redness, itching, and lastly, blisters.”\nPocahontas could have warned him. After all, Indian warriors coated arrow tips with poison ivy, and medicine men rubbed its leaves on infections in an effort to break open swollen skin. Physicians in the Colonies learned something new and expanded the plant’s use to the treatment of herpes, eczema, arthritis, warts, ringworm, and rattlesnake bites.\nToday we know the rash is an irritating allergic dermatitis. Upon exposure, the immune system revs up, attacking the plant oil and damaging your skin. The few who don’t react should still watch out. Sensitization can occur anytime, making a fool out of cousin Eddie when he rubs the leaves up and down his arm just to prove he “ain’t allergic.”\nThe offending substance in the oil is urushiol (oo-ROO-shee-awl), a yellowish chemical inside the leaves, stems, and roots of the plant. Because the oil is inside, undisturbed leaves won’t harm you. However, if the plants become dry, insect-chewed, or otherwise damaged, the oil leaks to the surface where it comes into contact with humans and other animals.\nAs it turns out, only primates are allergic. Dogs, cats, cattle, and sheep don’t break out, but they can pass the oil to their human keepers. Clothing and tools also spread the oil, and since urushiol remains allergenic for years, unsuspecting spring gardeners can get the rash from last season’s gloves and shovels.\nIf you come into contact with poison ivy, you should wash well with plenty of soap and water. Unfortunately, this won’t always prevent the rash because the oil bonds fast to human skin and is nearly impossible to remove within 30 minutes of exposure. This also means you won’t spread the rash by touching affected skin. Poison ivy does have the illusion of spreading, but this is because areas with the greatest exposure break out first, and because thinly-skinned body parts react more quickly than thick skin.\nOnce you have the rash, it typically lasts 2 to 3 weeks as the damaged skin is replaced by new cells. All you can do is treat the symptoms and prevent infection. For mild cases, over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream and oral antihistamines—like Benadryl—work well to control inflammation and itching. Topical antibiotic ointment may prevent bacterial infection when the skin is broken open from repeated scratching.\nIf you have widespread rash, face or genital involvement, or signs of infected skin, it’s time to see your doctor. In these cases, prescription steroids or antibiotics might be necessary.\nPrevention by avoidance is best. All three poison plants have compound leaves, most commonly with three leaflets. My Grandma Bert used to say, “Leaves of three, let them be!” and she was right.\nThe leaves are smooth and glossy, colored with a summer green that transitions to autumn shades of orange and scarlet. Poison ivy is a stout weedy vine that climbs trees east of the Rocky Mountains. Poison oak is larger, more shrub-like, and found west of the Rockies. Poison sumac grows in swampy areas of the Southeastern United States where it can reach heights of twenty feet.\nIvyBlock, and other medications containing the chemical bentoquatam (BEN-toe-kwa-tam), prevents the rash by providing a barrier on the surface of exposed skin. It is available over-the-counter and approved for ages 6 and up. It should be applied at least 15 minutes prior to expected exposure and reapplied every 4 hours to remain effective.\nSo get out there and enjoy your summer. Fire up the grill. Tend the garden. Play ball. But don’t forget my grandmother’s advice. Otherwise, you might end up in the waiting room, scratching your itchy skin with those other 40 million Americans."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:54e783fe-1923-48dd-bf19-ef3f139e4b0e>","<urn:uuid:8fd694bd-a2f3-4cc7-9bf1-6bf31108d1cd>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Compare the legitimacy challenges faced by Iraq's Hashemite monarchy under British control versus the 1963 Ba'athist government under U.S. influence.","answer":"The Hashemite monarchy suffered from persistent legitimacy issues as they were seen as foreign rulers and British puppets, facing constant tribal unrest and political dissatisfaction that ultimately led to their overthrow in 1958. The 1963 Ba'athist government, while receiving U.S. support including CIA assistance in purging communists, maintained more independence from their Western backers and could act contrary to U.S. interests. However, both governments proved unstable - the Hashemites fell in 1958 after decades of rule, while the Ba'athist regime was overthrown after only nine months in power despite U.S. backing.","context":["View the H-Diplo Discussion Logs by month\nView the Prior Message in H-Diplo's May 2014 logs by: [date] [author] [thread]\nView the Next Message in H-Diplo's May 2014 logs by: [date] [author] [thread]\nVisit the H-Diplo home page.\n-------------- H-Diplo Article Reviews http://www.h-net.org/~diplo/reviews/ No. 455 Published on 30 April 2014 -------------- H-Diplo Article Review Editors: Thomas Maddux and Diane Labrosse Web and Production Editor: George Fujii Commissioned for H-Diplo by Thomas Maddux -------------- Eric Jacobsen. \"A Coincidence of Interests: Kennedy, U.S. Assistance, and the 1963 Iraqi Ba'th Regime.\" Diplomatic History 37:5 (November 2013): 1029-1059. DOI: 10.1093/dh/dht049. http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/dh/dht049 URL: http://www.h-net.org/~diplo/reviews/PDF/AR455.pdf -------------- Reviewed by Brandon Wolfe-Hunnicutt, University of California, Merced It is interesting to note, as Nathan Citino does, that despite the fact that Iraq has been the site of America's longest and most sustained military commitments since the Vietnam War, there does not yet exist a single archival-based monograph detailing the origins of the U.S.-Iraqi relationship.1 The consequences of this can be seen in Peter L. Hahn's recent book, Missions Accomplished?2 Whereas Hahn claims that \"Declassified U.S. government documents offer no evidence to support\" suggestions that the Baath Party of Iraq \"maintained contacts with American officials\"3 in the period leading up to its 1963 coup d'état, a recent article from Eric Jacobsen does a great deal to correct the record on this matter. Jacobsen draws on these same declassified documents, in addition to invaluable oral history interviews with former policymakers, to show that American officials were indeed in close contact with Iraqi Baathists before, during, and after their 1963 putsch.4 As Jacobsen explains, the U.S. supported the Baath as an alternative to the government of General Abdel Karim Qasim. General Qasim had come to power in 1958 through a bloody coup that toppled Iraq's Western-backed Hashemite monarchy. Once in power Qasim initiated a series of policies that threatened U.S. interests in a number of ways: \"He sought Soviet assistance, built a political coalition that include the Iraqi Communist Party (ICP), reduced trade with Western nations, moved Iraq away from a capitalist economic model and toward a state-centered economy, and routinely challenged the neocolonial power of the Iraq Petroleum Company (IPC), a consortium of mostly American and British oil companies partially owned by the British government\" (1029). Though President John F. Kennedy remained aloof from policymaking toward Iraq (1037), Jacobsen shows that Kennedy's State Department, Central Intelligence Agency, and National Security Council kept a close eye on developments in the country and were eager to seize any opportunity to replace the government of General Qasim. As Jacobsen explains, that opportunity arose in mid-January 1963: \"the Baghdad Embassy reported that Soviet influence had grown, that Iraq was almost completely dependent on the Soviet Bloc, and that Iraqi Communists held key positions within the media and army. To end these threats to U.S. interests, Kennedy again opted to work with local actors - in this case the Iraqi Ba'th Party - to plan Qasim's demise\" (1040). Jacobsen details the close relations between the Kennedy administration and the emergent Baathist regime in Iraq. In the days following the February 8 coup, the CIA assisted the Baath as it carried out a systematic purge of Iraqi communists (1041, 1045). At the same time, the State Department provided economic assistance - principally PL 480 wheat shipments, and encouragement to U.S. firms to invest in Iraq (1054) - in exchange for a liberalization of Iraq's trade and economic policies (1044). On the military side, the Kennedy administration ramped up U.S. arms deliveries as part of a broader effort to cultivate American influence and establish lasting bonds of debt dependence (1049-54). In theory, this package of U.S. assistance could have served to integrate Iraq into a regional security structure and safeguarded Western access to Iraqi oil.5 This is indeed what Kennedy administration officials anticipated. But as Jacobsen shows, the Kennedy administration got very little for its efforts. The Baath did indeed adopt a series of measures that won U.S. approval (largely in the sphere of economic liberalization), but these actions were not taken because of U.S. influence (1058). On the contrary, it was \"merely a coincidence of interests\" (1058) that compelled the Baath to take such steps. In Jacobsen's view, the Baath \"would have likely taken similar actions without U.S. assistance\" (1031) as part of its effort to attract foreign capital and accelerate Iraqi economic growth. Moreover, \"when Iraqi interests ran contrary to those of the United States, the Ba'th regime chose to look out for itself\" (1058). The Baath demonstrated its resistance to U.S. power by, for example, continuing to purchasing Soviet and British military equipment rather entering into an exclusive relationship with U.S. suppliers, and by pushing back against U.S. loan repayment demands (1058). Ultimately, what the U.S. did or didn't get for its investment in the Baath became moot, as the Baath itself was overthrown in a military coup after only nine months in power. In the end, the Kennedy administration's enthusiasm for what it regarded as the great \"white hope of the Arab world\" came to naught (1041). This does not, however, mean that the Baath's brief tenure in power was without consequence for subsequent U.S.-Iraqi relations. On the contrary, in laying bare the Kennedy administration's support for the Baath in the early 1960s, Jacobsen has elucidated one of the reasons that more recent U.S. claims to support democracy and human rights in Iraq have been greeted with so much skepticism. As recent history has shown, the 'blowback' from cold-war era intelligence operations can have a very long half-life. As admirable as Jacobsen's article is, there are areas of the essay that could be further developed. I would have liked to see more an analysis of the policymaking process (as opposed to a more limited description of specific policy outcomes). Analyzing disagreements among policymakers can help to illuminate the ideological and institutional context out of which policy emerges and help us to understand the range of policy options available to policymakers. Not only would such an analysis allow us to better evaluate the wisdom and efficacy of supporting the Baath's rise to power, but it is likely that more attention to this dimension of U.S.-Iraqi diplomacy would draw attention to the ideology of American intervention and the role of modernization theory in shaping American perceptions of Iraq and Iraqis. Moreover, analyzing modernization as a discourse and ideology could in turn illuminate the general dynamics of American foreign policy in the early 1960s, and help explicate why the history of U.S.-Iraqi relations has been so fraught with violence. Limitations aside, Jacobsen's article represents a very important starting point in acknowledging this history and apprehending with its implications.

For more on this distinction, see Timothy Mitchell, Carbon Democracy: Political Power in the Age of Oil (London: Verso, 2011), esp. chapter 6. --","Iraq was an important outpost of the Ottoman empire. It was not known as Iraq at this time, it was the collection of three vilayets of the empire: Basra, Baghdad and Mosul, sometimes referred to by the British as Mesopotamia. It was physically close to the centre of the Ottoman empire and so at times it was closely linked to the fate and direction of the this empire. However, poor communications and infrastructure meant that at other times its policies could be quite remote, detached and autonomous from that of its overlords. Iraq's first contact with the British was through the English East India company. Iraq lay on one of the communications routes between India and Britain and so naturally acquired an interest for the company. Iraq also had a sizeable population and economy; large enough to support commercial enterprises in the region. It was for these reasons that the English East India company set up a factory in the port of Basra in 1763. The factory was not entirely a success as political events saw the Persians temporarily take Basra. In addition, Kuwait offered its deep water port as a viable commercial alternative with access to the Ottoman empire but lying outside of it. This meant that the English East India Company did not have to worry so much about the state of Britain's political relations with the Ottoman empire but could still take advantage of the trade in this part of the world.\nThe Mamluk rulers of Iraq did not have much love for their Ottoman overlords and so tried to cultivate increased economic and political links with the British. In 1798, they allowed a British agent to be appointed to the court in Baghdad and this was closely followed by the opening of a British Consulate there in 1802. This helped to stimulate British trade and commercial activity in the area, particularly with regards to textiles, but also with the new technologies of the nineteenth century: Steamships and the telegraph were just two of the state of the art technologies provided by the British. The Mamluks were overthrown in 1831 and direct control from Constantinople was reestablished, but commercial and economic links to the British and Europoean powers had become so well established that they were maintained by most of the subsequent governors of the province.\nEuropean influences were also felt at a deeper level as reforms were instituted by various rulers of Iraq. Land, administrative and legal reforms all helped the economy to develop along more Western lines as they turned the older tribal leaders and sheikhs into land holders and profit seekers. The flip side to this development was the way in which traditional craftsman were left exposed to the mass production techniques of British and European companies.\nFor most of the nineteenth century Britain was content to take commercial advantage of this part of the Ottoman Empire with no administrative costs or worries. However, by the turn of the twentieth century the Ottomans had decided to diversify their economic allegiances with the European powers and had left the British traders and companies in a dangerously precarious position. One manifestation of this policy was a series of high profile projects conducted in collaboration with the Germans. The most famous of which was the Berlin to Baghdad railway built in 1899. Stronger economic links almost inevitably led to stronger political ties as the Young Turk revolution of 1908 openly looked towards the Germans to provide a model for Ottoman political and economic development.\nThe strategic value of this part of the world was also increased by the discovery of oil in the south of Russia. European governments and companies were falling over themselves to gain concessions and political leverage in this part of the world. The stakes were further raised by the British themselves as the Royal Navy declared that it was abondoning coal powered ships in favour of oil powered ones. Oil was becoming a vital commodity.\nTaken together, by the outbreak of the first world war the British were already extremely anxious about the strategic fate of this part of the world, especially as it still lay on one of the key communications axes with India. When war did break out, the British were swift to conduct a campaign to defend these vital interests.\nEstablishment of Formal Relations\nWhen the Ottomans formally declared themselves allied to the Germans, the British planned a campaign against the Ottomans starting in Basra. They landed troops in Basra in 1914 and advanced up the rivers towards Baghdad. Initially, conscript Arab regiments gave little resistance and General Townshend advanced as far as Ctesiphon just outside of Baghdad. However, the Ottomans reinforced themselves with regular army units and soon had the tired and diseased British forces besieged in Kut. The British capitulated some 160 days later.\nThe following year the British tried again with a new campaign much more thoroughly planned and organised. In 1917, they successfully reached Baghdad and by the end of the war they had managed to advance as far as Mosul, this meant that they had control of the three Ottoman Vilayets which would form the basis of Iraq.\nImperial politics in this part of the world had become a complicated affair as the British and French had made and broken promises with all sorts of leaders, tribes and communities fighting the Ottomans. At first, it was thought that many Arabs would support the British as they had done whilst fighting the Ottomans during the war. However, it soon became clear that these Arab nationalists were not keen to replace one imperial overlord for another. 1919 confirmed the extent of the political chicanery and intrigue the British and French had entered into when they were declared by the League of Nations to be the countries responsible for administering vast tracts of what was previously the Ottoman Empire. Few Arabs were convinced that this was anything other than imperialism by another name. The murder of a British officer in 1919 gave the first indication of this political dissatisfaction. This murder was dealt with by arrests and police action against a number of political groups. This in turn led many Arabs into a series of street demonstrations and strikes that soon descended into an outright rebellion. The British lost control of much of the countryside for nearly three months and only reconstituted order through extensive use of air and land units.\nThis experience illustrated to the British that they needed to institute a more legitimate form of government if they were not to be involved in continuous guerilla campaigns and police actions. It was thought that the Hashemite ruler Faysal might provide sufficient legitimacy to allow the British to maintain some form of control over Iraq. He was descended from the Prophet Muhammed, which gave him impeccable Islamic credentials and he had fought the Ottomans which confirmed his Nationalist ones. On the downside, he was not from anywhere near Iraq. The British thought that this might actually be a useful handicap, as it meant that his legitimacy was not too strong that he might feel confident enough to desert the British. It was all a very finely based calculation that was discussed in detail at the Cairo conference of 1922. At this conference it was decided that a plebiscite would be held in Iraq to confirm whether the Iraqis wanted this leader imposed or not. The carefully conducted campaign endorsed King Faysal with 96 percent of the vote.\nThe British were quick to ensure their control over their new vassal by insisting on a comprehensive treaty and alliance with Britain and a constitution for the country along a British style constitutional monarchy and parliament. The treaty insisted upon commercial freedom, religious tolerance, and that all foreign, military, judicial and financial matters were to be taken by British advisers. The Iraqis would also pay half of the bills incurred by the British in Iraq. The treaty was a very one sided agreement.\nThe Hashemite monarchy was very much a British puppet, but even the King balked at the amount of power reserved by the British. It soon became a domestic political imperative for the King to regain some of the powers from the British. Protocols and treaties were negotiated and added in 1923, 1924, 1926 and 1927. However, these did not fully mollify many of the nationalists and tribal leaders who continued to agitate for independence. In 1929, the British finally decided to yield and started a series of negotiations that would leave them with control of foreign policy and 'common interests' and some air basesbut to hand most domestic matters to the Hashemite rulers. This treaty was agreed in 1930 and came into effect in 1932 when Iraq was allowed to enter the League of Nations as an independent nation.\nAlthough technically independent, the Hashemite rulers were as dependent on British expertise and advice as they ever had been. With British advisers, their children schooled in England, British governors and nannies, the Hashemites remained as puppet leaders who were only allowed to control events in Iraq as long as those events did not encroach on British political or commercial interests. The amount of dependence on the British was emphasised by events in 1941, when Iraqi parliamentary leaders refused to back Britain in its war against the Germans. The British landed a force in Iraq and overthrew the elected government and replaced it with a pro-British government and one that was required to declare war on Germany. At the end of the war, the British retreated from direct control again, but still maintained considerable indirect leverage, and this remained the case right up until the Hashemites were finally overthrown in 1958.\nRole within the Empire\nBritains primary concerns for the control of Iraq were to maintain communications with India and to maintain the flow of oil in the region. As naval power was superceded by aerial power, the importance of Iraq actually increased rather than decreased. Air bases were now required to link Britain to her most important imperial possession; India. It was for this reason that the British so assidiously tried to maintain complete control over the air bases when negotiating for the technical independence of Iraq. There was also an elaborate scheme to have an airship base in Iraq as a staging post linking London to Delhi. This strategic importance was only eclipsed in 1947 when India was granted independence. By this time, the value of oil had increased in importance and so Iraq remained a vital strategic concern until the coup of 1958.\nEconomics of Empire\nBritain invested a considerable amount of money and expertise in extracting oil from the region. However, its dominant political position also meant that it had extracted highly favourable commercial concessions for these activities. The Turkish (later Iraqi) Petroleum Company earned a great deal of money for the British owned Anglo-Persian Oil Company and also, after a series of protracted renegotiations, for the Iraqi government. A great deal of this money was spent on the armed forces, but some was also spent on public works projects such as irrigation schemes and infrastructural development. However, the amount of money flowing out of the country would be a constant source of embarrassment for the Iraqi leaders and a galvanising slogan for the nationalists.\nWithdrawal from Empire\nBritain's withdrawal from Iraq was a swift one. It came with the overthrow of the Hashemite regime that Britain had so assidiously cultivated over the years. The Hashemites had never fully gained legitimacy as rulers in the eyes of the Iraqis. They were regarded as little more than foreign rulers who followed every beck and call of their British masters. Constant tribal bickerings and uprisings weakened the government in outlying areas of Iraq, whereas in the main cities, political dissatisfaction was expressed in the ballot boxes and the free press that Britain had expressly created for the country. Political instability was a concern for the entire period of Hashemite rule, they regularly had to call upon the police and the military to maintain order in the country. The British and the Hashemites were so fully dependent upon one another that they both became even more alienated and distant from the Iraqi people; hatred for one institution translating into hatred for the other. The creation of Israel further inflamed passions and brought the British into even further disrepute. And events in Suez in 1956 also galvanised Arab opinion against the British and dented Britain's prestige and ability to defend its interests at the same time as it increased Arab self-confidence and self-importance. The British were in no position to help their puppet regime when the Hashemite King made his final call for help to protect him from the people that he purported to lead. Their all-embracing dependence upon one another meant that with the fall of the Hashemites, British power and influence dissappeared abruptly."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:36a2c64f-af3b-4450-949c-72792a312048>","<urn:uuid:ab0f16b1-18c9-4bcc-8b59-1f8f7aab6c73>"],"error":null}

But if you have not taken the time to observe how your child learns best, your child might be struggling in school unnecessarily. Identifying prominent learning styles in children is crucial in helping them identify their strengths and overcome their weaknesses as they progress into a more diverse spectrum of courses grade after grade. We often needlessly separate creativity from learning. But when parents help children understand their dominant learning styles, parent and child can both use this knowledge to improve the child’s experiences, not only in school, but also in life.\nMost people use a combination of learning styles. Do you know yours? Generally speaking, there are six types of learning styles you want to explore: visual, auditory, verbal, kinesthetic, tactile and logical. Knowing my own learning styles helps me become a better lifelong learner and a better learning coach for my child.\nYou might think your children will possess the same proclivities as you. But even though there may be some overlap, each person’s learning style is uniquely their own. For example, my daughter seems more visual than me and more auditory, is likely equally kinesthetic, but maybe not quite as verbal. Logic and tactile probably fall lower on both our lists, whereas her dad, my husband, likely dominates these last two learning categories in our home, as well as being highly visual and auditory.\nYou don’t have to go get tested to find out what kind of learners are living in your house. You simply have to be willing to reflect on what makes each of you tick. Where do you see a family member leaning in, and where do you see a family member leaning out? This is usually enough information to help you experiment with learning styles and see how they benefit each member of the family.\nUnder each category, I’ve listed approaches for test-driving each type of learning style.

Instead, they provide you with a list of SNPs. A SNP (usually pronounced “snip”), which stands for “single nucleotide polymorphism,” is a single location in your DNA which has been shown to be different for different people.\nFor example, at a certain place on chromosome number 16, there is a gene called ABCC11. The proteins encoded by this gene do various things, but scientists discovered that a single nucleotide in this gene dictates whether or not your earwax is wet or dry.\nThis location (given the handy name of \"rs17822931\") usually contains either the nucleotide Cytosine (C) or Thymine (T). Now, remember that you have two copies of chromosome 16 - one from mom, and one from dad. If both copies contain Thymine at that location, you get dry earwax. If you have a Cytosine at that location in either copy of chromosome 16, then you belong to the wet earwax club.\nNow you might be wondering, how on earth did scientists figure that out? Well one way scientists try to associate different SNPs with what they cause is through a technique called a Genome Wide Association Study, or GWAS.\nIn these types of studies, scientists get a big group of individuals and divide them into two groups.: those that have the condition they’re looking for, and those that don’t. Then they look at as many SNPs as they can in each person and try to identify patterns.\nSo if everyone in the dry earwax group has a certain nucleotide at a certain location (scientists say that these people have the same allele,) then scientists can say that the SNP is associated with the condition they are studying.\nNote that all we can do with a GWAS is associate a SNP with a condition. We can’t say that having the SNP causes the condition, or even that having the SNP makes you more likely to have a condition.\nOne more topic I want to mention briefly today is something called a \"haplotype.\" A Haplotype is a group of SNPs that tend to always stick together, down through the generations. For example, the dry earwax SNP I mentioned earlier belongs to a haplotype that is common in people of Asian ancestry, particularly Chinese and Korean ancestry.\nSo now you know more about DNA, SNPs, GWAS, and Haplotypes. Next week, we’ll take a look at what all of this has to do with personal genetic testing.\nIf you have a question that you’d like to see on a future episode, send me an email at firstname.lastname@example.org.

The FDA regulates the inks in tattoos, however the actual practice of tattooing is controlled by regional jurisdictions, such as cities and counties. That implies there is no standardized certification for those doing the tattooing or an overall governing body monitoring the health and wellness of tattoo parlors.\nHow Safe Is Your Tattoo Ink?\nBefore you get that dolphin tattooed on your ankle or “Mom” on your bicep, be alerted: The ink utilized in tattoos may be harmful– even years later. A new report has raised questions about the security of tattoo inks used in Europe, most of which are imported from the United States. The inks have been discovered to consist of dangerous chemicals, consisting of carcinogens. The report, from the European Commission’s Joint Research study Centre, also determined heavy metals such as arsenic, lead, and nickel, preservatives, organic substances, bacteria, and other possibly harmful substances in the inks. It requires an extensive review of tattoo inks in use throughout the European Union, and it highlights the need for strict policy of the inks, which are likewise utilized for permanent makeup. After the report was released, the organization asked the European Chemicals Firm (ECHA) to look even more into tattoo ink safety.\nIf you have actually ever craved ink– to use a permanent mark of love or fond memories or Dave Matthews Band lyrics– we’ve set you up with a guide to make sure it occurs healthfully.\nGetting Tattooed? Your Overview of Tattoo Safety in Parnell, Missouri 64475\nFirst, determine if this is actually something you want to do. “You ought to feel so highly about [a tattoo] that you’re restless without it,” states Scott Campbell, a Brooklyn-based tattoo artist who’s inked folks like Penelope Cruz, Josh Hartnett, and Orlando Flower. “If you have to decide of ‘ought to I, or shouldn’t I’– you should not.”.\nFeel in your heart and unsullied skin that you require a tattoo? Then don’t go to simply any tattoo artist. If you see somebody with a tattoo you like, ask which artist gave it to her, Campbell states. Or search online for nearby tattoo studios and dig deep into the artists’ portfolios.\nShould I be concerned about hazardous practices, or the tattoo ink itself?\nBoth. While you can buckle down infections from unhygienic practices and equipment that isn’t sterile, infections can likewise arise from ink that was infected with germs or mold. Utilizing non-sterile water to water down the pigments (ingredients that include color) is a common offender, although not the only one.\nThere’s no foolproof way to inform if the ink is safe. An ink can be infected even if the container is sealed or the label says the item is sterile.\nExactly what is in tattoo ink?\nPublished research study has reported that some inks contain pigments utilized in printer toner or in cars and truck paint. FDA has not approved any pigments for injection into the skin for cosmetic functions.\nFDA examines reports of negative reactions or infections from consumers and healthcare providers. We may learn about break outs from the state authorities who oversee tattoo parlors.\nThe health threats in 64475.\nBut as tattooing has actually spread, so have the involved health dangers– skin infections, allergic reactions, and blood-borne illness. Recently in Rochester, N.Y., 19 customers of a tattoo parlor were contaminated with the organism Mycobacterium chelonae, which triggers a rash and bumps on the skin; left unattended, the germs can spread to the lungs. The tattooing was performed using premixed gray ink, made in Arizona, that had actually been contaminated prior to circulation, according to a New England Journal of Medication report. And break outs of MRSA (Methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus) skin infections from commercially obtained tattoos have actually also been reported.\nState and local authorities oversee tattoo practices, which vary substantially across the nation. There is no basic regulation for training or licensing, and practically no requirements for assessment, record-keeping, or notified approval. Although the majority of states have laws restricting minors from getting tattoos, numerous teenagers however find them easy to obtain.\nAnd almost anyone can put up a tattoo shingle. For example, in New york city City, where tattoo parlors are not certified, a tattooist can get a specialist’s license after merely paying some charges and passing a three-hour infection control course.\nWhenever you’re injecting a substance into your skin, there’s a risk of infection. Some risks include hepatitis, staph, or warts. Utilizing unsterilized tools such as needles, weapons or ink can result in infection, so you’ll want to make sure that your tattoo artist is following safety rules (see listed below) to keep you healthy and infection totally free. This risk of infection is why the American Association of Blood Banks requires a 1 year wait to provide blood after you get your tattoo. The first week after is the most crucial time to take all the preventative measures recommended to guard against infection."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:00c9d6f5-2fcc-4b92-9dc0-7ffb583d81d4>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What legally required topics are covered in Asbestos Awareness training, and when is health surveillance mandatory for workers?","answer":"Asbestos Awareness training covers proper identification of asbestos properties, types of asbestos, health risks, assessment procedures, emergency protocols, and OHS legislation compliance. Health surveillance becomes mandatory when workers are involved in activities such as removal or handling of friable asbestos materials, handling asbestos using unsafe practices, or when asbestos exposure is at or above the exposure standard of 0.1 fibres/mL over an 8-hour time weighted average.","context":["Completing an Asbestos Awareness Course\nWhat is Asbestos Awareness Course?\nEmployers and all staff working with asbestos ought to consider an asbestos awareness course as an important concept that must adhered to. Some job occupations may require smaller degree of training, but those that highly involves asbestos, require a more extensive and detailed training.\nAsbestos awareness course is a legal requisite of the OHS law among those with job responsibilities with asbestos-related job occupations and employed in buildings or sites built before 2000 where high presence of asbestos is more likely.\nAsbestos Awareness course will inform managers, employers and employees of the health and safety hazards and risks that are more likely to develop in workplaces considered great sources of asbestos, and the proper procedures to take when this naturally occurring mineral is accidentally discovered. Training is mandatory for those with duties that involve asbestos and those who were affected because of disturbing a building’s fabric. The “Duty Holder”, the one mainly responsible for construction project, is also a recipient of the valuable benefits of the training. This is because, awareness of the maintenance, alterations and repairs regularly performed in the workplace are also taught in asbestos awareness course.\nWhat are the topics involved?\nA wide range of topics and information are discussed during the course, thus, after completion, trainees are expected to be aware of the following:\n- Proper identification of asbestos and its properties. Possible risks and effects to health, especially with smokers.\n- Description of the various types of asbestos and determine where ACMs are more likely present in buildings and plants.\n- The reasons for the use of asbestos insulation, asbestos cement, insulating boards and ACMs.\n- Health hazards and risks whenever ACMs release fibre.\n- Gaining awareness of the proper assessment used to determine presence of asbestos before starting with work\n- Competency regarding emergency procedures to follow when accidentally contacting ACMs\n- OHS legislations specifically implemented for asbestos to meet 4th and 5th regulations of Control of Asbestos Regulations (CAR)\nWho should complete the training?\nAsbestos awareness course is directed towards employees, staff and the management team with duties and plan activities that are to be executed in buildings, construction sites or any other premises. High-quality training provides asbestos awareness among trainees, offering them great information, including some effective measures that will meet their health, safety and environment responsibilities.\n- According to the OHS laws of Australia, specific asbestos awareness course is to be complied by:\n- Those inclined with a higher risk of disturbing asbestos while working\n- Executes planned, yet non-licensed asbestos activities\n- Are present in premises or venues that involves the use of asbestos\n- Employed as a staff who needs to perform licensed work\nWhere can I obtain Asbestos Awareness course?\nHealth, safety and environment professionals who are highly experienced in delivering quality training are hired by various reputable training providers all across Australia, to conduct high-quality Asbestos Awareness Course. This training course can be completed through face-to-face or in person training. For those who need a flexible time and schedule, online training is probably their best option. Trainees for online Asbestos Awareness Course are privileged to complete the whole couse according to their preferred pace. Recording of the progress allow trainees to take beaks in between and return later.\nSeveral training providers deliver high-quality training for asbestos awareness in different states and territories of Australia. Since each is governed by their own judicial authorities, each has their own part governed by their own particular authority, thus, differ in RSG requirements. It is important for trainees to determine the RSG requirements for their state or in any state they intend to work in.\nHow long will it take to complete asbestos awareness course?\nAs with most online participants, completing the whole course took only 2 – 3 hours (in just one session). Indeed, a cost and time-effective option for your asbestos awareness course\nAs soon as the asbestos awareness course is completed, the trainee shall receive a certificate of competency. Presentation of such document is a great illustration of an employer complying with the requirements under Work Health and Safety and an approach to due diligence. An approved asbestos awareness certificate is immediately available for printing as soon as online training is completed.\nIf you would like more information on asbestos and how to identify it – checkout our article on our blog – How to Identify Asbestos","Asbestos: Health surveillance - Guide for employers\nInhalation of respirable asbestos fibres may cause diseases such as asbestosis, lung cancer and mesothelioma. Risk factors include the dose (number of fibres inhaled), lifetime exposure, fibre type, smoking status and genetics. If the health of a person is at risk as a result of exposure to asbestos at work, the employer must ensure that health surveillance is carried out in accordance with the Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) Regulations 1996.\nWhat is health surveillance?\nHealth surveillance is monitoring a person to identify changes in their health resulting from exposure to a hazardous substance.\nWhy should health surveillance be conducted?\nHealth surveillance may detect harm to health at an earlier stage, allowing controls to be improved to protect workers’ health or earlier medical treatment.\nWhat regulations apply to health surveillance?\nIf the health of a person is at risk as a result of exposure to asbestos at work, the employer must ensure that health surveillance is carried out in accordance with the Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) Regulations 1996. Regulation 5.1 defines ‘health surveillance’ and regulation 5.23 requires an employer, main contractor or self-employed person to provide health surveillance to a worker in relation to hazardous substances.\nWhat activities may present a health risk?\nActivities that may present a health risk due to asbestos exposure, and where health surveillance should be carried out, include:\n- Removal or handling of friable asbestos materials (‘friable’ means the asbestos containing material is in a powder form, or can be crumbled by hand pressure);\n- Handling asbestos using unsafe practices (eg cutting with power tools - note that this is not permitted under OSH legislation); or\n- Activities where asbestos exposure is at or above the asbestos exposure standard (8 hour time weighted average of 0.1 fibres/mL)\nPlease note that excessive exposure to asbestos must be reported to WorkSafe (OSH Regulation 5.40) and exposed people must be informed (OSH Regulation 5.41).\nAll air has a very low background level of asbestos. Low risk activities such as working in asbestos cement buildings, or maintaining such buildings using safe work methods, do not require health surveillance.\nWho can provide health surveillance?\nHealth surveillance must be conducted by an Appointed Medical Practitioner (AMP), a doctor with adequate training and experience in relation to asbestos and who has been appointed by the employer after consultation with the worker/s. WorkSafe has a list of doctors who conduct health surveillance work, although not all such doctors are listed.\nIf the doctor you choose has not conducted health surveillance for asbestos previously, it is essential for them to contact WorkSafe’s occupational physician on 1300 307 877 to ensure they are aware of their duties under OSH legislation.\nShould there be any indications of adverse health effects from asbestos exposure, the AMP can refer the person to a respiratory physician for an assessment.\nHow often should health surveillance for asbestos be conducted?\nFollowing the baseline assessment, the frequency of health surveillance is based on medical advice and depends on the individual’s risk profile.\nWhat further information is available?\nAsbestos health surveillance reporting form (for the AMP to report results to WorkSafe):\nSafe Work Australia guidance on health surveillance (also called “health monitoring”):\n- Health Monitoring for Exposure to Hazardous Chemicals - Guide for persons conducting a business or undertaking\n- Health Monitoring for Exposure to Hazardous Chemicals - Guide for workers\n- Health Monitoring for Exposure to Hazardous Chemicals - Guide for medical practitioners\n- Hazardous Chemicals Requiring Health Monitoring\nWorkSafe guidance on asbestos safety:\n- National code of practice for the management and control of asbestos in workplaces [NOHSC:2018 (2005)]\n- National code of practice for the safe removal of asbestos 2nd edition [NOHSC:2002(2005)]\n- Asbestos in the workplace\nShare this page:"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:b495c3f0-05a2-404c-a86b-5d1ca48983fb>","<urn:uuid:ab46da40-6d62-4978-b0b1-405f041d3134>"],"error":null}
