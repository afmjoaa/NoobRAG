{"question":"How were Juwangsan's unique rocks formed?","answer":"The rocks in Juwangsan were formed by volcanic activity about 70 million years ago during the Cretaceous period. They were made from lava flows that hardened very fast without forming holes, unlike the rocks found in Jeju Island. These rocks were vulnerable to erosion, which created vertical cliffs, stairs topography, and other formations.","context":["Juwang-san or \"the Mountains of the King of Ju\" is a National Park in North Gyeongsang\nProvince, located between Andong City and the East Coast. It is a key section of the\nTaebaek-sanmaek [Grand White Mountain Range] as it runs south of Taebaek-san down to\nGyeongju. It is famous for its astoundingly beautiful scenery, and sacred because of the\nlegend of the Chinese rebel \"King of Ju\" and his daughter who hid and died here. These\nmountains contain a dozen interesting temples, half-a-dozen great waterfalls and more\nsteep pine-decorated granite cliffs than a rock climber could dream of...\nJuwangsan is the mountain composed of valleys with curious stones. Juwangsan National park is relatively low and small but it creates a\nbeautiful landscape. Having lots of legends, scenic figures and curious rocks, it attracts many visitors every year. It is called Sogeumgang, the\nmost beautiful place in Gyeongsangbuk-do area, and one of the three great mountains in Korea, having many fantastic rocky cliffs and\nThe mountain was designated as the 12th National Park on March 30, 1976 in Korea, neighboring Choengsong-gun and Yeongdeok-gun in\nGyeongsangbuk-do and covering 107.425km2 of the area. Centering around Juwangsan, Taehaeng-san(933m), Daedunsan(905m),\nMyeong-dongjae(875m), and Wanggeoam (907m) are spreading like a folding screen.\nWhen people think Juwangsan Naitonal Park, they make a mistake to think about only Juwangsan but Juwangsan only covers less than a tenth\nof entire district. Juwangsan leads to Taehaengsan, Daedunsan, Daegwallyeong, Useoll-yeong, and Mujangsan in the north, and it is only a\npeak situated in big ridges.\nHowever, Juwangsan is still beautiful and there are Gamebong, Wanggeoam and Geumeungwangi which are around 800m high peaks near\nJuwangsan shaped like a horse hoof creating magnificent atmosphere.\nJuwangsan originally called as Seokbyeongsan, Daedunsan, Jubangsan and there are interesting stories respectively. It was called\n'Seokbyeongsan' because of lots of rocky cliffs; Daedunsan for people escaped from war and hid here, Jubangsan for Kim Juwon, the\noffspring of King Seondeok of Silla stayed in the mountain. And King Ju of China (Dang Dynasty) hid in this mountain when pursued by\nGiam (the rock of falg), the representative clear water of Juwangsan, there is a legend that when King Ju had a severe battle with Silla, he\nmade these curious rocks to look like stacks of grain. The most distinguished fact about the curious rock is its smoothness compared to the\nother rocks found typically in Korea. It is about components that consist of the rock. Giam made of lava flow down from a volcano and became\nLike Giam, most of the cliffs in Juwangsan were made by volcanic activity. It is different from rocks found in Jeju Island which have lots of holes\nin them. Holes are made when lava erupted to the sky, falling down to the earth with air. But rocks in Juwangsan had no air in them because\nthey were hardened very fast without having holes. And the rocks were vulnerable to erosion, creating a vertical cliff, stairs topography, and\nThe volcanic activity was supposed to happen about 70 million years ago when dinosaurs lived on the Korean Peninsula in the Cretaceous\nperiod, the Mesozoic Age. Juwangsan was made around this time together with Naeyeonsan near the mountain, and Bohyeonsan in\nYeongcheon, Unmunsan in Cheongdo, Geoje in Namhae, Goheung peninsula, Wando(Island), and Jindo(Island).\nJuwangsan is also famous for its legend. Juwang(King) hid in this mountain when pursued by revolutionaries. Dang Dynasty asked Silla to kill\nJuwang, Silla sent General Ma with five brothers. When King Ju had a severe battle with Silla, he made curious rocks that looked like stacks of\ngrain and pretended that he had many soldiers.

The blood Juwang shed became a kind of azalea flower, Sudalrae, and they are in full blossom from the\nlate of spring to beginning of summer. The flower is much more reddish than azalea and has black spots in it. It is considered as the proud\nscene of Juwangsan and there is 'Juwangsan Sudalrae festival' every May.\nThere is another legend saying Kim Juwon of Silla Dynasty lived in Juwang. At the end of Silla Dynasty, Kim Juwon was recommended as the\nnext king following King Seondeok, but Kim Gyeongsin revolted and became king. Kim Juwon couldn't be a king and hide himself in\n'Seokbyeongsan'.

The most common symptom is a feeling of irritation in the eyes, nose and throat. Some people may also experience respiratory or heart symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, and wheezing.\nCan ozone hurt you?\nIf ozone is inhaled, it reacts with compounds found in the body and can cause harm to the lungs. If a person inhales a small amount of ozone, it can cause side effects, such as coughing, shortness of breath, chest pains, and irritation of the throat.\nHow much does ozone cleaning cost?\nThe cost for ozone treatment starts at $600, which generally covers about 1,000 square feet, Calamus said.\nHow do you get rid of ozone?\nAir cleaning refers to using methods like air filters and gas absorbing materials to remove pollutants out of the air. The use of air filters that include activated carbon is very effective at removing ozone from the air.\nHow is ozone exposure treated?\nNo specific treatment is available for individuals exposed to ozone, though some have suggested that oral intake of Vitamin E is beneficial to the chronic ambient exposure most experience.\nWhat are the symptoms of ozone exposure?\nWhat are ozone’s acute physiological and symptom effects?Cough.Throat irritation.Pain, burning, or discomfort in the chest when taking a deep breath.Chest tightness, wheezing, or shortness of breath.\nHow does ozone kill mold?\nProcess. High ozone shock treatment involves using an ozone generator with a timer to create lethal levels of ozone in an enclosed odour ridden or mold-affected room or building for a short period of time, between one and several hours.\nDoes ozone kill mold and bacteria?\nOzone kills bugs, mold, bacteria, plants, pets, and people, if any breathe it long enough. Ozone kills bugs, mold, bacteria, plants, pets, and people, if any breathe it long enough.\nDoes ozone treatment really work?\nAvailable scientific evidence shows that, at concentrations that do not exceed public health standards, ozone is generally ineffective in controlling indoor air pollution. The concentration of ozone would have to greatly exceed health standards to be effective in removing most indoor air contaminants.\nWhat happens if you breathe in ozone?\nWhen inhaled, ozone can damage the lungs. Relatively low amounts can cause chest pain, coughing, shortness of breath and throat irritation. Ozone may also worsen chronic respiratory diseases such as asthma and compromise the ability of the body to fight respiratory infections.\nCan you get ozone poisoning?\nWhether in its pure form or mixed with other chemicals, ozone can be harmful to health. When inhaled, ozone can damage the lungs. Relatively low amounts of ozone can cause chest pain, coughing, shortness of breath and, throat irritation.\nHow long does ozone take to kill mold?\nFor a while it was somewhat common to see mold remediation specifications call for flooding the work area with ozone for 24 to 48 hours following the gross removal and cleanup.\nIs ozone treatment FDA approved?\nOzone therapy. … In April 2016, the FDA prohibited all medical uses of ozone, “In any medical condition for which there is no proof of safety and effectiveness”, stating “Ozone is a toxic gas with no known useful medical application in specific, adjunctive, or preventive therapy.\nIs ozone safe to breathe?\nConclusions.

{"question":"new diatom species biological station discovery","answer":"Three new species of diatoms were discovered during an Algae in Freshwater Ecosystems class at the U-M Biological Station. Diatoms are a type of algae with a glass cell wall and diverse forms resembling snowflakes. One of these species was named Brachysira gatesii in honor of David Gates, a former director of UMBS and LSA professor emeritus of biology.","context":["Just a few days into the Algae in Freshwater Ecosystems class at the U-M Biological Station (UMBS), even squeamish students happily stepped straight into lakes, marshes, and bogs without protective clothing—snakes and leeches be damned. None of the students knew much about algae before taking the course. But very soon, they had become obsessed.\nAnyone who breathes should use every third breath to thank algae, say UMBS faculty members Rex Lowe (professor emeritus of biological sciences at Bowling Green University) and Pat Kociolek (director of the natural history museum and professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Colorado), because those little aquatic organisms produce an enormous amount of the oxygen on Earth. Algae aren’t plants, precisely—they lack roots and leaves—but they do photosynthesize. And their health reflects the health of the ecosystem they occupy, so studying algae is a good way to test water quality.\nThe tight-knit group of six students and two visiting professors in the algae class traveled from the Biological Station deep into Michigan’s upper peninsula, searching for specimens. They camped in tents at a state park in the Porcupine Mountains near Lake Superior. They hiked a steep and winding trail from their campsite to the shore of Lake of the Clouds. There, they swished nets, squirted turkey basters, scraped rocks, and dove deep to collect from all parts of the water column. The class hurried back to UMBS with their samples and spent the rest of the summer looking through microscopes to see what they’d found.\n“The beauty at that scale was breathtaking,” says Mark Fate (’13). The class collaborated on their observations, working with special equipment so they could project a microscopic view of the samples onto a screen for everyone to look at. What they saw were strings of structures, lime-shaped compartments patterned in different shades of green, broccoli-tufted aggregations, and other bizarre, beautiful forms. Sometimes they admired algae in the lab until long after dinner. They created digital photo libraries of their specimens, using the microscope to snap images, exploring a world of tiny organisms they’d never even considered before.\nMore than that, they saw completely new things that no one had ever described before: The class discovered three new species of algae. Three new species of diatoms, to be exact—a type of algae whose single cell is surrounded by a glass cell wall, and whose diversity of forms resembles the unique and beautiful geometry of snowflakes.\nThe algae class honored a much-loved former director of UMBS and LSA professor emeritus of biology, David Gates, by naming one of the diatom species Brachysira gatesii. They recently published their research in the Michigan Botanist, an academic journal established at U-M. Adding a scientific discovery to the scholarly record is a rare, tangible outcome for a semester of class—even at UMBS, where undergraduates routinely get valuable scientific research experience in the field.\n“We actually don’t get to that level with most classes,” Kociolek says. “Everybody was working on the one project, which gave them an opportunity to get into some uncharted waters and get a deeper knowledge of algae.”\n“You have this bonding experience, and you become very good friends,” Lowe says, remarking on the social impact of studying at the Biological Station. “You become colleagues by the end of the summer.”\n“That was the best experience I ever had in my life,” says Eric Hsieh (’13). “It taught me a spirit, a mindset, a way of thinking.”"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search query"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_expertise","category_name":"expert"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:fa8f8fa4-77c3-4a48-bdc5-6f5506ee5cec>"],"error":null}
{"question":"what are the main risks and dangers of using ai in warfare","answer":"The main risks of using AI in warfare include: making wars more precise, quicker, and crueler; potential harm to civilians from unmanned systems; errors in AI systems due to human mistakes and mechanical defects; vulnerability to malware and viruses; difficulty in tracking accountability for faulty missions; and increased risk of terrorists exploiting AI weaknesses. Additionally, AI warfare could lead to new threats like cross-domain attacks and potential hacking of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons control systems.","context":["Last week, AlphaGo — an artificial intelligence program developed by Google’s DeepMind team — beat the highest-ranked Chinese Go player, Ke Jie, for the second time during a match held in Wuzhen, in eastern China’s Zhejiang province. With the rapid development of big data, cloud computing, and the internet of things, AI stands at the center of a coming technological and industrial revolution. But what does AI mean for China’s defense? How should we address the security challenges that AI may cause if used inappropriately?\nBroadly speaking, AI is any computer science technology that emphasizes the creation of intelligent machines that think, work, and react like humans, exhibiting the capacity to learn and solve problems. Widely regarded as the world’s first programmable, electronic, digital computer, Colossus was a machine developed by British code breakers between 1942 and 1945 to help break the Lorenz cipher used by the German army to encrypt messages during World War II.\nSince then, AI has been widely used on the battlefield. Technologically advanced satellite sensors and wearable equipment have helped improve information processing. In order to manage data and information to gain the maximum advantage, the development of a command and control system is always at the top of the Chinese military’s agenda.\nIn addition, cloud computing and big data analytics are widely used in cyberattack detection and the diagnosis of faults. With adaptive technology, state defenses can now monitor the entire life cycle of an attack, from delivery, to callbacks and reconnaissance, to data exfiltration.\nThe industry of unmanned systems is also growing rapidly. To date, more than 70 countries have developed their own platforms to support and accelerate the development of unmanned vehicles, drones, and ships. Meanwhile, robot technology is also developing apace. Each day, new bionic robotics are being developed and put on the market. It is believed that robot warriors and drone swarms herald a future of autonomous war machines.\nThere is no doubt that AI will reshape defense technology and turn science fiction into reality. However, new challenges for defense and security should not be underestimated. First of all, AI will make future wars more precise, quicker, and crueler. Unmanned systems will be widely utilized by technologically advanced states to reduce their military casualties. However, the safety of civilians caught up in the fighting may not be guaranteed by unmanned systems. Eventually, AI warfare may undermine the principles of human morality.\nSecond, AI will never replace human ingenuity. AI is, simply, an automated way of building a computer program capable of finding patterns in large amounts of data. But in fact, thinking like a real human is all unexplored territory. It’s a place where human ingenuity is going to be more important than the AI it births. Like any tool, AI can do harm when used in the wrong way — maybe even increasing the possibility of a large-scale war.\nThird, AI is far from perfect. There may be a certain amount of error in AI systems because of human error and mechanical defects. In a confrontational environment, AI systems could be invaded or damaged by malware and viruses. Under such circumstances, uncontrollable AI may end up killing innocent people.\nLast but not least, because AI blurs the boundaries of accountability, it will be difficult to track down those responsible for faulty missions. For example, perpetrators of humanitarian disasters caused by drones may include the pilot, the computer programmer, the procurement officer, and the commander, among others. It is plain to see, therefore, that AI mistakes are much harder to police and rectify than human mistakes.\nMeanwhile, as new technology spreads, terrorists could exploit AI and its weaknesses in order to launch an attack. In an increasingly interconnected and globalized world, we face new risks of cross-domain attacks, as well as increased risks of miscalculation, misjudgment, and misperception. For instance, a cyberattack using AI technology could damage critical infrastructure and industrial control systems. Furthermore, nuclear weapons and chemical and biological weapons control systems may be left at risk of being hacked.\nWhile many states, including China, are attempting to upgrade their defense capabilities by introducing AI technology, we should remain cautious about its proliferation. AI may lead to new forms of warfare like open-source warfare, algorithmic warfare, and hybrid warfare. It will become more and more difficult for a single country to pursue absolute security for itself. I believe that, in the era of AI, people should work more closely to respond to international security challenges. In light of this, I have three recommendations.\nFirst, world leaders in military and technology circles should take on more responsibility. A double-track security dialogue should be organized within a framework of coordination and cooperation among think tanks from all countries. The dialogue should involve the following topics: strengthening information exchange and sharing, assessing hacking risks in the internet of things, predicting the effects of AI proliferation, and preventing war and conflict caused by the miscalculations of sovereign states and attacks by non-state actors.\nSecond, each country should use AI technology to facilitate and support deeper cooperation with other countries on disaster warning mechanisms, international anti-terrorism efforts, the fight against transnational crime, and humanitarian assistance missions.\nFinally, an international law on the weaponization of AI is an important measure for preventing AI abuse. International organizations should turn their attention to establishing retroactive liability for AI misuse and aim for a consensus on international law enforcement.\n(Header image: A SWAT team member aims a gun at a target in Beijing, Aug. 20, 2016.

The water that is fit for use is fresh water.\nQ20. Explain the three form of water that exists in nature.\nexists in three forms: solid, liquid and vapour. The solid form,\nsnow and ice, is present as ice caps at the poles of the earth, snow-covered\nmountains and glaciers. Liquid water is present in oceans, lakes, rivers, and\neven underground. The gaseous form is the water vapour present in the air\nQ21. From where do people in villages get water?\nMany villages do not have water supply system. There people fetch water\ndirectly from the sources. Often women and children have to walk several kilometres\nto fetch water. The children suffer a lot. They cannot attend school regularly\nsince they spend hours in fetching water.\nA large number of people draw water from wells, tube wells or hand\nQ22. List some methods to conserve water.\nto conserve water\nRepairing leaking supply pipes and taps.\nJudicially using water while brushing\nteeth, shaving, bathing, washing and during many other activities.\nQ23. Can we keep on drawing water from under the ground? How\nwill it affect the water table?\nWater drawn from under the ground gets replenished by seepage of rainwater. The\nwater table does not get affected as long as we draw as much water as is replenished\nby natural processes. However, water table may go down if the water is not\nQ24. What are the reasons for lowering of the water table?\nThis may happen due to many reasons. Increase in population, industrial and\nactivities are some common factors affecting water table. Scanty rainfall is\nanother factor that may deplete the water table. Yet another factor affecting\nwater table could be deforestation and decrease in the effective area for\nseepage of water.\nQ25. Why is distribution of water uneven in our country?\nIndia is a vast country and the rainfall is not the same everywhere.\nregions have excessive rains while some others have very little rainfall. Excessive\nrains cause floods, whereas the absence of rains results in droughts. Therefore,\nsome regions in our country may have floods while others may suffer from\ndroughts at the same time."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_expertise","category_name":"expert"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:4484e8b4-87ee-4e2b-b770-b5e094c84b81>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the key differences between positive and negative lenses in terms of how they affect incident parallel rays?","answer":"Positive (converging) lenses cause incident parallel rays to converge at a focal point on the opposite side of the lens. In contrast, negative (diverging) lenses cause incident parallel rays to emerge from the lens as though they emanated from a focal point on the incident side of the lens.","context":["Imaging with a Lens\nWe will explore the image-forming properties of lenses. Thin lenses can be grouped into two categories, positive (converging) lenses, and negative (diverging) lenses. A positive lens is one that causes incident parallel rays to converge at a focal point on the opposite side of the lens. A negative lens is one that causes incident parallel rays to emerge from the lens as though they emanated from a focal point on the incident side of the lens. The two types of lenses are illustrated below.\nUse the mouse to determine the position of the lens and of the focal point. The difference in these positions should be the focal length. Select the lens by clicking on it: the focal length f will be shown. Is it about what you expected?\nThe parallel rays in the figures above represent a point source infinitely far away to the left. (This is a tricky concept! Think about it.) More generally, light rays emanating from any point (the \"object\") on the central axis will be brought to a focus (the \"image\", real or virtual) at some other point on the central axis. If the object is not at infinity, but at the finite position p, then a lens of focal length f forms an image at the position q determined by the thin lens equation\nHere it is understood that p is measured from the center of the lens, and is considered positive if the object is to the left of the lens, and negative to the right. Similarly q is measured from the center of the lens and is positive to the right of the lens, negative to the left (opposite sign convention from p). What is q in the special case that p goes to infinity? (Compare the figures at the top of this page.)\nExperiment with the setup pictured below by dragging the object (source of the light rays) with the mouse. Note that when the object is off-axis the image is off-axis too. If the object is not too far off-axis, then the distances p, q, and f are still given by the thin-lens equation. This determines the horizontal position of the image. The vertical distance of the image from the axis is most easily determined by the special ray through the center of the lens, which is undeviated: as you move the object vertically, the image also moves vertically as if at the opposite end of a lever which pivots at the center of the lens. Try to make sense of these statements in the figure below, and in particular check the thin lens equation.Now replace the \"source\" in the applet with an \"object\" (meaning an object of finite extent). The way to do this is to select the source by clicking on it, then push the \"Clear Active\" button. The active element, that is, the source you selected, should disappear. Now push the \"Object\" button and click where you want to place the new object (roughly where the source used to be). If necessary, drag the new object a little off-axis so that you can see it better. The object is indicated by a vertical arrow, and the image of the tip of the arrow is constructed by ray-tracing. Only three rays are drawn, but they are enough to see where the image is, and they are the simplest rays, or, as they are called, the principal rays. Notice that the one through the center of the lens is undeviated, and the other two go through the focal points of the lens (select the lens by clicking on it to see this).\nDrag the object around and notice how the image behaves. As the object approaches the focal point of the lens, the image retreats to infinity (note the parallel rays). What happens if you bring the object inside the focal length of the lens? Something very interesting! The image reappears as a virtual image on the same side of the lens as the object (i.e., q is now negative: check how the thin lens equation describes this). An eye looking in from the right would receive rays as if from this image. It is called \"virtual\" because you have to extrapolate the rays backward to find it: the light rays themselves don't actually intersect to form a \"real\" image. By the way, in this configuration the lens is acting as a magnifying glass: think why this is.\nIt makes sense to compare the size of the object and the image. We define the magnification M to be the ratio of the size I of the image to the size O of the object, but by similar triangles this is also the ratio of the image distance q to the object distance p:"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_expertise","category_name":"expert"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:11544dd1-4a71-4cd5-bfc1-f62efa473b74>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the main differences between how Malay was spoken by different social classes in colonial Ceylon?","answer":"There were two kinds of Malay spoken in Ceylon: the Malay spoken by the literate elite classes, and the Malay spoken by the less educated Malays which was more similar to Bazaar Malay or a kind of Creole. The upper class Malays eventually acquired English knowledge and gradually lost their mother tongue, while the underprivileged classes preserved Malay by continuing to speak it. Additionally, upcountry Malays maintained standard Malay grammatical practices, like placing adjectives after nouns, while Malay speakers in areas like Slave Island used different word orders.","context":["Sri Lankan Malay language and its future\nby B. D. K. Saldin From Artscope Daily News\n14 January 2004\ncontroversy has arisen about the origins of the Sri Lankan Malay Language and as\nto why it differs from that which is spoken in other parts of the Malay speaking\nworld where the langauge has been standardized. Perhaps a brief history of the\nMalay language would throw some light on this vexed question.\nMalay language belongs to the Austronesian family of languages. The Austronesian\nlanguage family can be divided into four branches, viz. the languages of the\nMalay Archipelago (Nusantara), the languages of Polynesia, the languages of\nMelanesia, and the languages of Micronesia.\nNusantara group of languages has the biggest number between 200-300. Some\nexamples are Malay, the languages of the Philippine Islands such as (Tagalog,\nIlko, Bisaya); of Java such as Javanese, Sundanese, Madurese); of Kalimantan\nsuch as (Iban, Kenyah, Melanu); of Celebes Islands such as (Buginese,\nMakasarese, Selo); of Bima and Sumba such as (Bima, Manggarai, and Sumba); and\nof Ambon and Timor such as (Alor Roti Wetar)\nis a historical fact that our ancestors were not brought from one particular\nisland of Nusantara but from many. Therefore they would have spoken the langauge\nof the island from which they came. There was neither Indonesia nor Malaysia\nthen. Malay was the lingua franca with which all these groups communicated with\none another. Our ancestors used the gundul script and wrote in Malay.\ntheir progeny had continued to be literate perhaps they would still be speaking\nin the lingua franca which their ancestors used i.e. Malay. We cannot get behind\nthe fact that our language is a mixture for which there are historical reasons.\nBut we do not have to be ashamed of it.\nno Malay will deny the need to preserve and improve our langauge. In trying to\nimprove our langauge, we are faced with a dilemma. Our langauge has now become\nonly an oral means of communication and, but for a certain similarity in the\nlexicon, has become different in structure, grammar and syntax from the langauge\nspoken elsewhere in the Malay world. Are we to put into writing lock, stock and\nbarrel the langauge we speak, in whatever script we choose or are we to follow\nthe rules of Standard Malay as adopted by Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei\nand the rest of the Malay speaking world.\nfrom the literature of the Malay texts which were written in Gundul, it is clear\nthat there were two kinds of Malay spoken in Ceylon, the Malay spoken by the\nliterate classes i.e. the elite of which Baba Ounus Saldin was in the forefront\nand the Malay spoken by the less educated Malays, more akin to Bazaar Malay or a\nkind of Creole. The upper class of Malays, if I may so call them, acquired a\nknowledge of English and advanced materially. They gradually lost the use of\ntheir mother tongue.\nunderprivileged classes could not acquire a knowledge of English for whatever\nreason and therefore did not improve their lot materially. But it was these\nBazaar Malay speaking Malays who preserved Malay unconsciously by speaking it.\nThen again with the disbanding of the Malay Regiment in 1873 and the\nsimultaneous opening up of the railways to the upcountry the Malays of the upper\nclasses joined the tea and rubber plantations as conductors and tea makers and\nacted as liaison officers between the European planters and the Indian\ntypical Malay family with the writer in the centre\na sense they became isolated and did not have as much contact with the other\nindigenous ethnic groups as those who were left behind in Colombo.\nlatter were exposed more to a variety of langauge and cultural influences, as\nthey had to work closely with the other communities in places such as the\nharbour. For example the upcountry Malays always placed the adjective after the\nnoun, as is the grammatical practice in standard Malay.\nalways said \"daging goreng\" fried beef, \"Orang Kaya\", a rich\nman, \"Orang Miskin\" a poor man etc, in contrast to Goreng Daging, kaya\nOrang, and Miskin Orang, as expressed by Malay speakers in Slave Island.\nancestors wrote in the gundul script. If one reads any of the existing Malay\nreligious manuscripts, one will see that the language used is not much different\nfrom what is being spoken today in the Malay world. Therefore, one could safely\nassume that a few generations ago the Sri Lankan Malays also spoke in a similar\nI say that the literary type of Malay is now dead in Sri Lanka? An attempt to\nrevive Malay calls for both expertise and funding both of which are woefully\nlacking in Sri Lanka. Assuming that both the expertise and the funding are\navailable then it would be ideal to revive the literary Malay, which is what is\nnow being spoken in the Malay world. However, if we do this then the vast\nmajority of Malays are bound to feel alienated because standard Malay is, lets\nface it, is a foreign tongue.\npersonal view is that we need both kinds of Malay, Standard Malay and our own\nformer in order to communicate with the rest of the Malay speaking world, 200\nmillion in all with their priceless culture wherein lie our roots and the\nemployment opportunities that are available under the present political\nscenario. The latter because this langauge is what we have preserved for 200\nyears in an alien soil along with the adaptations we have made.\nadopt standard malay is in a sense easy because Indonesia and Malaysia have\nalready laid the foundation for altering the Arabic script into the Roman\nscript. To use my favourite expression, we do not have to reinvent the wheel.\nDewan Bahasa dan Pustaka, the language and Literature Institute of Malaysia, has\nagreed to help us with expertise and educational material.\ntranslate our dialect into the written form is a gigantic task for which we need\nfunding and expertise. Assuming that the funding and expertise is forthcoming\nhow do we set about it? Let us first decide on the script.\nLankan Malay was earlier written in the Gundul script i.e. the Arabic script\nwith the addition of 5 letters. Most Malays are familiar with the Arabic text\nand to learn the extra 5 letters would not take long. But the Malay speaking\nworld has now adopted the Roman script. For the Sri Lankan Malays to adopt an\nentirely new script in the sense that they already know the Roman Script, would\nnot be pragmatic.\nthere would be no serious objection to the Roman script, we have to determine\nthe spelling of words.\nmain argument adduced by those who oppose the use of Standard Romanized spelling\nfor Sri Lankan Malay is that the Malays are used to spelling and articulating\nEnglish words the way in Englishman does. Therefore, we should spell and\npronounce Malay also in the way they are all familiar with and even \"swear\nthink the \"script\" ought not to be the Romanized script used in\nMalaysia and Indonesia. They feel it ought to be the way they would spell the\nMalay words, little realizing that English is NOT a phonetic language and it\nwould be difficult to use it \"haphazardly\" to express Malay sounds by\npeople who are not trained linguists. The experts in Malaysia and Indonesia have\nstudied this problem and carefully worked out a Romanized structure, based on\nall know how difficult English spelling is. For instance, put and but are\npronounced differently. The written characters are tools for translating the\nwritten to the spoken but each language has a pronunciation of its own. This\nalso applies to Malay. The use of the letter C for the Ch sound seems to\nirritate these conservative elements the most.\nsay that they are used to the English way of spelling that sound which is\n\"ch\". They little realize that the letters \"ch\" in the words\nsuch as \"chemistry, character and chasm\" are not pronounced in the\nsame way as in \"church\". So if we spell \"chuchi\" won't\npeople pronounce it as \"kookie\".\nthese words are Malay words and not English words and it is ridiculous to spell\nit the so-called English way. Malay words must be spelt the Malay way.\nis nothing sacrosanct about the English way of spelling. If we are so enamoured\nwith our very own Malay why not start writing in gundul. I know that some people\nwill say that it is not practical.\nmight say why not use something that is already there like the roman script.\nThis is exactly my point. Why squabble over a script? The Malays are well-known\nfor their tendency to maintain that their point of view is always correct. For\nexample, if we wish to coin our own spelling for the word \"to wash\"\nthere can be a variety of ways to spell it such as, chuchi, choochi, chuchie\nchoochie, or choochy. Is it not better to spell it in the way the rest of the\nMalay world spells it as cuci.\nwe not follow a well tried out system formulated by trained linguists as is now\nprevalent in the Malay world? Why do we find it difficult to persuade our\nchildren to speak Malay and study Malay? Why is there such a demand for French,\nGerman and Japanese? The answer is the incentive of employment.\nhave always looked to the west when there are ample opportunities of employment\nin the east. Two hundred million people speak Malay and a knowledge of Malay\nwill help rather than hinder the quest for jobs.\ndo you think holds out the greater incentive, learning a kind of Malay's and\ngrammar, sans syntax, with a spelling devoid of any phonetic scheme or a well\ntried out system formulated by trained linguists as is now prevalent in the\nMalay world? I think \"the blind alley\", as some Malays choose to term\nit, is not Standard Malay but the former system which some are trying to\nadvocate. The Roman script, the way Standard Malay is written, is the bridge\nthat will connect us to the rest of the Malay world.\nideal would be for us to learn Standard Malay in the same way that we learn any\nother foreign language like French or German. At the same time let us talk our\nvery own Malay. If it were possible to translate this Malay into writing, then\nwe should adopt some sort of grammar and syntax.\ncannot form our own systems and the logical thing would be to adopt what has\nbeen done by the Malay world. For our children who are already burdened with a\nheavy curriculum it would be too much to learn two kinds of Malay.\nif it were at all possible for them to learn two kinds of Malay, then one kind\nof Malay will supersede the other. The stronger and the more vibrant with all\nthe resources at its command i.e. Standard Malay will swamp our local Malay.\nThis is inevitable.

{"question":"differences motif symbol theme literature","answer":"Motifs, symbols, and themes are distinct literary elements. A motif is something tangible that appears repeatedly throughout a story, while a theme is abstract (like feelings of love or loneliness). A symbol is an object representing a larger idea, but it only becomes a motif if it's mentioned several times throughout the story. For example, if a heart appears once to represent love, it's a symbol; if it appears multiple times, it becomes a motif.","context":["One of the most exciting techniques used by narrative writers is the careful weaving of a central element, called a motif, throughout a story. This can be an object, a sound, an expression, a setting, or a sentiment. Keep reading for several motif examples in literature.\nExamples of Motif\nWhat Is a Motif?\nOften, motifs spring to life through the use of repeated imagery or language. Sounds and visual descriptors can also encapsulate a motif, as they continue to reappear throughout a story. A popular one is the green light used by F. Scott Fitzgerald in The Great Gatsby.\nMotifs can also be woven through a story with phrases that keep reappearing. In Macbeth, Shakespeare uses the expression \"fair is foul, and foul is fair\" to centralize his sentiment about the constancy of good and evil and things not being what they seem.\nExamples of Motif in Narrative Writing\nSo now we know that a symbol contributes to a motif and a motif reinforces a theme. Let’s examine different scenarios where motifs might reappear to paint a masterful picture. What the motif could represent is shown in brackets.\n- A repeated reference or visual of shattered glass (something in life is about to break)\n- Recurring dishonest characters (to cue up the discovery of an unfaithful spouse)\n- A character who constantly misplaces things (as the loss of someone or something significant is on the horizon)\n- A blue bird that appears briefly on a windowsill each morning (because the main character will take off and leave the only home she's known)\n- The constant pattering of rain each night (bringing on the element of a cleanse or rebirth for a central character)\n- Hearing the phrase, \"Some things in life never change\" repeated throughout a story (to push a character to make a big change)\n- Watching a street lamp flicker, but only on Friday nights (to reinforce a central character's loneliness on Friday nights)\n- Hearing the sound of a dog collar once, twice, maybe three times throughout a story (to emphasize a character's sorrow over the loss of her faithful companion)\n- Finding a Bible at a bus stop and then coming across a featured painting in an art gallery that looks just like that Bible (to symbolize a call to God)\n- A pop of sunlight on a cloudy beach morning and then a pop of sunlight on a drive home in the evening (because the character's about to emerge from a difficult time)\nDid you notice each of these examples seemed to echo the function of a symbol? Let's look at the blue bird on the windowsill. If he'd only stopped by to say hello one morning, he'd merely be a symbol of leaving. The moment he kept reappearing every morning, he became a motif.\nExamples of Motif in Literature\nMotifs are an important component of literature. They establish literary elements such as mood, foreshadowing, characterization, and theme. A well-written literary work uses motifs in subtle but important ways.\nRomeo and Juliet by William Shakespeare\nShakespeare was a master of almost every literary technique. While MacBeth focused on good and evil, Romeo and Juliet focused on light and darkness. That motif was encapsulated in the brightness of the night moon, the stars that lit the sky and the bright flash that lightning provides.\n\"But soft, what light through yonder window breaks?\nIt is the east, and Juliet is the sun.\nArise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,\nWho is already sick and pale with grief\nThat thou, her maid, art far more fair than she. . . .\nThe brightness of her cheek would shame those stars\nAs daylight doth a lamp; her eye in heaven\nWould through the airy region stream so bright\nThat birds would sing and think it were not night.\"\nRomeo refers to Juliet as light throughout the play, she is “the sun” and her eyes are like “two of the fairest stars in all the heaven.” Their love is a light that shines brightest in the darkness but is ultimately consumed by it.\nThe Old Man and the Sea by Ernest Hemingway\nIn Old Man in the Sea, Ernest Hemingway uses animals as motifs, but they're not the sea animals you might expect. The main character, Santiago, repeatedly dreams about lions, even when he is far from land and surrounded by other predators.\n\"After that he began to dream of the long yellow beach and he saw the first of the lions come down onto it in the early dark and then the other lions came and he rested his chin on the wood of the bows where the ship lay anchored with the evening off-shore breeze and he waited to see if there would be more lions and he was happy.\"\nLions in another character's dream may indicate a menacing or fearful tone. However, to Santiago, lions are comforting. They remind him of his childhood and dreaming about them makes him happy. The very last line of the book, \"The old man was dreaming about the lions,\" indicates that the old man has finally found peace, whether he is sleeping or has died (according to some interpretations).\nPride and Prejudice by Jane Austen\nLet's take a look at another prevalent tale, Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. Journeys kept popping up, establishing the motif of change. Elizabeth's journey to visit Charlotte first introduces her to Mr. Darcy. Her second journey to Derby and Pemberley brings her back into contact with Darcy again.\n\"Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley’s attentions to her sister, Elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend. Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise. But no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she hardly had a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes. To this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying.\"\nSure enough, Darcy embarks on his own journey, too, when he saves the family honor by tracking down Wickham and Lydia. Darcy serves as a motif for Elizabeth's growth and development throughout the novel.\nOf Mice and Men by John Steinbeck\nJohn Steinbeck's novel Of Mice and Men is a shorter literary work but still has lots of space for symbolic motifs. One of the main motifs in the book is rabbits; specifically, the rabbits that are supposedly waiting to be fed by George and Lenny once they have their own land.\n\"Someday — we're gonna get the jack together and we're gonna\nhave a little house and a couple of acres an' a cow and some pigs\n\"An' live off the fatta the lan',\" Lennie shouted. \"An' have\nrabbits. Go on, George! Tell about what we're gonna have in the\ngarden and about the rabbits in the cages and about the rain in the\nwinter and the stove, and how thick the cream is on the milk like\nyou can hardly cut it. Tell about that, George.\"\n\"Why'n't you do it yourself? You know all of it.\"\n\"No ... you tell it. It ain't the same if I tell it. Go on ... George.\nHow I get to tend the rabbits.\"\nThe men have placed all of their hopes into the future, which comes up every time Lenny mentions the rabbits. It's almost a code word for Lenny and George when they need to think about brighter days. There are rabbits in the opening scene of the novel, and George and Lenny talk about the rabbits just before George shoots Lenny in the back of the head.\nWuthering Heights by Emily Brontë\nA strong motif in Emily Brontë's Wuthering Heights is the repeated presence of dogs. The story begins with Heathcliff's rough treatment of his dog, as opposed to Lockwood's inclination to pet her.\n\"I took a seat at the end of the hearthstone opposite that towards which my landlord advanced, and filled up an interval of silence by attempting to caress the canine mother, who had left her nursery, and was sneaking wolfishly to the back of my legs, her lip curled up, and her white teeth watering for a snatch. My caress provoked a long, guttural gnarl.\n'You’d better let the dog alone,' growled Mr. Heathcliff in unison, checking fiercer demonstrations with a punch of his foot. 'She’s not accustomed to be spoiled — not kept for a pet.' Then, striding to a side door, he shouted again, 'Joseph!'”\nHeathcliff's abuse is again evident when he kills Isabella's dog upon leaving Thrushcross Grange. This act foreshadows Healthcliff's treatment of Isabella, as the motif of dogs establishes that his character is animalistic and cruel\nMotifs vs. Themes\nMotifs are sometimes confused with themes. While they are very similar — both weave through a story — the easiest way to differentiate the two is to remember a motif is something tangible (like the green lantern or Shakespeare's catchphrase) while a theme is abstract (such as feelings of love or a character's underlying loneliness).\nIt's a fine line between the two. In the end, a green lantern may be a physical object, but it's a repetitive symbol for the theme of constancy. The two elements work together, much like a painter's brush and palette.\nMotifs vs. Symbols\nSymbols can also be confused with motifs. By definition, a symbol is an object representing a larger idea, like a heart is a symbol for love. That sounds like a motif, doesn't it? There's one big difference.\nIf something is mentioned once to allude to something else, it's a symbol. If something is mentioned several times throughout a story, it's a motif. Think of symbols as baby motifs. They only grow up to become motifs if they're repeated throughout the course of a narrative.\nCreating the Mood\nMotifs are wonderful ways to say, \"A change is coming,\" or \"She's a lost soul,\" without overtly writing that. Readers are able to watch tales unfold while subtle moods and feelings start to emerge from the pages simply through a repeated concept or object. The mind ends up getting a good workout and, in the end, a story's true sentiments stay with you forever.
