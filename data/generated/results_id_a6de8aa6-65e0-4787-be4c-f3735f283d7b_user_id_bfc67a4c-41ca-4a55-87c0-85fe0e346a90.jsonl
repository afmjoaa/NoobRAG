{"question":"I'm an IT manager planning to upgrade our phone system. Can you explain how VoIP call quality compares to traditional phone lines, and what infrastructure requirements are needed for successful deployment?","answer":"VoIP systems can now rival mobile phone or landline calls in terms of reliability, largely due to improved bandwidth availability. However, successful deployment requires careful infrastructure planning. Organizations must assess their network capacity, potentially increase bandwidth, and evaluate LAN and WAN infrastructure requirements. Quality of Service (QoS) must be established to prioritize network traffic. Additionally, encryption can be implemented for security, though it requires significant computing power and should be tested to ensure it doesn't degrade call quality. The implementation should also account for different teams' specific needs and usage patterns, and include redundancy planning to minimize potential disruptions.","context":["Every organization considering a Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) telephone system deployment hears the same dire warnings: “Routing voice calls over a data network exposes calls to eavesdropping.”\nIt is absolutely possible to eavesdrop on a VoIP telephone call. It’s also possible to eavesdrop on a telephone call placed using the traditional public switched telephone network (PSTN). The difference lies in the tools and skill set needed to conduct the eavesdropping.\nWhile it’s certainly true that any telephone call carries a certain degree of eavesdropping risk, is it true that VoIP calls have an inherently higher degree of risk? In this tip, we explore the ins and outs of VoIP eavesdropping.\nVoIP eavesdropping is possible\nFirst, it’s important to be clear about one thing: It is absolutely possible to eavesdrop on a VoIP telephone call. It’s also possible to eavesdrop on a telephone call placed using the traditional public switched telephone network (PSTN). The difference lies in the tools and skill set needed to conduct the eavesdropping.\nOn a traditional telephone network, someone seeking to eavesdrop on a call generally must have physical access to either the telephone or telephone cable, at least at the initiation of the attack. This type of attack is typical in the movies. Whether it’s the good guys or the bad guys conducting the eavesdropping, someone gains access to either a telephone handset or the telephone network interface box -- sometimes located outside a home or office -- places a wiretap listening device on the box, and then monitors calls on an ongoing basis.\nProspective VoIP eavesdroppers follow the same general procedure, but make use of different tools. The first requirement is access to the medium carrying the voice calls. This can be achieved by compromising a VoIP telephone, a workstation running a softphone device or a component of the VoIP network infrastructure, such as a network switch or cable. Next, the attacker must use software tools to capture the traffic on the network. Akin to the wiretapping device in a traditional eavesdropping attack, network sniffing tools, such as the open source Wireshark, capture all of the data packets traversing the network and either analyze them live, or write them to a file for offline analysis.\nFinally, the attacker needs to be able to make sense of the captured data. This requires a translator that can convert the data packets back into a voice conversation. Again, there are free tools available online, such as VOMIT and VoIPong, that facilitate this task.\nSwitch security is essential\nOne of the most important things that network administrators can do to reduce VoIP risks such as eavesdropping is to apply basic security controls to network switches. While endpoint security is important, the network switch is the point where traffic is aggregated. Widespread eavesdropping attacks are possible through the malicious use of a switch’s span port, which can mirror all traffic traversing the switch, as opposed to the voice traffic from a single endpoint.\nHere are some switch management best practices that can help to protect this vital component of network infrastructure.\n- It’s important to ensure the switch is physically secured within a locked closet and has the appropriate access controls. If an attacker is able to gain physical access to a switch, all bets are off.\n- Organizations should use a separate network for the management of switches and other critical infrastructure devices. It shouldn’t be possible for an attacker who gains access to one general purpose network to attempt to gain access to the management port of a network device.\n- Organizations must update switch firmware as frequently as possible in order to patch known vulnerabilities corrected by the vendor.\nNaturally, there’s much more to secure switch management than this basic advice. For more information, read our switch security tips.\nEncryption greatly mitigates VoIP risks\nEncryption is also a powerful weapon that can be found in the VoIP security arsenal. All major providers of VoIP gear now offer encryption capability, an approach that uses cryptographic techniques to obscure the communication that takes place between endpoints. An eavesdropper who manages to intercept a voice communication with a network sniffer is unable to decipher encrypted calls without access to the corresponding decryption key.\nBefore deploying VoIP encryption, be sure to study the effect it might have on the quality of service provided on your network. Encryption requires large amounts of computing power and it is possible that it could degrade the quality of calls on your network if not properly implemented by the manufacturer. That said, encryption is a feature enterprises should consider deploying, especially for lines that are likely to carry highly sensitive information.\nIf an organization decides to use encryption as a security measure on its network, the need to use sound encryption key management practices can’t be overlooked. An eavesdropper who gains access to an enterprise’s encryption keys can easily decipher voice traffic. For more on this topic, read: Securing VoIP networks: Key management mechanisms.\nIn my opinion, a properly secured VoIP environment is no more risky than a traditional telephone system. With a combination of solid network security and properly deployed encryption, you can safely leverage VoIP technology in your organization.\nAbout the author:\nMike Chapple, Ph.D., CISA, CISSP, is an IT security professional with the University of Notre Dame.

Without a solid plan, it’s easy for mistakes to happen, which can lead to downtime and even frustrated customers in addition to lost revenue.\nWhen you replace your regular phone system, aka PSTN or POTS, with voice over internet protocol, or VoIP, you need to develop a detailed plan to ensure that you get the call quality, scalability, and reliability you need. While internet telephony isn’t new, today, reliability has increased, in part due to improved higher bandwidth availability. Today, a solid VoIP implementation can rival mobile phone or landline calls.\nHere are just a few of the things that you need to include in your VoIP project plan.\nAssess network capacity and infrastructure\nAs part of your VoIP implementation, you’ll likely need to increase your bandwidth capacity. To figure this out, you’ll need to get an idea of what you have today and then do some calculations on how much more you will need. This will mean working with your providers and a significant increase might even mean you need to evaluate multiple providers. Determine LAN and WAN infrastructure requirements and build any provisioning or changes into our plan.\nAssess user’s requirements\nTeams will have different needs. If you have a large inside sales team, contact center, or help desk, you will need to work with those teams to understand their special needs, such as usage and quality.\nUnderstand the growth plans of these teams. Is inside sales planning on doubling in size next year? You could easily get behind without detailed information from user expectations.\nDevelop a project plan\nSet goals and establish milestones to keep the project moving and report progress to stakeholders and your executive champions.\nEstablish a timeline\nOnce you know how you need to address your bandwidth, develop a timeline so you can coordinate with your providers as well as your internal constituents. If phones are critical to your business, you’ll want to assess timing of any downtime or potential disruption and plan accordingly. Miscues on delivery or cut overs could be costly to your business. You may want to build in some redundancy as part of your plan, either short term or long term.\nEstablish service levels for quality of service\nEspecially if your business relies heavily on communicating via phone make sure that you’ve built in quality of services, or QoS to establish prioritization of network traffic.\nAddress VoIP security vulnerabilities\nBecause VoIP routes calls through the same paths used by network and internet traffic, it is also subject to some of the same vulnerabilities and threats cyber criminals use to exploit these networks. VoIP traffic can thus be intercepted, captured or modified and is subject to attacks aimed at degrading or eliminating service. Make sure you have a solid plan in place to address any issues and be alert and train users to be aware of vulnerabilities such as caller ID spoofing.\nCreate a cross-functional team\nOne of the most critical items in building your VoIP implementation project plan is putting together the right team of cross-functional stakeholders that is backed by executive sponsorship. That requires communications and cooperation. Create infrastructure for the team with email groups and a project website.\nThese seven steps are just a sampling of the most critical elements in building your VoIP project implementation plan.

{"question":"What minimum credit score needed for cheap equipment financing rate, and what monthly payment expect?","answer":"For cheap equipment financing rates, you need a 'good' credit score over 680. With this score, you can expect monthly payments of about $565-$585 for $1 buyout options, or $530 to $550 per $25,000 of financing on a lease. With 'fair' credit (620-650), payments are higher at around $760 per month per $25,000 on a 5-year term. For scores between 650-680, expect payments of $630 to $675 monthly on $1 buyouts and $600-650 per $25,000 on a lease.","context":["Qualifying for Equipment Financing\nNot all businesses will qualify for equipment financing.\nThere are programs available for most situations, though.\nIf you've been in business for one day, if you've had a bankruptcy in the past year, in some cases, you can still qualify for equipment financing.\nIn instances like this sometimes you may need down payments or collateral.\nThere are 4 basic types of qualifications for equipment financing:\nCredit Based Equipment Finance\nCredit based equipment financing is almost always less expensive than collateral based equipment financing.\nWhat \"credit based\" means is that if you've got ok credit, in most cases you can finance your equipment.\nIf you have \"fair\" credit - meaning a credit score of 620-650 or so, and you've been in business for two or more years, and typically have some money in the bank, you won't get the cheapest rates, but they won't be outrageous.\nAs a rule of thumb, maybe plan on $760 per month per $25,000 of financing on a 5-year term (for $1 buyout).\nWith \"a little better than credit (650-680 credit score) the rates get better. You're looking at around $630 to $675 as a monthly payment on $1 buyouts and $600-650 per $25,000 of financing on a lease.\nWith good credit (over 680 credit score) rates get pretty reasonable. Plan on about $565-$585, sometime less, on $1 buyout and $530 to $550 per $25,000 of financing on a lease.\nIf you are new in business, programs are available if your credit is good, but financing will be more expensive.\nCash Flow Based Financing\nIf you have some credit challenges but run a strong business, your credit score may often be ignored.\nImagine you have a very low credit score and need funds to purchase $25,000 worth of equipment. If your business has revenues close to $25,000 per month, in many cases you can still get approved for financing.\nYour payments will be significantly higher than if you had great credit in these cases, but the money is available to you.\nWe talk about payments to lease equipment for tough credit situations here.\nCollateral Based Financing\nYou can be approved to finance equipment with almost any business or credit challenge if you can make a 50% down payment or offer collateral.\nIf, for example, you needed to finance that $25,000 piece of equipment and could offer $25,000 worth of machinery or vehicles as collateral, in the vast majority of cases you'd be approved.\nThere are two times we do find it impossible to get you approved.\n- Open bankruptcy (discharged is ok)\n- Open child support collections\nAlmost any other time, if you've got the down payment or collateral, a deal can be done.\nStory Based Financing\nIf there is a good business case to lend to you, often your credit score can be ignored.

{"question":"Como does social apathy influence learning motivation, and what evidence-based instructional methods work best for engagement?","answer":"Social apathy influences learning motivation differently depending on initial commitment levels. When people see others being apathetic, those who are wavering in their commitment tend to give up more easily, while strongly committed individuals become even more determined. Regarding evidence-based instructional methods, research demonstrates that active learning approaches significantly improve student engagement and performance. This includes implementing class discussions and activities rather than passive listening. These strategies have been proven particularly effective in science, engineering, and mathematics through empirical research.","context":["One of the themes in this blog over the years is goal contagion, which is the idea that we often adopt the goals of the people around us. See someone helping others, and you suddenly want to be helpful. See someone being aggressive, and it makes you more likely to engage aggressively with others.\nWhat about apathy?\nIf you see people being indifferent about a task, is that contagious as well?\nThat question was explored in a paper in the August, 2014 issue of the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology by Pontus Leander, James Shah, and Stacey Sanders.\nThey suggested that when people are wavering in their commitment to a goal, then being exposed to apathy decreases people’s motivation to pursue a task.\nIn one study, participants performed twelve GRE analogy problems. Prior to solving these problems, participants did a task in which they responded to words presented in the center of the screen. Prior to seeing the words, pictures were flashed quickly on the screen. These pictures either showed students looking bored or students looking engaged. A control group saw no pictures. The pictures were flashed quickly enough that they could be perceived subliminally. After solving the GRE problems, participants were asked for their undergraduate grade-point average, which is a broad measure of their commitment to academic work.\nParticipants with a high GPA were relatively unaffected by the prime. Those with a low GPA solved fewer analogy problems when they were primed by apathetic students than when they were primed by energetic students or received no priming at all.\nThis result suggests that exposure to apathy can decrease the motivation for people who are already unsure of their commitment to a goal. Another study used primes for apathy and primes for anger. Only primes for apathy led people to perform more poorly on a later test. This finding suggests that apathy is not just creating negative emotion that influences performance.\nAnother study used a more sensitive measure of commitment to academic achievement. Once again, participants were exposed to images of people being either apathetic or not. For half the participants, the images showed academic situations, and for half the participants, the images were of nonacademic situations. All participants then solved anagrams, which they were told were a measure of verbal fluency. For example, they might see the letter ECTAR and would have to form the word CRATE.\nAn interesting pattern of results was obtained. The prime that was not in an academic context had very little influence on people’s behavior.\nThe pictures in an academic context had an interesting influence on people’s behavior. Participants who were not strongly committed to academic achievement spent less time on the anagrams and solved fewer anagrams when they saw pictures priming apathy than when they saw pictures unrelated to apathy. Participants who were strongly committed to academic achievement actually spent more time on the anagrams and solved more of them when they saw pictures related to apathy than when they saw pictures unrelated to apathy.\nThis pattern suggests two conclusions. First, the influence of apathy is situation specific. Second, the influence of seeing apathy depends on a person’s commitment to the goal. People who are not committed to the goal interpret apathy as a signal that they should also give up. People who are strongly committed to the goal actually get even more committed by seeing apathy.\nThe researchers ran several other studies to rule out other interpretations of the study. For example, one study demonstrated that just thinking about the goal does not lead to these effects. The influence of apathy requires that people have either a low or high commitment to the goal.\nWhat does all of this mean?\nWe interpret the actions of the people around us. When we see people acting indifferently to a task, we know that they are expressing a lack of interest in that task. That lack of interest is then related to people’s existing commitment to a goal. When people are wavering in their commitment to a goal, then seeing others who are apathetic nudges them in the direction of giving up. When people are highly committed to the goal, then seeing others who are apathetic actually increases their commitment to the goal.","Research proves that engaged students learn more.\nWe have created a real-time actionable measure of student engagement coupled with personalized Tips and research-based instruction strategies (RBIS) which allow educators to immediately improve learner engagement and educational practice in accordance with learning theory research on effective teaching practices. Research is embedded into our Student Engagement Survey (SES) and is the foundation of our RBIS.\nSES was developed through a literature review, an expert panel, and pilot testing. SES reliability was tested using Cronbach’s alpha (Cronbach, 1951). This process yielded a valid and reliable overall student engagement scale and nine categories, to help assess student engagement weaknesses in time to revise an educator’s instructional approach within a semester.\nWe created a definition for each category, a best practice/instructional goal, and questions directly linked to the evidence base of educational research. For example, our cognitive category includes a question on student perception of the amount of active learning in a lesson (i.e., the process of learning through activities and/or discussion in class, as opposed to passively listening to an expert or reading).\nResearch demonstrates that active learning increases student performance in science, engineering, and mathematics (Scott Freeman, et. al., 2014). The SES question on the cognitive category linked to active learning is shown below.\nI learned through activities and/or discussion in class, as opposed to passively listening to my teacher during this class lesson.\nStrongly Agree, Agree, Somewhat Agree, Disagree, Strongly Disagree\nResearch demonstrates that active learning increases student performance in science, engineering, and mathematics (Scott Freeman, et. al., 2014). The SES question on the cognitive subscale linked to active learning is shown below.\nResearch-Based Instructional Strategies (RBIS)\nRBIS are instructional practices where research has proven their effectiveness in improving learner outcomes. We have compiled a database of RBIS which will improve the score for each question on our Student Engagement Survey, such as the active learning strategy shown below:\nActive Learning Strategy: Promote active student learning through class discussion.\nOur Tip Masters and Instructional Coaches have access on the LessonLoop platform to our RBIS database and incorporate relevant instructional strategies into their coaching Tips. We continuously review education research sites and journals to add new instructional strategies with a focus on these sources:\nOur Research Luminaries\nWe gratefully applaud the work of John Hattie and Robert Marzano who have pioneered and made possible the increased incorporation of educational research into instructional practice by synthesizing and translating a tremendous amount of complex social science into easily understandable strategies.\nBill & Melinda Gates Foundation (2015).

{"question":"How do the legal protections for YouTube under DMCA Safe Harbor provisions compare to the liability faced by online music services like Napster?","answer":"YouTube has stronger legal protections than Napster due to DMCA Safe Harbor provisions. As long as YouTube implements compliant Notice and Take-Down procedures, they are eligible for immunity against claims of infringement by users. The burden of monitoring for copyright violations rests with content owners like Viacom. In contrast, Napster faced direct liability and had to transform into a fee-based service through a settlement with the NMPA in 2001. The key difference is that YouTube's automated, passive role in user uploads qualified for DMCA protection, while Napster's system was deemed to actively enable copyright infringement.","context":["National Music Publishers' Association\nFrom Wikipedia the free encyclopedia\nPresident and CEO\nBoard of Directors\nRalph Peer, II\nIrwin Z. Robinson\nThe National Music Publishers' Association (NMPA) is a trade association for the American music publishing industry. Founded in 1917, NMPA represents American music publishers and their songwriting partners. The NMPA’s mandate is to protect and advance the interests of music publishers and songwriters in matters relating to the domestic and global protection of music copyrights.\nFirst half of the 20th century\nThe NMPA was founded in 1917 as the Music Publishers' Protective Association, seeking to end the practice of publishers having to pay vaudeville theaters for performing their music. The payola was said to have reached $400,000. The MPPA mandate went into effect May 7, 1917. Founding firms included:\n- Broadway Music Corporation\n- Joseph W. Stern & Co.\n- Waterson, Berlin & Snyder, Inc.\n- Al Piantadosi & Co.\n- Leo Feist Co.\n- T. B. Harms & Francis, Day & Hunter, Inc.\n- Maurice Richmond (1880–1965)\n- Jos. Morris Co.\n- Charles K. Harris\n- Harry Von Tilzer Co.\n- Shapiro, Bernstein & Co.\n- M. Witmark & Sons\n- James Kendis (1883–1946)\n- James Brockman\n- Kalmar, Puck & Abrahams Consolidated, Inc.

Remick & Co.\n- Church, Paxson & Co.\n- Karczag Publishing Company (Wilhelm Karczag; 1859–1923)\n- William Jerome\nSecond half of the 20th century\nIn 1966 the name of the Music Publishers' Protective Association was changed to the National Music Publishers Association. The NMPA lobbies federal legislators and regulators on behalf of music publishers and crafted guidelines for the Copyright Act of 1976.\nIn September 2001, the NMPA reached a settlement with Napster, turning the company into a fee-based service with publishers licensing music to the users. The NMPA won a judgment against peer-to-peer filing service StreamCast Networks in September 2006. In 2007, NMPA joined a lawsuit against YouTube for hosting user-generated videos containing music under copyright. The suit was dropped four years later.\nAlong with the Music Publishers Association (MPA), the NMPA has been responsible for taking many free guitar tablature web sites offline. NMPA President David Israelite asserted that \"[u]nauthorised use of lyrics and tablature deprives the songwriter of the ability to make a living, and is no different than stealing\". The NMPA also pushed for rate hikes for legal downloads of music in 2008.\nIn 2010, the NMPA represented EMI, Sony/ATV, Universal and Warner/Chappell, Bug, MPL Communications, Peermusic and the Richmond Organization in a lawsuit against LimeWire. The suit sought $150,000 for each song that was distributed.\nNMPA is a member of the International Intellectual Property Alliance, a business alliance which amongst others publishes the Special 301 Report, a controversial list of countries that the coalition of copyright holders feel do not do enough to combat copyright infringements.\nIn December 2016, the NMPA announced that it had reached an agreement to with YouTube to allow the distribution of royalties for musical works used in videos on YouTube where ownership was previously unknown.\n- Warner/Chappell Music Inc. v.

YouTube\nYouTube is a web property that enables users to upload videos, and to watch videos uploaded by others. The videos that users can upload are restricted by size (no larger than 100MB), length (no longer than 10 minutes) and format (avi, mpg, etc.). These are technical restrictions that enable YouTube to implement an automated process to efficiently process the tremendous number of videos that are uploaded each day. Using the YouTube webpage as a file uploading interface, users can upload whatever quirky video they have on their hard drive, and a short time later view the video streamed in a small embedded Flash player from the YouTube website. Humans like to do this, and YouTube has become immensely popular.\nViacom is a media conglomerate, owning such media properties as Comedy Central, Black Entertainment Network, Country Music Television, Logo, MTV, Nikelodean, Spike, Noggin, and VH1. Headed by the mercurial Sumner Redstone, Viacom is worth in excess of $28B. Of all of it media assets, SpongeBob SquarePants is probably the most emblematic of the Viacom empire. Consequently, henceforth all references to Viacom's registered copyrighted audiovisual works shall be anthropomorphized as \"SpongeBob\".\nIn November 2006, YouTube was purchased by Google Inc. for an impressive $1.65B. In order to reduce friction incurred by users uploading registered copyrighted audiovisual works not their own, YouTube struck numerous partnership deals with content providers such as CBS, BBC, Universal Music Group, Sony Music Group, Warner Music Group, NBA, and The Sundance Channel, amongst others.\nBy early 2007, Viacom had noticed that lots of fans of SpongeBob had been uploading clips and episodes to YouTube. As the fans of SpongeBob were a numerous and evasive bunch, Viacom thought it might be prudent to also engage in negotiations to license SpongeBob to YouTube. Such a license would bring revenue to Viacom, while obviating the unpleasant task of tracking down and prosecuting its base of loyal customers. However, the negotiations broke down, and on March 13 (coincidentally, the same date Germany invaded Austria in 1938), Viacom filed a $1B lawsuit against YouTube for copyright infringement.\nViacom's complaint alleges six counts of copyright infringement, consisting of three types of direct infringement, and three types of indirect infringement.\nDirect Infringement Claims\nCount I: Direct Copyright Infringement Public Performance\nA performance is considered \"public\" when the work is performed in a \"place open to the public or at a place where a substantial number of persons outside of a normal circle of a family and its social acquaintances are gathered.\" A performance is also considered to be public if it is transmitted to multiple locations at multiple times, which would be the case with audiovisual works streamed from a website.\nViacom claims that YouTube itself publicly performs the SpongeBob videos on the YouTube site and other websites.\nHowever, the court in Field v Google had no problem finding that users clicking on the Cached link did not constitute direct copyright infringement because there was no volitional act on the part of Google at that point in the process. This is the same situation; users clicking on hyperlinks cause the SpongeBob videos to be streamed to their browsers. Consequently, there can be no direct infringement of public performance.\nAs the court noted in ALS Scan v. Remarq, As to direct infringement, liability is ruled out for passive, automatic acts engaged in through a technological process initiated by another.\"\nCount II: Direct Copyright Infringement Pubic Display\nViacom claims that YouTube causes SpongeBob to be publicly displayed by showing individual images of infringing video clips in response to searches for videos on YouTube. It appears that YouTube takes a frame from videos that are uploaded to the website, and transforms that still image into a thumbnail image that is used as a hyperlink. As a result, a user searching for a video will be able to peruse a series of images and more easily locate the video that satisfies his search.\nUnlike the Public Performance claim above, or the Reproduction claim below, YouTube doesnt have a Field v Google automatic out on this one because the creation of the thumbnail is not at the users request or direction. YouTube extracts the image from the video file, transforms it, and copies it into its database, from whence it transmits it to the user in response to a search performed by the user. Even though the process of creating and posting the thumbnail is automated, the actual creation and transmission of the thumbnail was done by YouTube, and not at the direction of the user.\nSince it looks like there may be a direct infringement on this count, YouTube must rely on a defense such a Fair Use, which is easily found here under the reasoning articulated in Kelly v. Arriba Soft. In Kelly, a visual search engine searched the web for images, transformed the images into thumbnails, and copied them into its database, from whence it transmitted them to users in response to a searches performed by users. The key in Kelly was that the creation of the thumbnails were sufficiently transformative, in both appearance (reduced resolution) and use (means of identification and hyperlink, as opposed to contemplative objects). Likewise, YouTube is transforming the appearance (motion video to reduced resolution still image) and use (means of identification and hyperlink, as opposed to a slice of a moving image).\nA possible fly in this ointment is the ruling in a Perfect 10 case against Google which cuts against the fair use finding if the thumbnail compete with an existing market for such images. In Perfect 10, the porn site Perfect 10 was licensing thumbnails of its images of naked women to cell phone companies. Consequently, when Google Image Search, a visual search engine similar to Arriba Soft, transformed the images into thumbnails, the court didnt consider that transformation to be that transformative.\nHowever, it is unlikely that YouTube will have any Perfect 10 problems. First, it is highly unlikely that Viacom can show a secondary market for screen captures of random slices of SpongeBob. Second, in weighing the Relative Amount prong of the First Use test, Google was using 100% of the image, whereas YouTube is only using 1/10000 of the audiovisual work.\nCount III: Direct Copyright Infringement Reproduction\nViacom claims that YouTube is making and otherwise authorizing copies of SpongeBob into its video database. The main argument that Viacom seems to make here is that, even though the files are uploaded by users, by inserting itself into the process by converting the uploaded file from its native format into Flash, YouTube is now copying the uploaded files.\nIf this is more like the facts in Arriba Soft, then Google will need a Fair Use argument; but if it is more like Field, then there is no direct infringement, so we dont need to go there. In Arriba Soft, there was a transformation, which seems like what is going on here with YouTube high-rez picture to low-rez thumbnail andavi to flv. However, in traditional copyright analysis, the pictures transformed in Arriba Soft would probably qualify as derivative works, whereas the straight transcoding of the video files probably would not. Consequently, this is much more in line with Field, and because there is no volitional act on the part of Google at that point in the process, there is no direct infringement.As to direct infringement, liability is ruled out for passive, automatic acts engaged in through a technological process initiated by another.\" In providing access to newsgroups, RemarQ does not monitor, regulate, or censor the content of articles posted in the newsgroup by subscribing members.\nIndirect Infringement Claims\nCount IV: Inducement of Copyright Infringement\nHere, Viacom gets to try out the new theory of secondary indirect copyright infringement created in Grokster. In this case, Viacom alleges an underlying direct infringement by users who are uploading SpongeBob to YouTubes website, where SpongeBob is then publicly performed and publicly displayed. YouTube, it is alleged, induces Users to do this.\nYouTube promotes and induces uploading SpongeBob, by\n- Clear expression\n- Other affirmative steps\nIt is claimed that 1) YouTube is aware SpongeBob is copyrighted and available Nick.com, and 2) that YouTube is aware that users use YouTube to reproduce, perform and display SpongeBob. Viacom claim that the fact that YouTube knows these two things means that it intends, encourages, and induces Users to infringe SpongeBob.\nIn order to prevail on the Inducement Test, Viacom is going to have to show that YouTube is more like Grokster than Sony. Sony knew that VCRs would be used for infringing purposes, and did nothing technologically to prevent its devices from accomplishing that infringing purpose. Likewise with Grokster. However, the point the court hammered home time and again was that Grokster, with 90%+ infringing works flowing through its system and representations that it was the new Napster, had no viable purpose other than to facilitate copyright infringement.\nIf we get anything out of Grokster, maybe its a 90% litmus test for secondary liability. In any case, YouTube is clearly not in that category, either in terms of amount of infringing material in its system, or representations made to the world.\nCount V: Contributory Copyright Infringement\nIn order to prevail on a claim for Contributory Infringement, Viacom would need to show two elements:\n- 1) Knowledge - that YouTube knew or had reason to know of the infringing activity on its servers, and\n- 2) Material Contribution - that YouTube materially contributed to the infringing activity.\nIn Fonovisa, Cherry Auction was found liable for contributory infringement because evidence of knowledge was established and material contribution was found in the tight, intertwined financial and operational interactions between the auction operator and the pirates.\nIn Ellison, AOL claimed DMCA safe harbor against a claim for contributory infringement, but because the implementation of its Notice and Take-Down procedures was defective, it lost the safe harbor, and for the very same reason failed the contributory infringement test because the defective implementation imputed the Knowledge prong of the test.\nWhile YouTube does not have an Ellison problem, as evidenced by the the number of Take-Down Notices issued by Viacom and which have promptly been addressed by Google, the questiof financial gain derived from the entwinement of Google and its users will have to be addressed.\nCount VI: Vicarious Copyright Infringement\nViacom claims that: 1) users are directly infringing by uploading SpongeBob to YouTubes website, where SpongeBob is then publicly performed and publicly displayed; 2) YouTube has the right and ability to supervise Users and prevent them from infringing SpongeBob; 3. YouTube enforces copyright restrictions for partners, but withholds them for others; 4) YouTube greatly benefits from widespread infringement of SpongeBob since SpongeBob is a draw, attracting users to YouTube. The more users on YouTube, the more advertising revenue YouTube generates.\nIn the dance hall cases followed by the court in Fonovisa, operators were found liable for vicarious infringement for the direct infringement of users when the operators:\n- 1) could control the premises; and\n- 2) obtained a direct financial benefit from the audience\nOn the control issue, Viacom will point out that YouTube does have the ability to filter SpongeBob, and feature that is has offered to its partners, but withhold from non-partners conglomerates.\nOn the financial benefit derived from the draw of SpongeBob, this is much more speculative than the \"dance hall\" cases, in which without the infringing songs, there would be no paying customers. The facts don't map quite as well against Fonovisa, but as we shall see below, it doesn't reallly matter after all.\nDMCA Safe Harbors\nWhile the above discussion on three theories of indirect copyright infringement may be pedantically interesting, it is also moot since YouTube is eligible for immunity against claims of infringement by virtue of acts committed by users by the Safe Harbors provided by the DMCA. This is in fact what the crux of this case is all about who has the burden of monitoring YouTube for SpongeBob uploaded by users, YouTube or Viacom?\nViacoms lawyer confirmed this in a statement made at the Progress & Freedom Foundation: [T]he real bone of contention between Viacom and YouTube in the many months of negotiation and discussion that led up to this suit that the parties just werent able to resolve is, where is the responsibility going to lie for policing and monitoring to prevent infringement?\nThe DMCA is clear that as long as YouTube is eligible by virtue of implementing compliant Notice and Take-Down procedures, the burden rests squarely on the shoulder of Viacom."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:b49c8313-9a26-42b5-9c3b-b8f37992ccef>","<urn:uuid:a9fe87ad-2ed9-4873-b8c9-87d5a5a39fee>"],"error":null}

Once the remnant returned to the land, Zerubbabel did not insist on his lineage and take a position of royalty. Rather, he took the humble position of “governor” and it says here that he “began to build”. He owned the government of God on his people, and he was not above putting his hand to the trowel. What a Christ-like spirit! No wonder he serves, in Haggai’s fifth vision, as a type of Christ; the humble, dependant man, soon to come forth crowned with many crowns, and be displayed to the world as God’s “chosen” man!\nThe Governor Tetnai Questions the Authority to Build (5:3-5)\n3 At that time came to them Tatnai, governor on this side the river, and Shethar-boznai, and their companions, and said thus to them: Who gave you orders to build this house and to complete this wall? 4 And they said to them after this manner: What are the names of the men that build this building? 5 But the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews, and they did not make them cease till the matter came to Darius; and then they returned answer by letter concerning it.\nA Copy of Tetnai’s Letter to Darius Asking for an Investigation (5:6-17)\n6 The copy of the letter that Tatnai, governor on this side the river, and Shethar-boznai, and his companions the Apharsachites, who were on this side the river, sent to Darius the king. 7 They sent a report to him in which was written thus:\nTo Darius the king, all peace! 8 Be it known to the king that we went into the province of Judah, to the house of the great God, which is being built with great stones, and timber is laid in the walls, and this work is being carried on with diligence, and prospers in their hand. 9 Then asked we those elders: thus we said to them, Who gave you orders to build this house and to complete this wall? 10 We asked their names also, to inform thee, that we might write the names of the men that were the chief of them. 11 And thus they returned us answer, saying, We are the servants of the God of the heavens and the earth, and build the house that was built these many years ago; and a great king of Israel built and completed it. 12 But after that our fathers had provoked the God of the heavens to wrath, he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, the Chaldean, and he destroyed this house, and carried the people away unto Babylon. 13 But in the first year of Cyrus king of Babylon, king Cyrus gave orders to build this house of God. 14 And the vessels also of gold and silver of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was at Jerusalem and brought into the temple of Babylon, those did king Cyrus take out of the temple of Babylon, and they were delivered to one Sheshbazzar by name, whom he had appointed governor. 15 And he said to him, Take these vessels, go, carry them into the temple that is at Jerusalem, and let the house of God be built in its place. 16 Then came the same Sheshbazzar, and laid the foundation of the house of God which is at Jerusalem; and since that time even until now has it been in building, and it is not completed. 17 And now, if it seem good to the king, let search be made in the king’s treasure-house, which is there at Babylon, whether it be so, that orders were given by king Cyrus to build this house of God at Jerusalem; and let the king send his pleasure to us concerning this matter.\nDarius’ Search of the Archives – Cyrus’ Decree Found (6:1-5)\n1 Then king Darius gave orders, and search was made in the house of the rolls, where the treasures were laid up in Babylon. 2 And there was found at Achmetha in the fortress that is in the province of Media a roll, and therein was a record thus written: 3 In the first year of king Cyrus, king Cyrus made a decree concerning the house of God at Jerusalem:\nLet the house be built for a place where they offer sacrifices, and let its foundations be solidly laid; its height sixty cubits, its breadth sixty cubits, 4 with three rows of great stones, and a row of new timber; and let the expenses be given out of the king’s house: 5 and also let the golden and silver vessels of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that is at Jerusalem and brought to Babylon, be restored and brought again to the temple that is at Jerusalem, in their place; and thou shalt put them in the house of God.\nDarius Reissues the Decree, Makes Provision for the Building (6:6-12)\n6 Therefore Tatnai, governor beyond the river, Shethar-boznai, and your companions the Apharsachites, who are beyond the river, be ye far from thence: 7 let the work of this house of God alone; let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this house of God in its place. 8 Moreover, I give orders what ye shall do to these elders of the Jews, for the building of this house of God: that of the king’s goods, of the tribute beyond the river, expenses be diligently given to these men, that they be not hindered. 9 And that which they have need of, both young bullocks and rams and lambs, for the burnt-offerings to the God of the heavens, wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the appointment of the priests that are at Jerusalem, let it be given them day by day without fail; 10 that they may present sweet odours to the God of the heavens, and pray for the life of the king and of his sons. 11 Also I have given order that whosoever shall alter this rescript, let timber be pulled down from his house, and being set up, let him be hanged thereon, and let his house be made a dunghill for this. 12 And the God that has caused his name to dwell there overthrow every king and people that shall put forth their hand to alter or to destroy this house of God which is at Jerusalem.

Its depth was ten cubits in front of the house. 4For the house he made windows with recessed frames. 5He also built a structure against the wall of the house, running around the walls of the house, both the nave and the inner sanctuary; and he made side chambers all around. 6The lowest story was five cubits wide, the middle one was six cubits wide, and the third was seven cubits wide; for around the outside of the house he made offsets on the wall in order that the supporting beams should not be inserted into the walls of the house.\n7 The house was built with stone finished at the quarry, so that neither hammer nor ax nor any tool of iron was heard in the temple while it was being built.\n8 The entrance for the middle story was on the south side of the house: one went up by winding stairs to the middle story, and from the middle story to the third. 9So he built the house, and finished it; he roofed the house with beams and planks of cedar. 10He built the structure against the whole house, each story five cubits high, and it was joined to the house with timbers of cedar.\n11 Now the word of the Lord came to Solomon, 12“Concerning this house that you are building, if you will walk in my statutes, obey my ordinances, and keep all my commandments by walking in them, then I will establish my promise with you, which I made to your father David. 13I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not forsake my people Israel.”\n14 So Solomon built the house, and finished it. 15He lined the walls of the house on the inside with boards of cedar; from the floor of the house to the rafters of the ceiling, he covered them on the inside with wood; and he covered the floor of the house with boards of cypress. 16He built twenty cubits of the rear of the house with boards of cedar from the floor to the rafters, and he built this within as an inner sanctuary, as the most holy place. 17The house, that is, the nave in front of the inner sanctuary, was forty cubits long. 18The cedar within the house had carvings of gourds and open flowers; all was cedar, no stone was seen. 19The inner sanctuary he prepared in the innermost part of the house, to set there the ark of the covenant of the Lord. 20The interior of the inner sanctuary was twenty cubits long, twenty cubits wide, and twenty cubits high; he overlaid it with pure gold. He also overlaid the altar with cedar. 21Solomon overlaid the inside of the house with pure gold, then he drew chains of gold across, in front of the inner sanctuary, and overlaid it with gold. 22Next he overlaid the whole house with gold, in order that the whole house might be perfect; even the whole altar that belonged to the inner sanctuary he overlaid with gold.\nThe Furnishings of the Temple\n23 In the inner sanctuary he made two cherubim of olivewood, each ten cubits high. 24Five cubits was the length of one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the length of the other wing of the cherub; it was ten cubits from the tip of one wing to the tip of the other. 25The other cherub also measured ten cubits; both cherubim had the same measure and the same form. 26The height of one cherub was ten cubits, and so was that of the other cherub. 27He put the cherubim in the innermost part of the house; the wings of the cherubim were spread out so that a wing of one was touching the one wall, and a wing of the other cherub was touching the other wall; their other wings toward the center of the house were touching wing to wing. 28He also overlaid the cherubim with gold.\n29 He carved the walls of the house all around about with carved engravings of cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers, in the inner and outer rooms. 30The floor of the house he overlaid with gold, in the inner and outer rooms.\n31 For the entrance to the inner sanctuary he made doors of olivewood; the lintel and the doorposts were five-sided. 32He covered the two doors of olivewood with carvings of cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers; he overlaid them with gold, and spread gold on the cherubim and on the palm trees.\n33 So also he made for the entrance to the nave doorposts of olivewood, four-sided each, 34and two doors of cypress wood; the two leaves of the one door were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding. 35He carved cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers, overlaying them with gold evenly applied upon the carved work. 36He built the inner court with three courses of dressed stone to one course of cedar beams.\n37 In the fourth year the foundation of the house of the Lord was laid, in the month of Ziv. 38In the eleventh year, in the month of Bul, which is the eighth month, the house was finished in all its parts, and according to all its specifications. He was seven years in building it.\nThe John Calvin commentary does not cover 1 Kings 6."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:9a1f676d-70c8-4be0-a050-391c1127c68f>","<urn:uuid:3fd5f31c-9a83-4f18-93b5-b7eb705aa666>"],"error":null}
{"question":"In the context of cowpea cultivation, how do pest-related challenges differ between the field growth stage and the storage phase?","answer":"During field growth and storage phases, cowpea faces distinct pest challenges. In the field, major pests include the legume pod borer (Maruca vitrata), coreid pod-bugs (Clavigralla tomentosicollis and Anoplocnemis curvipes), groundnut aphid (Aphis craccivora), and thrips (Megalurothrips sjostedti). These pests can cause significant damage - for instance, pod-sucking bugs can cause 30-70% yield loss, while thrips can lead to complete crop failure. In contrast, during the storage phase, the main pest is the cowpea weevil (Callosobruchus maculatus), which can completely destroy stored grain within 6 months. While field pests are typically managed through IPM strategies and pesticides, storage pests are controlled through different methods such as hermetic storage technologies and freezing.","context":["S01.B1–UIUC, IPM-omics: Scalable and sustainable solutions for pest management of insect pests of cowpea in Africa\nMichigan State University as Lead University\nU.S. PIs and Institutions and Collaborating Host Countries\nLead U.S. PI\n- Barry Pittendrigh, University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, Illiniois\nCollaborating Scientists: U.S.\n- Julia Bello-Bravo (Co-PI ), University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, Illinois\nCollaborating Scientists: International\n- Dr. Manuele Tamò, IITA–Benin\n- Dr. Clémentine Dabiré-Binso, INERA–Burkina Faso\n- Mr. Laouali Amadou, INRAN-Niger\n- Dr. Ibrahim Baoua, INRAN–Niger\n- Dr. Stephen Asante, SARI, Ghana\n- Dr. Haruna Braimah, CRI–Ghana\n- Mr. Eustache Biaou, INRAB-Benin INRAN-Niger\nAnnual Technical Project Reports\nWorkplans and Technical Description\nProject Problem Statement and Justification (Brief)\nCowpea is an important protein source for tens of millions of West Africans, many of whom live on less than $2.00 per day. The greatest biotic constraints on cowpea production are insect pests, which dramatically reduce crop yields for cowpea farmers in West Africa. Pesticides and/or transgenics will not provide the long-term solutions needed to bring these pest populations under control within the economic constraints of cowpea farmers. The remaining logical strategy is Integrated Pest Management, involving a pipeline of diverse pest control solutions. Our program is focused on the development and deployment of scalable pest control solutions involving a combination of traditional pest control and deployment strategies and cutting-edge technologies, including genomics and geographic information systems (GIS) to direct the deployment of these approaches most effectively; testing and deploying cutting-edge ICT (information and communication technology) tools is also part of these solutions.\nThe major pests of cowpea in the field in northern Nigeria, Niger, and Burkina Faso include:\n- the legume pod borer (Maruca vitrata Fabricius)\n- the coreid pod-bugs (Clavigralla tomentosicollis Stal and Anoplocnemis curvipes)\n- the groundnut aphid (Aphis craccivora Koch)\n- thrips (Megalurothrips sjostedti Trybom)\nFoundational work has been initiated to understand these insect pests and has provided a good understanding of pest biology and population structure, which will help direct current and future pest control strategies. Over the past several years, our program has developed multiple promising integrated pest management (IPM) solutions for the pests of cowpeas. Up until the last phase of this project under the Pulse CRSP, there were few alternatives to pesticide sprays for many of these pest species. By the close of the Pulse CRSP project, there were several.\nOur program, termed IPM-omics, involves defining the pest problems, bringing forward appropriate solutions through a biocontrol/biopesticide pipeline, and scaling of solutions through multipronged strategies that will include farmer field flora, ICT approaches, women’s cooperatives and partnerships with small-scale industries. We have and will continue to develop online interfaces that make our outcomes easily available to other groups who can benefit from the materials and we will continue to develop approaches where we can share solutions with outsides groups that can help in the scaling and sustainability of these solutions. We will develop, deploy, and test training/technology packages/programs that will be passed-off to groups (e.g., NGOs, national/international agencies) and we will determine the potential for impact with this approach.\nAdditionally, for M. vitrata, there exists a potential biotechnology-based pest control solution. Transgenic cowpea expressing the Bt-protein Cry1Ab, effective against M. vitrata already exists, but has not been released, and may be a component of IPM in the next phase of this project. However, before transgenic Bt-cowpea can be released, there will be a need for an insect resistance management (IRM) plan and our program has already set the stage for just such a plan (Onstad et al., 2012). Bt-cowpea, even if/when it becomes available to farmers, will only control one of many pests that attack cowpea. Thus, for more immediately tangible control strategies, we have other pest control solutions at hand for M. vitrata. Additionally, host plant resistant traits are being brought forward by Dr. Phillip Roberts at California at Riverside (UC-R), some of which is being done in collaboration with our collaborators at INERA and IITA. We will continue our work with the aforementioned investigators, to bring forward such host plant resistance traits. However, over the past phase of this project we have developed multiple IPM pest control options for cowpea systems, many of which will require the next phase of research to bring them forward to larger-scale release and testing of impact.\nAlthough biocontrol agents, transgenic plants, and traditional plant breeding for insect resistant varieties are all potentially effective methods for controlling pests of cowpeas, a continued refinement of our understanding of pest populations is needed in order to integrate these and other pest control options into an overall integrative pest management (IPM) plan to maximize cowpea production in the field. IPM refers to a pest control strategy where a variety of complementary approaches are used to minimize the negative effects of pests on a given crop or cropping system. As we develop, refine and deploy IPM strategies, we must understand the important life-history parameters of these pest insects in relationship to their environment. In the past phase of CRSP we developed a more in depth understanding of M. vitrata populations and have recently determined that M. vitrata living on cowpea have a great diversity of alternative host plants and common populations – this insight (due to the use of genomics tools) is extremely important as it means all alternative host plants, for M. vitrata, can likely act as a refuge for Bt-cowpea and when releasing biocontrol agents onto alternative host plants, programs can choose the host plants that are most useful and cost effective. We term the use of genomics tools to help direct IPM strategies as IPM-omics. The IITA group has demonstrated that the release of biocontrol agents, for M. virata control, on different alternative host plants can be done with varying levels of cost-effectiveness. Thus, as we move forward over the next four years we will determine the population genetic structure of the other pests of cowpea. We have developed molecular tools to accomplish such a task (Agunbiade et al., accepted). We will also investigate the presence of these insects on cowpea and the population structure of these species, as well, if they prove to be pests causing significant economic losses.\n- Define the Pest Problems\n- Develop Approppriate Solutions\n- Scaling of Solutions\n- Capacity Building\nDefining the pest problems.\nWe expect to collect 1 year of data on the major pests of cowpeas (beyond Maruca) in terms of timing, location, and wild alternative host plants. We expect to perform initial molecular work on these populations and we expect to lay these data over known GIS data.\nWe will bring forward in the biocontrol pipeline new promising agents. We expect to bring forward biopesticides and develop tools and an understanding to take them to the next step towards commercial production (not only the technology, but a better understanding of who to work with to “pass off” the technologies to the marketplace. We also expect to have an understanding of the potential for a low-cost neem press.\nScaling of Solutions.\nWe expect to continue to perform inoculative releases of natural enemies in Niger, Burkina Faso, and Benin; we expect these to ultimately suppress insect populations. We expect to have developed and expanded on partnerships that can help us scale our solutions – in the first year (FY14) we expect the most immediate tangible results will be NGOs using our educational materials. We expect this to be the beginning of developing larger-scale in country deployment networks for our materials. Also, as SAWBO materials have been translated into languages beyond these countries, we also expect to work with and interact with NGOs and other organizations that will use these materials in their educational programs. We also expect some of our assessments on the potential for scaling will give us important insights for continued scaling.","This is a placeholder. Remove this element to add top adverts or real content\nCowpea is the most economically important indigenous African legume and most versatile African crop which feeds people, their livestock, the soil and other crops. In Nigeria it is simply known as ‘beans’. If you ask a layman in Nigeria what cowpea is, you would have a hard time finding the right answer but once you say Beans, they know exactly what you mean. There are two major varieties that are popularly known to people in southwest Nigeria; sweet beans or honey beans (ewa oloyin) and Nigerian brown beans (ewa drum).\nBotanically, it is called Vigna unguiculata and is grown in the semi-arid tropics which cover Asia, Far East, Africa, Central and South America. Cowpea has its root in Africa most especially South, West and East Africa but the name Cowpea probably emerged when it got to the United States of America and was used as an important feed for Cow.\nThere are a lot of great reasons why one should cultivate this crop; it can tolerate low rainfall and shortage of water, performs well in a wide variety of soils, and being a legume, it replenishes low fertility soils when the roots are left to decay, which makes it an ideal crop for crop rotation.\nCowpea is an annual herb which has a growth form that varies; it can be bushy, trailing, erect or climbing. Its root is a taproot which is quite strong and with many spreading lateral roots in surface soil. The stems of cowpea are striate, smooth or slightly hairy. Its leaves are in alternate pattern and are trifoliate, the colour of the leaves is dark green and shape varies from linear-lanceolate to ovate. Cowpea seeds also vary in size, shape and colour and the number of seeds per pod also varies.\nCowpea is an important economic crop, because of its various attributes such as: ability to adapt to different type of soils and suitability for intercropping, it grows and covers the topmost soil which in turn prevents erosion, all parts of Cowpea are useful even the leaves which can produce 9 times the calories, 15 times the protein, 90 times the calcium and thousands of times more vitamin C and beta-carotene of cowpea seed. Cowpea also complements a lot of cereal crops.\nClimatic condition requirements for cowpea- During growing season the temperature range for cowpea is between 280C-300C, its rainfall range is between 500-1200mm/year but some variety can thrive in areas with less than 500mm, in a nutshell this means cowpea will still survive in areas with low rainfall, although Cowpea requires enough moisture during the germinating period.\nCowpea does well on any soil but the best soil for cowpea is well-drained Sandy loam soil or Sandy soil with a soil pH in the range of 6 to 7, although its sensitive to water-logging conditions.\nCowpea is propagated by seeds.\nThe farm land should be cleared, removing shrubs and especially stubble; it can be sprayed with herbicide to stop the emergence of weed on the land, it should be plowed or harrowed for good root growth, you can also make ridges if you want. In a situation where the soil is fragile and prone to erosion one can make use of Zero tillage (this a process whereby one uses herbicides to control weeds and maintains crop residue on the soil surface)\nThe soil should be well tilled or pulverized (act of grinding to powder or dust) to ensure that the root of the Cowpea which is a taproot does not encounter any obstacle such as hardpan (a hardened layer, which happens in the soil and impairs drainage and affects plant growth), for easy penetration into the soil. The topsoil can either be ridged or left flat as seedbeds.\nCowpea does not necessarily need nitrogen fertilizer, but in cases where\nby the land has been used continuously for farming purposes, application of starter dose of Nitrogen up to 20kg/ha is good, especially when the organic matter is as low as 1%. For soils in Sudan and Sahel region in Africa, they are very low in phosphorous and potash and therefore phosphorous should be added as a single superphosphate, it does not only increase yield but also nodulation in Cowpea.\nThe inter-row and intra-row spacing depends on the type of variety of cowpea grown and the growing pattern, but generally for grain production, a plant population of 200,000 to 300,000/ha at 30 to 50cm inter-row spacing is preferred.\nThe seed should be planted at 3cm to 4cm deep. Planting should be timed in relation to the maturity period, such that the crop is harvested in bright dry weather. It’s best to sow when the soil is moist or wet, i.e. when the rainfall is reduced. The date of planting should be timed in such a way that will allow the crop to escape from periods of high pest, and harvesting to coincide with the period of dry weather because harvesting under humid cloudy weather favours pod rot.\nIf the farmer is to plant cowpea twice in a year it is advised for the first crop be planted in April and the second in late July to mid-August, if planting the same variety the older seeds should be planted not the recently harvested seeds, because seeds that are not properly dried fail to germinate well and plant stands are reduced. Also, seeds that will be planted must be sorted to make sure that they are free from insect damage that is it has no holes or wrinkles and are disease free.\nWeeds are unwanted plants which causes harm to a plant by competing for nutrients, lights, water and sunlight. Cowpea cannot easily withstand the competition of weed, especially at the early growing stage, if the weed is not well managed or controlled, it can accommodate pest and also reduce the yield and quality of the Cowpea. The type of control measure carried out, should be based on the nature of the weed. The weeding should be done 2 weeks after germination, but if a pre-emergence herbicide (this a chemical used to subdue weed) is used, the first weeding should be 4 weeks after. It is best to complete weeding by the 6th week, when the crop is already covering the ground. The two types of parasitic weeds that affect Cowpea are Striga and Alectra.\nCowpea is affected by a variety of diseases - fungal, bacterial and viral disease and these affects cowpea in different ways at different stages of growth.\nRoot Rot is caused by fungi, due to either damp weather or too much of moisture in the soil.\nStem Rot is caused by Phytophthora vignae, it occurs mainly in wetter coastal and sub-coastal areas, also occurs on waterlogged soils.\nMosaic virus affects leaves, the infected leaves are smaller than the healthy ones, and edges of the leaf are curly, generally the infected plants are more dwarfed and bushy, than non-infected plants. The disease also affects the formation of the pod.\nFusarium Wilt affects the leaves, it causes the lower leaves on one side of the plant to turn yellow, and plants infected are usually stunted and wilted. In order to control Mosaic virus and Fusarium Wilt it is s best to plant tolerant or resistant varieties. Although in the case of Fusarium Wilt root-knot nematode control practices should be followed since nematodes increase plant susceptibility to Fusarium wilt, and Cowpea is susceptible to nematodes, so it should not be planted consecutively on the same land. Other major and common diseases of cowpea are Anthracnose, Sclerotium stem, Damping off, Cercospora leaf spot, Septoria leaf spot, Scab, Bacteria blight (Xanthomonas vignicola) etc.\nSome general control measures include:\nCowpea is attacked by various Insect pests, during different phases of its lifecycle even down to storage. This is a major constraint to Cowpea production especially in West Africa, because the\nir damage can be as high as 80-100% if not well managed.\nThese are some of the major and important pests of cowpea :\nAphid (Aphis craccivora) - This insect pest does not just cause direct damage to the Cowpea, it also acts as a vector in transmitting of Cowpea aphid-borne mosaic virus. It damages the plant by sucking sap from the under surface of young leaves and stem issues, and on the pods. Sometimes it is recommended, not to control the insect pest until it is considered large i.e.when its infestation is threatening the crop, but if its few they can be easily pulled out, burnt or fed to livestock. The decision to treat is based on visual counts and the stage of crop development. Commercial pesticides are used to control aphids and the most effective are systemic pesticides, also heavy rains do reduce aphids.\nThrips (Megalurothrips sjostedti) - This pest attacks the flowering stage of cowpea. It can cause complete crop loss and in some cases where infestation is severe plants do not produce flowers or flowers appear distorted and discoloured, flower buds and flower can fall prematurely in some cases without forming any pod. This insect pest can be controlled by using insecticide or recommended chemicals.\nPod sucking bugs (Anoplocnemis curvipes): This pest attacks the pods of Cowpea. It causes a yield loss which varies from 30% to 70%\n,.They suck the sap from the green pods, causing them to shrivel and dry prematurely, which results in seed loss. It can be controlled using pesticide during podding period.\nCowpea weevil (Callosobruchus maculatus): It’s a serious Cowpea pest which affects it\nin during the storage period ,. it can completely destroy the grain within 6 months, although it’s considered medically harmless to humans. Hermetic storage (process of removing oxygen present in the atmosphere) technologies can also aid in controlling the pest. Freezing also can help control the pest.\nCowpea should be intercropped or mixed cropped and also grown as a cover crop for average yields to be attained. Cowpea should be harvested when the pods are fully mature and dry, but these pods do not mature at the same time because of its staggered flowering period. Cowpea varies in its growth habit from erect to semi erect types. Cowpea that is grown for vegetable purposes are picked 4 weeks after planting. One can either use hand or combine harvester to harvest the crop. More than 11 million hectares are harvested annually worldwide, 97% is from Africa and Nigeria harvests 4.5 million hectares annually. After harvesting, it is best to sun dry the pods and then thresh them immediately. This is important because drying reduces the moisture content of the grains\n, before storage in order to avoid the seed getting mouldy.\nAfter drying the seeds to about 10% or less and threshing the seeds, pods should be stored. It\n’ is advised to store the seeds using Hermetic storage techniques, the store should be cleaned before loading in new seed and also the seeds should be sorted before storing.\nIITA (2009) noted that there is a big market for the sale of Cowpea grains and fodders in West Africa and in Nigeria farmers who store Cowpea fodder for sale at the peak of the dry season have been found to increase their annual income by 25%. It also serves as income generating avenues for other value chain actors within the cowpea chain. Cowpea ensures returns for both the marketers and producers which in turn aids sustainability of the system.\nAbout 5.4 million of tons of dried cowpeas are produced worldwide from 11 million hectares, Africa produces nearly 5.2 million and Nigeria harvests 4.5 million hectares annually.\nNigeria is the largest producer of Cowpea worldwide\n, as 58% of worldwide production comes from this country yet Nigeria is still the largest consumer of the crop. To supplement our production, substantial amounts of Cowpea come into Nigeria from Cameroon, signifying that we are still not producing enough Cowpea to feed our nation.\nIn most parts of Nigeria Cowpea is been processed into other by products such as moin-moin, bean cake, bean soup etc. It contains 20%-25% of protein and 64% carbohydrate and has potential for poverty alleviation and malnutrition amongst the poor; also all parts of cowpea are useful, its vegetative part is good feed for cattle. This shows that all over Nigeria Cowpea is consumed in so many forms, thereby increasing the demand for cowpea.\nCOWPEA: Post-Harvest Operations culled from http://www.fao.org/\nhttps://csirsavannah.wordpress.com (PRODUCTION GUIDE ON COWPEA)\nAll data and information provided on this site is for informational purposes only. agriculturenigeria.com makes no representations as to accuracy, completeness, correctness, suitability, or validity of any information on this site and will not be liable for any errors, omissions, or delays in this information or any losses, injuries, or damages arising from its display or use.

{"question":"How do these two library systems address the needs of children and young readers?","answer":"Both library systems prioritize children's reading but in different ways. Edgefield County libraries primarily use their funds to purchase children's and teen's books, as well as programming supplies for children's activities like paper and craft materials. In Annapolis, the initiative specifically places little libraries in areas frequently visited by children and their parents, such as parks. The Annapolis project provides books in both English and Spanish, with some locations featuring dedicated children's book boxes. Both approaches aim to increase access to books for young readers, with Edgefield operating through traditional library buildings and Annapolis using accessible community locations.","context":["Edgefield County Council Chairman Dean Campbell is kicking off this year’s Chairman’s Community Project to bring more books and supplies to the three Edgefield County libraries.\nAnd you can help.\nLibraries are an integral part of every community, Campbell said, adding that in today’s electronically-connected world, libraries still play a key role for young and old.\n“Our libraries bring to citizens year-round programs, research opportunities, and reading for information and fun,” Campbell said. “The statistics show that even though our society has moved into social media and ebooks, libraries continue to grow in use.”\nIn the three Edgefield County libraries, located in the towns of Trenton, Johnston and Edgefield, patrons continue to check out books, participate in programs and use computers at an all-time high, based on patron visits and what they use the library for.\nThe funds raised through the Chairman’s Community Project, which come only from public donaitons, will be divided among the three County libraries, unless the donor designates a specific library for his or her donation.\nFunds raised through this program will be primarily used to purchase additional children’s and teen’s books, as well as programming supplies used by the children, such as paper and craft materials.\nThe local libraries are part of the Aiken-Bamberg-Barnwell-Edgefield (ABBE) Regional Library System.\nMary Jo Dawson, ABBE Regional Library Director, said the local libraries can always use “discretionary” funds, such as these, to continue to ensure the Edgefield County Library System stays current with materials.\n“Edgefield County citizens have always supported the libraries through patronage, through donations and through the hard work of the Library Board and Friends of the Library,” Mrs. Dawson said. “Our staff is dedicated to improving our libraries, and the Chairman’s Community Project is an excellent method to continue to improve our libraries.”\nWhile some state and county money goes into the local libraries, those funds are enough to fund salaries, utilities, office supplies, mobile libraries, and other administrative costs. Only a small amount is left to purchase books and materials. But the local library system continues to respond to citizen needs, Mrs. Dawson said. For example, the libraries just completed the first year of offering downloadable ebooks and audio books through the ABBE website.\nMrs. Dawson added that the free internet service at the libraries helps those citizens without computers in their homes to compete for jobs, keep current with information, and generally level the playing field for them in a growing electronic/internet-driven world.\nCampbell began the Chairman’s Community Project as an annual fundraising effort to help fill a need in the area. Past years’ Projects have included raising money for heating bills for those who couldn’t afford it to providing more funds and food for the Johnston Food Bank.\nFor those who want to contribute to this year’s fundraising Project, monetary donations, which are tax deductible, should be mailed to the Friends of the Edgefield County Library, 105 Court House Square, Edgefield, SC 29824.\nFor more information about the Edgefield County libraries, contact Lisa Lintner, Edgefield County Public Library Manager at 803-637-4025.\nThe Project runs during the month of September.","In an effort to combat lower reading rates across the country, several Annapolis groups have partnered to make free books available to Annapolis residents with 18 weatherproof little libraries.\nAnnapolis Recreation and Parks director Archie Trader said the libraries will be built between the end of August and the beginning of September in parks and communities along Mayor Gavin Buckley’s envisioned West-East Expressway, which would connect Waterworks Park to the Historic District.\nThe libraries will be roofed square boxes, not much larger than a milk crate, standing atop a wood post. Trader said the department will place the little libraries in areas along the envisioned trail that children and their parents frequent, such as parks, to encourage reading. The project is helmed by the Annapolis Rotary Club with other partners.\n“If you’ve ever been into a house where there’s no books, no magazines, no newspapers, it is a terrible thing,” Trader said. “I’ve been in houses like that, and it discourages children, or does not give children incentive, to read.”\nLeisure reading in the U.S. declined between 2004 and 2018, according to reporting from The Washington Post. The Pew Research Center reported in 2019 that more than a quarter of U.S. adults hadn’t read a book at all in 2018.\nDona Sturn, one of the founders of the Annapolis Rotary Club’s Breakfast Group and organizer of the project, said the 30 to 40 books in each little library will be free for anyone to access.\n“The objective was, how do we put an influx into our community of books so that people could keep them and build on their personal home libraries,” Sturn said.\nThe project, which Sturn said she first brainstormed two years ago, was scheduled to begin in March but was postponed because of the pandemic. Taking objects touched by others is also a new concern due to the pandemic.\nCommunity members will be advised to wipe down books before bringing them inside their homes to mitigate the risk of transmitting the coronavirus, Sturn said.\nAnne Arundel County health officer Nilesh Kalyanaraman said if community members take necessary precautions, including leaving hardcovers untouched for three days and paperbacks for one day, risk of transmission from bringing books from the little libraries into their homes is “extremely low.”\nSturn said the rotary club’s project will use Little Free Library’s brand and platform but will differ from the international organization’s mission. Little Free Library promotes the exchange of books through its 100,000 libraries in more than 100 countries, according to its website. The rotary club’s goal is for community members to keep the books they take.\nRecreation and parks installed a little library in front of Pip Moyer Recreation Center three years ago when Trader became head of the department. He said the little library is restocked every two to three months, adding that it would be restocked more often if members of the community refrained from returning books they took.\nDaily Top Stories\nThe Books for International Goodwill warehouse, founded through the Rotary Club of Parole, will provide books in English and Spanish for the program from its daily donations, which total between 1,500 and 2,000. Organization president Steve Frantzich said the warehouse had donated roughly 1,000 books of a variety of genres to the project as of Monday.\nThe Rotary Club of Annapolis is in the process of developing an app that will log which genres are most popular. If a certain genre at a certain location is especially popular, the rotary club will fill that box with more of the desired genre. Having data to draw from will also help the rotary club apply for grant money to grow the project, Sturn said.\nThe 18 little libraries will be placed at 14 different locations along the envisioned trail, including Poplar Park. Adetola Ajayi, African American community services specialist for the mayor’s office, said the city chose locations near both low-income communities and more affluent areas to encourage reading among people of different socioeconomic backgrounds. The libraries will be monitored and refilled every few weeks to ensure each maintains between 30 to 40 books.\nFour of the locations will feature both children’s and adult book boxes. Each of the boxes will be dedicated to a deceased influential member of the community, including Annapolis activist Robert Eades and young people killed by violence, Ajayi said.\nThe rotary club divided its project into three phases. In phase one, recreation and parks will install the 18 little libraries in areas along the envisioned trail. Phase two will include installing little libraries inside city community centers and in phase three the rotary club aims to extend the project to other areas of the city and county, including the grounds surrounding Walter S. Mills-Parole Elementary School, Trader said.\nThe rotary club has raised more than $12,000 of its $20,000 goal for phase one. Four little libraries for children’s books were donated, and 11 of the 14 remaining little libraries have been paid for through sponsorship from organizations and members of the community.\nSturn said it costs $500 to sponsor one of the little libraries and the rotary club is searching for sponsors for the remaining three. Each one that isn’t sponsored will be paid for by the rotary club. Sturn said at least 10 little libraries are also available for sponsorship as part of phase two."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:5e6f48b1-d50f-4f01-adcf-252b4e7f97d2>","<urn:uuid:56c91dcd-d8c2-4efb-86f1-ccfa06714926>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What is the main difference between regular brokers and direct market access (DMA) brokers in terms of order routing?","answer":"Regular brokers automatically route orders in-house before they hit the market, and may sell order flow to third parties or trade against clients' orders. In contrast, direct market access (DMA) brokers enable clients to control their order routing directly to market makers, electronic communication networks (ECNs), stock exchanges and alternative trading systems (ATS).","context":["While the era of zero-commission trading has arrived, traders are finding out the hard way that you get what you pay for. From trading outages to stuck orders with delayed confirmations to horrible order fills, the gamut of maladies gets exposed during times of major volatility.\nSeasoned traders understand that while the markets can’t be controlled, order routing can.\nRegular Brokers vs. Direct Market Access Brokers\nThere are generally two types of online brokers.\nThe typical discount brokers usually charge per trade (or now offer zero-commission equity and ETF trading). Customers are allowed to place market orders, limit orders, and a few advanced orders. While the platforms appear to have all the “bells and whistles”, they don’t allow direct order routing meaning all orders are automatically routed in-house.\nOrders are routed to the broker before they hit the market (a small, but important detail). Discount brokers may sell order flow to various third parties and/or trade against clients’ orders. Since these brokers cater primarily to long-term investors, this doesn’t present much of a problem. Investors tend to be less sensitive to execution speed and fill prices (within reason). To these investors, the commission cost-savings are worth it, however day traders require more control over their order flow. This is where direct market access brokers come in.\nDirect market access (DMA) brokers are specialized brokers that enable clients to take control of their order routing. Clients generally have access to market makers, electronic communication networks (ECNs), stock exchanges and alternative trading systems (ATS).\nTraders who utilize DMA brokers can select the destination of their trade orders or use algorithmic smart routing. DMA brokers charge a base commission per trade and/or per share in addition to passthrough fees and/or rebates depending on the chosen route and price limit of the order (i.e. maker or taker). These brokers accommodate active traders who place a high value on control, liquidity and transparency with their fills.\nTo better understand the difference, let’s look at what happens when you place a trade.\nWhat Happens to Your Order After You Click Buy or Sell?\nA complicated sequence of events occur when you submit a trade order.\nFor regular brokers, the order is delivered in-house to be worked by their own market makers or outsourced to preferred third-party broker-dealers via order flow agreements. The quality of the fills depends on inventory, liquidity and volatility. In calm markets, traders may not notice too many discrepancies with their order fills. However, in fast and volatile markets, the discrepancies can become more apparent. Limit orders may become tougher to fill completely and market orders may result in unpredictable fills. Trade confirmations may also take longer to complete.\nDirect Market Access brokers have a different process.\nTrade orders placed through a DMA broker get sent directly to the ECN, ATS, stock exchange, dark pool or market maker that the trader specifies. If routed directly to an ECN limit book, the order can also include many additional augmentations (IE: hidden and iceberg). Orders that match the limit book get filled instantaneously usually in fractions of a one-second with confirmations.\nAt this point, you may be wondering what an order route is.\nWhat is an Order Route?\nAn order route is the selected destination where an order is sent to be filled. Your order route can determine the speed with which your order does/doesn’t get filled and the price at which your order is filled.\nOrders can be sent to a national stock exchange (IE: NYSE, NASDAQ, AMEX) where market makers compete to fill your order, or to an ECN or alternate trading system (which include dark pools).\nECNs were originally created to bypass the proverbial “middlemen” like specialists and market makers, who would manually match up orders and use their own capital to provide liquidity. This gave the middlemen too much control and transparency. This ushered in the era of electronic order books where supply and demand were clearly displayed and available for the taking (as buyers would directly engage with sellers).\nAs ECNs evolved, the need to minimize transparency to avoid market impact became such a top priority that completely invisible ECNs known as dark pools emerged. These order books are completely invisible showing no bid prices, ask prices, or order size. Trades would only be shown on the time and sales after execution. Institutions used dark pools to trade massive sized blocks amongst each other. The largest ECNs and dark pools have established themselves as ATS, as they compete for order flow and liquidity.\nTypes of Order Routes\nThere are three major U.S. stock exchanges: NYSE, AMEX and NASDAQ. These exchanges also own smaller exchanges (IE: NASDAQ owns the PHLX (Philadelphia Stock Exchange) and BSE (Boston Stock Exchange).\nOrders routed to these exchanges get filled by a specialist (NYSE and AMEX) or market makers (NASDAQ).\nOutside of these exchanges, ECNs and ATS bypass the middlemen to connect buyers and sellers directly and sometimes very discreetly. The most popular ECN/ATS are ARCA, INET/ISLD, EDGE, BATS and BTRD.\nA level 2 screen enables access to these ECNs, ATS, and market makers.\nHow to Take Control of Your Order Routing\nIn order to take control of your order routing, you need to have an account with a direct market access broker.\nUsing a DMA broker enables you to pick and choose the order route for your trades. When placing an order with a DMA broker, you will have the option to choose which route you’d like to send your order to.\nYou can also configure a pre-set sequence of order routes. This comes in handy when a stock may have thinner liquidity or even in cases where a stock has tremendous liquidity (i.e. collecting rebates by routing entries on cheaper ECNs and exits on higher rebate ECNs).\nBenefits of DMA and Order Routing\nThere are many benefits of using a DMA for order routing.\nDirect routing enables much faster executions, confirmations and cancels. It also enables potentially better fills and liquidity since you may route directly to an ECN that may be showing large size on level 2. This is especially helpful during pre-market and post-market trading periods where liquidity thins out without the presence of market makers. In certain situations, speed of execution can make the difference between participating in a trade and sitting on the sidelines.\nAnother important benefit of direct routing is the ability to place “hidden” orders that are invisible on the limit books. This enables you to buy or sell larger sized orders without showing it on the order book, which can make an immediate market impact against you (i.e. displaying 10,000 shares to sell on the inside ask can cause bidders to quickly step off and sellers to step in front of your order).\nECNs also enable “iceberg” orders which let you display a smaller size while trying to sell more shares (i.e. displaying 100 shares on the inside ask but trying to sell 3,000 shares).\nRouting Fees and Rebates\nIn addition to broker commissions, ECNs charge passthrough fees for taking liquidity (i.e. buying on the inside ask and selling on the inside bid).\nECNs also provide rebates for providing/making liquidity (i.e. buying on the inside bid and selling on the inside ask), meaning you can actually get paid for your order flow.\nUsing a DMA broker enables you to configure a pre-set sequence of ECNs to be able to enter positions through ECNs with cheaper passthrough fees and exit on ECNs with larger rebates.\nDirect market access brokers are ideal for active traders who seek to be in control of their order flow and want abundant access to liquidity. In heavy volume volatile trading markets, direct access routing is akin to taking the EZ-PASS road while the rest of the commuters are stuck in bumper to bumper traffic. Traders who regularly like to trade the pre-market and post-market sessions will appreciate the additional liquidity choices having access to a multitude of ECNs while retail traders are limited to a single ATS. The difference in fills can be dramatic. The ability to hide transparency with hidden and iceberg orders can mean make a huge difference when trying to limit market impact with your orders while maximizing price executions."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:c344984d-4fe9-4083-9fbf-f7eb33f4664d>"],"error":null}
{"question":"As someone new to wilderness survival, what are the main medical supplies needed for outdoor living, and how should I assess the natural risks in my chosen camping area?","answer":"For medical supplies, you need: aspirin for headaches, paracetamol for fever, anti-vomit and anti-diarrhea medication, anti-inflammatory drugs, any personal prescription medications, various ointments for skin irritations and burns, bandages, band-aids, splints, slings, thermal blankets, medical scissors, gloves, and alcohol for disinfecting wounds. As for assessing natural risks, you must understand both natural and human-made dangers in your chosen area. Natural hazards include predatory animals like mountain lions and bears, as well as terrain-related risks such as cliffs, water bodies, areas of deadfall, and unstable ground. You should also be aware of human-made dangers, including logging areas, construction zones, and areas with previous criminal activity. Additionally, it's crucial to analyze local weather patterns and anomalies, as some locations can experience sudden fog, rain, or temperature drops even in summer months.","context":["For some, living in the woods is a mean of escaping the usual daily craziness while others see it as more of a way of life. Whether you plan on living outdoors for a few weeks or a longer period of time, there are a fair amount of factors that will need to be carefully considered. It’s no secret that planning can make all the difference, so preparing for your wilderness adventure should be done well in advance.[the_ad_placement id=”in-text-1-type-r”]\nIf, for whatever reason, you find yourself unexpectedly stranded in the woods, you obviously won’t be able to prepare. However, knowing and understanding basic survival skills will definitely make all the difference; particularly if you are faced with an emergency or challenging situation.\nWhy live outdoors?\nWhile many people look for information on how to live in the woods, there are those out there who wonder why choose to live outdoors. When you have a cosy home and a comfortable bed, why would you want to leave all of your treasured comforts behind for an unpredictable trip?\nWell, for those who enjoy the idea of giving up on just about every luxury they own, living in a natural setting can prove to be a greener lifestyle. By living off the land and consuming less than you normally would in terms of gas and other power sources, you will do far less harm to the environment.\nApart from this, your body and mind can also benefit enormously from all that fresh air and the sound of nature surrounding you. No loud noises, no traffic and no eccentric boss yelling at you. What’s not to love? It really is the ultimate getaway.\nIf you enjoy at least one planned trip, you will also find yourself that much more prepared just in case a significant disaster happens to strike or if you find yourself lost in the woods. Reading up on the subject is one thing. It’s putting the theory you’ve read into practice that makes it count for something.\nPlanning the location\nPart of learning how to survive in the woods will require that you find some sort of testing ground. In other words, you will need to look for a suitable area that is pretty much void of civilization as well as abundant in fauna and flora.\nOnce you have found the perfect spot to carry out your first wilderness experience, you will need to conduct additional research. Find out just how far away it is and how to get there. You should also find out if it is privately owned or government owned. Either way, you will need to ensure that you obtain any and all relevant documentation and permits in order to legally access the land and set up camp. If you are planning on hunting or fishing, you may need additional licenses, and you will need to familiarize yourself with the local regulations and any restrictions.\nPlanning the time frame\nThe amount of time you intend on spending outdoors will, to a large extent, determine how to endure life in the wilderness. You will need to consider the weather conditions as well as how long you plan on staying.\nIf you are planning your outdoor trip for a few weeks, your plan will differ vastly from that of a trip that lasts for a full year or even half a year. In addition, if you are planning to live outdoors during the summer, you will need different supplies compared to those needed in the winter. Of course, you should always pack clothing for all seasons, just in case!\nThe time of year will also determine the kind of hunting season that you’re in for. Not all animals may be hunted throughout the year, and there are specific regulations in place that protect them during certain times of the year.\nUnderstand potential risks\nEstablishing how to stay alive in the woods will mean that you need to take into account the very real risks that you will face. It’s not just about the weather conditions and finding a reliable source of food. You also need to consider the risk presented by certain wild animals and potentially hazardous plants.\nIf you plan on living in a location where wild cats or bears roam, you could be in for some not-so-pleasant surprises. Likewise, you will need to be able to identify dangerous and toxic plants. Not every gorgeous berry is ripe for eating! In some instances, the fruit of a plant is its best defence mechanism!\nYou will enjoy several hours of daylight, but you will also need to make it through each night. With limited light at times, you will stand a greater chance of tripping, falling, or getting hurt. When you do go out (be it day or night), you have to mind your steps. Your medical supplies will come in handy should you get injured. You should also keep some form of communication just so that you can reach out in the event of an emergency.\nMany adventure seekers understand the various risks and, for this reason, they choose to join a community instead of going it alone. When you are in a group, your chances of survival are that much greater. Not to mention the fact that you will avoid getting bored out of your wits!\nFood and supplies\nBy packing the right supplies and preparing yourself by brushing up on several skills, you will make it that much easier to survive the conditions in the woods. The list below details the main points of preparation.\nPrepare to hunt\nMeat is an important source of protein and, since you won’t find any supermarkets nearby, you will need to determine how to fend for yourself. The method of hunting that you choose will depend on the type of game you’re trying to catch. Likewise, what you hunt will depend on the season. Check out our tips and guidelines on predator hunting to prepare you for the big game.\nSince you won’t have access to a fridge or freezer, the summer can be troublesome when it comes to storing meat. In this case, you have two general options. You could hunt small game on a regular basis and basically only hunt what you plan on eating that day. Alternatively, you could hunt beyond your daily needs. Dry and salt the meat so that your meat will last without refrigeration.\nHunting smaller game like rabbits can be done using several methods like long-netting, traps, snares, or shooting of course. Larger game are usually hunted by shooting or setting up snares. Either way, it’s important to make yourself aware of the relevant laws and if any restrictions apply. Familiarize yourself with hunting techniques and make sure that you take any necessary supplies.\nFish is another excellent source of nutrients and, provided you are setting up camp near a lake or river with a healthy fish population. Like meat, fish can also be caught on a daily basis, or you can dry the fish and store it for a later stage. In many cases, it can prove highly beneficial to stock up on meat while you can. Fish might be abundant one month and not so abundant the next.\nIf you manage to get a great catch during the colder months of the year, you can easily rely on the low temperatures to help keep your fish and meat fresh without requiring actual refrigeration. Just be sure to place your meat in a secure location, so that other wild animals don’t steal it! For tips on how to lure those fishes, see our article on this important topic.\nPlants are everywhere in the woods, and many of them have the most beautiful flowers and bright berries. As delicious as they might look, not all plants are good for human consumption. It’s important to understand that, unlike animals, plants can’t flee from predators. Their only defense mechanism comes in the form of toxins. Some plants are toxic from root to tip while others are good to eat but have poisonous berries and flowers. See our important list of wild plants that you can eat for survival for more information.\nWhen planning your trip, you should research your location and conduct research on the various plants native to these parts. Find out which ones are good to eat and learn about their nutritional value while you’re at it. For example, if you come down with a cold, you might have some plants nearby that contain Vitamin C. The common cold has no cure but Vitamin C can really help soothe the symptoms until it passes.\nRemember that some plants are even toxic to the touch. Take Poison Ivy, Poison Oak and Poison Sumac for example. Both contain a particular oil that causes serious irritation and inflammation.\nApart from living off the land itself, there’s no harm in taking along some extra food supplies like popcorn, rice, coffee, tea, sugar and similar items you feel you need but won’t necessarily find in the wild. However, you should avoid overloading yourself by carrying things you like but can live without. A few canned meals can prove handy just in case you encounter a day or to off poor hunting.\nLike food, you cannot survive without water, and you can’t exactly drag a limitless supply along with you. You will need to determine how to make your drinking water safe without having to run to the store every other day.\nThe first thing you must understand is the fact that water can be home to all sorts of microscopic germs. If you consume contaminated water, you can become dreadfully ill in a matter of minutes or hours. Boiling is a highly effective way of eliminating contaminants and purifying your water. You will need to make sure that you boil your water properly. A slight boil will not do.[the_ad_placement id=”in-text-2-type-r”]\nIt needs to boil quite furiously for a few minutes before you remove the pot from the source of heat and cover. If you do not cover while the water is cooling, much of it will evaporate. If you boil your water in the evening, you will have a cool supply in the morning. Likewise, if you boil another pot in the morning, it will be cool enough by the afternoon (depending on the daily temperatures).\nAnother potential concern is the presence of larger impurities in the water like sand and dirt. Even if you cannot see the dirt particles, drinking them will mean that they will enter your digestive system and could end up in your kidneys and other parts of your body. If these deposits build up, you could face serious medical problems.\nA water filtration device is definitely a great investment. Some filters are designed for one person while others are made to filter larger quantities that accommodate families and even communities. Choose the right purification system to suit your needs.\nBeing so far from civilisation is no joke. Particularly if you get sick or injured. You will need to stock up on a few basic medical supplies just in case you or anyone in your travel group needs treatment.\nSome of the best medication to keep on hand includes:\n- Aspirin for headaches\n- Paracetamol for fever\n- Anti-vomit medication\n- Anti-diarrhoea medication\n- Anti-inflammatory medication\n- Any prescription medication you may need (like heart or diabetic medicine for example)\n- Ointments for various conditions including skin irritations, burns, muscle pains, and so on.\n- Bandages and band-aids\n- Splints and slings\n- Thermal blanket(s) or Space Blankets as they are also known\n- Medical scissors, gloves and other medical equipment\n- Alcohol for disinfecting and cleaning out wounds\nIn many cases, you can make use of various objects found in nature to prepare your food. You can use rocks to build a fireplace, and the stones will serve to protect your surroundings from fire damage. If you can’t find rocks, you can dig a hole and build your fire in the ground to make a kind of fiery oven.\nTo purify your water, you will need a pot with a lid, and you will need cups, plates or bowls and some kind of cooking and eating utensils too. Each person will need their own set of eating utensils, of course, but you won’t need as much as you might think. Consider items that will serve a dual purpose or multipurpose like a Swiss Army Knife. Not only can you use your knife for meal preparation, but it can also be used when you are setting up camp and in so many other situations.\nThe type of shelter you choose will largely be determined by the weather and your surroundings you will likely encounter. For example, if the weather you are likely to experience is bound to be fairly harsh, you will need a durable form of shelter. There are different kinds of tents, and each one is suited for different weather conditions.\nWhile some lightweight varieties can withstand a degree of wind and rain, there are those that are tougher and better suited for snow and heavier downpours. You might enjoy investing in a tent as well as an additional tarp. Eating under the tarp will prove far more pleasant than having to hide inside your tent when dining in the rain.\nThe base of your shelter needs to be durable and waterproof like the rest of your tent. Make sure that you take a repair kit, extra pegs and ropes for securing your tent just in case it becomes damaged or ropes snap.\nLike shelter, you will also need to choose your wardrobe very carefully. Items that you will need to include are:\n- Summer clothes\n- Waterproof jacket and pants\n- Winter clothes\n- Accessories like hats and gloves\n- Tough, waterproof boots\n- Underwear and socks\n- Regulation gear like an orange jacket so that you can be easily spotted by other people in the area and prevent hunting accidents.\nApart from these main categories of items that you will need to take along, you will also need several miscellaneous items. Firstly, you will need some kind of pillow and a sleeping mat. If you plan on living outdoors for a longer period of time, you might want to invest in a durable air mattress and pump. You will also need blankets. Don’t forget to take extra just in case they get wet.\nYou will need to keep your fire going for making food, heat, and light. You will, therefore, need plenty of matches and perhaps some tinder and flint. Waterproof matches are the best bet of all for obvious reasons.\nFor extra light, you should pack a flashlight or two along with extra batteries. If possible, flashlight with a solar charger might prove better in the long run.\nIt always helps to keep things like rope, waterproof containers or bags and basic tools like a small axe for chopping firewood.\nTake along a few good books and other forms of entertainment like a chess board, a deck of cards and similar social games that can be played when you’re not out hunting, exploring, or taking a nap.\nDon’t forget about the importance of hygiene! Take plenty of soap, toothpaste, shampoo, toilet paper, and other toiletries along for the trip. Don’t bother with such items as make-up, perfume and aftershave. In fact, it’s best to avoid perfumed substances if you want to keep bugs at bay!\nTake some bug spray to repel insects like mosquitoes and don’t forget to back sun protection lotion with a high SPF as well as an After Sun lotion or gel just in case you do get a nasty burn.\nTake along a basic guide to first aid as well as a forestry guide book. What you read today, you might not remember after a week or a few months. Having these resources on hand will prove advantageous at some time or another.\nTake a break from technology\nEnduring life in the forest might seem tough for those who are at least somewhat dependent on their phone, computer, the internet, or TV. Technology is a luxury that we can all do without when trying to survive in such conditions. You cannot simply recharge your phone or tablet whenever you like, and your reception might not even be that great. Not to mention trying to drag a TV along wherever you go!\nTake this opportunity to cut those strings and release yourself from your tech dependence. Sure, as mentioned earlier, you should definitely keep some kind of means of communication but this does not mean that you should ignore your surroundings while you surf the web or chat to friends. This defeats the whole point of getting away. In addition, it’s great practice just in case you find yourself in a situation where you’re unexpectedly stuck in the woods without access to such luxuries.\nFor those travelling as a group, you can really benefit by investing in radio communication devices like Walkie-Talkies. That said, they should only be used as needed since you will consume batteries. If possible, get a solar power outlet to charge various small devices and batteries.\nPrepare to have fun!\nOnce you learn how to live in the woods, you might be reluctant to return to your usual city life! Living in beautiful natural surroundings can be challenging but it can also be extremely rewarding. If you are planning such a trip, make sure that you prepare properly in advance and be sure to let at least one friend know where you are headed and when you plan on returning.[the_ad_placement id=”in-text-3-type-r”]\nIf your trip is scheduled to continue for an extended period of time, you might want to check in with a particular friend or family member back home on a regular basis. This way, should you run into trouble, they will know and they can alert the relevant authorities.","The five elements for mitigating risk are essential principles for planning your next backpacking adventure. Backpacking season brings an increase in news reports about disappearances and accidents on the trail. Recently, there was a report from California discusses the disappearance of an experienced hiker at a campsite in the Bristlecone Pine Forest. She was later found alive after four days. The report reveals that she had to flee her location due to a threatening person. Another story relates to the discovery of the body of a missing person on the Snake River in Wyoming. Backpacking and hiking are enjoyable outdoor activities to experience nature. However, they also have inherent risks. It is vital to develop a risk assessment and reduction plan. The following principles can help you build your risk mitigation plan.\n1. Assess the level of wilderness experience and field skills of yourself and others\nA person’s lack of experience and skills backpacking in the wilderness should indicate that they are a risk to themselves and others. One way to reduce that kind of risk is to take a more experienced partner on the trail. Their experience and skills will offset your weak areas. For example, I am not proficient in wild edibles and medicinal plants. If I attempt to eat something on the trail that may look edible, the results could be tragic. Yet, if I go on the trail with someone who has more experience in that area, I will learn more about how to recognize safe plants, making the hike more safe and enjoyable. Moreover, it is always better to go on the trail with a partner regardless of your experience or skills.\n2. Know the level of health and physical fitness of yourself and others\nIt is vital to know your level of health and physical fitness. Health and physical fitness play an important role in determining the class of trail one should be hiking. For example, a person with some health considerations may be limited to hiking fully developed trails versus a minimally developed one.\nAltitude and elevation also will influence decisions about where to go backpacking when one’s level of health or physical fitness is a concern. It may not be wise to take someone on a trail above 8,000 feet in the Rocky Mountains if they have a respiratory issue. Furthermore, someone who has suffered a previous heat injury should probably not be backpacking in the desert Southwest’s summer heat.\n3. Understand the natural or human-made dangers of the area of activity\nMany stories about people’s negative experiences in the outdoors reflect a lack of awareness of the risks present in that area. One type of natural hazard involves predatory animals, such as mountain lions or bears. Other inherent threats are those relating to the terrain, such as cliffs, water bodies, areas of deadfall, or unstable ground. Human-made dangers are those of human activity. These can comprise logging areas, areas of construction, or even previous criminal activity. There seems to be an increasing number of stories about backpackers being confronted by criminals on their hike. Thus, it is vital to know the criminal activity of your planned trail.\n4. Analyze the local weather and weather anomalies of the area of activity\nWeather is a contributor to outdoor risks. There are reports of sudden fog, rain, or dropping of temperatures even in the summer months in some locations. It must be remembered that some local weather patterns cannot be found in a national or local forecast. The people who live in the area can provide useful information on local weather activities such as afternoon thundershowers. Analyzing the local weather traits will help make decisions about what to put in your backpack, such as rain gear or a light fleece jacket. Thankfully, technology, like weather applications on your smartphone, helps sensitize you to weather dangers arising on your hike.\n5. Identify the level of access to emergency help in the area of activity\nSometimes people, who go outdoors, do not take into account the availability of emergency help. It is essential to have a good understanding of what kind of emergency help is available. Additionally, it is crucial to know how to access emergency help in your planned area of activity. The importance of knowing how to contact emergency help is a critical part of your outdoor planning.\nFor example, one of the areas near me does not have a large number of park rangers. They tell you when you come into the park that most emergency help will be by airlift. They do not have the personnel or transportation available to go to your aid if you call for help. Thus, an expensive life flight to a local hospital awaits, should you dial for assistance. That kind of information influences your activity and what you have in your gear.\nSome wilderness areas have no cell phone access. How will you get help in an emergency?\nIt is recommended that you develop a first-responder contact card. This card should have contact information for park rangers, first responders, and area hospitals. You should include emergency radio channels on the card if you are carrying a handheld radio with you.\nRisk reduction is an important skill to develop and exercise for those who love hiking and backpacking. Your risk reduction plan has its limitations. Yet, without one, you may find your activity being less than enjoyable. Once you have identified the risks for your planned wilderness adventure, then develop and implement measures to reduce it. Your risk reduction plan should take into account the kind of activity (Mission), local and area dangers (Enemy), time of day, month or day (Time), the people involved (Troops), location (Terrain), and accesses to emergency help (Civilian Considerations). Once you have your risk mitigation plan complete, give a copy to those you will be making your communication checks while you are on the trail. As you plan your next backpacking adventure, remember these principles for reducing the risks."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:445f6ff5-c589-4c58-b7a7-a362a9612c12>","<urn:uuid:de5b931e-dcb2-4892-8f13-b938ba11d8f9>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do safety footwear protection ratings (S1-S5) compare to electrical protection classifications (EH, SD, CD) in terms of their safety coverage?","answer":"Safety footwear ratings S1-S5 focus on physical protection features: S1 covers antistatic, energy absorption and oil resistance; S2 adds water penetration prevention; S3 adds midsole penetration resistance; and S5 provides leak-proof protection with midsole penetration resistance. In contrast, electrical protection classifications focus on specific electrical hazard protection: EH shoes impede electricity flow, SD shoes dissipate static electricity, and CD shoes conduct static electricity faster for highly flammable environments.","context":["How to Choose Safety Workwear and Shoes\nThere are various factors to consider when looking at health and safety gear. For people working onsite or in a physically demanding environment, taking care of yourself and your team is very important. Safety is a major concern, especially when working with weighty machinery, using power tools and cutting heavy-duty materials.\nRory from Premier Handyman tells us why choosing safety workwear is crucial for his team\n“At Premier Handyman, the work we undertake varies everyday, from laying flooring to replacing taps to hanging pictures. The correct safety workwear is essential to ensure a safe work environment for myself and my employees. We use safety workwear on a daily basis, from safety glasses, shoes and ear plugs to high visibility jackets, knee-pads and respirators, thus why we like to choose a brand which provides quality along with durability.”\nChoosing safety clothing and equipment is a three-stage process:\n- Assess the risks associated with the job\n- Evaluate those risks in detail. i.e. ask yourself what are the potential dangers? How serious are the consequences?\n- Implement measures to reduce the identified risks\nAfter completing a risk assessment of the environment, you’ll need to decide which safety clothing and equipment is required. For choosing the most effective workwear and footwear, you’ll need to understand what Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is.\nWhat is Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)?\nSimply put, Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is apparatus that protects you against health and safety hazards at work. It includes items such as safety helmets, eye protection, ear defenders, gloves, high-visibility clothing, safety footwear and safety harnesses. It’s essential for ensuring a safe work environment, and protects you and your team from risks, such as implications to:\n- The body, e.g. from fluctuating temperatures\n- The hands and feet, e.g. from falling materials\n- The skin, e.g. from encountering hazardous materials\n- The eyes, e.g. from shards of material and corrosive liquids\n- The lungs, e.g. from breathing in pollutants\nChoosing the right protective gear and equipment can be a challenge. Whether you’re looking to buy workwear for your business or yourself, the best place to start is by selecting the best PPE according to the job. Be sure to choose the equipment carefully and train employees to use it correctly.\nWhen selecting PPE, consider the following:\n- Choose items that are PPE compliant\n- Select equipment that suits the users – consider the size, weight and purpose of the PPE\n- Make sure different PPE items work when utilised together, e.g. safety glasses and a respirator\n- Ensure that PPE is used correctly – this may require training\nVikkie from The Carpenter’s Daughter shared why she thinks it’s important to use PPE, even for DIY projects:\n“On every DIY project I tackle and share, I always weigh up the risks and wear appropriate safety work-wear so that I lead by example. A couple of years ago when I also used YouTube to learn how to tile my own kitchen, I hadn’t seen anyone wearing gloves, so I didn’t either. Being new to tiling, little did I know that grout has cement in it and I’d slightly burnt a couple of my fingertips, which were very painful where they were placed.\nI now make sure I read all substance warning labels and take them seriously. But generally, I find myself wearing my respirator, goggles, gloves and knee pads more than anything else. I also like to make sure I keep my arms and legs covered for extra protection and think my Dickies overalls are perfect for this.”\nHow to Care For & Maintain PPE\nFor hard hats / helmets:\n- Regularly clean your hard hat using warm water and soap, and allow it to air dry\n- Be sure to replace the helmet if it’s cracked, dented or has taken a heavy knock\nFor eye protection:\n- Clean eyewear with mild soap and water. Store goggles in a clean dust-proof case to avoid scratches and damage\n- Replace safety glasses if they’ve been bent, cracked or impair vision\nFor hearing protection:\n- Clean earmuffs with a damp cloth after use, store in a safe area, and replace padding when they lose resilience\nFor respiratory protection:\n- Follow the manufacturer’s instructions when cleaning respirators\n- Asses the condition of the respirator – look for holes, cracks, deteriorations and anything else that may interfere with efficiency\n- Safety store respirator to protect it from dust, chemicals, moisture, and extreme weather conditions\nFrom construction workers and electricians to mechanics and gardeners, safety in the workplace is vital. Whether you’re on a construction site or doing general maintenance in your garden, consider using the following safety workwear:\n- Helmets to protect your head from injuries\n- Safeguard your eyes with suitable eye protection\n- Use appropriate earmuffs or earplugs if you work with or near noisy machinery\n- Gloves are essential for protecting your hands against injury\nWorkwear for construction workers & electricians:\n- Head protection: use a hard hat to protect your head from falling objects or a bump to the head\n- Eye and face protection: use safety glasses to protect your eyes from foreign objects getting into the eyes when cutting, grinding, welding or nailing\n- Foot protection: wear safety work shoes or boots to reduce the risk of slips, trips and falls that can cause severe injuries\n- Hand protection: wear the correct safety gloves for each job and ensure they fit snugly\n- Coveralls: wear an overall on top of the usual shirt and trouser combination to protect your body and clothing from fluids and grease\n- Work jackets: they are typically waist-length and used to keep mechanics warm\n- Work trousers: like the button-down shirts that make up a traditional mechanic’s uniform, trousers are available in various styles, including dress and jeans. Trousers are usually closed via a front zipper\n- Shirts: wear a long, short or button-down shirt, made from a breathable material such as cotton and synthetic fibres\n- Gloves: mechanic’s gloves aren’t too thick and feature rubber grips on the palm, allowing technicians to safely hold their tools safely while working\n- Gloves: gardeners are constantly using their hands, so use durable gloves to protect your hands from cuts and abrasions, as well as extreme weather\n- Trousers: choose a tough pair of utility trousers, featuring pockets and loops that gardeners need to hang their tools on. Buy a pair with knee panels to provide protection when on weeding duties\n- Work jacket: select a body warmer or gilet to protect your mid-section, while giving the arms complete freedom to move\n- Wellingtons: perfect for walking on muddy pathways and enjoying impromptu excursions into the great outdoors. They are easy to clean and provide lower leg protection from bushes and thorns\n- Knee pads: great for jobs that require you to kneel, as they prevent sticks and stones from digging into your skin\nThe required safety workwear and accessories will differ between trades, so make sure the type of PPE you use is adequate for the job in hand. Although PPE is created to keep your team safe and protected at work, it’s good to consult with them about which items of clothing they feel will help them move and be comfortable in, as they may have a different perspective about requirements.\nSafety workwear for all weather\nThe British climate can be unpredictable, so before commencing with a project consider the time of year and what weather to expect throughout the duration. For example: a project happening during the summer, you can expect warmer, hotter weather than in the spring and autumn when rain is more likely. In wintertime, temperatures drop significantly, and the early darkness can cause low visibility, which will all need to be considered.\nFor dry and hot weather:\n- For summer safety gear, consider our hard-wearing work shorts and t-shirts, with added breathability for keeping cool and comfortable whilst working\n- Explore our protective lightweight jackets, as an excellent outer layer in spring or early autumn during mild conditions\nFor wet and cold weather:\n- It’s a good idea to explore our dependable hi-vis safety workwear and clothing, such as jackets, trousers, vests, and more for maximum protection\n- For the best clothes for working outside in winter, start with our range of functional thermals, designed to wick sweat away from your body and keep you dry and comfortable\n- Expect rain sporadically throughout the year, so buy waterproof essentials like our quality work trousers, jackets and suits\n- Continue to layer-up with our superior comfort fleece tops and thick work coats and jackets, which are available with extra padding\nTypes of safety shoes\nAs a minimum safety standard, all safety footwear should have an impenetrable sole, uppers with a steel toe-cap, and conform to EN ISO 20345. Safety footwear are available in the following styles:\n- Light, low-cut leather safety shoes for jobs that involve climbing\n- Regular safety boots for heavy duty work\n- High-performance rubber safety wellingtons for protection against harsh substances, chemicals and fluids\n- Composite safety shoes and boots that are similar to steel toe cap boots but are made out composite material\n- Metatarsal safety shoes that are similar to composite and steel toe shoes but also include a protective plate that covers the metatarsal part of the foot. They offer protection to the upper area of the foot between the bottom of the shin and toes\nWhen considering safety footwear, there are six protection ratings that are applied. Here’s what they mean:\n|SB||Safety basic – toe protection|\n|S1||Antistatic, energy absorption & oil-resistant|\n|S2||Prevents water penetration|\n|S3||Midsole penetration resistance|\n|S5||Leak-proof with midsole penetration resistance|\n- ESD safety shoes: ESD stands for electrostatic discharge. These shoes protect the wearer from static charge items, decreasing risk and increasing safety.\nThe type of safety shoes or boots that should be used depends on the nature of the work, how often you’ll be wearing them and for how long. Consider the following safety shoes and boots for different trades:\n- For construction workers: choose a durable safety work boot to protect your feet when moving heavy materials and other risks located on-site\n- For mechanics: durable, oil and slip resistant work boots with a sturdy sole are best for garage environments\n- For electricians: safety boots with a composite toe are the best work boots for electricians\n- For gardeners: steel toe-cap safety wellingtons are a great option for garden work\nAnd if like John, you have a passion for woodturning, then you should check out his video below where he explains how to prepare your own blanks and the importance of safety workwear when using a chain sword. John is wearing Dickies Eisenhower multi-pocket trousers, Dickies Safety Helmet Kit and Dickies Liberty Safety.\nChoosing the right workwear doesn’t have to be complicated, as long as you focus on protecting yourself and your workers from potential dangers in the workplace. Provide employees with equipment for additional protection, understand that the weather will affect how you should dress, and make sure you buy durable safety workwear from a reputable, authentic brand like Dickies.","What type of payments do you accept? - We accept Visa, MasterCard, Discover and America Express credit cards issued in the USA.\nWhat kind of warranty do you offer? - We offer a 6 month warranty for manufacturer defects.

Please see chart below:\nB or N - narrow width\n|A or N - narrow width\nB or M - medium width\nC or W - wide width\nWhat's the difference between Electrical Hazard, Static Dissipative, and Conductive Safety Shoes?\nThe 3 distinct types of conductivity found in Safety Shoes are Electrical Hazard (EH), Static Dissipative (SD), and Conductive (CD). These are tested according to the ASTM (American Society of Testing and Materials) standards F2412-05 and F2413-05.\nEH Electrical Hazard Safety Shoes\nThe differences between these classifications of Safety Shoes are that Electrical Hazard shoes are designed to impede (reduce significantly) the flow of electricity through the shoe and to ground, thereby reducing the possibility of electrocution. Electrical Hazard Safety Shoes will have an \"EH\" clearly visible on the ASTM label sewn inside the safety shoes. (ASTM F2413-05 Sec. 18.104.22.168) Only safety shoes can have the Electrical Hazard designation. (ASTM F2413-05 Sec. 5.5.1),\nIMPORTANT: Electrical Hazard shoes are not designed to be the primary source of protection in an electrical hazard environment. They are designed to be only a secondary source of protection in an electrical eazard environment, and that is clearly stated in the ASTM standards for Electrical Hazard Safety Shoes. (ASTM F2413-05 Sec. 5.5.4 & Sec 5.5.2).\nCD Conductive Safety Shoes\nConductive Safety Shoes are designed to \"conduct\" static electricity through the shoes and into ground. Conductive Safety Shoes are similar to Static Dissipating Safety Shoes because both are designed to dissipate static electricity. Conductive Safety Shoes (CD) dissipates static electricity much faster and more completely than Static Dissipating Safety Shoes (SD). The reason is that Conductive Safety Shoes are worn in environments that are highly flammable and explosive, which means that reducing the possibility of a static spark or discharge, is critical to the safety of not only the employee, but the other employees in the immediate area and others in the vicinity of the explosive area. According to the ASTM Standard, Conductive (CD rated) Shoes must be Safety Shoes (ASTM F2413-05 Sec. 5.4.1), and the Conductive Safety Shoes have a \"CD\" clearly visible on the ASTM label sewn inside the safety shoes. (ASTM F2413-05 Sec. 22.214.171.124).\nSD Static Dissipating Shoes\nStatic Dissipating Safety Shoes are designed to dissipate (reduce) the amount of static electricity build-up on your body. Unlike Electrical Hazard Safety Shoes, Static Dissipating Shoes can be either safety toe or non-safety (or soft-toe). Static Dissipating shoes actually conduct static electricity through the linings and insole, cement, and outsole and into ground. Static Dissipating Safety Shoes and non-Safety Shoes have a \"SD\" clearly visible on the ASTM label sewn inside the safety shoes. (ASTM F2413-05 Sec. 126.96.36.199),\nTo accomplish Static Dissipating environments consistently, several things must be controlled. First, you cannot add any kind of insole to the shoe, except a specially designed Static Dissipating insole. If a non-Static Dissipating insole is added to the shoe, static electricity will not flow through the insole. When the insole becomes non-conductive; the shoe will not dissipate static electricity. Also, the floor and sole of the shoe must remain clean and free of dust and other foreign matter to maintain good contact between the sole and the floor. This allows the static electricity to dissipate, or flow through the sole and into ground. (This assumes that floor is \"grounded\" and static electricity will flow through to the floor material.)\nStatic Dissipating Shoes and Safety Shoes are worn in mainly two types of environments: Computer component handling facilities and nuisance static electricity environments, like plants where the process and machinery create a large static electricity field in the manufacturing process. Typically, this field creates a build-up of static electricity on employees working in the environment, and then discharges when the employee touches metal that goes to ground or has a neutral or less charge than the body has. This static discharge \"shocks\" the person, creating momentary discomfort and annoyance. Static Dissipating shoes can help this situation, but the floor, mats, and machinery, also need to be grounded to reduce the static electricity field in the environment.\nImportant: Because Conductive Safety Shoes (CD) conducts electricity, employees wearing these shoes must avoid wearing Conductive Safety Shoes in Electrical Hazard (EH) environments. Obviously, this could be a very dangerous situation.

{"question":"I work in corporate security and need to understand why email retention policies are particularly important for healthcare and financial services companies. Can you explain the specific regulatory requirements?","answer":"In healthcare, HIPAA requires companies to encrypt health data in transit and storage. For financial services, FINRA has issued guidance requiring the archiving of text messages and digital communications for records retention purposes. These policies help ensure companies meet data protection requirements and avoid non-compliance risks. Without proper retention policies, companies risk data leakage and regulatory violations when employees communicate with each other or clients using text messaging or chat apps for business purposes.","context":["When it comes to essential security requirements for businesses, the electronic communications policy is decidedly unsexy. A painstakingly detailed document is rarely read in full outside of the employee onboarding process, and often languishes, unchecked, in the abyss of corporate paperwork.\nThat said, an electronic communications policy serves as the foundation for basic internet safety guidelines, business instant messaging practices, email standards, and general corporate policy for today’s digital workplace. Without a solid policy in place, businesses open themselves up to a bevy of security issues, potential employee mishaps, and sometimes serious legal challenges.\nWhat does a good policy look like?\nIn general, an electronic communications policy needs to be comprehensive — meaning it covers all forms of electronic communication — and well-defined.\n“It’s important to identify scope and purpose to help employees understand what you mean by electronic communications, and why this policy exists,” said Heidi Shey, a senior analyst with research firm Forrester. “Does this only apply to email? What about VoIP calls, or texting, chat and messaging apps? Without a well-thought policy, everyone makes their own assumptions about what is acceptable use, and people may not know what they don’t know about risks to the enterprise with using different forms of electronic communications.”\nShey said it’s also important to avoid making assumptions about the reader and to use clear, concise language that employees understand. A policy document should also provide a date for when it was last updated and a contact person for employees to go to if they have questions or concerns.\nThe most comprehensive, well-defined communications policies are usually written by a team of experts within an organization, spanning the departments of human resources, legal, audit and compliance, and information technology.\n“That’s because the document isn’t about any one of these things individually,” said Sean Pike, program VP for IDC’s security products group. “It’s about reducing risk throughout the business.”\nAs far as terminology goes, the common bullet points in an electronic communications policy include:\n- Guidelines on the appropriate use of email and other communication platforms\n- Retention policies\n- Proper internet usage\nThe policy should also contain clear language about prohibited uses of email, messaging platforms, internet and other electronic communications, as well as consequences and disciplinary actions for policy violations.\nThe security rationale\nWhen it comes to email usage, the communications policy should set standards for appropriate content to send under the company banner, as well as rules for acceptable use and behavior, like avoiding personal messages and maintaining professionalism.\nPrecise guidelines are also needed to ensure that certain types of information remain within the confines of the business and only reach the eyes of intended recipients.\n“The drivers are are often risk or regulation,” said Pike. “Accidentally leaking corporate crown-jewel intellectual property via email could be devastating, and accidentally emailing unencrypted personally identifiable information of customers could also create challenges.”\nProper email usage is also key to preventing phishing scenarios. Corporate employees should be well-trained to avoid email that looks suspicious, and up-to-date anti-phishing training should be part of the email regimen in an effort to reduce security risks.\nPolicies surrounding email retention are needed to help companies ensure that they meet various data protection or retention requirements for relevant regulations, explained Shey. In healthcare, for instance, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) requires health care businesses to encrypt health data in transit and storage.\nFor financial services, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) has issued guidance for social media and digital communications that requires archiving text messages for records retention purposes.\n“This is so employees who are communicating with each other or clients using text messaging or a chat app for business purposes don’t put the company at risk of non-compliance and possible data leakage,” Shey said.\nBoth usage and leakage are important for internet guidelines as well. For the most part, companies want to make sure that users only go to approved web resources to reduce the risk of viruses or downloading unapproved software. Some companies even have policies that dictate behavior on an employee’s personal social media accounts to reduce brand risk.\nThe exact details of a communications policy will vary depending on an organization’s precise needs, but Pike noted that modern policies have trended toward being longer and more specific to ensure that every calculable risk is managed.\n“There are plenty of ways to be destructive with communication, whether that’s leaking information — accidentally or purposefully — or creating hostility toward a coworker,” said Pike. “At the end of the day, these policies are in place to establish the way companies believe employees should act, or must act, given corporate culture or legal and regulatory obligations.”\nIf you need a place to start in creating or updating your company’s policies, these templates from our sister site Tech Pro Research (a paid resource) can help:\n- Electronic communication policy\n- Internet and email usage policy\n- Electronic Retention Policy\n- Social media policy\n- Information security policy\n- Brazilian government to create national information security policy\n- Leaked: Facebook security boss says its corporate network is run “like a college campus”\n- Australians will trade privacy for security if you frame it right\n- How the White House’s new policy for reporting security flaws will affect businesses (TechRepublic)\n- Protect your data assets when disposing of old storage media (TechRepublic)\n- Geek Squad’s FBI informant case illustrates need for good IT policies (TechRepublic)\n- All apps, including WhatsApp, must maintain 'sanctity' of personal communication: Prasad\n- Govt to discuss proposed India e-commerce policy on Thursday\n- What's Section 230?

{"question":"How do I create a Smart List in the iOS 15 Reminders app and what filters can I apply to organize my tasks?","answer":"To create a Smart List in Reminders, open the app and tap 'Add List' in the bottom right corner. Enter a list name, select a color, and tap 'Make into Smart List'. In the Filters screen, you can apply five different types of filters: Date (specific or relative ranges), Time (morning, afternoon, evening, night), Location (home, work, car), Flag status, and Priority levels (High, Medium, Low). After selecting your desired filters, tap 'Done' twice to create the Smart List. Your new Smart List will appear at the bottom of your existing Reminders list.","context":["Apple is soon going to release the next iteration of its mobile operating system – iOS 15 that’s bringing refinements to Notifications, Weather, Safari, Find My, Spotlight, Photos, and FaceTime. One of the native apps that are getting some new features is the stock Reminders app as it now gets the ability to create “Smart Lists” so that you can group reminders inside different categories. In this post, we’ll explain what Smart Lists inside Reminders are all about and how you may use them on iOS 15.\nWhat are Smart Lists?\nThe Reminders app on iOS already lets you divide your actions like work, bills, chores, and more into different lists or groups. With Smart Lists, users can customize these lists to show up based on a specific condition that you’ve set for your reminders. You can choose to add conditions based on location, date, time, priority, and flag so that you’re only shown those reminders that you need to fulfill when you are required to.\nPrior to this, Apple allows users to categorize their reminders into pre-defined lists – Today, Scheduled, All, Flagged, and Assigned to me.\nSmart Lists thus lets you prioritize your reminders based on your present conditions and you can customize it to show reminders for when you’re at home, for when the weekend comes, for a particular period of a day, or for when you’ve selected a priority or flag filter. Each of these filters will offer even more customizability and you can assign multiple conditions to group your reminders into.\nTo give you an example, you can create smart lists to add reminders and tasks that are:\n- Due on a certain date/time like next month, tomorrow\n- Completed on a certain date/time like last week, two months ago\n- Shared with others you know\n- Postponed several times in the past\n- Contain specific words and tags\n- Set the highest in terms of priority\n- Estimated to be complete within an hour, day, or so on\nYou can customize your lists by combining two or more of the aforementioned conditions for greater control over how to view them.\nThe new Smart Lists feature is basically an extension of Tags that are new on iOS 15. Although Tags have existed inside task-management apps over the years, this is the first time Apple has incorporated them in one of their apps. Tags allow you to manage your reminders and tasks with user-defined tags across all Apple devices.\nWhen you create tags, they’ll appear inside the ‘All Tags’ tab under ‘Tags’ along with all the other tags you’ve created in the app. You can also view the newly created tags under the ‘My Lists’ section inside Reminders. This is where Smart Lists comes in as the Tags you create can be directly turned into a Smart List. Users can create a Smart List that has been customized with conditions based on tags, location, date, time, priority, and flag.\nHow to Get Smart Lists on iOS\nSmart Lists is an option available on iOS 15, which is currently in beta. If you’ve enrolled in the iOS beta program, you can use the new feature inside Reminders directly or you can wait till Apple releases the stable build of iOS 15 for everyone worldwide.\nEven if you’re running iOS 15, the Smart Lists option won’t be enabled inside your iPhone by default. Instead, you’d need to enable it inside iOS by first opening the Reminders app and then tapping on the ‘Upgrade’ button adjacent to the ‘My Lists’ section.\nOn the next screen, tap on the ‘Upgrade Now’ button to enable Smart Lists for your Reminders app.\nHow to Create Smart Lists in the Reminders app\nCreating Smart Lists on Reminders isn’t as hard as you think it may be. To do that, open the Reminders app on your iPhone and tap on the ‘Add List’ option from the bottom right corner of the screen.\nA ‘New List’ screen would pop up from the bottom. On this screen, enter the name of the list you want to create and select the color you want to assign to this particular list.\nOnce that’s done, tap on the ‘Make into Smart List’ option under the list’s name.\nYou’ll now see the ‘Filters’ screen pop up.\nHere, select the filters and tags you wish to add to your list and customize it however you want. A detailed guide on which filters to select and how to customize them is provided in the section below this.\nOnce you’ve customized filters for your Smart List, tap on the ‘Done’ option at the top right corner.\nNext, you can complete creating the Smart List by tapping on the ‘Done’ option again on the next screen.\nOnce you do that, your new Smart List will be created and will appear at the bottom of your existing Reminders list.\nWhat are the Filters you can Apply inside Smart Lists\nWhen you select the ‘Make into Smart List’ option during the creation of a Smart List, you’ll be presented with 5 different options to manually curate your list based on different scenarios. These include:\nYou can set date-based filters for your Smart Lists by choosing the ‘Date’ option when the ‘Filters’ screen appears.\nWhen you select ‘Date’, you’ll get to choose any of these options – Off, Any, Specified Range, and Relative Range. Choosing ‘Any’ will show a list of reminders you’ve set with an assigned date.\nWhen you select ‘Specified Range’, you get to choose the Start Date and End Date for the reminders to show up in this list.\nSelecting ‘Relative Range’ will let you set a roundabout period for the tasks to show up. You can configure it to show upcoming or previous tasks that are set to happen or have happened in a few hours, days, weeks, months, or years.\nWhen you select the ‘Time’ parameter, you can choose from among the following options – Any, Morning, Afternoon, Evening, and Night.\nThis way, Apple will find tasks that were set to be accomplished during a general period of time of a day. Assigning lists based on a part of the day provides you with tasks at hand that you can break down across different periods.\nYou can categorize tasks based on the location you’re at so that you can see only those tasks that have been assigned to your specific location. You can set different locations for tasks like when at home, work, in your car, or someplace else.\nSelecting this option, let you filter your tasks based on whether or not they’ve been flagged by you. Flags can be used to set items at the highest of priorities so that they’re not lost under other tasks.\nIf you don’t like to flag stuff but you’re instead into categorizing tasks into different levels of priority, then you can sort through your reminders into High, Medium, Low, or Any.\nHow to Add Reminders to a Smart List\nOnce you’ve created a Smart List inside Reminders, you can add reminders to it. There are two ways to do that – one by creating a new reminder for a Smart List and the other by moving an existing reminder from one list to your new Smart List.\nCreating New Reminders for a List\nTo create a new Reminder for your Smart List, open the Reminders app on your iPhone and select the Smart List you have created.\nOn the next screen, tap on the ‘New Reminder’ option at the bottom left corner of the screen.\nA new reminder will now appear as a pointer inside the Smart List. You can add details to it by tapping on the ‘i’ icon on the right side of the new reminder.\nInside the Details screen, enter the required details for your reminder inside Title, Notes, URL (optional), Date, time, repeat, tags, location, flag, priority, and other info.\nTo make sure the new reminder is added directly to your Smart List, tap on the ‘List’ option inside the Details screen.\nNext, select the Smart List you want to add the reminder to.\nTo confirm the process, tap on the ‘Done’ option at the top right corner.\nYour new reminder will be created and will be visible inside your Smart List.\nMoving Existing Reminders to Smart List\nIf you have created a reminder previously but want to move it to your new Smart List, you can do that by opening the Reminders app and tapping on ‘All’ to see all of your reminders or selecting one from the pre-defined list or My Lists.\nOn the next screen, tap on the 3-dots button at the top right corner.\nWhen a menu appears under this button, select the ‘Select Reminders’ option.\nNow, select the reminders you wish to move from your screen. Once you’ve selected the necessary reminders, tap on the Folder icon at the bottom.\nYou should now see a ‘Select a List’ screen pop up from the bottom. On this screen, tap on the Smart List you want to move the reminders.\nAfter you select your preferred Smart List, tap on the ‘Add’ button at the top right corner of the screen.\nThe selected reminders will now be added to your Smart List and you can view it when you open the list inside Reminders. You can repeat these steps for when you need to add more reminders to your Smart List in the future.\nHow to Re-arrange Smart Lists inside Reminders\nSmart Lists are there to show you tasks based on different factors you have assigned for them. If you’ve got a bunch of Smart Lists inside Reminders, you may want to select which of these lists appear at the top when you open the Reminders app by rearranging it the way you prefer.\nTo rearrange Smart Lists, open the Reminders app. Here, tap and hold on the list that you want to move to the top of the ‘My Lists’ section and drag it to the top.\nYou can repeat this for other reminders you want to rearrange and place them wherever you deem them right.\nHow to Manage a Smart List\nOnce you have created a Smart List for your reminders, it’s easy to use and manage it within the Reminders app.\nRename a list/ Change its icon\nTo rename a list or change its icon, open the Reminders app and tap and hold on the Smart List you want to modify.\nWhen an overflow menu appears, select the ‘Show Smart List Info’ option.\nAlternatively, you can also access this option by first opening the Smart List, tapping on the 3-dots button at the top right corner, and selecting the ‘Show Smart List Info’ option.\nHere, tap on the current name of the Smart List inside the ‘Smart List Info’ screen and then type a new name that you want to set for the list.\nTo change the List icon, scroll down on this ‘Smart List Info’ screen and select the icon you wish to apply for the Smart List, and select from one of the colors available at the top to finalize your List icon.\nOnce all changes have been made, tap on ‘Done’ at the top right corner.\nSort through a Smart List\nIf you’re finding it hard to locate tasks from within your Smart List, the Reminders app lets you view them in different sorting options. To change the sorting order of a Smart List, open the reminders app and tap on the 3-dots button at the top right corner.\nIn the menu that appears, select ‘Sort By’.\nYou should now see the ‘Sort By’ option expand to another menu. From here, you can choose any of the following options – Manual, Deadline, Creation Date, Priority, and Title.\nYou can also choose whether you want the arrangement to be sorted in ascending or descending manner based on the sorting you select.\nShow completed tasks in a list\nThe Reminders app lets you mark tasks as completed in an easy way by simply tapping on the circle on the left-hand side of any reminder you create. By default, when you open a list inside the app, you shall only be able to see only those reminders that are yet to be completed. If you wish to see tasks that you have completed within a Smart List, first open the Reminders app and select the Smart List.\nWhen the list loads up, tap on the 3-dots button at the top right corner.\nIn the menu that appears, tap on the ‘Show Completed’ option to see tasks that you have completed in this Smart List.\nPrint a Smart List\nLike any list on Reminders, you can print your Smart List by tapping on the 3-dots button inside a Smart List and then selecting the ‘Print’ option.\nOn the next screen, you can modify your print options and then tap on the ‘Print’ button at the top right corner to print your Smart List.\nDelete a Smart List\nIf you no longer wish to access a Smart List or if you’ve accomplished all the tasks within a Smart list, you can choose to delete it at any time. For this, open the Reminders app and tap, and hold on the Smart List you want to remove.\nWhen an overflow menu appears, tap on the ‘Delete Smart List’ option.\nYou may need to confirm the deletion process by tapping the ‘Delete’ button in the prompt that appears on the screen.\nAlternatively, you can also remove a Smart List after opening it, then going to the 3-dots button > Delete Smart List.\nOnce a Smart list has been deleted, you will no longer see it appear inside the Reminders app. However, the tasks that you had created previously will continue to appear in their original lists or inside the ‘All’ section.\nThat’s all you need to know about using Smart Lists inside Reminders on iOS."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:45cf37b8-c5b4-47d4-94dc-e066bd40fb04>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How does light's wavelength affect both its energy levels and its refraction behavior through different materials? Could you compare these relationships?","answer":"Light's wavelength has inverse relationships with both energy and refraction effects. For energy, shorter wavelengths (like blue light) correspond to higher frequencies and higher energy levels, while longer wavelengths (like red light) have lower frequencies and energy levels, following E=hf. For refraction, the bending angle depends on wavelength - when light moves between media of different densities, different wavelengths bend at different angles. This is demonstrated both in natural refraction through materials with positive refractive indices and in metamaterials with negative indices, where the Harvard team showed radio waves being bent the 'wrong way' at specific frequencies between 1-50 gigahertz.","context":["Materials that bend light in unnatural ways are often touted as the path to futuristic technologies such as cloaking devices and super-powered lenses. Such materials are hard to make, but scientists have now discovered a simpler way using electrons.\nAt Harvard University's School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, a team of researchers led by Hosang Yoon and Donhee Ham showed that using ordinary semiconductors and confining electrons to a two-dimensional plane they could make a material with a so-called negative refractive index that bends radio waves the \"wrong\" way, and does so a hundred times better than other methods.\nA refractive index is a measure of how much a material bends light. An index of 1 means no bending at all. Diamonds have that nice prism effect because they have an index of about 2.42, whereas air bends light hardly at all.\nLight — and that includes radio waves — bends because as it travels through anything other than a vacuum it slows down. Most materials always have a positive refractive index. That means that if light is approaching a denser, higher-index material from a lower-index one it gets bent to the right if the denser stuff is on that same side.\nThis all changes if the material has a negative index — as metamaterials do. In that case, the bend would be to the left. An object surrounded by a metamaterial would scatter the light away from it, making it invisible.\nThe Harvard team's radio-wave metamaterial itself won't make you invisible, but it could be used to make a kind of \"superlens\" for radio waves, boosting signals. Or it could divert radar away from a target.\nThe researchers set up one micrometer-wide strips of aluminum-gallium-arsenide (a common semiconductor) parallel to each other. They then cooled the device to a few degrees above absolute zero and ran a current through it, while simultaneously applying an electric field to one end.\nThe electric field accelerates the electrons in one of the strips. Those accelerating electrons couple to those in the strip next to it, and so on. That creates an effect like people in a stadium doing the wave — the electrons don't move but they do couple with others.\nThis differs from other methods of coupling electrons, which use magnetic fields. In this case, it's an electric field, and the coupling is due to the acceleration of the electrons themselves, a phenomenon called kinetic inductance.\nYoon and Ham then fired a beam of microwaves at frequencies of 1-50 gigahertz at the accelerating electrons. They found that the beam was refracted the \"wrong\" way, with an index of refraction at up to -700. For comparison, diamond, one of the most refractive materials known for visible light, has an index of 2.42. Most metamaterials developed so far have indexes of between -1 and -5.\nHam told InnovationNewsDaily that the wave of electrons is a key piece of the effect. The electric field applied to the strips creates an effective wave of a specific frequency, so the electrons will refract radio waves in a certain range. But that range can be adjusted by simply raising or lowering the frequency of the field.\nThis system wouldn't work for visible light, as the semiconductors used aren't transparent. So the technology won't lead to the creation of invisibility cloaks. But that doesn't mean it won't be possible later on.\nHam said future experiments will look at proving that the apparatus works with higher frequencies, in the terahertz and far infrared range.\nImage courtesy of Flickr, buttersweet\nThis article originally published at InnovationNewsDaily here","2 Radiation and Spectra Chapter 5 LightRadiation and SpectraChapter 5\n3 What is Light?

{"question":"What are the current challenges in maritime data sharing and standardization, and how does this impact the industry's greenhouse gas emissions?","answer":"The maritime industry faces significant challenges in data sharing and standardization due to its conservative and competitive nature, with stakeholders being resistant to change and wary of collaboration. Despite the International Maritime Organisation's call for uniform data exchange standards, ports and shipping companies remain stubbornly independent. This resistance to data sharing affects not only the shipping industry but also asset owners, trade finance industry, and land-based logistics operators. Regarding emissions, shipping accounts for about 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions, contributing around 1 billion tonnes annually. Without action, these emissions are expected to more than double by 2050. Better data sharing could help reduce emissions by enabling better coordination of vessel arrivals, minimizing anchorage time, and allowing for optimal speed management, which significantly contributes to reducing carbon emissions.","context":["Rainmaking Director of Trade Tarun Mehrotra says despite the maritime sector’s conservative outlook, mindsets are shifting, with observers predicting large-scale tech adoption within the next five years.\nBy Tarun Mehrotra\nTechnology can vastly improve maritime efficiency, streamline port orchestration and advance decarbonisation initiatives. But stakeholders will have to break down traditional silos, writes Tarun Mehrotra\nShipping is a conservative and competitive industry, resistant to change, wary of collaboration and reluctant to adopt new technological solutions. Data sharing is a particular area of concern. Many attempts have been made to break down traditional silos and facilitate the sharing of data, however no workable solution has yet been embraced by stakeholders.\nAlthough viable tech solutions do exist, and the International Maritime Organisation has called for ports to institute a uniform standard for data exchange, ports and shipping companies remain stubbornly independent, resisting the adoption of data sharing and standardisation.\nWith 80% of the world’s trade carried by sea, inefficiencies in port orchestration have an enormous effect on the global economy and society at large. The COVID-19 crisis has highlighted the fault lines in the traditional model, leading to a drop of approximately 10% in port calls globally, affecting the resilience of operations, which goes hand-in-hand with environmental impact.\nOur contemporaries at airfreight companies, airlines and airports embrace technological advances and the greater efficiency, cooperation and coordination they bring. The remarkably complex air-traffic management delivered by Eurocontrol provides one shining example.\nMany of the solutions that have been adopted by airlines and airports could easily translate to shipping — we needn’t start from scratch. However, insofar as collaboration or new technology go, skepticism and hesitance remain the dominant mindset within our industry.\nThis approach adversely affects not only the shipping industry but also asset owners, the trade finance industry, and land-based logistics operators, which ships must effectively interface with when in port. Most land-based logistics organisations are moving with the times, insofar as tech goes, and would welcome more efficient interactions with their shipping partners.\nShipping accounts for roughly 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions, a figure that could be greatly decreased via the streamlining of port orchestration. Our belief is that there is no one ‘silver bullet’ solution to port orchestration problems. Inefficiencies in this area not only impact port operations, but have a trickle-down effect on the dependent ecosystems adjoining the maritime industry.\nCEO and Co-founder of PortCast Nidhi Gupta believes there are three key elements that must be better coordinated in order to increase the efficiency of port operations: in-ship, pre-arrival and in-port.\n“Firstly, improved turnaround time of the ship through automated processes for crew to depart early as well as communication with the shore operations team on relevant clearances. Secondly, pre-alerts and notifications of delays and risks in arriving at any port in the voyage (as well as the final port) at least five days ahead of arrival. Thirdly, ensure just-in-times operations at the port,” says Gupta.\nAccording to Gupta, given the myriad parties involved in the successful execution of port operations, it is vital that information be effectively distributed to all stakeholders.\n“Data standardisation and sharing is critical for efficiency in maritime. It’s about time that we, as an industry, can agree on common standards of data, common definitions and also enable sharing of data,” says Gupta.\nDNV GL APAC Regional Head of Maritime Advisory Dr Shahrin Osman concurs with Gupta’s assertion that shipping operations need to become more transparent.\n“The shipping industry as well as the port authorities and terminal operators must be willing to share data and show the willingness to collaborate and interface via a common data sharing standard,” says Osman.\nHe believes that greater shared visibility of information such as vessels’ scheduled arrival, berth availability at terminals, cargo operations and terminal productivity, and synchronisation with ports’ marine and ancillary services would be of enormous benefit to the industry as a whole.\nImproving profits is always a strong motivator to change, however the industry is also coming to acknowledge the importance of reducing carbon emissions. Stakeholders including shipping lines and terminal operators recognise tech’s potential to assist in that respect, insofar as data sharing goes.\n“If vessels are informed well in advance on the optimal arrival schedule (time to arrive at anchorage), with the vessels being tracked throughout the voyage prior the port arrival, then this will smooth out fluctuations in speed for the entire trip as well as minimise the time at anchorage and awaiting for berth. Speed management contributes to a significant component to reduce carbon emissions from shipping,” says Osman.\nCutting vessel dwell time and better coordinating scheduling will have a number of direct and indirect benefits — not least, in terms of minimising carbon emissions. Reducing the number of ships waiting at berth and cutting congestion at port can produce significant decarbonisation impact, with fewer trucks waiting and the slow steaming of ships that are arriving early.\nThe COVID-19 crisis has brought the need for wide-reaching solutions into sharp focus, highlighting the impact to overall supply chains if just one element in the fragmented ecosystem fails. Coupling these concerns with pressure from lawmakers, shareholders and customers to increase sustainability, change is now being forced.\nConsequently, despite the maritime sector’s longstanding conservative outlook, mindsets are indeed shifting. Within the next five years, many observers predict large-scale adoption of technology and data sharing within the industry. We believe there is enormous potential for AI or tech-enabled solutions to help break down silos and create a smarter, safer and greener industry.\n(Ed. Featured image by Photographer Sascha Hormel.)","Reducing emissions from the shipping sector\nShipping is a large and growing source of the greenhouse gas emissions that are causing climate change. The European Union wants a global approach taken to reducing emissions from international shipping. As a first step towards cutting emissions, the European Commission has proposed that owners of large ships using EU ports should report their verified emissions from 2018.\nEmissions from the global shipping industry amount to around 1 billion tonnes a year, accounting for 3% of the world's total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and 4% of the EU's total emissions. Without action, these emissions are expected to more than double by 2050. This is not compatible with the internationally agreed goal of keeping global warming below 2°C, which requires worldwide emissions to be at least halved from 1990 levels by 2050.\nTowards global action\nThe European Union and its Member States have a strong preference for a global approach to reducing GHG emissions from international shipping led by the International Maritime Organization (IMO). This should include the use of global market-based measures (MBMs).\nConsiderable efforts have been made over recent years, within both the IMO and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), to reach such an agreement. In 2011 IMO made progress by adopting the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI), which sets compulsory energy efficiency standards for new ships, and the Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan (SEEMP), a management tool for ship owners.\nHowever, the international discussions have yet to bring agreement on global MBMs or other instruments that would cut GHG emissions from the international maritime transport sector as a whole, including existing ships.\nThe EU's strategy\nThe Commission's 2011 White Paper on transport suggests that the EU's CO2 emissions from maritime transport should be cut by at least 40% of 2005 levels by 2050, and if feasible by 50%. However, international shipping is not covered by the EU's current emissions reduction target.\nIn June 2013 the European Commission set out a strategy for progressively integrating maritime emissions into the EU's policy for reducing its domestic greenhouse gas emissions.\nThe strategy consists of three consecutive steps:\n- Monitoring, reporting and verification of CO2 emissions from large ships using EU ports;\n- Greenhouse gas reduction targets for the maritime transport sector;\n- Further measures, including MBMs, in the medium to long term.\nFirst step: monitor and report emissions\nAt the same time as publishing a Communication setting out the strategy, the Commission put forward a legislative proposal to establish an EU system for monitoring, reporting and verifying (MRV) emissions from large ships using EU ports. This would implement the first step in the strategy.\nThe Commission proposes that the MRV system apply to shipping activities carried out from 1 January 2018. To become law, the proposal requires approval by the European Parliament and Council.\nThe proposed EU system of MRV for shipping emissions is designed to contribute to building an international system. First steps in this direction have already been taken at the IMO, with active support from the EU and partner countries. By yielding further insights into the sector's potential to reduce emissions, an MRV system will also provide new opportunities to agree on efficiency standards for existing ships.\nThe proposal would create an EU-wide legal framework for collecting and publishing verified annual data on CO2 emissions from all large ships (over 5 000 gross tons) that use EU ports, irrespective of where the ships are registered.\nShip owners would have to monitor and report the verified amount of CO2 emitted by their large ships on voyages to, from and between EU ports. Owners would also be required to provide certain other information, such as data to determine the ships' energy efficiency.\nA document of compliance issued by an independent verifier would have to be carried on board ships and would be subject to inspection by Member State authorities.\nReduced emissions and costs\nThe MRV system is expected to cut CO2 emissions from the journeys covered by up to 2% compared with a 'business as usual' situation, according to the Commission's impact assessment. The system would also reduce net costs to owners by up to €1.2 billion per year in 2030.\nIn addition it will provide useful insights into the performance of individual ships, their associated operational costs and potential resale value. This will benefit ship owners, who will be better equipped to take decisions on major investments and to obtain the corresponding finance.\nConsultation and research\nThe approach proposed by the Commission is the result of extensive consultation with relevant stakeholders in various fora. These include a working group under the Second European Climate Change Programme (ECCP II), three meetings in 2011 of a High Level Platform on greenhouse gas emissions from ships, a public consultation in early 2012 and an ad hoc stakeholder meeting in December 2012.\nThe Commission's approach is also based on a number of research studies (see Studies tab at the top of this page) which show that an MRV system will help overcome a lack of information and other market barriers which are currently preventing the shipping sector from fully tapping its high potential to reduce emissions."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:6610a13a-8653-4002-b098-d7b878c49ea8>","<urn:uuid:ef158bbc-eb3e-47fb-9c77-bd2785b4f1e6>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What is the relationship between plants and decomposers in ecosystems, and how do secondary metabolites change from fresh plants to litter?","answer":"Plants and decomposers are connected through the plant-litter continuum, where fresh plant parts fall to the ground to form litter that decomposers consume. Fungi are the primary decomposers in many ecosystems, using their hyphal networks to penetrate organic matter and release enzymes that break down decaying material. Regarding secondary metabolites, they are generally more concentrated in fresh plants (green world) compared to litter (brown world), with the exception of apolar terpenes. This decrease in secondary metabolites as plants transition to litter may be a strategy to recycle compounds and avoid negative impacts on detritus feeders that consume the litter.","context":["The subject of this article brings together two researchers who have a common interest in specialized metabolites involved in plant chemical defenses. Dr. Thomas Michel is analytical chemist at the Institute of Chemistry of Nice (Université Côte d’Azur, Nice, France) where he develops analytical tools for chemical ecology and for discovery of bioactive compounds from plant biodiversity. He employs HPTLC for analytical goals and TLC for preparative separations. Dr. Anne- Violette Lavoir, ecologist at the Institute Sophia Agrobiotech (INRAe, Université Côte d’Azur, Antibes, France) works on the chemical interaction between plants and insects (community ecology, chemical ecology). In this work, the authors employed HPTLC for secondary metabolites screening of different plant extracts in an ecological context.\nEcosystems are complex systems, forming a vast network in which different actors – the living beings – interact with each other. The main trophic network is the \"green world\" [1,2], in which the chlorophyllous plants are the primary producers. They bring organic matter and energy into the network through the fixation of mineral matter by photosynthesis. In this green world, fresh plants are the basis as they are consumed by herbivores, which will in turn be consumed by predators. The \"brown world\" [1,2] is based on the litter, mostly formed from plant parts (e.g. leaves, bark, stems) that dry out and fall to the ground (inert organic matter). The litter is consumed by detritus feeders (or decomposers), which will then also be consumed by their predators. As litter are previously fresh leaves, the basis of the green and brown world is linked through the so-called plantlitter continuum.\nA change in plant or litter chemistry would impact not only their consumers, but all the trophic levels above. For instance, plants could modify their chemical defenses such as secondary metabolites, impacting all their consumers. Because of the plant-litter continuum, any modification in the chemistry of the fresh plants will in turn modify the chemistry of the litter and consequentially the brown trophic network.\nIn this context, we studied the variation in content of secondary metabolites at five stages of the plant-litter continuum (young plants, mature plants, fresh litter, old litter and decomposer feces), from four plant species (Bromus erectus, Pilosella officinarum, Potentilla grandiflora and Sanguisorba minor). Each stage and plant species were sampled by our collaborators on grasslands of Les Causses (South of France) and each grassland was either fertilized or not. Our main objective was to compare the global chemistry of the four plant species throughout the plant-litter continuum and to see if the fertilization may modify such pattern.\nThe great diversity of phytochemicals and their small quantities in plant species, and the number of samples to investigate led us to set up a large-scale HPTLC analysis. HPTLC was chosen because it offers numerous advantages such as versatility, capacity to run several samples in parallel and low solvent consumption. Additionally, detection using various derivatization reactions can provide crucial information about the nature of chemical substances present in samples. Furthermore, sample preparation in HPTLC is simple while other chromatographic techniques (e.g. GC and HPLC) usually require a time-consuming and expensive sample preparation prior to the analyses. Therefore, HPTLC is suitable as a high-throughput fingerprinting method in an ecological context.\nQuercetin, asiaticoside and betuline are dissolved in methanol at different concentration levels.\n20mg of ground plant are extracted in an ultrasonic bath with 1.6 mL ethanol – water 7:3. Extracts are then filtered and stored at –20 °C before HPTLC analysis.\nHPTLC plates silica gel 60 F254 (Merck), 20 x10 cm\nAutomatic TLC Sampler (ATS 4), application as bands, 16 tracks, band length 8.0 mm, distance from left edge 15.0 mm, distance from lower edge 8.0 mm, application volume 2.0 μL for sample solutions and 2.0 μL for standard solutions\nIn the Automatic Developing Chamber (ADC 2) with ethyl acetate – formic acid – acetic acid – water 100:11:11:26 (polyphenols), chloroform – methanol – water 5:4:1 (glycosylated terpenoids), or hexane – ethyl acetate – water 4:1:0.5 (hydrophobic terpenoids) after chamber saturation (filter paper) and activation at 33% relative humidity for 10 min using a saturated solution of magnesium chloride, migration distance of 70 mm (from the lower edge), drying for 5 min\nAll plates are immersed into specific reagents for 2 s using the Chromatogram Immersion Device. For phenolic compounds, the plate is immersed into NP reagent (1.25 g diphenyl borinic acid ethylamino ester in 250 mL of ethyl acetate) and then into PEG reagent (10% polyethylene glycol 400 in dichloromethane). For terpenoids, the plate is immersed into anisaldehyde-sulfuric acid reagent (0.5 mL anisaldehyde, 10 mL glacial acetic acid, 85 mL methanol, 5 mL sulfuric acid) and heated on the TLC Plate Heater at 105 °C for 5 min.\nTLC Visualizer under UV 254 nm, UV 366 nm, and white light\nTLC Scanner 4 and winCATS, slit dimension 5.00 mm x 0.20 mm, scanning speed 50 mm/s, spectra recording from 190 to 450 nm, measurement after derivatization in fluorescence mode at 366/>400 nm with Hg lamp (polyphenols), in absorbance mode at 400 nm (polar terpenoids), and at 600 nm (apolar terpenoids) with tungsten lamp, evaluation via peak area and calibration curves of specific compounds (i.e. quercetin, asiaticoside, betuline)\nData are statistically analyzed by a Scheirer-Ray- Hare test using R software.\nResults and discussion\nTo analyze and compare the diversity of the phytochemicals (i.e. polyphenols, terpenes, alkaloids) of the four plant species, the first step was to develop a suitable analytical workflow and to optimize the chromatographic conditions for separation of the different compound families.\nQuantitative estimation of each class of compounds was further performed by scanning densitometry. A typical HPTLC densitogram obtained at 366 nm after derivatization with NP reagent is shown below. The area under each peak was determined and compared to the calibration curves of specific compounds (e.g. quercetin for polyphenols). Results are then expressed in mg standard/g dry matter.\nFor example, relative quantity of polyphenols (mg of quercetin/g dry mass) in Sanguisorba minor samples significantly decreases between the green and the brown world (p<0.0001). No significant differences were observed between samples from the same world (e.g. young and mature plant). On the contrary, the effect of fertilization is significant for both green and brown worlds (p < 0.0001). Polyphenols are more present in fertilized samples than in unfertilized ones.\nUsing this HPTLC strategy, we were able to estimate the relative quantity of polyphenols (i.e. mg quercetin/g dry matter) and terpenoids (e.g. mg betulin/g dry matter) according to the plant species, to the stages in the plant-litter continuum and to the fertilization status. Furthermore, this strategy was also applied to tannins, terpenoids, and alkaloids (data not shown), giving us the possibility of a complete screening of secondary metabolites in all plant species studied. The complete results enable the determination of the evolution of secondary metabolites in the fresh plant-decomposed litter continuum:\n- There are more secondary metabolites in the green world compared to the brown world (i.e. in fresh and mature plants compared to litter), except for the apolar terpenes that have shown an opposite pattern.\n- There are more secondary metabolites in the mature plants compared to the youngest plants inside the green world.\n- Plant species show diverse metabolic strategies: Bromus erectus has significantly less secondary metabolites compared to other species.\n- The concentration of secondarymetabolites in plants of the same species is higher on the non-fertilized site.\nTo conclude, this HPTLC strategy allowed us to highlight modifications of the plant secondary metabolites throughout the plant-litter food web but also to observe a link between the green and the brown world. Interestingly, even though plants show various strategies, we always observe a decrease of concentrations in the brown world. As secondary metabolites are mainly defense compounds, we hypothesize a decrease of such compounds in the leaf before they fall in order to recycle such compounds and/or to avoid a negative impact on detritus feeders which are consuming the litter. Analyzing the plant chemistry throughout the plant-litter continuum helps us to disentangle the complexity and the link structuring the green and brown worlds.\n Wardle et al.

Like herbivores and predators, decomposers are heterotrophic, meaning that they use organic substrates to get their energy, carbon and nutrients for growth and development. While the terms decomposer and detritivore are often interchangeably used, detritivores ingest and digest dead matter internally, while decomposers directly absorb nutrients through external chemical and biological processes. Thus, invertebrates such as earthworms, woodlice, and sea cucumbers are technically detritivores, not decomposers, since they must ingest nutrients - they are unable to absorb them externally.\nThe primary decomposer of litter in many ecosystems is fungi. Unlike bacteria, which are unicellular organisms and are decomposers as well, most saprotrophic fungi grow as a branching network of hyphae. While bacteria are restricted to growing and feeding on the exposed surfaces of organic matter, fungi can use their hyphae to penetrate larger pieces of organic matter, below the surface. Additionally, only wood-decay fungi have evolved the enzymes necessary to decompose lignin, a chemically complex substance found in wood. These two factors make fungi the primary decomposers in forests, where litter has high concentrations of lignin and often occurs in large pieces. Fungi decompose organic matter by releasing enzymes to break down the decaying material, after which they absorb the nutrients in the decaying material. Hyphae used to break down matter and absorb nutrients are also used in reproduction. When two compatible fungi hyphae grow close to each other, they will then fuse together for reproduction, and form another fungus.\n- \"NOAA.

{"question":"How does the daily schedule and route work for the 7-day horseback expedition along the Esqueletos Coast in Tierra del Fuego?","answer":"The 7-day expedition begins at Maria Luisa Ranch near Ushuaia. Each day involves approximately 6 hours of riding covering 30 kilometers. Day 1 goes from Maria Luisa Ranch to La Chaira Station via Irigoyen River. Day 2 continues to Rio Bueno Station, passing shipwrecks like the 'Barca'. Day 3 reaches Policarpo Ranch through rivers and peatlands. Day 4 is a rest day at Policarpo Ranch. Days 5-7 retrace the route back through Rio Bueno Station and La Chaira Station to Maria Luisa Ranch. The exact schedule depends on weather conditions and tides, as the route crosses five major rivers. The journey includes overnight camping in tents, with BBQ dinners at certain stations. Throughout the expedition, riders can observe wildlife, aboriginal remains, and abandoned stations.","context":["Expedition horseback riding\nThis excursion is going to be done in the well-known Esqueletos´s Coast, located in Mitre´s Peninsula, on the south east of Tierra del Fuego, that wonderful place in the End of the World.\nDuring long hours we are going to be in the deep nature of Tierra del Fuego, enjoying of it variety on wildlife and flora.\nOur way to move around are going to be horses specially trained to walk on this land, same as many years ago, the men who explored over the Patagonia.\nThe most wonderful of this excursion is the pleasure of the loneliness sensation that you are going to experiment once we are in places that are far away of any city or noise.\nThe landscape invited us to discover the silence and with a lot of respect the secret that they are hiding in these millenaries trails. During the tour we are going to have the opportunity of seeing really close the variety on the wildlife that includes cows, wild horses, also cetaceans shipwrecks of hundreds years old, abandoned ranches, Indian trails and more. At night we are going to make a fire to enjoy, share experiences, to tell stories, always in the magnificent company of the Austral Sea; that it gets its name from the big amount of whale´s skeletons and sea lion’s skeletons, also of the establishments and boats which where famous many years ago.\nWe are going to be in the most magnificent adventure, with a constant contact with the nature and it changing climatic conditions. If you are lucky and the surrounding allows us, maybe you could fish.\nThe overnight is going to be in tents which will give us more contact with the night and it mysteries, also you are going to get relax with the constant sound of the Ocean, and we are going to be in contact with the people who live in the ranch. This experience is unique and one way or another it will change us forever.\nDay 1: Ushuaia / Maria Luisa Ranch / La Chaira Station\nA transfer is going to pick you from your hotel in Ushuaia to take you to the place where the horseback riding is going to start, the Maria Luisa Ranch.\nThis Ranch works mainly in ranching and logging. Along the way, the passengers will witness the most beautiful and amazing scenery, especially when you cross mountain range through Garibaldi Pass, where you could see incredible panoramic views.\nOnce you get to the ranch you are going have a horse assigned, and the staff is going to introduce themselves. The first day is going to be about getting in tune with the nature and getting used with the place.\nYou are going to use a trail that is going to take to the shore of Irigoyen´s River, this is an special place to people who like to do fishing, you can get trout fishes over 10 kilos.\nThe first day we are going to sleep in a tent on La Chaira Station, place where there´s not going to be more people than us, and you are going to have a delicious BBQ.\nDay 2: La Chaira Station // Rio Bueno Station\nAfter enjoying an energetic breakfast, we are going to start our 2 horseback riding day.\nThe objective today is to reach the Rio Bueno Station, place where we are going to sleep.\nAlong the way you can see how the civilization’s track starts disappearing and the wildest side of Tierra del Fuego appears.\nDuring this horseback riding day you are going to visit some shipwrecks like the “Barca” which is been stuck in the beach for many years. Also you may find abandoned stations. The shocking part is going to be how close we are going to be from the wildlife of the place. Between all the species that you will see, you may see foxes, guanacos, condors, marine mammals, beavers and many beautiful birds. The last part of the day we are going to go around “Leticia” River which is going to takes us to our last stop.\nLike the night before, we are going to sleep in tents and we can get relax with the sound of the “Bueno” River.\nDay 3: Rio Bueno Station // Policarpo Ranch\nAfter breakfast, you are going to start the way with the objective to reach Policarpo Ranch which was declared a National Historic Landmark\nThe trail is going to take us along the shore of the “Bueno and Policarpo” Rivers, where you may find aboriginal remains from the native “ Haush” tribe.\nThe conditions on this there are pretty similar to the day before, the difference is going to be in the peatland you are going to find, and you will be able to see the different abilities of the horses, while walking on this floor.\nAlong the way we could see the local wildlife where the wild horses, sea lions and king penguins will surprise us. You may also find different shipwrecks as “Duquesa de Albania”.\nFrom the high valley we could see Falsa Creek which was abandoned in the 60’s. Here is possible to find remains and tools of all kinds.\nWe are going to do our overnight in a tent in “Policarpo” Ranch.\nDay 4: Policarpo Ranch\nOn this day we are going to rest and relax in Policarpo Ranch. If you want to, you could visit the cormorant colony which is located in the marine caves or do a trekking in the Bilbao Hill, place where you could see incredible panoramic views.\nDay 5: Policarpo Ranch // Rio Bueno Station\nOn this day, we are going to start our return trip to Rio Bueno Station. In some parts you are going to use different trails.\nDay 6: Rio Bueno Station // La Chaira Station\nIn your return trip to La Chaira Station, you are going to use different trails, compared with the ones we used on our first way.\nOn La Chaira Station, we are going to enjoy a delicious BBQ.\nDay 7: La Chaira Station // Maria Luisa Ranch // Ushuaia\nWe are going to come back from La Chaira Station to Maria Luisa Ranch, where we are going to go up the cars which are going to take us to Ushuaia. Here is where our services finish.\nTimes riding and distances\nYou will ride for 6 hours each day, doing stops and breaks. The distance each day is doing to be 30 kilometers approx.\nLevel of difficulty\nThis is a medium difficulty since is necessary to know about horseback riding and you need to have a good health condition. You will ride through different lands, but most of all through beaches and peatlands where because of the conditions of the land it could be necessary to dismount. Also you are going to go through leafy forest and some steep cliffs.\nIt´s important to know that the schedule for the places where to sleep and the durations of the days are going to depend on the weather conditions and the tide, since during the excursion your are going to go along 5 different and important rivers.\nWe are going to be riding in places completely isolated and lonely, away from civilization and sanitation, that’s why the staff is going to carry a satellite phone for emergencies. Also the guides on charge are SAN-WFR (Wilderness First Responder) Certified, given by the Argentine School of Lifesaving and First Aid. Each guide is going to carry with a First Aid kit and also they are going to know the whole technical part. All the water is potable during the trip.\nHorses and Mounts\nWe are going to use Native Argentine horses, of 1.55 meters on average, a really known race all over the world because of their nobility and strength, they are ideal for this kind of excursions. The same ones have been raised in Tierra del Fuego, reason why they are familiarized and comfortable riding in the different kind of lands.\nTalking about the mounts we are going to be using a combination between the Chilean and Argentinean ones. The horses don´t need spurs.\nThe weather is going to be very variable. During summertime the days are incredibly long with a length of 14 hours, where we can experiment different weather conditions.\nPeople said that you can have all four seasons in just a few minutes in Tierra del Fuego, although the extreme conditions are rare. In general the weather is cold and windy and the temperature goes from 2 to 12ºC, although the wind and the regular drizzle can make it colder.\nEither ways the weather could be nice with cold nights even though we are close to Antarctica.\nClothing and other items required\nBecause of the weather, the clothes need to be warm and waterproof as an esential ítem for the a comfortable trip.\nThe best system you can use to dress is the layers system, to adapt to the changing weather conditions.\nWe recommend this equipment\n1 -Shoes: 2 pairs. We highly recommend waterproof leather boots, which are really good for rain or cold weather. We really another pair of a comfortable and warm shoes for the relax moments. If you want you, you can take leggings which are really good to avoid friction.\n2- Socks. 5 pairs. The best option is to take some cotton ones and some wool ones.\n3 –Interiors. 2. One for the chest and the one that is being worn. Take a look on the Power Dry or similar options for material. If you suffer the cold weather, to take pair of pants of the same material could be a good option. The cotton clothing is not a good option because they absorb the humidity and take a long time to dry.\n4 –Pants. We highly recommend taking lightweight trousers and a pair of pant covers of any waterproof material.\n5 – Jacket. Take a waterproof material one as a Gore-tex material with an adjustable hood.\n6 – Gloves (2 pairs and posibly waterproof), hat for the sun and a warm hat, sunglasses and a scarf. It’s pretty useful to take leather glove’s covers.\n7 – Overcoat. Polar fleece’s vest and a feather’s jacket.\n8 – Backpack. Is important to take a backpack with you (35 to 40 liters) where to put the thing we are going to need close to us during the riding and during the trekking. Is a good idea to take a waterproof backpack cover.\nThis is the equipment recommended by the guides, this doesn’t mean if you don’t have something of these things, you can’t do the excursion. The most important thing is to have waterproof clothes, so we can keep our body temperature.\nFor those who don’t want to spend so much money, an option is to buy those yellow robes that are one hundred percent waterproof. The cons with this robes is that you can get really hot when the sun is shining. We don't recommend using poncho, since they scare the horses when they get shaken by the wind and don’t give the necessary isolation.\nRemember to bring your sleeping bag which needs to have the comfortable temperature under -10Cº. Renting these sleeping bags is possible in Ushuaia, they been tested and approved.\n• Photo camera / film camera with batteries.\n• Personal medicine,\n• Travelogue, maps, etc..\n• Some Cash\n• Patient card, which will be given to guide\n• Passport. It is mandatory to have it circular route. Passengers have the option to leave it at Maria Luisa Ranch to avoid losing it.\n• Trash bags resistant material to protect all these personal effects\nThe backpacks which are going to be given to you has the necessary space to save all these things. It’s not necessary or recommended to bring a lot of clothes, since is not possible to carry more things than the backpack capacity.\nThe excursion includes\n- The horse and all the mount equipment.\n- Backpack with waterproof bags where to save all the personal items and the sleeping bag.\n- Extra horses that will carry all the group’s stuff.\n- Bilingual guides and helpers.\n- All the meals and beverages (breakfast, lunch, tea and dinner)\n- Satellite phone for emergencies.\n- Security kit and radio.\n- Insurance for personal accidents until certain amount.\n- Transfer service from and to Ushuaia\n- Tents for 2 people and insulating for the sleeping bag.\n- Crockery, cutlery, cooking elements, etc..\nAmount of passengers: 4 minimum 12 maximum.\nYou have the option to return to Ushuaia by helicopter.

{"question":"As someone learning about art history, I'd like to understand how Alfonso Ossorio's Five Brothers compares to Jackson Pollock's approach in terms of artistic technique and materials - what are the key differences and similarities?","answer":"Both artists were part of the Abstract Expressionist movement, but used different techniques. Ossorio focused on layering ink on top of dense layers of wax and watercolor using a wax-resistant technique, creating complex surfaces through material interactions. In contrast, Pollock developed the 'drip and splash' style where he poured paint from cans onto canvas laid on the floor, manipulating it with sticks, trowels, and knives. While Ossorio worked with conventional and unconventional mediums to create controlled layers, Pollock aimed for a more spontaneous 'action painting' approach, creating all-over compositions without points of emphasis. However, both artists shared the Abstract Expressionist philosophy of rejecting naturalistic images in favor of spontaneous expression and non-representational forms.","context":["Today’s activity looks at Alfonso Ossorio’s Five Brothers as we dive into the curious world of science using the scientific method. The scientific method is a process of six steps scientists use to help them gain knowledge, solve problems, and understand why things work the way they do. We’ll use it to conduct experiments exploring the various reactions materials such as wax, salt, and glue have with watercolors. After conducting our experiments we will use our findings to create our own Ossorio-inspired masterpiece. Let’s get started!\nAbout the Artist: Alfonso Ossorio was one of the first members of the Abstract Expressionist movement, which rejected naturalistic images and stressed spontaneous expression. An artist, collector, and patron of both American and European artists, he is one of the most colorful figures of postwar America. Ossorio was born in the Philippines in 1916, and spent the majority of his childhood attending Catholic Preparatory School in England. Ossorio moved to the US to attend boarding school, and became a citizen in 1933. He attended Harvard where, against his father’s wishes, he majored in Fine Art.\nIn 1940, Ossorio was offered his first solo exhibition when Betty Parsons, a prominent New York art dealer, discovered his work. Through his connection with Parsons, Ossorio was introduced to Jackson Pollock and Jean Dubuffet. Throughout his career, Ossorio experimented with different mediums, both conventional and unconventional. This enabled him to create a style that was informed by the works of Pollock and Dubuffet, yet remained fiercely independent due to his interest in surrealism and belief in free and spontaneous gestures.\nLook Closely: Five Brothers was painted in 1950. Ossorio’s return to the Philippines in the 1950s, at the age of 34, was the first time he had returned in 26 years. The works he created during this time are thought to be some of his most personal images. Though the title of this work recalls a specific image, Ossorio replaces any representational forms with complete abstraction. He focuses on the complexity of the surface and interactions between materials as he layers ink on top of dense layers of wax and watercolor using a wax-resistant technique.\nThinking Moment: When you look at this painting, what jumps out to you? Try to identify the different mediums you see. What are you curious about?\nIn this art project, we will be scientists as well as artists. Keep in mind Ossorio’s unique technique and style during our watercolor experiment. After we investigate the properties of watercolors and collect our results, we’ll use what we know to create an Ossorio-inspired work of art!\nThe six steps of the scientific method are: observe/ask a question, research, hypothesis, experiment,analysis, and conclusion. Click here to download a worksheet we’ve created to help you keep track of your data and results.\nAge Suggestion: 5+\nTime Estimate: 1-2 Hours\nWhat You’ll Need:\nGlue (liquid glue is best)\nTwo sheets of paper\nSharpie marker and/or pencil\nScientific method worksheet\nStep 1: Gather your materials. Print the worksheet and have something to write with.\nStep 2: Now we will walk through the 6 steps of the scientific method:\nObserve/ Ask a question: The scientific method starts when you ask a question about something that you observe. Examine the watercolor paints, salt, glue, and wax crayons. For example, put a dab of glue on your fingers. Observe how it glides across your fingers. Now ask a question. Does the consistency change? What do you think the glue is made out of? Think about what questions come to mind as you examine the glue.\nResearch: Look for information on the internet or at the library about what it is you’re questioning and gather background information. We did this by reading the ingredients on the packaging, and looking for information about watercolors, wax, salt, and glue on the internet.\nHypothesis: Form an educated guess based on your research. This is called a hypothesis. It’s a prediction of what will happen during the experiment. A common way to form a hypothesis is by using the “If, then” format: “If I do ________ then _________ will happen.” Using what you’ve learned so far; what do you think will happen when you mix the different materials with watercolors?\nHere is an example of one of ours: “If salt is sprinkled on top of watercolor paint, then the salt will absorb the water in the paints leaving a change in color pigment.”\nExperiment: Organize a plan to test your hypothesis.\nA) Fold and cut a sheet of paper into four smaller pieces and label them as follows: “Control”, “Glue”, “Salt”, and “Wax”. These squares will represent the four tests you’ll conduct.\nYou may be wondering what the paper labeled “Control” is for. When scientists conduct experiments, they have what is known as a control variable. The control variable is when the matter being tested is unchanged and constant. In our experiment the control variable is watercolor.\nB) Take the piece of paper labeled “Control” and begin painting using the watercolors. In this test you’re observing how watercolor behaves on paper without any of the other materials.\nJot down something you notice happening. In our control experiment, we observed the way watercolors interact with each other and on the paper. If you put two watercolors closely together, the paints bleed into each other, as you can see where the purple splashed into the red.\nC) Let’s set up the glue test next. With your glue bottle in hand, gently squeeze a design onto the piece of paper labeled “Glue”. Put this piece of paper to the side. We’ll come back to this test when the glue has had time to dry.\nD) For the third test, grab the piece of paper labeled “Salt” and have your salt ready. Start painting on this piece of paper with your watercolors. With the paint still wet, sprinkle salt over the paper.\nRemember to record your results! How is the salt reacting with the watercolor? We noticed that the places where we sprinkled salt showed a change in color pigment as the salt absorbed the water in the paints. Depending on how much salt was used, it created either lighter or more concentrated areas of paint and left a unique texture.\nE) In your wax test, create a drawing using crayons. Draw whatever you’d like! Use the watercolors to paint over the areas of the paper where there’s crayon. What happens to the watercolor and the wax?\nRecord what you see in your worksheet. In our wax experiment we noticed that the crayon repelled the watercolors. Therefore, when we painted over our crayon drawing the spots where we had used white crayons appeared extremely vibrant.\nF) Lastly, return to your glue test. Check if the glue has dried. Paint over the paper with watercolor to see what happens.\nRecord your observations. We observed that the places where the glue had dried fully repelled the watercolor, similar to how the crayons did. However, in places where the glue hadn’t fully dried the watercolor bled into the glue.\nAnalysis: Review your findings. The information collected is called “data”. What happened to the watercolor in each test? Read your notes and record anything you might have missed.\nHere are our results from the experiment\nConclusion: From your results, review your hypothesis with the data. Check to see if your data supports your guess and report what you’ve learned from the experiment . Were your predictions correct? Write down the outcome and what you’ve learned from this experiment.\nFor example, our hypothesis for salt was, “If salt is sprinkled on top of watercolor paint, then the salt will absorb the water in the paints leaving a change in color pigment.”\nOur analysis of the salt experiment supported our hypothesis. We learned from our research that salt absorbs water, just as we predicted.There were some instances where the salt formed concentrated areas of pigment depending on the ratio of salt and paint used. Furthermore, we predicted that the wax and dried glue would repel the watercolor, while wet glue would mix with the watercolor. The results from the experiments proved our predictions to be correct.\nStep 3: Create your masterpiece. Now it’s time to create your own painting. Use the conclusions you drew from experimenting to brainstorm how you want to design your final piece. Maybe you want to build layers, mix all of the different materials together, or only use one. Have fun and see what happens!\nHere are our finished artworks:\nWe each used all three materials building upon different layers.\nWe first drew with crayon, then added the glue, followed by painting with our watercolors and finishing our works by sprinkling salt on them. What do you think?\nOssorio is known for his use of organic lines, geometric forms, and bold colors. We manipulated the wax, salt, and glue in an attempt to imitate a natural, uncontrolled gesture similar to Ossorio’s.\nStep 4: Reflection. Look at what you’ve created! Isn’t it cool that you got to be both an artist and a scientist?\nOssorio was always concerned with displaying expressive gestures in his art. What kind of gestures did you make?\nWe hope you enjoyed experimenting with us today, and that you continue to question the world around you using the scientific method to guide your experiments. We would love to see where your experiments led you! Take a picture of your work and share it in the comments below.\nMarin Williams and Betty Q. Le, K12 Education Interns","Werner Hammerstingl ©1998\nExpressionism, in general, describes the artist's philosophical perspective concerning the purpose of their art more than specifically defining their method.\nWebster's dictionary on WWW, Main Entry: abstract expressionism Function: noun Date: 1951 : an artistic movement of the mid-20th century comprising diverse styles and techniques and emphasizing especially an artist's liberty to convey attitudes and emotions through nontraditional and usually nonrepresentational means - abstract expressionist noun or adjective\nThe movement of abstract expressionism originating in the middle of the twentieth century was an approach to modernism/ post-modernism accentuating the uninhibited expression of emotions. The products of this genre are characteristically free and loosely structured, stylistically. They tend to focus on the sensual and psychological subjects, but as abstractions, essentially avoid any clear representational imitation of reality.\nHowever great a disaster World War II was, it did at least mean that artists such as Paul Klee, Marcel Duchamp, Piet Mondrian and Max Ernst, in leaving Europe for the safety of the USA, greatly extended their artistic influence. It is impossible to estimate how much they affected American art, but the fact remains that in the 1940s and '50s, for the first time, American artists became internationally important with their new vision and new artistic vocabulary, known as Abstract Expressionism.\nThe first public exhibitions of work by the ``New York School'' of artists-- who were to become known as Abstract Expressionists-- were held in the mid '40s. Like many other modern movements, Abstract Expressionism does not describe any one particular style, but rather a general attitude; not all the work was abstract, nor was it all expressive. What these artists did have in common were morally loaded themes, often heavyweight and tragic, on a grand scale. In contrast to the themes of social realism and regional life that characterized American art of previous decades, these artists valued, above all, individuality and spontaneous improvisation. They felt ill at ease with conventional subjects and styles, neither of which could adequately convey their new vision. In fact, style as such almost ceased to exist with the Abstract Expressionists, and they drew their inspiration from all directions.\nThe painters who came to be called ``Abstract Expressionists'' shared a similarity of outlook rather than of style-- an outlook characterized by a spirit of revolt and a belief in freedom of expression. The main exponents of the genre were\nbut other artists included\nThe term Abstract Expressionism was first used by Robert Coates in the March issue of the New Yorker in 1936. The movement was hugely successful, partly due to the efforts of the critics Harold Rosenberg and Clement Greenberg who also originated the terms Action Painting and American Style.\nStella's works have been called critical rebellion against abstract expressionism as well as heralded as examples of it. The works of Frank Stella have evolved to exhibit the extravagant designs, wild flourishes, and vivid, variety of the chromatic spectrum that makes him an expressionist. But on the surface, his first works seem hardly effusive or passionate. Still, even the minimal, geometric patterns of his early work must not be dismissed as simple and cold. They hint at the deep mystery and illusion as he breaks the structure of framing and two-dimensional ground and maintains personality of line even in the deceptively hard-edge Black and Metallic exhibit. His more recent pieces, high relief collages and metallic sculpture, are more clearly bold, progressive works influenced by abstract expressionism.\nPollock, Jackson (1912-56). American painter, the commanding figure of the Abstract Expressionist movement.(also known as Jack the dripper)\n``On the floor I am more at ease, I feel nearer, more a part of the painting, since this way I can walk around in it, work from the four sides and be literally `in' the painting.'' -- Jackson Pollock, 1947.\nHe began to study painting in 1929 at the Art Students' League, New York, under the Regionalist painter Thomas Hart Benton. During the 1930s he worked in the manner of the Regionalists, being influenced also by the Mexican muralist painters (Orozco, Rivera, Siqueiros) and by certain aspects of Surrealism. From 1938 to 1942 he worked for the Federal Art Project. By the mid 1940s he was painting in a completely abstract manner, and the `drip and splash' style for which he is best known emerged with some abruptness in 1947. Instead of using the traditional easel he affixed his canvas to the floor or the wall and poured and dripped his paint from a can; instead of using brushes he manipulated it with `sticks, trowels or knives' (to use his own words), sometimes obtaining a heavy impasto by an admixture of `sand, broken glass or other foreign matter'. This manner of Action painting had in common with Surrealist theories of automatism that it was supposed by artists and critics alike to result in a direct expression or revelation of the unconscious moods of the artist.\nPollock's name is also associated with the introduction of the All-over style of painting which avoids any points of emphasis or identifiable parts within the whole canvas and therefore abandons the traditional idea of composition in terms of relations among parts. The design of his painting had no relation to the shape or size of the canvas -- indeed in the finished work the canvas was sometimes docked or trimmed to suit the image. All these characteristics were important for the new American painting which matured in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Action painting: Pollock was the first ``all-over'' painter, pouring paint rather than using brushes and a palette, and abandoning all conventions of a central motif. He danced in semi-ecstasy over canvases spread across the floor, lost in his patternings, dripping and dribbling with total control. He said: ``The painting has a life of its own. I try to let it come through.'' He painted no image, just ``action'', though ``action painting'' seems an inadequate term for the finished result of his creative process. Lavender Mist is 3 m long (nearly 10 ft), a vast expanse on a heroic scale. It is alive with colored scribble, spattered lines moving this way and that, now thickening, now trailing off to a slender skein. The eye is kept continually eager, not allowed to rest on any particular area. Pollock has put his hands into paint and placed them at the top right-- an instinctive gesture eerily reminiscent of cave painters who did the same. The overall tone is a pale lavender, maide airy and active. At the time Pollock was heiled as the greatest American painter, but there are already those who feel his work is not holding up in every respect.\nLee Krasner (1908-84), who married Pollock in 1944, was not celebrated at all during her lifetime (cut short in 1956 by a fatal car crash), but it was actually she who first started covering the canvas with a passionate flurry of marks. The originality of her vision, its stiff integrity and its great sense of internal cohesion, is now beginning to be recognized. Cobalt Night (1962; 237 x 401 cm (7 ft 9 1/3 x 13 ft 2 in)) at 4 m (over 13 ft) is even larger than Lavender Mist and has the same kind of heroic ambition.\n1950 Change was in the air and on the walls. Europe's boldest artistic experiments had become almost mainstream. Startling innovations were being experimented in America by artists like Jackson Pollock, and Willem de Kooning to term the radical art movement Abstract expressionism. Abstract expressionism would take America by surprise. A leading New York School painter, Jackson Pollock (also known as Jack the dripper) delved into Karl Jung's theory of the collective unconsciouness. During this time modern paintings were to say the least abstract, and often dealt with the artists psyche and state of mind when the painting was created.\nLike movements in time, abstract expressionism would develop a new and improved look (so to speak). If abstract expressionism was to be thought of as abstract, hard edge painters took out the \"abstract\" in painting. Hard edge paintings exhibited calculated, impersonal expressionism; instead of spontaneous, subjective abstract expressionism. Hard edge painters preferred sharply contoured, simple forms. The paintings are termed as \"precise and cool\", as if made by machines. Frank Stella perfectly describes Hard edge painting as: \"What you see is what you see\"......."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:aacdea8e-3f68-4b5f-9db3-1a9a8a835698>","<urn:uuid:7ba8feea-6682-4256-9d25-8a9c6652dca9>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the key differences between wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) and automated sample preparation methods for drug monitoring in terms of sample processing time and analysis capabilities?","answer":"WBE and automated sample preparation have different capabilities and processing times. WBE can process 50-100 samples per day using rapid direct injection LC-MS/MS, taking less than 5 minutes per sample and requiring only 10 µL of sample with minimal preparation (just filtering). In contrast, automated sample preparation using the Biomek 4000 Workstation can process a full plate of 96 samples in just over three hours, including a two-hour incubation step. While WBE can analyze 165 substances ranging from pharmaceuticals to pesticides, automated sample preparation enables analysis of 56 compounds across multiple drug classes with high accuracy (89-109%) and precision (CVs below 18%). WBE focuses on community-level analysis through wastewater, while automated sample preparation is designed for individual biological fluid samples.","context":["Using Wastewater to Assess Near Real-Time Population Exposure to chemicals\nWastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) has become a valuable tool in understanding population health and exposure at large scales, and in near real time. This is due to the discharge of chemicals into wastewater from populations who consume or are exposed to an array of chemicals, including but not limited to pharmaceuticals, agricultural chemicals, illicit drugs, household cleaning products and explosives. Wastewater essentially represents a pooled urine sample from an entire community and when analysed with techniques such as liquid chromatography – mass spectrometry (LC-MS) we can gather insights into the health and wellbeing of this population.\nThe ECC team is highly involved in the development of platforms for large-scale analysis using wastewater-based epidemiology. Apart from daily sample processing and analysis, method development and validation remain key components to our work, along with publications in peer-reviewed journals to ensure a continuous high quality of results and robustness of methods. Our recently developed rapid direct injection LC-MS/MS method  allows us to quantify 165 substances ranging from pharmaceuticals to pesticides and illicit drugs in less than 5 minutes using only 10 µL of a sample, without further sample preparation apart from filtering. This efficient workflow allows a high throughput of over 50-100 samples in a single day. Furthermore, the group uses a high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) to perform sample ‘suspect screening’; a powerful tool that permits rapid identification of over 1,000 compounds. The screening results can then be used to prioritise the chemicals that need to be monitored quantitatively to assess exposure levels. Moreover, the data obtained can be used in machine learning models, such as retention time prediction to enable identification of large numbers of additional, unknown compounds.\nThe aim of the WBE project is to:\n1. Develop novel, scalable analytical methodologies for ultra-trace characterisation and measurement of hundreds-thousands of chemical residues in municipal wastewater which can be used to assess exposure.\n2. Determine the quantity and frequency of chemical exposure and any associated potential health impacts in and across catchments with high spatiotemporal resolution.\n3. Provide a near real-time early-warning system to track population exposure to toxic substances.\n4. Shortlist chemicals which may result in environmental exposure in the aquatic environment following treatment and discharge.\nThere is a wide range of sub-projects based on WBE ongoing within ECC. Example projects within this WBE portfolio include:\n1 – Estimation of population level illicit drug consumption\nWBE has been successfully used over the past two decades for estimation of community-scale consumption of illicit drugs. ECC is a member of the Sewage Analysis CORE group (SCORE) which is an international consortium of laboratories and was formed in 2011. This allowed the first WBE-based international comparison of usage patterns of drugs including cocaine, amphetamine, methamphetamine and MDMA. ECC has provided data for London which was estimated to be one of the highest consumers of cocaine globally by mass . The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) now includes SCORE data in its annual reports. WBE is a growing tool used to monitor community activity for drugs of misuse at near real time, providing data such as total daily masses of the substances and estimated per capita loads. Our efforts here have focused on scaling up platforms for large scale monitoring, with ECC being able to quantitatively analyse between 50-100 samples per day. We currently have a postdoctoral fellow (Dr Helena Rapp Wright) who is developing and applying new, rapid analytical approaches for WBE-assessment of drug consumption. We also have an MRC Centre for Environment and Health-funded PhD student (Ms Derryn Grant) working in partnership with the UK Health Security Agency focusing on developing analytical preparedness for opioid monitoring in wastewater including very potent substances like fentanyls.\n2 – Community-wide chemical use and exposure to potentially toxic substances\nExpanding WBE analytical platforms to include more substances enables a much more detailed insight into how events like a pandemic affects whole communities. Moreover, WBE is an excellent technique for assessing chemical exposures that we are not always aware of in our daily lives, such as plasticisers, mycotoxins and pesticides. This knowledge about chemical use and exposure then allows for the identification of potential hazards and the development of interventions that can help to improve a community’s overall health. Aligning our wastewater-based findings with publicly available NHS data creates an additional layer of robustness and enables the identification of potential behavioural changes and/or accessibility issues. We have a current PhD project (Ms Melanie Egli) focussing on monitoring the changes in exposure and use of >200 pharmaceuticals and toxic chemicals such as pesticides before, during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the potential risks of these changes on the receiving rivers where wastewater is discharged.\n3 – Intelligence and Security\nHigh-profile terrorist attack incidents are often associated with explosive threat agents, particularly homemade explosives (HMEs) and improvised explosive devices (IEDs). This is all attributed to the ease of synthesis and availability of a large and diverse number of industrial, agricultural, pharmaceutical and veterinary chemicals, which are designed for legitimate daily household use but can be easily used as precursors for the HMEs synthesis. Manufacturing of HMEs and IEDs often occurs discretely, and interception of such illegal activities is challenging. A new detection capability is proposed where detection of these threat markers through WBE can potentially be used as an early warning monitoring tool and a source of intelligence for law enforcement. This is a two-year project funded by the Government Office for Science and the Royal Academy of Engineering through the UK Intelligence Community Fellowship Scheme.\nPI: Dr Leon Braron","Automated Sample Preparation for the Monitoring of Pharmaceutical and Illicit Drugs by LC-MS/MS\nSCIEX Triple Quad™ 4500 LC/MS/MS system and Beckman Coulter Biomek 4000 Workstation\nLekh Sharma | Vision Laboratories, LLC, Chattanooga, TN, USA\nMichael Kowalski | Beckman Coulter Life Sciences, Indianapolis, IN, USA\nMichael Jarvis | SCIEX, Concord, ON, Canada\nAmy Gibson | Beckman Coulter Life Sciences, Indianapolis, IN, USA\nNavaline Quach | Beckman Coulter Life Sciences, Indianapolis, IN, USA\nAutomated sample preparation enables highly reproducible quantitative analyses while meeting the increased efficiency needs often required for sample processing in laboratories. This application note describes results obtained using a liquid handling-based automation system for the sample preparation of compounds to be analyzed by LC-MS/MS and applied to the monitoring of multiple classes of pharmaceutical and illicit drugs. This screen panel contains 56 compounds that could be identified and quantified over a wide range of concentrations from 0.5X to 10X the cut-off value. In addition, the large majority of the compounds could be analyzed with accuracy over 80% and CV under 15%. This method provides automated capabilities for analytical laboratories that currently routinely process samples manually for the monitoring of these drugs in biological fluids.\nLiquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry provides laboratories with a powerful tool for accurate, multiplexed analysis of large panels of compounds. As a consequence, this technology is being increasingly applied to the forensic screening of urine samples, to monitor for the potential diversion of prescription pharmaceutical drugs.\nAs the number of samples to be analyzed increases, the bench time required to process these samples, as well as the opportunity for errors in processing also increases. Automating the sample preparation prior to analysis by LCMS/ MS can increase the possible throughput, reduce the active bench time required to prepare even small numbers of samples, and minimize the number of human intervention points, thereby minimizing opportunities for error and maintaining the integrity of sample information. Automation can also eliminate the variability that is introduced by multiple technologists processing samples in slightly different fashions.\nIn this work, we have utilized a Biomek 4000 Workstation (Figure 1) to automate the sample processing for the forensic screening of pharmaceutical drugs in human urine on an SCIEX Triple Quad™ 4500 LC/MS/MS system\nFigure 1A. Beckman Coulter Biomek 4000 Workstation\nFigure 1B. SCIEX Triple Quad™ 4500 LC/MS/MS system.\nThis method enabled the analysis of 56 compounds across multiple drug classes, including the opiates, opioids, benzodiazepines, amphetamines, tricyclic antidepressants, barbiturates, and illicit drugs cannabis (THCCOOH), synthetic cannabinoids and bath salts. Standard curves were generated across 6 concentration levels, ranging from 0.5x – 10x the cut-off levels (Table 3), and excellent accuracy, precision, and curve linearity was observed.\nMaterials and Methods\nAutomated Sample Preparation\nThe automated sample preparation protocol is described in Table 1. Briefly, pre-cleared urine controls and samples were combined with acetate buffer and beta-glucuronidase. Following automated mixing, the plate was removed from the deck, capped, and heated to 55°C for 2 hours. Following incubation, curve diluent was added to each well and the plate was centrifuged to clear any precipitate in the samples. 200 μl of the supernatant was transferred to a new plate and analyzed by LC-MS/MS.\n|Step 1||Barcoded urine samples are added to a deepwell plate (“Samples”) and precleared by centrifugation at 4500 rpm in an Allegra X-30R (Beckman Coulter).||Manual|\n|Step 2||100 μL of samples, calibrators, and QC controls are transferred to a deepwell plate (“Assay”).||Automated|\n|Step 3||50 μL of 0.1 M pH 4 acetate buffer is added to each well.\n|Step 4||25 μL of β-glucuronidase (100,000 U/mL) is added to each well and the plate is shaken\n|Step 5||Plate is sealed and incubated in a water bath at 55°C for 2 hours.\n|Step 6||50 μL of internal standard is added to each well except for the double blank urine control,\nwhich receives 50 μL water.\n|Step 7||750 μL of curve diluent is added to each well and the plate is shaken to mix.\n|Step 8||Samples are centrifuged at 4500 rpm in an Allegra X-30R, for 15 minutes.\n|Step 9||200 μL of supernatant are transferred to a flat-bottomed plate (“LCMS”) for analysis.\n|Step 10||Analysis by LC-MS/MS system.\nTable 1.

In the software, users highlight the plate wells that contain samples or controls to initiate sample processing. To accelerate the sample preparation, reagents were added to full plate columns using the multichannel tools while partial columns (if any) were transferred using the single channel tool. The volumes of reagents and standards were also set as variables to enable easy alterations during initial optimization studies. The Biomek 4000 deck layouts for pre- and post-incubation steps are illustrated in Figure 2.\nUpon completion of the methods text files are generated to ensure data such as sample barcodes are maintained throughout the workflow, and these barcodes can be pasted into an “Analyst batch” for LC-MS/MS analysis.\nFigure 2. Software representation of the Biomek 4000 deck demonstrating the labware utilized for preincubation (top) and postincubation (bottom) automated methods.\nAnalyses by LC/MS/MS\nHPLC separation was performed using a Shimadzu Prominence LC-20XR system and mass spectrometric detection was performed using the SCIEX Triple Quad™ 4500 LC/MS/ MS system (Figure 1), equipped with Turbo V™ ionization source (Temperature = 600°C; Gas1 = 60; Gas2 = 50; Curtain Gas = 25). The temperature of the autosampler was set at 15°C.\nThe prepared (hydrolyzed and cleaned) samples were injected onto the system, and the chromatographic separation was achieved using a Phenomenex Kinetex Biphenyl (50x3.0mm, 2.6μm) column, at 40°C. The separation employed a binary gradient of mobile phases A (HPLC-grade water with 0.1% formic acid) and B (methanol with 0.1% formic acid). The LC-MS/MS data acquisition was done using the Analyst 1.6.2 software. Multiquant 3.0.1 software was used for data processing, and reporting. Two MRM transitions were used to monitor each analyte, and a single MRM transition was used to monitor each internal standard. The Scheduled MRM™ algorithm was employed, to maximize the acquisition dwell time for each analyte and thereby improve data quality.\nEach sample was injected twice: the first injection utilized an LC-MS/MS method that was optimized for the analysis of those analytes that ionize preferentially in positive electrospray ionization (ESI) mode (including the opiates, opioids, benzodiazepines, amphetamines, tricyclic antidepressants, and other illicit drugs); the second injection utilized an LC-MS/MS method that was optimized for the analysis of those analytes that ionize preferentially in negative mode (Butalbital, Phenobarbital, and THC-COOH). For the positive ESI analytes (Ion Spray voltage = 2500), 10μl of sample were injected and run at a flow rate of 0.6mL/min for a 7 min run time with the following time profile for mobile phase B: 0-0.5 minute hold at 10% B; 0.5-2.0 minute ramp from 10-25% B; 2.0-4.5 minute ramp from 25-80% B; 4.5-5.5 minute hold at 85% B; 5.5-7.0 minute hold (re-equilibrate) at 10% B (Figure 3). Each analyte was monitored during a 50-second detection window centered on the expected Retention Time. For the negative ESI analytes (Ion Spray voltage = -4500), 20μL of sample were injected and run at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min for a 5 min run time with the following profile for mobile phase B: 0-1.5 minute ramp from 25-85% B; 1.5- 3.0 minute ramp from 85-95% B; 3.1-5.0 minute hold (re-equilibrate) at 25% B (Figure 4). Each analyte was monitored during a 30-second detection window centered on the expected Retention Time.\nFigure 3.

Overlaid is a representative chromatogram displaying all analytes at their respective cut-off concentration levels.\nA full plate of 96 samples and controls can be processed in just over three hours, including the two hour incubation step and offline centrifugation. The reproducibility of the automated sample preparation protocol was assessed by preparing and analyzing replicates (n=6) of each calibration standard for the 56 target analytes. A total of 6 concentration levels were prepared and analyzed, across a concentration range from 0.5x – 10x the cut-off levels. The method displayed good sensitivity, accuracy, precision, and linearity for all analytes. Representative calibration curves are shown in Figure 5 for (a) Hydrocodone, (b) Butalbital, (c) Methadone, and (d) Amphetamine. Representative chromatograms at the cut-off level are displayed in Figure 6, for each of these four analytes, demonstrating the excellent sensitivity of this method. Table 3 shows the average accuracy and coefficient of variation (CV) across the six detection levels for the 56 analytes. The average accuracies ranged from 89% to 109%. The average CVs were below 18% for all analytes, with 49 out of 56 analytes having average CVs below 10%. The average accuracy at each calibration level across all 56 analytes ranged from 92% to 102%, as shown in Table 2, with CVs below 11% at the lowest calibrator level (0.5X cut-off). From the 336 data points that were analyzed (56 compounds, at 6 different concentrations), 98% displayed accuracy over 80% and 92% displayed CVs under 15% (data not shown).\nFigure 5.

{"question":"I'm learning about data classification: how do discrete data types in Six Sigma relate to the different categories of electric vehicle consumers and charging patterns?","answer":"Six Sigma's discrete data types directly apply to EV consumer categories and charging patterns. Discrete nominal data classifies EV types into categories like BEVs and PHEVs, while discrete binary data captures yes/no consumer decisions about EV purchases. Discrete ordinal data applies to consumer preference ratings, shown in the 2019 survey where 50% expressed interest in EVs and 28% planned to purchase one. The numeric discrete data appears in counting aspects like the number of charging stations, while attribute data helps categorize different customer types (individual, fleet, business) and charging locations (home, office, public spaces).","context":["The Six Sigma approach is a data-driven approach to problem-solving. It stands to reason that the people who study in a Lean Six Sigma Green Belt course will be confronted with different data types in Six Sigma measure phase. Even some reputable free Six Sigma Green Belt Certification training will cover different types of data when discussing the Six Sigma Measure phase of the DMAIC process. Understanding the different data types of Six Sigma measure phase is critical to the successful execution of the Six Sigma Measure phase as it affects how data will be measured, collected, analyzed and interpreted.\nUnderstanding different data types of Six Sigma Measure Phase\nBefore we move towards the concept of types of data of Six Sigma measure phase, let’s first look at what “data” means. Data refers to organized or unorganized information. It can be numbers, words, measurements, observations or even just descriptions of things.\nTypes of data affects the execution of Six Sigma Measure phase\nIn the Six Sigma measure phase of the DMAIC process, before doing actual data collection, the project team should consider some statistical techniques including types of data and sampling. This is because these statistical techniques and the types of data that will be collected will affect how the team goes about collecting the data. The “X” or “Y” data in Six Sigma methodology can be either continuous data or discrete data. In other words, continuous and discrete are two different data types often used in Six Sigma measure phase.\nUnderstanding the difference between continuous and discrete data is important because the difference influences how Six Sigma project teams define their measures, how they collect their data, and what they can learn from it. The difference also affects the sampling of data and how they will analyze it too. So we may say that it affects the whole Six Sigma measure phase.\nThe 1st Data Type of Six Sigma Measure Phase: Discrete Data\nDiscrete numeric data of Six Sigma Measure Phase\nLet’s take a closer look at what discrete data means for Six Sigma measure phase. Discrete data is also known as attribute data. Discrete numeric data is countable in the sense that you can count how many of something there are. You can count items with a specific characteristic, or you can count the number of occurrences of an event or incident (Count Data). Discrete numeric data is measured by the presence or absence of a particular characteristic of each device that is being tested during Six Sigma measure phase.\nExamples of discrete numeric data for Six Sigma measure phase would be:\n- Number of people who pass a test\n- Count of errors or number of errors on a bill\n- Software errors in a software program\n- Number of defects in a sample\n- Number of days in a week\n- Number of dimples on a golf ball\n- Number of people in a stadium or arena\n- Number of parts damaged in shipment\n- Number of hours in a day\nDiscrete attribute data of Six Sigma Measure Phase\nLet us now study what discrete attribute data means for Six Sigma measure phase. Discrete attribute data is qualitative in nature. Think of attributes as a way of categorizing or bucketing things. Let take a simple example. Animals could be a Cat, Dog, Rabbit or a Gerbil. A product ordered could be a CD, MP3 file or DVD. Not only can you count how many items have a certain attribute but you can also count how many items do not have a certain attribute. This can also be converted into a percentage. Now, let us study the 3 types of Discrete Attribute Data of Six Sigma measure phase.\nDiscrete ordinal data\nThe first type is discrete ordinal data. A set of data is said to be ordinal if the values/observations belonging to it can be ranked or put in order or have a rating scale attached. Note that ordinal data can be counted and set in order but it cannot be measured. For example, “The third tallest person in the class” (We don’t know how tall, only that there are two others taller than this person).\nLet’s have a look at another example. Suppose a group of people was asked to taste varieties of biscuits and classify each biscuit on a rating scale of 1 to 5. The rating scale of 1 represents “Strongly Dislike,” the scale of 2 represents “Dislike,” The scale of 3 represents “Neutral,” the scale of 4 represents “Like, ” and the rating of 5 represents “Strongly Like.” In this case, a rating of 5 indicates more liking or enjoyment than the rating of 4. Such data are ordinal.\nDiscrete nominal data\nThe second type is discrete nominal Data. This type of data is descriptive, and not numeric, with more than two categories, for example; names, phone numbers, colors, type of car, capital cities and states. In a more general form, the data, assigned with labels or names, are considered as the data in nominal scale. Since each label or name indicates a separate category of the data, this data is also called ‘Categorical Data.’\nNominal data can also be equated to discrete values, for example, to distinguish among people such as sales representatives, marketing representatives, etc. However, to maintain some anonymity, they could be coded and referred to a discrete number whereby Sally = 1, John = 2, Michael = 3, and Ricky = 4. Moreover, the data, related to gender, race, religious affiliation, political affiliation, etc., are also nominal data.\nDiscrete binary data\nThe third type is discrete binary data. It is a qualitative or categorical type of data made up of two classifications. For example, Yes/No, Pass/Fail, On/Off, Male/Female, Good/Bad, Agree/Disagree, etc.\nThe 2nd Data Type of Six Sigma Measure Phase: Continuous Data\nContinuous data of Six Sigma measure phase is also known as variable data. Common continuous measures are time, money and any physical measurement such as weight, height, length or temperature. Continuous Data can take on any value on a continuous scale such as temperature, distance, cycle time, profit. This is a type of data that is usually associated with some sort of physical measurement. Continuous data or measures are only those things that can be measured on an infinitely divisible continuum or scale.\nThe examples for continıus data of Six Sigma measure phase are as follows:\n- Time (Hours, Minutes and Seconds)\n- Height (Feet, Inches, Fractions of an inch and so on)\n- Sound Level (Decibels)\n- Temperature (Degrees Celcius and Fahrenheit)\n- Electrical resistance (Ohms)\n- Money (Dollars, Yens, Euros, and fractions thereof)\nHow to Distinguish The Different Data Types of Six Sigma Measure Phase?\nHave a look at the figure below. This chart on data types of Six Sigma measure phase is a kind of summarized chart on discrete and continuous types of data. Please remember a fundamental rule about types of data here. Discrete data is all about counting while continuous data is all about measurements.\nLet’s see how we are supposed to read this table. Look at the first column titled ‘Measurement.’ In the first row, the objective is to measure the time of the day. The units of measurement are hours, minutes and seconds. It is a piece of continuous data. Moving on in the same row, ordinal data for measuring the time of the day has been noted as 1, 2, and 3 without indicating any order among them. We can count 1, 2, 3 as 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours, etc. It is a piece of discrete ordinal data. Nominal data is not applicable to be measured against the time of the day. In the case of binary data, the time of the day can be measured as am/pm only. The time during the day can be expressed either as am or pm. It’s simply a close-ended answer.\nA quick and easy way to distinguish data types of Six Sigma Measure Phase\nNow, to understand the crux of data types of Six Sigma measure phase here is a quick test for distinguishing between discrete and continuous measures. Please have a look at the next table in the figure above. Think about the “Unit of Measure,” or the thing being measured and then ask yourself if “half of that thing” makes sense. If the answer is yes, then the measure is “Continuous.” If the answer is No, then we have a “Discrete” measure.\nKnowledge of different data types of Six Simga measure phase is essential for the Six Sigma practitioner. The data types that he or she will be confronted with during the Six Sigma measure phase of a project will affect how the data is collected, analyzed and interpreted. Before you can collect data, you must first understand types of data and how it applied to your project during Six Sigma measure phase. Now that you know how to distinguish between the different types of data, you are ready to collect data for your project in Six Sigma measure phase.","Utilities in the age of electric vehicles\nUtilities in the age of electric vehicles\nUtilities in the age of electric vehicles\nThe impact of vehicles on the environment has driven regulatory mandates to adopt a more sustainable way of commuting. As a result, electric vehicles (EVs), and the necessary infrastructure to operate them, has changed the automobile and utility industries over the past decade.\nElectric vehicles are powered by a charged battery pack and can be separated into two categories:\n- Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs): These EVs are purely electric with lithium ion batteries suitable for short to medium distances.\n- Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs): Electric vehicles with an internal combustion engine (ICE) with support from a small electric motor.\nWhy Electric Vehicles?\nThe 2015 Paris Agreement has challenged countries to reduce their carbon emissions to “net zero” over the coming years. This international treaty has prompted governments around the world to phase out gas and diesel powered vehicles, shifting instead to EVs:\nSales of electric vehicles have grown steadily over the last decade. The following chart from the International Energy Agency shows China leading market share at 47%. Twenty other countries have reached a market share of above 1%: emissions. As a segment, the automobile industry can tout sustainability and the environmental benefits of emerging technologies to entice consumers to buy EVs.\nAccording to a study by IRENA (International Renewable Energy Agency) on EVs:\n- Electric passenger cars will reach 200 million by 2030\n- Electric two-wheeled and three-wheeled vehicles could outnumber four-wheeled vehicles, with as many as 900 million on roads by 2030\n- Electric buses and light-duty vehicles could surpass 10 million by 2030\nFactors Contributing to EV Adoption\n1. Consumer Interest:\nEco-friendly consumers who want to decrease their carbon footprint prefer to buy EVs. Transportation around the globe is one of the biggest contributors of carbon emissions. As a segment, the automobile industry can tout sustainability and the environmental benefits of emerging technologies to entice consumers to buy EVs. A 2019 international electric vehicle consumer survey (of 7,600 consumers in seven regions) shows consumer interest in electric vehicles is high. 50% of consumers say they’re interested in owning an EV and 28% say they’ll purchase one as their next vehicle.\nConsumer benefits to owning electric vehicles:\n- Reduced operating costs, lower charging prices and simpler maintenance\n- Quieter driving experience\n- Exemption in Clean Air Zones – areas that charge fees to vehicles that pollute the environment\n- Government subsidies that make EVs cheaper than ICE vehicles\n- Preferential parking permits in dense urban areas\nEV technology has vastly improved. Range limitations and charging times have been addressed, alleviating concerns and increasing purchase momentum. Consider these three, top selling EV models in the world in 2020:\n3. NetZero Target:\nIn support of the 2015 Paris Agreement, utility and automobile companies are working to achieve net-zero emissions. To do this, they’re offering customers low-carbon products such as renewable electricity and electric vehicles. By taking advantage of these offerings, individual consumers can reduce their carbon footprint. Businesses can reduce their overall cost of fleet ownership, and organisations can reduce fuel costs, reap tax benefits and take advantage of government incentives.\nChallenges for Utilities:\nEVs help combat climate change. However, barriers to adoption exist:\nCharging Pricing: An increase in the number of electric vehicles can lead to disorganised charging. This makes peak shaving difficult, creates incremental costs for generators, increases transmission and distribution pressures and reduces grid reliability and security. It also degrades power quality and increases the harmonics of the grid. Ultimately, an unreasonable pricing structure can lead to its failure. A dynamic pricing strategy can help utilities overcome the challenges of EVs and can reduce the burden of power on a grid.\nComplex Billing: EVs also present billing challenges for utilities:\n- Number of Stakeholders: Charging hosts, charging point operators, eMobility service providers, roaming network providers, etc. are all involved in the billing process. These stakeholders have to manage multiple plans – pre-paid, postpaid, ad hoc, group plans, etc.\n- Customer Type and Charging Location: Plans offered will vary based on customer type such as individual, fleet, business, public and private. They’ll also vary based on location, including home, office, fleet charging center, parking lot, multi-tenant unit, municipal location and more.\n- Price Per Charge: The customer can be charged based on charge point, price per kWh or by minute/ hour (flat fee). The charging session may include ancillary fees such as a connection fee or a waiting fee for staying connected after reaching a full charge.\nCharging Infrastructure: The mechanics of charging pose challenges to utility companies:\n- Network: Availability remains limited\n- Technology: Fast-charge still in its initial stage and widely unavailable in the network\n- Customer Experience: Unpredictable charging experience negatively affects customer opinion\nService and Maintenance: Electric vehicles require specialised mechanics who are still difficult to find. According to a study done by UK’s Institute of the Motor Industry (IMI), 97% of today’s mechanics aren’t qualified to work on electric vehicles. Of the 3% of mechanics who do qualify, many work directly for EV dealerships, limiting service options for general EV buyers.\nHigher Upfront Investment: Higher manufacturing costs vs. the cost to make a combustion engine vehicle make EVs more expensive to buy. This sticker shock feeds consumer doubt about the long-term economic benefits of an electric vehicle. Government subsidisations help alleviate that doubt, but total consumer buy-in will take time.\nThe Utility Opportunity\nAs more people switch to electric cars, the impact of EV charging loads on generation, transmission and distribution networks translates into more energy and more revenue opportunities for utility companies.\n- Charging Infrastructure: Utilities can play a vital role in modulating charging rates and shifting charging times to provide grid services that support supply and demand. Consider these energy giants already investing in charging infrastructure:\n- Shell recently announced the rollout of 500,000 electric charging stations over the next four years.1\n- Ecotricity a “Big Six” UK energy supplier, partners with Moto, RoadChef and Welcome Break to offer 45-minute fast-charge stations. They call the network “The Electric Highway.”2\n- In the UK, companies like Centrica are building out their EV charging capabilities by acquiring smaller independents. Centrica invested in Driivz, a software company that manages EV fleets and charging networks, to create Centrica Electric Vehicle Services (CEVS) 3\n- New EV Tariffs: Consumer tariff structures (e.g. time-of-use tariffs) reward consumers who slow-charge during off-peak hours. These tariffs, which reduce consumer bills and prevent overloads on the grid, help influence EV drivers to shift their charging behavior. By partnering with EV manufacturers, utility companies can create custom electricity tariffs that can be bundled into the purchase of an electric vehicles. Energy suppliers in the US, UK and other European countries have already begun offering EV energy tariffs.\n- Improved Customer Experience: Careful planning, phased execution and synergy with non-utility businesses can help electric utilities facilitate a smooth transition to EV adoption. With the right customer relationship management (CRM) platform in place, utilities can offer consumers “charging ecosystems” – chargers, charging plans, etc. - for their vehicle. This positive consumer experience, combined with the financial upside of aligning with non-utility companies, translates into increased revenue for the utility company.\n- Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G): While EV tariffs can prevent overloads by shifting charging behavior, they also present challenges. If too many EV drivers charge during off-peak times, it can spike load levels and lead to grid congestion. To counter this, vehicle-to-grid (V2G) enables energy to be pushed back to the power grid from the battery of an electric vehicle. This helps balance the variations in energy production and consumption. Furthermore, V2G can support the integration of renewable energy resources into the grid.\n- AI Driven EV Marketing: With electric vehicle purchases on the rise, utilities must position themselves at the forefront of energy innovation to ensure brand credibility. AI-driven marketing helps identify crucial digital touchpoints for targeted messaging.\n- Data Advantages: Utilities can use data analytics and data science tools to develop services, applications and hyper-personalised product offerings. They can also leverage the data to expand into non-core markets. This allows for:\n- Joint offerings with automotive companies\n- After sales services in conjunction with car dealerships\n- Installation of charging stations at locations where customers park electric vehicles for more than an hour\nGlobally the uptake of electric vehicles is leading to the transportation and electricity sectors becoming increasingly connected.\nEven though barriers to EV adoption exist they are phasing out due to technological advancements. Innovation is the key in identifying opportunities to minimise costs and reducing pain points.\nFor utilities the biggest challenges is to ensure grid reliability and resilience. Providing a successful infrastructure for EV adoption will require coordination among various parties - Vehicle & charging manufactures, Electricity service providers, Distribution network operators, and Regulatory authorities\nIn the long run - Utilities that invest in electric vehicle infrastructure and technology will be well-equipped to offer solutions that benefit future customers.\n2Ecotricity and Nissan install UK electric-car-charging network | Guardian sustainable business | The Guardian\nEXL Utilities Academy"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:1d32ba5c-c409-4700-8124-8f355113a8e2>","<urn:uuid:dc7f0a0b-46cd-416c-b618-7a830371a8fd>"],"error":null}

{"question":"How does blocking orexin receptors affect sleep disorders versus stress conditions?","answer":"Blocking orexin receptors has different effects depending on the condition. For sleep disorders, orexin receptor antagonists inhibit excitatory input to arousal systems and create conditions for sleep, with drugs like Suvorexant showing efficacy in treating insomnia. In stress conditions, blocking specifically the orexin 2 receptor decreases stress levels, but only on day one of repeated stress. However, in panic disorder-like states with hyperactive stress, blocking orexin 2 receptor becomes effective throughout five days of stress exposure, suggesting different mechanisms of action depending on the condition being treated.","context":["Dr. Grossi's Blog\nDisturbances of the sleep cycle are among the most common disturbances associated with psychiatric disorders. The most common sleep disturbance is insomnia but oversleeping can also be an issue. Insomnia can involve falling asleep (initial insomnia), staying asleep (middle insomnia), or early morning awakening (delayed insomnia). Usually people with this problem do not feel rested when awakened and usually experience irritability, anxiety, fatigue and reduced productivity the following day. I intend to set out the current understanding of the sleep/wake cycle in this blog.\nSleep is a regularly occurring state of unconsciousness resulting from two competing internal processes. Those processes are designated homeostatic which controls the amount of sleep and circadian which controls the timing of sleep. In the homeostatic process the longer one is awake the stronger the drive to sleep. So, as a normal day progresses the homeostatic drive increases and abates when one sleeps. If one is sleep deprived, then the homeostatic process increases to become overwhelming. The circadian process is a synchronization of many bodily processes which starts with an area called the suprachiasmatic nucleus in the hypothalamus. Signals from that nucleus influence the sleep/wake cycle, hormone release, body temperature, and other physiological systems. It is the opposition of these two systems that consolidates sleep and wakefulness into discrete periods. The opposition can be thought of as similar to a teeter totter. When weight is added to one end that end falls, when weight is added to the other end or weight is taken from the original end, then the balance shifts. So the wake promoting and sleep promoting work to inhibit one another. If wake promoting activity is higher then sleep promoting is inhibited and one is awake. I sleep promoting activity is greater, then wake promoting is inhibited and one is asleep.\nThe neurobiology and neurophysiology underlying these competing systems is far from clear and established. It would appear sleep promoting involves GABA, galanin, and melatonin whereas wake promoting involves orexin (hypocretin), norepinephrine, histamine, serotonin, and acetylcholine. GABA is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the human brain. Orexin is a peptide produced by neurons in the lateral hypothalamus and tilts the balance toward wakefulness. This discovery was made in narcoleptics who are orexin deficient. GABA is driven by the homeostatic process whereas orexin is driven by the circadian process.\nSince the 1960s with the advent of the benzodiazepines the clinical treatment of sleep has focused on the sleep promoting side of the equation. The drugs thus used include all the household names. Doxepin was the first agent aimed to block wakefulness rather than promote sleep. Histamine levels increase during the night which is the likely explanation for H blockers promoting sleep maintenance. With the discovery of the orexin system and its wakefulness promoting actions, a whole new approach has opened for sleep therapeutics. Antagonists that block the orexin receptors inhibit excitatory input to arousal systems and create the conditions for sleep. Such drugs are on the horizon and should be in the marketplace soon. One such drug, Suvorexant, has demonstrated efficacy at all doses and tolerability. It should be with us in months.\nThis blog was stimulated by the confluence of several events at the end of May and beginning of June. I was asked by the parent of a patient about my experience as the expert witness in the 1972 Prosenjit Poddar trial which became the Tarasoff case. The rules derived from that California Supreme Court case still govern the disclosure psychiatrists and other mental health workers must make when a patient is threatening harm to someone in the community. A few days after discussing this case, a young Californian, Roger Elliot, killed six people near Santa Barbara. About two weeks later 60 Minutes had an extended piece on mass murderers. In the past I have avoided high profile topics like this in these blogs; however, I decided to make an exception in this matter because I have had some experience as an expert in certain murder defenses and there are substantial debatable public health and safety issues which need airing.\nA cardinal distinction that psychiatrists draw when evaluating any patient or perpetrator is whether the individual is psychotic. This broad term is often defined as \"loss of contact with reality\", and typically includes hallucinations, delusions, inability to think clearly, drawing incorrect conclusions which cannot be corrected even when clear contradictory information is presented. Some recent examples include James Holmes who thought he was \"The Joker\" and killed twelve people at a Colorado theater; Anders Breivik thought he was the future ruler of Norway, Europe's Perfect Knight and killed seventy-seven people in Norway; and Seung-Hui Cho who thought he was Jesus Christ and said he vacationed with Vladimir Putin in North Carolina. He killed thirty-two at Virginia Tech. Psychosis can be caused by a psychiatric illness, substances, or medical illness.\nAbout 2.7 to 3 million people in the United States population of approximately 317 million people suffer from severe mental illnesses and about one in seven commit murder. Of this number about 50% are psychotic. The remaining 50% are motivated by anger, jealousy, revenge, or attention secured by being a \"copy cat.\" These numbers exclude war, terrorism, and gang activity.\nThere are a number of features that distinguish psychotic killers from non-psychotic killers. The psychotic killer usually acts alone, rarely tries to flee from the authorities, and is usually killed at the scene either by suicide or \"suicide by cop.\" They are generally not under the influence of alcohol or drugs, are Caucasian and older than thirty, often unemployed, and usually telegraph their plans verbally, in writing, or on the internet. When looking back at their lives, they often demonstrate a fluctuating level of functioning from superior to impaired. Their actions are not usually impulsive but planned and they often know that they are behaving illegally. The individuals at greatest risk are family, friends, neighbors and mental health workers.\nThere are about 20 instances of psychotic mass murder in the United States each year. This rate has been stable for the last forty years. This is both a public health and safety problem. The public debate about prevention in the United States is almost exclusively focused on gun control. In my view this is too narrow a focus. I think a comprehensive strategy needs to be considered beyond guns because they are generally available and plentiful. Furthermore they are not always the instrument used in these tragedies. In addition, a significant number of psychotic perpetrators have been in contact with the mental health system but have been ineffectively treated. This shouts out loud and clear to me that the system needs reform. Such reform would perforce require a reappraisal of the balance between individual freedom and involuntary treatment or commitment. Once the public debate has taken place, community leaders should shepherd the changes into law. Follow up for patients discharged from psychiatric units needs study and improvement. Certain treatment modalities, long acting injections for certain patients, need to be discussed and guidelines for their use changed so as to increase medication compliance in very problematic patients. Finally, it strikes me as inappropriate to task the police with evaluating the mental state of individuals in the community. These evaluation when done properly require a working knowledge of psychiatric conditions, physiological responses to legal and illegal substances, and the impact of social circumstances on the individual in question. These evaluations should be performed by well-trained and experienced mental health professionals if the community interest is maximum accuracy and minimum errors.\nOne week ago a patient was talking to me in the office and disclosed that he was paranoid about a particular upcoming experience. He was using the word as a synonym for anxious, tense, apprehensive. This represents a colloquial slang usage of the word \"paranoid.\" Psychiatrists use the word paranoid to mean suspicious, mistrustful. I will not be addressing a common form found in paranoid schizophrenia, because that would be mixing two confusing diagnoses, i.e., paranoid and schizophrenia. Paranoia is a way of thinking or feeling that is pervasive and whose severity varies from relatively mild to loss of reality as, for example, in delusions. The more severe, the more normal functioning is compromised.\nTraits of people who are often paranoid include those who are emotionally constricted, fearful, and suspicious. Others are rigidly arrogant and more aggressively suspicious.The trait or attitude of suspiciousness involves the continual expectation of trickery and if chronic leads to a way of thinking. Rigidity refers to having something on a person's mind which causes that person to look at their experience with certain expectations and search for confirmation of those expectations. If someone tries to dissuade the individual from his original view, that person will become an object of suspicion. So, the paranoid person does not pay attention to new facts, doesn't see apparent meaning, but \"looks through\" the obvious and sees an aspect that confirms the original view, i.e., examination of the data takes place with prejudice so that there is confirmation of the original thought. Anything that contradicts this is dismissed as mere appearance. The paranoid individual is incapable of any other type of attention. His attention is tense, rigid, actively searching with a biased purpose and intensely concentrating.\nEveryone has some expectations to help guide them in their view. We are all influenced by what we see and what we don't expect. Those people that are suggestible are easily influenced by whatever striking fact or view or opinion presents itself. People with strong views impose their anticipation on the facts. Paranoid people seek confirmation of their anticipations and these in turn allow them to disregard apparent contradictory facts. In this way the paranoid's mind becomes an instrument of bias and leads to \"brilliantly perceptive mistakes\", that is, the perception can be correct but the judgment wrong. They are hypersensitive and hyperalert. Anything out of the ordinary or surprising triggers their suspiciousness and heightens their extreme tension. What would appear to be obvious to most people in a given circumstance is to them mere appearance and disregarded. They need to look beyond. They listen for clues. In this was they loose the tone and color of experience and those features that modify and qualify experience or convey a sense of proportion or scale. They are over represented in fanatics. These are the cognitive mechanisms that lead to a distortion of reality or in the extreme a loss of reality.","What’s going on inside our bodies and brains when we respond to stress? Previously, we covered research into powerful little neuropeptides called orexins that may help regulate an individual’s vulnerability to stress. Now, we dug into fresh research from the lab of Seema Bhatnagar, PhD, an associate professor in the division of Stress Neurobiology at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, and conducted by Laura Grafe, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow. Dr. Grafe studies how orexins regulate behavioral and neuroendocrine responses to repeated stress. (Or, in other words, how animals behave when exposed to a stressor multiple times.) The exciting research of Dr. Grafe and her colleagues appeared recently in Neuroscience. When we chatted with Drs. Bhatnagar and Grafe, we learned five fascinating facts about how orexin can affect an individual’s stress response – and what that might mean about building resilience.\nOrexins increase arousal and can affect sleep, binge-eating, and habituation to stress.\nOrexin is a neuropeptide that’s been associated with sleep, appetite, and more recently, stress. It’s known to mediate arousal and alertness in the body. In the case of sleep, blocking orexins can help to combat insomnia, while too little orexin can cause narcolepsy. In the case of stress, high orexin levels have been linked with a higher stress response.\n“We know that with a single stressor, if you block orexins, you reduce the stress response,” Dr. Grafe said.\nIn the new study, however, she and her colleagues looked into a lesser-known aspect of the phenomenon: How orexins might be involved in the habituation to repeated stress – or what Bhatnagar describes as a “decreased response to a familiar stress that you have been exposed to over and over again.” A simplified example might be a freshman college student becoming acclimated to the onslaught of exams and homework and, with experience, finding they don’t get as flustered.\nOrexin levels drop over a period of repeated stress.\nDr. Grafe and her fellow researchers conducted a restraint test with rats: For 30 minutes a day, five days in a row, they limited the rat’s physical movement to study how the animals struggled in response. They then measured their orexin levels in the brain.\n“We found that by measuring levels of orexin in the cerebrospinal fluid and the activation of orexin neurons, both of these decreased over the five days of repeated stress,” Dr. Grafe said.\nThe finding shows that orexin levels do indeed fluctuate as the rats habituate or adapt to repeated stress – and that orexin may even play a key role in that habituation. While this was fascinating in itself, the researchers wanted to know how and why exactly this happens, and also what might happen under conditions of extreme stress, as seen in panic disorders. Learning the mechanisms behind a decrease in orexin can help researchers design treatments to mimic that process.\nBlocking the orexin 2 receptor decreases stress levels for just day one.\nOrexin has two receptors: orexin 1 and orexin 2. As with all receptors, different receptors can produce different effects when attached to a respective chemical. Using an orexin receptor antagonist, the researchers blocked the actions of orexin 2 over the course of the five days of stress to see whether stress levels still decreased in the absence of the chemical’s second receptor. From their observations, they found that orexin 2 receptor did appear to regulate the rat’s stress levels – but only on day one. One possible hypothesis: Orexin 1 receptor may play a larger role in the course of five days of repeated stress.\nIn a hyperactive state of stress, however, blocking the orexin 2 receptor decreases stress levels.\nAs part of the study, the researchers also wanted to create models of extremely high stress responses, such as panic disorder, to study how blocking orexin receptors might help with that.\n“What’s interesting is that with certain disease states like panic disorder, orexins are highly stimulated, and levels are much higher with those types of disorders,” Dr. Grafe said. “So what we wanted to do was model this.”\nThey used DREADDS technology (which stands for designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs) to stimulate the rat’s orexin neurons and release more orexins. In other words, the rats were incredibly stressed out.\n“We did this throughout the repeated stress to see what would happen in that hyperactive state of orexin activation,” Dr. Grafe said.\nThey found that orexin 2 now appeared to play a role in five days of stress – not just one – during this overstimulated state.\nWe can’t translate rat studies to human application just yet, but that’s the direction researchers hope to travel toward.\nWhile it’s tempting to make the connection between a rat’s behavior when put under restraint and our own resilience during our days of high pressure, we can’t exactly translate a rodent study into immediate human conclusions. Nevertheless, the researchers have their hypotheses.\n“What you can sort of hypothesize is that in somebody with panic disorder, where orexins are overstimulated, perhaps orexins are regulating their response to repeated stress,” Dr. Grafe said.\nFuture drugs may even be developed to block the actions of orexin 2, as Dr. Grafe did in the study, to soothe an aggressive stress response in the body. In current and upcoming research, Drs. Bhatnagar and Grafe will dig deeper into the link between orexins and vulnerability, and piece their discoveries together with other lab work on the neurobiology of stress resilience."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:0bd4d602-328d-467e-89a1-91da2d98479e>","<urn:uuid:4deed907-578d-4fb0-a18c-57bb0e737472>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How is the Fungo Baseball/Softball drill conducted for team practice?","answer":"The Fungo Baseball/Softball drill is conducted like an inter-squad scrimmage, but with key differences. Instead of live pitching, hitters toss the ball to themselves and hit fungoes where they want. It's set up as a competitive game that allows practice of various skills. The drill is particularly useful early in the season to simulate real game situations and when teams need to stay sharp on fundamentals like relays, backing up, and communication.","context":["There are many advantages to using a fungo bat. If you are a coach or a parent looking to improve your player's defensive skill set, you're going to want and need a fungo bat. A normal adult wooden baseball bat will weigh around 27-31 ounces, and after a couple of rounds of pop-flys, it is going to feel like you just went through a full-on workout. With the help of a fungo bat, you will be able to hit ground balls and pop flys all day without getting fatigued. The barrel on a fungo bat will typically be 2 1/4 inches in diameter which greatly helps increase your control over the bat through the hitting zone. While the barrel has a much more thin diameter, it is also much longer in comparison to a normal wood baseball bat. This larger hitting surface and smaller barrel combine to give coaches and parents quick swing speeds with precise accuracy.\nChris Coste, a former catcher for the Philadelphia Phillies who coaches at Division III Concordia, in Moorhead, Minn., agreed. “When baseball is every single day, you’ve got to do things differently,” he said. “In the big leagues, they get so many ground balls during batting practice that infield is more for the fans and more for the scouts and things like that. At this level, we need it, and we love doing it.”\nalso called jock or athletic supporter. An undergarment worn by boys and men for support of the testicles and penis during sports. A jockstrap by itself holds the testicles up and close to the body to help keep them from being squished between the thighs, or from twisting or hangingout. The jockstrap with cup pocket contains a pocket to hold a protective cup.\nAlright, let’s get to the drill. “Fungo Baseball/Softball” is a great drill for fielding and base running. It’s the same as playing an inter-squad scrimmage, except the pitchers do not throw live, and the hitters toss the ball to themselves and hit fungoes where they want. It is set up as a competitive game with an endless amount of teaching points. I really like to do this drill early in the season in order to simulate some real game like situations, and also when you’re on a hot streak and you’re looking to keep your team sharp on the little things like relays, backing up, and communication.\nWithin league standards there is ample latitude for individual variation, many batters settling on their own bat profile, or one used by a successful batter. Formerly, bats were hand-turned from a template with precise calibration points; today they are machine-turned to a fixed metal template. Historically significant templates may be kept in a bat manufacturers' vault; for example, Babe Ruth's template, which became popular among major-league players, is R43 in the Louisville Slugger archives.\nA rounded, solid wooden or hollow aluminum bat. Wooden bats are traditionally made from ash wood, though maple and bamboo is also sometimes used. Aluminum bats are not permitted in professional leagues, but are frequently used in amateur leagues. Composite bats are also available, essentially wooden bats with a metal rod inside. Bamboo bats are also becoming popular.\nIf your high school or travel team has at least two coaches, you can use what Bates calls a two-fungo drill. One coach can hit to third and second, while the other hits to short and first. If catchers are finished working with the pitchers, they can feed balls to the fungo hitters. The idea is for the third baseman to practice turning a 5-4-3, with the first baseman moving up toward second base about 60 feet instead of 90, with a net behind him to catch overthrows. The shortstop works on throwing across on 6-3s.\nMaple bats in particular were once known (circa 2008) to potentially shatter in a way that resulted in many sharp edges, sometimes creating more dangerous projectiles when a bat broke. Maple bat manufacture evolved significantly, in cooperation with Major League Baseball, paying special attention to grain slope, and including an ink spot test to confirm safest wood grain orientation."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:358bb266-c0c2-4cbb-9b31-602aa571f0ae>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do linear relationships in finance compare to linear relationships in general statistics?","answer":"In general statistics, linear relationships are represented by straight lines on plots and described by equations in the form y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. This concept is applied in finance through the security characteristic line, which specifically describes the relationship between an asset's and the market's excess returns. In finance, the slope is called beta and measures market sensitivity, while the y-intercept (alpha) measures investment performance relative to risk. Both applications use linear regression to fit equations through data points, though perfect linearity is rare in real-world data.","context":["Learn something new every day\nMore Info... by email\nA linear relationship occurs when a change in one or more independent variables that have a power of one or zero affects a dependent variable. Linear relationships are represented on plots as straight lines. In statistics, linear regression is used to fit a linear equation through a set of data points which are linearly related. An example from financial theory is the security characteristic line, which describes the linear relationship between an asset’s and the market’s excess returns.\nLinear relationships are typically described by linear equations written in the slope-intercept form y = mx + b. The independent variable x is plotted on the horizontal axis and the dependent variable y is plotted on the vertical axis. The constant m is the slope or steepness of the straight line. The constant b is called the y-intercept and is the value of y when the line crosses the vertical axis.\nIf a set of data points has a perfectly linear relationship, their plot will form a straight line. This rarely occurs with real world data, although a strong linear relationship may exist between two variables. Other times, the data is weakly linear, but a linear equation is still interesting since it is easy to work with and model. In both cases linear regression techniques, such as the least squares method, can be used to describe the relationship.\nStudying the linear relationship between two variables can be useful when predicting future behaviors. For example, linear regression could be used on data concerning wage rates over the last ten years, considering wages as a function of time. Expected wage rates for a particular year can be calculated using the linear equation and this information may be used to budget for savings and retirement.\nIn the Capital Asset Pricing Model, the security characteristic line is derived by linear regression on a single asset’s historical data and describes the linear relationship between systematic and unsystematic risk. The independent variable is the market’s excess return, and the dependent variable is the asset’s excess return. The y-intercept called alpha measures an investment’s return given its risk. If alpha is positive the investment has overperformed, if negative it has underperformed, and if zero its returns are adequate given the investment’s risks.\nThe slope of the characteristic line is called beta and describes the asset’s sensitivity to changes in the market. A positive beta means that the asset’s price moves with the market. If beta is between zero and one, then the asset’s price will fluctuate as much as the market and can reduce a portfolio’s volatility. If the beta is greater than one, then the asset will outperform the market if the market increases, but will underperform the market if the market decreases, thus allowing for higher earnings or losses.\nOne of our editors will review your suggestion and make changes if warranted. Note that depending on the number of suggestions we receive, this can take anywhere from a few hours to a few days. Thank you for helping to improve wiseGEEK!","What is Beta?\nBeta is a measure of the relationship between the rate of return of a company’s stock and the overall market return. It compares the volatility of a stock relative to that of the market. Beta indicates how an asset’s value has reacted to either a movement up or a movement down in the market.\nThe beta of the market must be 1 since this is measuring the volatility of the market relative to itself. A more volatile stock than the market average will have a beta greater than 1, while a less volatile stock will have a beta of below 1. Beta a theoretical measure of systematic risk, or the risk that applies to the entire market and cannot be diversified away.\nKey Learning Points\n- Beta is a theoretical measure of systematic risk or the risk that applies to the entire market and cannot be diversified away\n- Beta is used in the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), and is used to calculate the cost of equity of an asset\n- A beta greater than 1 indicates that an investment has a higher systematic risk than the market. This means that the investment is likely to give higher returns than the benchmark index in an up-market scenario\n- Regression analysis is the most common and practical method for estimating beta for listed companies\n- Companies with greater predictability in their earnings and dividends tend to have lower beta values. Examples of such companies are insurance companies, utilities, and food retail.\nBeta & Systematic Risk Explained\nBeta is an important component in the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). The CAPM is an asset pricing model that explains the relationship between the expected return investment and the risk for a specific security. CAPM is based on the assumption that only systematic risk should affect asset prices.\nSystematic risk, or market risk, is a risk that cannot be avoided at the firm level and is inherent in the overall market. It includes risk factors that affect the market as a whole. It is non-diversifiable within a portfolio and all firms in the market are exposed to it. Factors constituting systematic risk include interest rates, economic cycles, natural disasters/pandemics, currency fluctuations, and inflation.\nUnsystematic risk refers to the risks inherent in a specific company or an industry. It can potentially be avoided through diversification.\nBeta measures systematic risk only and not unsystematic risk. For example, positive macro events such as economic booms are likely to result in greater gains for all companies. Likewise, negative macro events such as pandemics or natural disasters are likely to result in reduced gains for all companies. A beta greater than 1 indicates that an investment has higher systematic risk than the market. It also indicates that the investment is likely to generate higher returns than the benchmark index in an up market scenario. In comparison, the investment is also likely to deliver greater losses than the benchmark index in a down market scenario.\nExample: Beta in Action\nWe will use the following information about two companies to further investigate beta. Company A is a relatively smaller company that is more sensitive to economic fluctuations. Company B is a larger company with more predictable earnings and dividends. We are asked to calculate the expected returns on the stocks of these two companies.\nCompany A has a higher beta of 1.5, indicating a higher systematic risk than the market. Company B has a lower asset beta of 0.8 indicating a lower systematic risk than the market.\nUsing CAPM, we get the following as expected returns on these two assets.\nAll things being equal, in an up-market scenario company A is likely to give a higher expected return as it has a higher beta. However, if the market were to go down, company A is likely to result in bigger losses for investors since it has a higher beta.\nCompanies with lower beta (such as company B) tend to underperform in up market scenarios. However, they tend to perform better (or, at least, less bad) in a falling market. Insurance stocks, utilities, and food retail are examples of industries with lower beta values.\nData on beta is widely available through many financial data providers. Regression analysis is the most common and practical method for estimating beta. The beta for any asset can be estimated by regressing the returns of that asset against the returns of the index chosen to represent the market portfolio. The slope of the linear regression is the beta of the security. Beta calculations can also be carried out in Excel using the ‘slope’ function.\nHere is an example of the beta for a list of food companies.\nTaking the example of the Kellogg Company shown in the above graph, the returns from the market are shown on the horizontal axis and Kellogg’s returns on the vertical axis. Each blue diamond represents the return on the market and Kellogg’s for a particular period of time and the linear regression analysis then identifies the line of best fit all of the data points.\nThe slope (or gradient) of that line is the beta. The slope represents the level of movement in returns of a given security (in this case, Kellogg’s share price) for each unit of movement in the market. In this case, the gradient is 0.55367, which means that for every 1% increase in the returns on the market, it would be expected that Kellogg’s would generate an extra 0.55367% return\nAnother way of looking at this is that, if the market returns are 7.0%, it would be expected that Kellogg’s would generate returns of around 4.0% [0.5537 x 7% + 0]. If the market return is negative 3.0%, this analysis would suggest a Kellogg’s return of close to 2.0% [0.5537 x -3% + 0].\nGenerally, large brands (such as the Hershey Company) with greater predictability in their earnings tend to have lower beta values. Smaller brands tend to have higher betas."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:34560787-e506-4bf9-a0fc-cd5b9b5c19cd>","<urn:uuid:fcb14462-6aa8-4db4-bd1c-af2ac12d42ea>"],"error":null}

There are a variety and resources, tools and incentives designed to make caring for your property a little easier.\nA preservation easement is an interest in real property that the owner of the property transfers to a qualified organization such as Historic Denver, Inc. (or to a governmental body). To be eligible, the property must be historically designated either at the local, state or national level. An easement prohibits the demolition of the property and any modifications that will harm its historic character, and also requires that the property be maintained in good condition. Preservation easements are a powerful tool for protecting a historic property because an easement “runs with the land” – meaning it is perpetual and remains in place when the property is sold.\nHistoric Denver currently holds 64 easements in the Denver metro area. While Historic Denver is not a regulatory agency and is not involved in design review of local landmarks, we do have an obligation to ensure the general upkeep of these particular easement properties. In order to fulfill the conditions of the easement, Historic Denver conducts annual inspections of our easement properties in order to ensure that they are in good condition and have not been altered. Our experienced staff identifies areas of concern and recommends preservation approaches, materials and contractors for any needed work.\nIf you would like to train to become an easement inspector, please fill out this application form HERE.

Restoring or rehabilitating a historic structure requires planning, a love of challenges, and financing! Read more about Tax Credits, the State Historical Fund and other funding sources…\nDesignated historic properties can be eligible for preservation tax credits. These credits can significantly reduce the cost of restoration and rehabilitation. A 20% federal tax credit is available to commercial properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places. A 20-25% Colorado state tax credit is available to both income-producing and residential property-owners of properties listed on either the National Register of Historic Places, State Register of Historic Places or locally designated through a Certified Local Government, like the City of Denver. Buildings that contribute to a historic district are also eligible.\nColorado Job Creation & Main Street Revitalization Program\nOn Wednesday, May 14, 2014 Governor John Hickenlooper signed HB-1311, the Colorado Job Creation & Main Street Revitalization Act at a meeting of economic development organizations in Pueblo. Historic Denver advocated for this legislation along with our preservation partners, History Colorado, Colorado Preservation, Inc., the National Trust for Historic Preservation and Downtown Colorado, Inc.\nCo-sponsored in the House by Representatives Leroy Garcia and Tim Dore and in the Senate by Senators Pat Steadman and Larry Crowder, the bill improves Colorado’s existing state tax credit by increasing the project cap from $50,000 to $1 million for commercial projects and by making the commercial credits transferable. Fewer changes were made to the way the tax credit applies to single-family homes, although it can now be “re-used” more than once per property, which makes long-term stewardship more viable. To be eligible to use the credits, a building must be locally designated or listed on either the State Register or National Register of Historic Places.\nState Historical Fund\nThe State Historical Fund (SHF) is a unique program of the Colorado Historical Society that funds a wide range of preservation projects across the State of Colorado, including restoration construction efforts. SHF grant funds are generated from the state tax revenues produced by gaming in the historic mining towns of Black Hawk, Central City and Cripple Creek.\nSince grant applicants to the SHF must be either a non-profit organization or public entity, and the proposed project must be able to demonstrate a public benefit, SHF grants are not a good option for the restoration of a private residence. Private owners of buildings open to the public or otherwise offering a public benefit may apply for a grant with the sponsorship of an eligible non-profit. Historic Denver has successfully applied for and managed dozens of SHF grants on behalf of private and non-profit owners. Please visit the State Historical Fund’s website to learn more about the available grant types, application process and grant regulations.\nTo learn about how Historic Denver may be able to apply for and/or manage a grant on behalf of your organization, please contact our Director of Preservation Programs, John Olson by phone at 303-534-5288 ext. 4 or by email at email@example.com.\nOther Funding Sources\nHistoric Denver currently does not offer direct assistance in funding preservation projects.\nHistoric Designation Frequently Asked Questions\nIs your building a local landmark or located in a historic district? We’ve created a Historic Designation FAQ guide, which answers many of the questions we commonly receive from property owners. You can also visit the City of Denver’s Landmark Preservation website to search for designated properties, read about design review for designated properties, and find pertinent application forms.\nThe city of Denver’s Preservation Ordinance was created in 1967, just a year after the watershed passage of the National Historic Preservation Act. The ordinance is a framework that supports Denver’s historic districts and individual landmarks, and specifically outlines provisions related to historic designation, design review and demolition review. It is an important to note that these functions are managed by the City & County of Denver, its Landmark Preservation Committee, and the Denver City Council.\nThere are 52 local historic districts in Denver and over 300 individually landmarked properties. Landmark designation is a great tool for preserving the historic fabric of Denver’s neighborhoods while encouraging thoughtful and sympathetic improvements and additions. Navigating the ins and outs of what designation means for your property, however, can seem like a daunting task. Below we’ve compiled a number of questions we frequently receive about designation to highlight the benefits of landmark designation and to shed light on the many misconceptions surrounding the process. The City of Denver’s Landmark Preservation Commission also has a list of Frequently Asked Questions.\nPlease note: Historic Denver, Inc is a private, non-profit organization that provides ideas and actions for Denver’s historic places. We do not manage the city’s designation programs. The Landmark Preservation Commission is the formal city agency responsible for designation and design review. To contact the Landmark Commission, please visit their website or call them at (720) 865-2709.\nHomeowner Education Workshops\nHistoric Denver has produced a series of videos to capture information presented in four homeowner education workshops. Owning a historic building, whether it’s your home, your business or an investment property, requires care and commitment. There are a variety and resources, tools and incentives designed to make caring for your property a little easier.

Since its inception in 2000, the program has aided in the protection and preservation of more than 50 historic sacred landmarks across the Denver metro area. The Sacred Landmarks program provides residents and community leaders with the tools necessary to be good stewards of their historic resources. This in turn ensures that these landmarks continue to serve as centers of community life for generations to come. This is particularly important as sacred landmarks typically serve a community much larger than their own congregation, hosting nonprofit agencies or community groups, and providing critical social services.\nThrough the program, we conduct research to determine the maintenance and renovation/repair costs of the historic sacred building; we strive to strengthen and maintain public education about the importance of sacred places by offering community-centered services; and we provide technical assistance to inner-city congregations and their pastors to help them accurately assess the enormous value of their physical and human resources, as well as identify funding sources and secure grants for restoration and rehabilitation — most often from the Colorado State Historical Fund.\nHistoric Denver’s Sacred Landmarks team is currently managing grant-funded projects at First Unitarian Church and the Althea Center in Capitol Hill, Trinity United Methodist in downtown, North Highland Presbyterian in West Highlands, and People’s Presbyterian in the North City Park/Skyland neighborhood. Past project include work at the former Temple Emanuel in Uptown, Central Presbyterian in downtown, 430 Years of Church in Christ in Five Points, and Four Winds American Indian Council in Baker.\nDoes your historic place of worship need help? You’re invited to contact us for help and information.\nBuilt in the 1890s, this property at 1400 N. Lafayette St. in Denver’s Capitol Hill/Cheesman Park neighborhood is a prime and unique example of construction using locally sourced rhyolite in the Richardsonian Romanesque style. It was designated a Denver landmark in 2016. This project will rehabilitate the masonry of all four facades of the church, and includes cleaning and re-pointing exterior stone masonry. It is funded, in part, by History Colorado’s State Historical Fund, in partnership with Historic Denver.\nThe building houses the oldest Unitarian congregation in Colorado. It was founded in 1871 – five years before Colorado statehood. During its first two and a half years, the congregation used seven different assembly venues, largely due to the controversial social action work undertaken by its members. The Unitarians often made news for bold moves like utilizing female ushers, teaching vocational skills to girls, educating boys who worked during the day and, later, advocating for reform against the imprisonment of children.\nIn 1958, First Unitarian Society of Denver purchased the building at 1400 N. Lafayette St. from the first owner, Plymouth Congregational Church. First Unitarian has been the proud steward of the building since, and has exhibited significant community and social justice work since its founding.\nThis important rehabilitation work will propel plans to engage the public, its membership, and numerous partner groups in the powerful story of the church and its building. First Unitarian is committed to maintaining its presence at this location as an “urban sanctuary in the heart of Denver.” Now as in the past, First Unitarian is active and influential in social justice issues of race, gay and lesbian rights, marriage equality, women’s rights, and immigration rights."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:d0e4aec9-bbf8-46f9-8dd5-8f20f0d2b7fe>","<urn:uuid:a263acf5-aa85-4805-be04-3adc75428e5b>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What is anesthesia awareness during surgery, and how does it relate to trauma-focused therapy approaches used to treat psychological conditions?","answer":"Anesthesia awareness occurs in 1-2 per 1,000 medical procedures involving general anesthesia, where patients become conscious during surgery and can recall their surroundings or surgical events, though usually without pain. For psychological treatment of traumatic experiences, evidence-based trauma therapies like Prolonged Exposure (PE) and Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) are well-established treatments. While anesthesia awareness can be disturbing and traumatic, requiring post-surgery counseling, trauma-focused therapies can help address such experiences through systematic exposure to feared stimuli and modification of unhelpful beliefs about trauma.","context":["If you’re having a major surgery, you most likely will receive general anesthesia and be unconscious during the procedure. This means you will have no awareness of the procedure once the anesthesia takes effect, and you won’t remember it afterward.\nVery rarely — in only one or two of every 1,000 medical procedures involving general anesthesia — a patient may become aware or conscious. The condition, called anesthesia awareness (waking up) during surgery, means the patient can recall their surroundings, or an event related to the surgery, while under general anesthesia. Although it can be upsetting, patients usually do not feel pain when experiencing anesthesia awareness.\nAlthough it can be upsetting, patients usually do not feel pain when experiencing anesthesia awareness.\nAnesthesia awareness is not the same as remembering some activities surrounding your procedure, such as something that happened just before the anesthesia started working or when its effects began to wear off after surgery. This is normal. You might even dream during surgery and only think you experienced awareness.\nAnesthesia awareness during surgery can happen for a few different reasons. It can be more common in patients with multiple medical conditions, and certain surgeries or circumstances increase the risk of awareness because the usual dose of required anesthesia cannot be used safely. These surgeries are often emergencies, such as emergency C-sections, certain types of heart surgery and surgery that’s needed after a traumatic injury.\nPeople who have experienced awareness under anesthesia report different levels of awareness. Some people have brief, vague recollections. Others remember a specific moment of surgery or their surroundings. In some cases, people recall a feeling of pressure.\nPatients also are more likely to experience awareness with procedures that do not involve general anesthesia. For example, you may recall all or part of your procedure if you have one of the following types of anesthesia:\n- Intravenous, or “twilight” sedation, which is often used for minor procedures such as a colonoscopy, certain types of biopsies, or a dental procedure.\n- Local or regional anesthesia, such as an epidural, spinal block, or nerve block, which temporarily numbs the area being treated during the surgery.\nDepending on the person and the event, anesthesia awareness can be disturbing and even traumatic. If it should happen to you, be sure to describe your experience to your anesthesiologist after your surgery. Some patients benefit from counseling after surgery to help cope with feelings of confusion and stress.\nBefore your surgery, your anesthesiologist will meet with you to learn about any health conditions you may have as well as your previous experiences with anesthesia. To reduce your risk of experiencing awareness during general anesthesia, it is important to tell your anesthesiologist as much information about your health as possible, including the following:\n- Previous problems with anesthesia, including a history of being aware during surgery\n- All medications you are taking — prescription, over-the-counter, and herbal supplements\n- Concerns you may have about surgery, including fear of awareness during surgery\n- History of drug or alcohol use, which can increase the risk of anesthesia awareness\nAnesthesiologists are the most highly skilled medical experts in anesthesia care, pain management, and critical care medicine with the education and training that can mean the difference between life and death.","This is Part 2 of a 3-part series on posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and eating disorders by Dr. Mary Hill. To access the first post describing the co-occurrence of eating disorders and PTSD click here.\nEvidence-based trauma therapies reduce symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and common co-occurring problems like depression, and improve functioning and well-being.1 Prolonged exposure (PE), cognitive processing therapy (CPT), and trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (CF-CBT) are well-established evidence-based treatments for individuals with PTSD.2,3,4,5 Descriptions of each treatment and how they work are presented below.\nPE has the strongest recommendation as a treatment for individuals with PTSD in clinical practice guidelines.2,3,4,5 It addresses problematic avoidance that develops as a result of the trauma. People with PTSD often try to avoid things that remind them of the trauma because encountering people, places, objects, and memories that remind them of the trauma is highly distressing. Avoidance reduces distress in the moment, but ultimately makes PTSD worse. Over time, people avoid more and more trauma reminders, even those that most people would consider safe. Not only does this avoidance keep PTSD symptoms going, it negatively impacts individuals’ ability to engage in meaningful activities and live the kind of lives they want.\nPE works by helping individuals limit problematic avoidance through gradual, systematic exposure to feared but safe stimuli (e.g., places, situations, memories). Essentially, PE helps individuals face their fears safely. PE involves two types of exposure: imaginal exposure and in vivo exposure. During imaginal exposure, individuals retell the trauma memory. The major goal of imaginal exposure is to help individuals emotionally process the trauma memory in order to reduce PTSD symptoms. By repeatedly telling the trauma narrative, individuals better organize and process the memory and their cognitive and emotional reactions to it.\nDuring in vivo exposure, individuals approach objectively safe trauma-related situations (e.g., going to crowded places) that they have avoided because of trauma-related distress. Through direct experience during exposure, individuals learn that the trauma memory, reminders, and physiological responses are not dangerous, and the distress experienced when encountering them is temporary. In addition, new information learned through direct experience that is incompatible with trauma-related beliefs (e.g., “people can’t be trusted,” “I can’t handle being out by myself”) promotes improved quality of life as individuals reengage in meaningful activities previously avoided because of trauma-related distress.6\nCPT is another evidence-based treatment that focuses on one’s beliefs about self, others, and the world that changed as a result of the trauma and how these beliefs affect emotions and behaviors. Specifically, unhelpful beliefs related to power and control, esteem, safety, trust, and intimacy are addressed. It is thought that these beliefs that developed after the trauma make PTSD worse.\nThe primary focus of CPT is to modify dysfunctional cognitions that impair functioning, known as “stuck points.” For example, the “just world belief” states that, “good things happen to good people, and bad things happen to bad people.” If that is believed to be true, it can be hard for trauma survivors to make sense of why something bad happened to them and may impact their ability to engage in their lives as they did before the trauma. CPT challenges stuck points by teaching individuals how to assess whether facts support their stuck points. If not, they can work with their therapist to create a new perspective. CPT is believed to work by developing more balanced and helpful beliefs which decrease difficult emotions and other PTSD symptoms.7\nFinally, TF-CBT is an evidence-based treatment for children with PTSD or traumatic grief and their parents. Treatment includes components of PE and CPT. TF-CBT is comprised of psychoeducation about trauma and PTSD, teaching relaxation skills and other coping skills, in vivo exposure to reminders of the trauma, creation of a trauma narrative (which is similar to imaginal exposure), processing trauma-related thoughts and emotions, and developing safety skills.8\nDespite research support for these treatments, many trauma survivors and therapists express concern that trauma-focused therapies will make people with PTSD feel worse.9 However, the literature shows that most who participate in evidence-based PTSD treatment improve and do not experience worsening of PTSD symptoms or depression.10,11 These treatments are safe and effective, although it is important to find a therapist who is trained in the treatment modality, and it can be beneficial to ensure that individuals have good coping skills prior to beginning treatment as addressing trauma in treatment can be emotionally intensive. Although there are currently no established guidelines for when to address trauma in treatment for individuals with eating disorders or which treatment may be most beneficial, evidence-based PTSD treatments can be used in combination with eating disorders treatments. It is important for future research to assess the best way to integrate treatment for both PTSD and eating disorders.\n- van Minnen, A., Zoellner, L. A., Harned, M. S., & Mills, K. (2015).

{"question":"I need to medicate 400 piglets weighing 20kg each through water. 请问怎么计算所需的药物剂量？ (How do I calculate the required medication dosage?)","answer":"To calculate the medication dosage, follow these steps: 1) Calculate total animal weight: 400 piglets × 20kg = 8,000kg. 2) Determine daily water consumption - for 20kg piglets, each drinks 4 liters/day, so total is 1,600 liters/day. 3) Calculate active product needed - if dosage is 20mg/kg, then 8,000kg × 20mg = 160,000mg (160g). 4) Calculate commercial product needed - if using 10% concentration product, then 160g × 100/10 = 1,600g of commercial product. 5) For 1,600 liters of water consumption, use 1kg of commercial product per 1,000 liters.","context":["Medicating water using a tank is an easy and flexible method used to administer drugs, but it can be imprecise if the products we use aren’t totally soluble. As with any other system there are a several critical points we should keep in mind if we want to successfully medicate the water:\nTank appropriate for medicating in a warehouse with a pressure pump.\n- The tank should have two valves, one for input and one for output. The input valve should be closed when preparing and administering the medication, in order to avoid dilution. The output valve should also be closed while we prepare the medication. It is also a good idea to close it if the tank’s capacity is limited and it is necessary to prepare the medication several times: closing the output valve will speed up filling the tank.\n- Often tanks are located inside facilities which means they reach a temperature similar to that of the hall. When the temperature of the drinking water exceeds 22°C, consumption is reduced. This circumstance is especially important if we have used tables to forecast the animals’ consumption as we could actually under dose the treatment.\n- Tanks should always have lids. These will prevent the entrance of organic materials (dust, insects, etc…), and at the same time they prevent UV rays from entering when the tank is located outside. Organic material can alter the effectiveness of certain products, like for example the sulfonamides, and the contact of the sun with the water develops some algae that can affect the correct dissolution of the medications. Perhaps affecting their availability and activity.\nTanks appropriate for medicating\nExterior tanks, and tanks too large for medicating\nUsing an example we can see how to correctly medicate the water.\nLet’s imagine that we want to treat, in the summer, 400 20 kg (live weight) piglets with a daily 20 mg dose of active product/kg of live weight and the capacity of the tank is 800 liters.\nThe first step will be to calculate the daily water consumption based on the type of animal to be treated. This can be done by using consumption charts.\nTable 1. Daily water needs for pigs\n|Age||Daily water consumption (l/day)|\n|Nursery piglets (5-15 kg)||2-3|\n|Nursery piglets (15-25 kg)||3-5|\n|Growing pigs (25-45 kg)||5-7|\n|Fattening pigs (45-65 kg)||7-9|\n|Fattening pigs (>65 kg)||9-12|\nBased on summertime water consumption. Temperature, quality of the water, and type of drinking trough can affect this consumption.\nTaylor and Roese. 2006\nBut we should take care not to forget other factors that can increase or decrease consumption, like: temperature, humidity, type of feed, water quality, etc. It is best to always confirm real water consumption in the area to be medicated.\nIn our case, 20 kg piglets will drink 4 liters/day; therefore 400 piglets will drink 1.600 liters/day.\nThe second step will be to calculate the quantity of active product/day needed. For this we should:\n- Know the concentration of the commercial product, for example: 10% (10 g of active product per 100 g of commercial product).\n- Calculate the total weight of the animals to be treated: 400 20 kg piglets = 8.000 kg.\n- Determine main ingredient needs: 8.000 kg x 20 mg = 160.000 mg (160 g)\n- Determine the amount of commercial product to use: if for every 100 g of product we have 10 g of active ingredient (10%), then for 160 g we need 160 g x 100 / 10 = 1.600 g of commercial product.\n- Keeping in mind the consumption calculated in the first step, if we have to dissolve 1.600 g of commercial product in 1.600 liters of water, for each 1.000 liters of water consumed we need to include 1 kg of commercial product.\nThe third step will be to calculate how to distribute the medication based on the tank’s capacity:\n- If consumption is1600 liters/day and capacity is 800 liters/tank, we should distribute the daily medication in two doses (morning and afternoon). In the morning we will mix 800 g of medication in a full tank (800 l) and repeat in the afternoon.\n- If we have doubts about whether the second dose will be correctly administered, it is a good idea to duplicate the morning dose, providing water without medication in the afternoon. In this case, the medication will not be 100% correct, but this is a better option than wondering whether they have taken the afternoon dose or not.\nThe fourth step will be to prepare the medication necessary for each dose:\n- Close the water vale of the troughs.\n- Close the tank’s main valve.\n- Distribute the 1.600 g of commercial product in 2 doses per day.\n- In order to prepare the morning dose we should first dissolve the 800 g of commercial product in a bucket of lukewarm water.\n- Empty the bucket with the solution into the tank, mixing well.\n- Open the tank’s water valve to the drinkers.\n- We should repeat this in the afternoon, and for every day of medication.\nNOW WE CAN MEDICATE THE WATER."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:901e711b-0072-48aa-900c-bed827139e08>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How did the Chicago blues scene evolve from its South Side roots in the 1960s, and what venues currently preserve this musical heritage in the city?","answer":"The Chicago blues scene in the 1960s was centered on the South Side, with legendary venues like Pepper's Lounge (Muddy Waters' regular club), Turner's Blue Lounge, and Theresa's (where Junior Wells performed with Buddy Guy). The blues later migrated north to Old Town venues like Mother Blues and Big John's. Today, several venues preserve Chicago's blues heritage, including Buddy Guy's Legends on the South Side, which features local, national and international acts nightly, Blue Chicago in River North offering intimate blues performances, and Kingston Mines on the North Side, which has been operating continuously for nearly 50 years with two stages featuring alternating bands playing authentic Chicago blues.","context":["Release date: September 25, 2020\nBy Greg Easterling\nOne hundred years of blues...let that soak in for a while. That's the cumulative amount of professional experience that guitarist Elvin Bishop and harpist Charlie Musselwhite have logged since they both showed up on the South Side of Chicago in the early 1960s.\nIt was certainly a different day and time. The clubs in which both absorbed the blues are gone now with only the street names remaining the same. Pepper's Lounge near 43rd Street was once Muddy Waters' regular club, “every Wednesday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday”. Turner's Blue Lounge was under the El station at 4012 South Indiana and 40th Street where J.B. Hutto played a regular Wednesday night gig. Otis Rush was on the West Side at Curley's; he also appeared at Pepper's. And at the corner of 48th and Indiana, there was the legendary Theresa's where Junior Wells had regular engagements every Friday, Saturday and Sunday often with Buddy Guy. Eventually the blues migrated north to Old Town on Wells Street at clubs such as Mother Blues, Big John's (at Eugenie Street) and the more folk music oriented The Gate of Horn owned Albert Grossman, future manager of Bob Dylan and Janis Joplin. Big John's was one of the first North Side clubs to bring in black blues men from the South Side; Steve Miller did some of the booking, yes THAT Steve Miller, recently in from Madison, Wisconsin. And Old Town was also where you might find other young white guys who loved the blues: Paul Butterfield from Hyde Park, Mike Bloomfield of Glencoe, and Nick “the Greek” Gravenities who penned Butterfield's signature song “Born In Chicago”.\nAs for Elvin and Charlie? Bishop came from Oklahoma to attend The University of Chicago and fell in with Little Smokey Smothers with chances to jam with Hound Dog Taylor, Junior Wells and J.T. Brown. He also met and started to play with the Butterfield Blues Band before Bloomfield came on board officially. Musselwhite was from Memphis and got a job at Chicago's famed Jazz Record Mart while hanging out on the South Side under the influence of his early blues mentors Big Joe Williams and Big Walter “Shakey” Horton. An early encounter with Muddy Waters insisting that he sit in with the band on harmonica also made a deep impression. Charlie says, “I might not ever had a career in music if men like Muddy hasn't been so welcoming and encouraging”. He also got to know producer Samuel Charters who arranged Musselwhite's early session work with singer Tracy Nelson and also with Horton for Volume Three of the legendary Vanguard Records 1965-66 anthology, Chicago/The Blues/Today!. He was billed as Memphis Charlie on one song that featured two harmonicas with Big Walter taking the lead. Charters later produced Musselwhite's first band album on Vanguard with Harvey Mandel on guitar.\nBoth Elvin and Charlie relocated to California by the late 1960s for better weather and music connections as electric Chicago blues became a major influence on rock, especially with the coming of British blues lovers The Rolling Stones, John Mayall's Bluesbreakers and The Yardbirds with Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck and Jimmy Page which led to Cream, Derek and the Dominoes, The Jeff Beck Group and Led Zeppelin. Bishop in particular would come to the attention of rock impresario Bill Graham for many gigs at the Fillmore West, plus management, and also a slot on Graham's own Fillmore label distributed by Columbia/Epic Records. Bishop went on to become part of the San Francisco Sound with the likes of the Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane and Quicksilver.\nWhile Elvin and Charlie were no doubt aware of each other in the Windy City, it took the California trip for both to forge a personal friendship that has resulted in 100 Years Of Blues for Chicago's Alligator Records. They toured Hawaii together for shows in the 1980s and went out again nationally in 2002. Charlie has guested on Elvin's recent Alligator albums such as 2014's Can't Even Do Wrong Right and Elvin Bishop's Big Fun Trio released in 2017. The original version of the title track of this collaboration originally appeared on the latter. Both Bishop and Musselwhite were so pleased with the results that they decided to do a whole album together. According the Elvin,”...it made me realize how much we have in common.”\nYou might even call them “Birds Of A Feather” which is also the name of the opening track for 100 Years Of Blues. Bishop wrote it and uses it as an actual introduction to whole thing. “Here we are birds of a feather, a whole bunch of blues lovers gathered together.” He talks it more than sings, setting the tone for what feels like a very intimate, down home, front porch kind of musical affair. The instrumentation is spare but effective with Musselwhite on harp, both Bishop and musical partner Bob Welsh on guitar and producer Kid Andersen playing upright bass. Andersen from Rick Estrin and the Nightcats also partially hosted the sessions at his own Greaseland Studios in San Jose. Charlie takes the first solo, introduced by Elvin who then takes his turn. Bishop reacts to the proceedings, “I feel the spirit moving”, concluding “Man, it's pretty hard to beat the blues!”\nThe next song is the album's first cover, one of three that appear on 100 Years Of Blues. “West Helena Blues” is a historic choice, written by Roosevelt Sykes and recorded by James Cotton with Otis Spann back in '66 forChicago/The Blues/Today! Volume Two. The city of Helena, Arkansas is rich in blues culture and was once called the “1930s blues capitol of the Delta” associated with legendary names such as Robert Johnson, Elmore James and Sonny Boy Williamson II aka Rice Miller. It is also the home of radio station KFAA and the famous blues music program King Biscuit Time which has spread the word for longer than Charlie and Elvin individually. Musselwhite sings lead and plays, not one but, two solos here after a long harp Intro. The lyrical motivation for the songs is predictable. “I got a woman that I'm loving/Lives in West Helena, Arkansas”. The city gets name checked in a less complimentary fashion later as Charlie sings, “They tell me West Saint Helena, it ain't nothin' but a murderer's home.” Bob Welsh switches to piano here and helps to drive the song's rhythm in the absence of bass or drums.\nElvin gets topical next on his original song, “What The Hell?” with some reflections on post 2016 life delivered in his trademark Okie accent. “Look at the shape the nation's in/the situation is a shame and a sin”. Recorded before the Covid 19 pandemic, Elvin's observations are still timely even though mostly inspired by the results of the last presidential election. “How can four years seem so long” asks Bishop, lamenting that “half of the people in this country can't stand the other half/why can't we halfway get along?” Elvin's tone is neighborly while communicating frustration without being condemning.\n“Good Times” follows but it's not a declaration that happy days are here again in 2020 or 21. It's a look back by Charlie who sings, “Where did all our good times go?”. Musselwhite impresses here with his more than respectable slide guitar work that's a focal point of this track. He usually sticks to his specialty of blues harp but stretches out to show an additional talent on this original song of his. It's not the first time Charlie has played guitar though. Listen to his song “Stingaree” from the 1993 Alligator release In My Time, a track also featured on Alligator's 25th Anniversary Collection in 1996.\n“Old School” is next and it's a song that Elvin originally waxed for his Can't Even Do Wrong Right album. Charlie contributed harp on the original and returns here, sharing vocals on the chorus with Elvin. With the more laid back retro feel of 100 Years Of Blues, this was a natural choice for the two to revisit. Bishop brings a knowing smile lyrically, revealing he's no fan of “Facebook or social media, no Twitter or Tweets”. He requests, “Call me on the phone if you want to talk to me” and later, “Don't send me an email/ send me a female!”.\nBoth Charlie and Elvin shine instrumentally on Cut 6, “If I Should Have Bad Luck,” a Musselwhite original that signifies the halfway point of the album. Elvin's solo is especially melodic, no surprise from the guitarist who crafted the historic guitar solo for his big pop hit “Fooled Around And Fell In Love,” one of the best solos of the 1970s. Charlie demonstrates his mastery of the so-called Chicago harp sound forged in the noisy environs of South Side blues clubs by Little Walter, Sonny Boy Williamson II and his friend Big Walter Horton. Different sounding from Delta harmonica, the Chicago technique was derived from cupping a microphone and blues harp together, literally touching them in the palms of one's hands to produce a powerful sound that was perpetuated by Junior Wells, James Cotton and for decades now by Charlie.\n“Midnight Hour Blues” is another cover, written by a largely forgotten blues keyboardist who was one of the top blues performers between 1928 and 1935 on the Vocalion and Bluebird labels. Leroy Carr was responsible for future standards such as “Blues Before Sunrise” and “How Long, How Long Blues” before he passed at the age of 30. Elvin and Charlie play it slow and full of feeling for a lonely protagonist whose “mind was wandering back to days of long ago” because “the little girl I used to love/I don't see her anymore”. Bishop handles the heartfelt sounding lead vocals here.\nIt's another Musselwhite original next in the form of a question, “Blues, Why Do You Worry Me?”. Charlie sings here with another winning harp solo, joined again by Bob Welsh who helps set the pace on piano. Elvin delivers a short but stinging solo. There's no good answer lyrically as Charlie confesses, “I used to drink to keep from worrying/now I ride from town to town” reflecting a transient life on the road. In the end though there's resilience as he sings, “I learned to smile at trouble/I won't let it get me down”.\nThen Bishop comes up with some long awaited “South Side Slide,” the album's only instrumental which also gives the two blues aces some space to solo and match licks quoting briefly from classics like “Blue Monk” by Thelonious Monk. The album's longest track “Blues For Yesterday” happens next with some nice piano work from Welsh and an effective lead vocal from Charlie that's both affecting and sentimental.\nNearing the end of the album now, Musselwhite and Bishop pull out an important Sonny Boy Williamson II song, “Help Me” which Junior Wells covered as a tribute to Sonny Boy on Chicago/The Blues/Today! Volume One. It's a final time to shine on the album's second longest jam with great solos from Elvin and Charlie over some stylish piano accompaniment provided by Welsh.\nThen it's nearly full circle with the new recording of the title track, 100 Years Of Blues which features Elvin recapping some of the details of their mutual South Side musical adventure from so many years ago. As good as it is, functioning as a close to this intimate musical portrait of the blues, these great stories should also be preserved in a book sometime before it's too late to do so.\nMany thanks to Elvin Bishop and Charlie Musselwhite for gifting us with this recording during a time of trial. It's a down home, relaxed kind of jam that soothes musically while still addressing some issues, both timeless and contemporary. It also provides incentive to hear these stories that reveal so much about the history of the blues in Chicago at a time when many of us have more spare time perhaps. The blues may help us get through yet again, a function they've fulfilled in American culture since the harsh days of cotton fields and chain gangs.\nGreg Easterling hosts American Backroads on WDCB (90.9 FM) Thursdays at 9 p.m.","El-Amin Life Productions Cultural Institute Supports the promotion of performing arts in The City of Chicago.\nMusic Around the World \"Stand By Me\" Video\nMainstream pop, indie rock, hip hop, punk, blues or jazz – no matter your musical taste, you'll find it live in Chicago any night of the week.

In America!\nBlack History Month is an annual celebration of achievements by African Americans and a time for recognizing the central role of blacks in U.S. history. The event grew out of “Negro History Week,” the brainchild of noted historian Carter G. Woodson and other prominent African Americans. Since 1976, every U.S. president has officially designated the month of February as Black History Month. Other countries around the world, including Canada and the United Kingdom, also devote a month to celebrating black history.\nThe story of Black History Month begins in 1915, half a century after the Thirteenth Amendment abolished slavery in the United States.\nThat September, the Harvard-trained historian Carter G. Woodson and the prominent minister Jesse E. Moorland founded the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History (ASNLH), an organization dedicated to researching and promoting achievements by black Americans and other peoples of African descent.\nKnown today as the Association for the Study of African American Life and History (ASALH), the group sponsored a national Negro History week in 1926, choosing the second week of February to coincide with the birthdays of Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass. The event inspired schools and communities nationwide to organize local celebrations, establish history clubs and host performances and lectures.\nIn the decades that followed, mayors of cities across the country began issuing yearly proclamations recognizing Negro History Week. By the late 1960s, thanks in part to the civil rights movement and a growing awareness of black identity, Negro History Week had evolved into Black History Month on many college campuses.\nPresident Gerald Ford officially recognized Black History Month in 1976, calling upon the public to “seize the opportunity to honor the too-often neglected accomplishments of black Americans in every area of endeavor throughout our history.”\nDid you know?

Understanding the different categories of disease, and segmenting a large patient population into smaller, more precisely defined classes, enables medical researchers to discover new, tailored treatments and considerably improve chances of survival and quality of life.\nOf course, those suffering from devastating conditions such as pancreatic cancer or ALS would embrace such targeted medicines immediately; for these patients, the new treatments would represent the difference between life and death.\nFor most patients, however, the individualized therapies promised by personalized medicine represent incremental improvements in the treatment of asymptomatic conditions such as hypertension, high cholesterol and osteoporosis; will patients in the future embrace tailored treatments with more enthusiasm than patients diagnosed and treated today? Will a more personalized, more definitive risk assessment improve a patient’s willingness to adhere to a particular regimen? What will be the response of patients who learn about their susceptibility to cancer and heart disease years before these diseases show up?\nWe’ve already learned that behavioral improvement is urgently needed even when effective medications are available. While patients with acutely life-threatening conditions such as cancer and HIV are understandably quite diligent about their medicines, many of us tend to be more cavalier, especially if the condition seems relatively unobtrusive, such as high blood pressure or low bone density. Despite effective monitoring and treatment options, diabetes remains the leading cause of blindness, kidney failure and amputation in the U.S. Similarly, while detection and treatment of high cholesterol has been clearly demonstrated to be of enormous benefit, less than half of patients who start on a statin even refill their prescription.\nThe best medicines only work if you take them. And many patients require cholesterol or diabetes medicine in the first place because they are unable to adjust their unhealthy eating and exercise habits. The bottom line is that changing behavior is as difficult as it is essential. Consequently, our ability to harvest the benefits of personalized medicine may depend upon our ability to meaningfully change our behavior.\nThe “behavior gap,” as we call this, is likely to increase as scientific advances create new, more precise risk assessments and expand our diagnostic tools. Many people will suddenly discover they are “at risk,” well before pharmacological treatments are available. In some cases the diagnostic testing may suggest the person is in a segment of patients for whom existing therapies have lower chances of success. Consequently, technological advances may actually further fuel the need for improved behavioral options.\nThe ability to monitor progress more precisely, and identify treatment response earlier, can allow for a fine-tuning of therapeutic approach, and can also help patients adapt to individual approaches. Monitoring could also help patients stick with treatment regimens, since the benefits of positive actions might yield rapid reinforcement, while unhelpful behaviors could be identified quickly and avoided in the future.\nInformation technology can also help close the behavior gap. The widespread adoption of electronic medical records will facilitate the organization of important health data, and will help patients and doctors connect behavior to outcome. Online communities of patients are also providing compelling behavioral support options, emphasizing both the increasingly important role of the Internet in health care as well as the trend for patients to play a central and more active role in the management of their own conditions.\nFor all the advances of modern science, the future of medicine will look a lot like the present, and will provide physicians and patients with many of the same challenges. While sophisticated science may yield a more precise segmentation of disease states, and a few magic bullets, we’ll likely still be left with many more diseases than drugs, and our health will likely continue to depend upon our ability to modify our behavior, whether that means passing on dessert or taking our medicines regularly.\nFortunately, the same medical technologies that enable us to gauge our risk may also provide us with opportunities to develop more effective behavioral strategies that can be targeted with exquisite precision. But if we let our excitement about molecular advances obscure the pressing medical need to improve our understanding of behavior, we may be surprised by how difficult it is to translate biological progress into something the really matters–improved health outcomes for patients.\nDavid Shaywitz, a physician-scientist, is a New Jersey-based management consultant in the health care practice of the Boston Consulting Group (BCG).

Science leads you in directions you hadn’t initially thought of, and you have to navigate your way through it, but at the same time to let it lead you.”\nAssistant Professor Reut Shalgi, who this week was awarded the prestigious Alon Fellowship for Outstanding Young Faculty, joined the ranks of the Technion faculty last year. Currently, as a member of the team at the Technion’s Rapapport Institute of Medical Research, she investigates the mechanisms of translational control by the ribosomes.\nShe graduated cum laude from Tel Aviv University in 2002, with a double major in Biology and Computer Science. Her final project explored what was back then the emerging field of Bioinformatics, which applies tools from statistics and computer science to biological and pharmacological research.\nThanks to her computer science skills Prof. Shalgi began, while still an undergraduate, to work in the hi-tech company of RadVision. But the search for new challenges led her to enroll in the Life Sciences Master’s degree program at the Weizmann Institute. With the guidance of Prof. Yitzhak Pilpel and Prof. Ron Shamir she used bioinformatical methods to study mechanisms that regulate gene expression – and was captivated by the world of scientific research. “During my Masters I realized I wanted to be a scientist – to understand how cells function, investigate the ways in which they can malfunction and find ways of correcting them.\n“We work in the new and fascinating field of systems biology, increasingly integrating biology and computer science, and using genome-wide data and bioinformatical tools,” Assistant Professor Shalgi explains. “Systems biology gives us an broad view of the biological processes taking place inside the cell, whereas classic biology examines these processes in depth.” She went on to undertake her PhD at the Weizmann Institute, with Prof. Pilpel and Prof. Moshe Oren as her advisors. “My research focused then on the regulation mechanisms of micro-RNA – small molecules that are genes but that do not encode proteins. Every stage in protein synthesis is controlled by numerous factors inside the cell. I investigated the interrelationships and the coordination between different levels in this network.”\nIn 2009, after she completed her Ph.D., Assistant Professor Shalgi went to pursue her post-doctoral studies at MIT. Under bioinformatics expert Prof. Chris Burge and Prof. Susan Lindquist, a world leader in the field of chaperones (specialized proteins that facilitate the correct folding of other cellular proteins, which is essential for their proper function), Shalgi studied translation control mechanisms in cells under stress, as well as the interrelationship between chaperones and the ribosome. It was at this time that she discovered a previously unknown mechanism of translation control: chaperone-mediated ribosome pausing during the translation process. She continues to research this mechanism in her own lab.\nThe pausing occurs in response to extreme environmental conditions, and is mediated by the chaperones and their interaction with the ribosome. Upon relief from stress, the essential process of protein synthesis resumes.\n“We think that this mechanism is also involved in neurodegenerative diseases, such as ALS, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and Huntington’s diseases, among others,” she adds, “conditions in which proteins misfold and aggregate [accumulate and clump together]. We are currently studying how ribosome pausing is linked to these pathologies.”\nShe has very good memories of her five post-doctoral years in Boston, during which her first daughter was born – but “I really wanted to come back to Israel, to my family and friends. The Technion gave me a very warm welcome, and last October we returned to Israel – thanks to the Technion. I came back from MIT with several cutting-edge research methodologies, which I brought with me to my new lab at the Faculty of Medicine.”\nOne of these methods involves high throughput screening of protein-protein interactions performed by a robot, which can screen thousands of protein pairs per day and produce quantitative information on the interactions between each pair of proteins. Assistant Professor Shalgi analyses this data using bioinformatics tools, and maps the control network that governs the cell’s translation system and the interactions among the proteins: “The robot enables me to map out entire protein networks rapidly, and I use bioinformatics tools to analyze the cross-talk between the components in this network, and translation regulators.\n“In my lab we integrate biology with genome-wide methodologies and bioinformatics to study the cell as a system. Our unique approach is to look at the cell as a system in which every component must not only function properly on its own but also be coordinated with all other components.”\nShe never felt that she had to compromise her scientific or research excellence with the move from MIT to the Technion. “The Faculty and the Technion offer me the highest standards possible. It’s a very diverse faculty with a good, strong interface between clinical and scientific research. The Technion’s new major in Medical Sciences offers the Faculty’s students an opportunity to get to know the science and possibly become researchers. Everyone knows what a medical doctor does, but not everyone understands what it means to be a researcher, what it is that researchers actually do on a day-to-day basis. An M.D. treats patients with the tools available to them, but the development of a new drug or treatment requires in-depth understanding of the mechanisms that lead to the disease, and that’s what we as researchers aim for. Some medical doctors manage to do research alongside the clinic, but it’s the full-time researchers who can delve deeply into the processes that cause the disease.”\nOriginally published in the Technion website."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:3d5e20ee-1ac2-4da7-8958-f89cba0a5e5f>","<urn:uuid:f281027d-73a9-436f-a3e5-5f7ea85122cf>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I'm interested in understanding how self-organized teams operate in complex organizations - what are their key characteristics and decision-making processes?","answer":"Self-organized teams are characterized by team members taking responsibility and making their own decisions rather than receiving direct orders from team leads. Team members become highly involved, take responsibility, and show dedication to the project. In complex organizations, decision-making is moved down to where information is generated, involving both people with knowledge power (technical expertise) and position power (organizational experience). The decision-making process typically follows a methodology that includes building the right team, clearly defining problems and objectives, developing alternative solutions, gaining commitment, and executing implementation plans. Decisions are made by consensus, and all team members must commit to supporting whatever decision is reached, even if they don't personally agree with it.","context":["Important note: this post is not intended to state that when you do scrum, you should make your own interpretation of it. It's to explain how you can benefit from agile / scrum principles on integration projects, that are not using the scrum methodology at all. It's a subtle, but important difference!\n1. Prototype in an early stage\nI'm working for more than 10 years on integration projects and every new assignment comes with its specific challenges: a new type of application to integrate with, a new protocol that is not supported out-of-the-box and specific non-functional requirements that you never faced before. Challenges can become risks if you do not tackle them soon. It's important to list them and to perform a short risk assessment.\nPlan proof of concepts (PoC) to overcome these challenges. Schedule these prototyping exercises early in the project, as they might influence overall planning (e.g. extra development required) and budget (e.g. purchase of third party tool or plug-in). Perform them in an isolated sandbox environment (e.g. cloud), so you do not lose time with organizational procedures and administration overhead. A PoC must have a clear scope and success criteria defined. Real life examples where we introduced a PoC: validate performance characteristics of the BizTalk MLLP adapter, determine the best design to integrate with the brand-new Dynamics 365 for Operations (AX), test the feature set of specific Logic Apps connectors against the requirements…\n2. Create a Definition of Ready\nA Definition of Ready is a kind of a prerequisite list that the development team and product owner agree on. This list contains the essential information that is required in order to kick off the development of a specific backlog item. It's important to agree on a complete, but not too extended Definition of Ready. Typical items that are listed on an integration focused Definition of Ready are: samples files, data contracts, transformation analysis, single point of contact of relying backend application.\nThis is a very important aspect in large integration projects. You want to avoid that your development team is constantly blocked by unclear dependencies, but on the other hand it's not advised to postpone development constantly as this imposes a risk. It's a difficult balancing exercise that requires a pragmatic approach and a decent level of flexibility.\nIt's important to liberate your development team from the task of gathering these prerequisites, so they can focus on delivering business value. In large integration projects, it's a full-time occupation to chase responsibles from the impacted teams to get the required specs or dependencies. The person taking up this responsibility has a crucial role in the success of the project. Excellent communication and people skills are a must.\n3. Strive for a self-organized team\n\"The team lead gives direct orders to each individual team member\". Get rid of this old-fashioned idea of \"team work\". First, the development team must be involved in estimating the effort for backlog items. In that way, you get a realistic view on the expected development progress and you get the team motivated to meet their estimates. Secondly, it's highly advised to encourage the team to become self-organized. This means they decide on how they organize themselves to get the maximum out of the team, to deliver high quality and to meet the expectations. In the beginning you need to guide them towards that direction, but it's amazing how quick they adapt to that vision.\nTrust is the basis of this kind of collaboration between the team lead (or product owner) and the team. I must admit that it wasn't easy for me in the beginning, as my natural flavour is to be in control. However, the advantages are incredible: team members become highly involved, take responsibility, are better motivated and show real dedication to the project.\nOne might think you lose control, but nothing is less true. Depending on the development progress, you can shift the product backlog in collaboration with your stakeholders. It's also good to schedule regular demo sessions (with or without the customer) to provide your feedback to the development team.\nEach team member has its own role and responsibilities within the team, even though no one ever told them to do so. Replacing one member within the team, always has a drastic impact on the team performance and behaviour. It's like the team loses part of its DNA and needs some time to adjust to the new situation. I'm blessed that I was always able to work together with highly motivated colleagues, but I can imagine it's a hell of a job to strive for a self-organized team that includes some unmotivated individuals.\n4. Bridge the gap between teams\nThe agile vision encourages cross-functional teams, consisting of e.g. business analysts, developers and testers. Preferably one person within the team, can take multiple roles. However, if we face reality, many large organizations still have the mindset of teams per expertise (HR, Finance, .NET, Integration, Java, Testing…). Often there is no good interaction amongst these teams and they are even physically separated.\nIf you are part of the middleware team, you're stuck between the two teams: the ones who manage the source application and those who are developing the target system. Try to convince them to create cross-functional project teams, that are preferably working at the same place. If this is not an option, you can aim at least for a daily stand-up meeting with the most important key-players (the main analysts and developers) involved. Avoid at all time that communication always goes via a management layer, as this is time consuming and a lot of context is lost. As a last resort, you can just go on a daily basis to the floor where the team is situated and discuss the most urgent topics.\nThroughout many integration projects, I've seen the importance of people and communication skills. These soft skills are a must to bridge the gap between different teams. Working full time behind your laptop on your own island, is not the key to success within integration. Collaborate on all levels and cross teams!\n5. Leverage the power of mocking\nIn an ideal scenario, all backend services and modules we need to integrate with are already up and running. However, if we face reality, this is almost never the case. In a waterfall approach, integration would be typically scheduled in the last phase of the project, assuming all required prerequisites are ready at that moment in time. This puts a big risk on the integration layer. According to the scrum and agile principles, this must be avoided at all time.\nThis introduces a challenge for the development team. Developers need to make an abstraction of external systems their solution relies on. They must get familiar with dependency injection and / or mocking frameworks that simulate back-end applications. These techniques allow to start development of the integration layer with less prerequisites and ensure a fast delivery once the depending backend applications are ready. A great mocking framework for BizTalk Server is Transmock, definitely worth checking out if you face problems with mocking. Interesting blogs about this framework can be found here and here, I've also demonstrated its value in this presentation.\n6. Introduce spikes to check connectivity\nIntegration is all about connecting backend systems seamlessly with each other. The setup of a new connection with a backend system can often be a real hassle: exceptions need to be made in the corporate firewall, permissions must be granted on test environments, security should be configured correctly, valid test data sets must be available, etc...\nIn many organizations, these responsibilities are spread across multiple teams and the procedures to request such changes can cause a lot of administrative and time consuming overhead. In order to avoid your development team is being blocked by such organizational waste, it is advised to put these connectivity setups early on the product backlog as \"spikes\". When the real development work starts in a later iteration, the connectivity setup has already been given a green light.\n7. Focus first on end-to-end\nThis flowchart explains in depth the rules you can apply to split user stories. Integration scenarios match the best with Workflow Steps. This advice is really helpful: \"Can you take a thin slice through the workflow first and enhance it with more stories later?\". The first focus should be to get it work end-to-end, so that at least some data is exchanged between source and target application. This can be with a temporary data contract, within a simplified security model, without more advanced features like caching, sequence controlling, duplicate detection, batching, etc…\nAs a real-life example, we recently had the request to expose an internal API that must consume an external API to calculate distances. There were some additional requirements: the responses from the external API must be stored for a period of 1 month, to save transaction costs of the external API; authentication must be performed with the identity of the requesting legal entity, so this can be billed separately; both sync and asynchronous internal API must be exposed. The responsibility of the product owner is to find the Minimal Valuable Product (MVP). In this case, it was a synchronous internal API, without caching and with one fixed identity for the whole organization. During later phases, this API was enhanced with caching, with a dynamic identity and an async interface.\nIn some projects, requirements are written in stone upfront and are not a subject of negotiation: the interface can only be released in production if all requirements are met. In such cases, it's also a good exercise to find the MVP required for acceptance testing. In that way, you can release faster internally, which results in faster feedback from internal testing.\n8. Put common non-functionals on the Definition of Done\nIn middleware solutions, there are often requirements on high performance, high throughput and large message handling. Most of these requirements can be tackled by applying best practices in your development: use a streaming design in order to avoid loading messages entirely in memory, reduce the number of persistence points, cache configuration values wherever it's applicable, etc…\nIt's a good practice to put such development principles on the Definition of Done, to ensure an overall quality of your product. Code reviews should check whether these best practices are applied. Only in case that specific measures need to be taken to meet exceptional performance criteria, it's advised to list these requirements explicitly as user stories on the product backlog.\n\"Done\" also means: it's tested and can be shipped at any moment. Agree on the required level of test automation: is unit testing (white box) sufficient, do you fully rely on manual acceptance testing or is a minimal level of automated system testing (black box) required? Involve the customer in this decision, as this impacts the team composition, quality and budget. It's also a common practice to ensure automated deployment is in place, so you can release quickly, with a minimal impact. Fantastic to see that team members are challenging each other, during the daily stand-up, to verify if the Definition of Done has been respected.\n9. Aim for early acceptance (testing)\nIn quite a lot of ERP implementations, go-live is performed in some big phases, preceded by several months of development. Mostly, acceptance testing is planned at the same pace. This means that flows being developed at the beginning of the development stage, will remain several months untouched until acceptance testing is executed. One important advice here: acceptance testing should follow the iterative development approach and not the slow-paced go-live schedule.\nOne of the base principles of an agile approach is to get fast feedback: fail fast and cheap. Early acceptance testing will ensure your integrations will be evaluated by the end users against the requirements. If possible, also involve operations in this acceptance process: they will be able to provide feedback on the monitoring, alerting, troubleshooting capabilities of your integration solution. This feedback is very useful to optimize the integration flows and to take into account these lessons learned for the subsequent development efforts. This approach can avoid a lot of refactoring afterwards…\nTesting is not the only way to get feedback. Try to schedule demos on a regular basis, to verify if you are heading in the right direction. It's very important to adapt the demo to your stakeholders. A demo for operations can be done with technical tools, while explaining all details about reliability and security. When presenting to functional key users, keep the focus on the business process and the added value that integration brings. Try to include both source and target application, so they can witness the end result without exactly knowing what is under the hood. If you can demonstrate that you create a customer in one application and this get synchronised into two other applications within 10 seconds, you have them on your side!\n10. Adapt to improve\nContinuous improvement is a key to success. This improvement must be reflected on two levels: your product and your team. Let's first consider improvements on the product, of which you have two types. You have optimizations that are derived from direct feedback from your stakeholders. They provide immediate value to your product, which is in this case your integration project. These can be placed on the backlog. Secondly, there are adaptations that result in indirect value, such as refactoring. Refactoring is intended to stabilize the product, to improve its maintenance and to prepare it for change. It's advised to only refactor a codebase that is thoroughly tested, to ensure you do not introduce regression bugs.\nNext to this, it's even more important to challenge the way the team is working and collaborating. Recurring retrospectives are the starting point, but they must result in real actions. Let the development team decide on the subjects they want to improve. Sometimes these could be quick wins: making some working agreements about collaboration, communication, code review, etc… Other actions might take more time: improve the development experience, extend the unit testing platform, optimize the ALM approach. All these actions result in better collaboration, higher productivity and faster release cycles.\nI find it quite challenging to deal with such indirect improvements. I used to place them also on the backlog, whilst the team decides on their priority. We mixed them with backlog items that result in direct business value, in a 90% (direct value) / 10% (indirect value) proportion. The drawback of this approach is that not everyone is involved in indirect improvements. Another way to tackle this is reserving 1 day, every two weeks, that is dedicated for such improvements. In that way the whole team is involved in this process, which encourages the idea of having a self-organized development team.\nHope you've enjoyed this one!","Problem Solving in a Complex Organization Requires Two-Way Communication\nMany of us work in organizations that require multiple points of communication\nSuccessful relationships in complex organizations must begin with:\n- Common understanding of goals\n- Clear understanding of individual roles\n- Commitment to accomplishment of objectives\nThe key to a successful relationship is effective two-way communication. One-way communication takes considerably less time; however, two-way communication is considerably more accurate.\nAs a speaker in the communication process, make your message as clear as possible. Avoid overgeneralizations or excessively firm statements – this might force a defensive response from your listener. Don’t threaten your listener(s) by using unknown jargon or fifty dollar words. Check for understanding from your listeners. Our words are always subject to misinterpretation, watch for indicators (verbal and nonverbal) of misinterpretation and respond to them. Ask for feedback on clarity. Restate and summarize when needed.\nAs the receiver of a message listen carefully to the person speaking. That sounds simple, but it takes a lot of effort to listen well. Demonstrate that you value others’ opinions by not interrupting or responding prematurely. Never jump to conclusions before you have all the facts. Listen and ask questions! As you are listening, be careful to distinguish facts from opinions. Paraphrase the message back to the speaker to check for clarity when necessary.\nThe effectiveness of an organization is in large part dependent on the effectiveness of communication within the organization; lateral communication and vertical communication increase the need for accurate and open communication. Good communication skills require attention and practice. We need to continually work on and hone these skills.\nThe characteristic elements of relationships in complex organizations are:\n- Multiple points of input and direction\n- Shared responsibilities / ownership\n- Increased participation\n- Decision making by peers\n- Organizational lateral information flow\n- Minimal hierarchy congestion\n- Coordination of people with relevant, timely knowledge\n- Vertical and lateral processes and decision making input\nOf these characteristics, probably the two most critical are: two or more bosses (dual reporting) and decision making by peers.\nTwo or More Bosses\nAlthough business organizations have traditionally evolved as one-boss hierarchies, we are all familiar with dual reporting relationships. The most common example of dual reporting is the family structure: we all had a mother and a father. As children we were responsible to both of them, and they both had authority over us. Conflicts a child may encounter are rarely due to the existence of a second parent. In fact, one parent often helps ease the difficulties a child might encounter with the other parent.\nDecision Making in Matrices\nThe second critical characteristic of complex organizations is decision making by peers. Decisions are made every day. They may range from fairly simple decisions, such as what to eat for lunch to as complex a decision as where to put the next manufacturing plant.\nIn traditional hierarchies, a clearly defined chain of command dictates that a certain kind of decision can be made by a person occupying a certain position in the organization chart. In a complex organization, however, this is no longer true. Decision making is moved down to where information is generated and authority to make decisions exists. Moving decision making down in the organization allows for decisions to be made by a mix of people with knowledge power (power derived from intimate familiarity with the technology of the day) and people with position power (power attained from years of experience with the organization). In an information industry where success depends on what we know, the inclusion of knowledge-power people in the decision-making process is crucial.\nThe increase in the number of decisions made at lower levels in an organization increases the organization’s dependence on the quality of decisions made. The decision-making process we use, therefore, is critical. Understanding of the process is essential to making timely, effective decisions.\nHere is an example of a 7-step methodology to help the team decision-making process work effectively in complex organization.\n1. Build the team to define the problem and set the objectives.\nGenerally, the decision-making process starts with some information or data that a problem exists. The first step is to put together a team to examine the problem indicators in order to get a clear definition of the issues. This problem-definition team should include a mix of the people who are closest to the situations, who know the most about it and the “owners” of the problem. This team will not necessarily include the “solvers” of the problem during this step.\nIt is imperative that the real problem(s) be clearly defined. Too often we find ourselves working on solutions to the symptoms of problems, not the real problem. In defining the problem, ask a lot of “who, what and when” type of questions. For example: What are the symptoms? Where does the problem occur? What departments are involved? What shifts? What influence, if any, does time of day, day of the week, etc., have on the problem?\nNow is not the time to ask “why.” Why implies cause and solution issues. Remember, this is the problem definition step. Never jump to solutions until the problem(s) are clearly identified. Once the problem is clear, the team must establish commonly agreed-on objectives. In other words, what are you trying to get done? Well thought-out objectives will not only help you define the problem, but will help you decide whether it is a problem worth solving. It is important to start with objectives, so you know where you are going and have some basis with which to measure the decision. Your objectives will become the focus of all discussions, data gathering and related considerations from this point on.\nObjectives should be written in terms of the specific goal(s) to be reached. (E.g., the purpose of this decision is….). Supplement objectives with realistic milestones. That is, the things that must be completed to accomplish the objective(s). Often a decision is not reached because clear milestones and deadlines have not been set.\n2. Build the team to solve the problem.\nOnce the problem has been clearly defined and the objectives and milestones set, the emphasis of the team players shift to making the decisions which will solve the problem.\nThe problem-solving team may or may not be the same team that worked on problem definition. Clarity of the problem may indicate that different team members with different expertise and authority are needed for solving the problem. Decisions should be made at the lowest competent level. This means that the team should include a mix of technical expertise (knowledge-power people) and members capable of implementing the decision (position-power people).\nThis team should be kept small but it is essential that all pertinent areas are represented. For example, the team for a decision about a product shipment should include representation from manufacturing, engineering and marketing. The team for a feature decision on a processor should include chip designers, architects and marketing personnel.\n3. Define the causes and alternative solutions to the problem.\nThe goal of this step is to identify the true cause(s) of the problem. Causes of a problem, unlike symptoms, are seldom readily apparent. Start this step by hypothesizing possible causes of the problem. To do this you need to analyze all the tangible evidence that is available. Occasionally it will be necessary to collect additional data during this step.\nNow is the time to start asking “why”. For example, why has the reject rate risen to 30 percent? Or, why is the current hardware no longer able to process information that the development group is generating.\nOnce the causes of the problem are identified, the team should generate alternative solutions. Alternatives need to be stated as clearly as possible. Each alternative should be accurately described so there can be no misunderstanding as to the possibilities from which you are making your selection. As a team, discuss the alternatives looking at the advantages, disadvantages, costs and expected results of each. Narrow the list of alternatives down to the two or three most viable solutions.\nIt is has not been done already, the team should also establish the criterion (or criteria) that must be met by the solution. You can’t recognize the best solution without some “ideal” to compare it against. Establishing criteria is a natural extension of the objective(s) set in Step 1. For example, if money is an objective, specify the monetary cost target. If quality control is an objective, specify the acceptable error rate target.\nGenerally, some criteria are more important than others. And, some will be absolute in their importance. Look at your list of criteria and identify any which are “musts” – the ones that cannot be compromised in any way. Once you have identified all the musts, prioritize any remaining criteria in order of their relative importance.\nAt all times in the decision-making process, open discussion should be encouraged. All facts, opinions and points of view should be heard in an atmosphere of openness and candor. All team members need to participate in proposing and evaluating suggestions. Each member serves as a sounding board for others’ ideas.\n4. Gain commitment to the decision process.\nBefore the decision is actually made be sure all team members are committed to the decision-making process. This is critical. Each member of the team must agree to support whatever decision is reached. Agree to disagree and commit - agreement with the decision is not necessary, but commitment to back the decision is a must! Avoid “lipotage” – the act of giving lip service to an agreement and then sabotaging it later. It is what happens when people say they commit and only keep that commitment until they are out of the door.\nWhy people don’t commit or renege after seeming to commit:\n- Perception of dishonorable intent\n- Perception of unfairness\n- Perception of a sham\n- Perception of stupidity\n- Perception of being powerless\nSome suggestions to make sure you never commit lipotage again:\n- Set ground rules for disagreement\n- Create a signal\n- Get in the habit of disagreeing – have courage!\n- Practice positive cantankerousness\n- Take a risk a day\n- Express your feelings off-line\n5. Make decision and obtain ratification when required.\nNow is the time to make the decision. By now you have developed some viable alternative solutions and a detailed list of criteria. You have also identified which criteria are musts and which allow some flexibility. Now you need to combine all of these elements to determine how good the alternatives are. They must be evaluated against the criteria and against one another.\nApply the criteria established in Step 3 to each alternative solution. Look first at your “must” criteria. Any solutions which don’t meet these can be eliminated immediately. Look at both the positive and negative consequences of each solution in terms of the team objective. Also consider the future consequence each solution might have. Ask: What trouble might it create? Who else would it affect? What effect will it have on other activities? What opportunities might it open up?\nOnce the pros and cons of each viable solution have been analyzed, choose the alternative which best fits the need. Remember, consensus (agreement on an alternative whether or not all parties to the decision prefer it) must be reached on all decisions made. Ratification of the decision must be obtained when the team doesn’t have the power of implementation of the decision.\n6. Prepare, communicate and execute implementation plan.\nPrepare an implementation plan. List the action steps that need to be taken to implement the solution and identify responsibilities and completion dates for each. Be sure that everyone involved or affected by the decision has not only been informed of the decision, but has had an opportunity to discuss the decision and its implementation with you. Clear communication is vital.\nThe implementation plan should also specify how to evaluate the success of the solution. Go back to the objectives generated in Step 1 and the criteria established in Step 3. These will point to the appropriate evaluation mechanisms. If you have established criteria such as a monetary goal or a reject rate percentage goal, be sure you have a way to collect the data necessary to determine if you have met those goals.\nDon’t reopen debate or overturn a decision without good reason. However, don’t be inflexible. If a decision is failing to gain the support necessary for implementation, maybe it was the wrong decision. Don’t be afraid to revisit, but be sure there is significant new data which indicates the need.\n7. Review progress and abolish team when the objective(s) is accomplished.\nThe importance of this follow-up step cannot be stressed enough. Always check the results of the evaluation set up in Step 6 to determine if the problem has already been solved. If the results show the problem still exists, you probably need to go back to Step 1 and redefine the problem. If, however, the implemented solution is achieving the desired results, check to see if the team needs to continue. If you have accomplished the objectives, abolish the team.\nNot a member-scholar yet?

{"question":"What are the benefits of mycorrhizal fungi for plant health, and how do different agricultural management practices affect these fungal relationships?","answer":"Mycorrhizal fungi form beneficial associations with about 90% of plant species, providing increased water and nutrient uptake for plants while receiving carbohydrates in return. Their thin hyphal filaments can absorb minute water droplets that cling tightly to soil particles, making plants more drought resistant. However, agricultural practices can significantly impact these fungal relationships. Tillage physically tears apart fungal bodies and breaks soil aggregates that fungi help create. Fungicides directly kill fungal populations, while herbicides like glyphosate can interfere with biochemical functions by chelating metals important for enzymatic processes. These practices can disrupt the complex ecological relationships that support plant health.","context":["All orchids, including this Colorado native orchid, Coralroot, Corrallorhiza maculata, are completely dependent on on mycorrhizal fungi to begin their life cycle and and this reliance continues to varying degrees throughout their life. Photo credit: SPD\nUnseen, unheard, and certainly under-appreciated, beneath the ground we walk on lies a living world that is critical to the health and the future of both plants and people. This underground world is not just dirt. It’s a complex ecosystem at work feeding plants and sequestering four more times the carbon than all of our terrestrial plants, even when rainforests are included. Healthy soil inhibits erosion and produces plant growth that is more robust, and importantly, more nutritious. We’ve got to stop treating our soil like dirt!\nThis productive ecosystem is made up of non-living elements like minerals and humus (animal and plant parts in all stages of decomposition) as well bacteria, fungi, and\nliving creatures, tiny ones you’ve heard of like springtails, centipedes, mites, and insect larvae; and tiny ones you haven’t, like, symphylids and diplurans, and then the larger ones like moles, salamanders, ants, and toads, all of them contributing to soil health.\nOne gram (about 1/5 teaspoon) of healthy, non-poisoned soil could contain one hundred million bacteria, one million actinomycetes, and one hundred thousand fungi; if strung together, their filaments or hyphae would measure about 16 feet (5 meters) in length.\nClimate-Wise Landscaping, Reed and Stibolt\nPlant roots in a mycorrhizal relationship. Photo courtesy Wilhelm Zimmerling PAR, CC BY-SA 4.0 <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0>, via Wikimedia Commons\nNew technologies have given researchers expanded understanding of how important the fungal relationships called mycorrhizae are in developing healthy, resilient plants. The word ‘mycorrhiza’ comes from the Greek words ‘mukès’ (fungus), and ‘rhiza’ (roots). So we now have fungus roots, which about sums it up. Mycorrhiza is a network of fungi that form an association with the roots of a plant. About 90% of all plants species are engaged in this relationship. The plant benefits from an increased intake of water, minerals, and nutrients from mycorrhiza, and the fungus, which can’t photosynthesize under there, gains carbohydrates from the plant. The word mycorrhiza is used to refer at different times to both the relationship itself, and to the group of fungi that are involved. The plural form is ‘mycorrhizae.’\nHere in CO we might be especially interested in the ways mycorrhizae assist plants in acquiring more water and becoming more drought resistant. Because mycorrhizal hyphae, (threadlike filaments) are thinner\nthan plant roots, they are able to absorb minute drops of water which are clinging more tightly to soil particles under high pressure underground. The collective group of thin hyphae, known as the mycelium, gives each plant a vastly increased area of contact with the soil from which to gain access to both water and nutrients. Mycorrhizae have a vast array of methods for collecting, changing, and exchanging food – another fascinating study to explore.\nSoil Health Is Reaching the General Media\nTwo well-known, general-interest publications have raised the question of soil viability recently. Time magazine’s first issue in June devotes an article to what they call ‘soil extinction,’ The Future of Our Planet Rests In the Quality of Our Soil. George Monbiot, writing for The Guardian in May, gives us The Secret World Beneath Our Feet and claims that soil is the world’s most neglected ecosystem. Both articles raise the important connection between the collective health of the world’s soil and the problem of feeding the world without devouring it. It’s now clear that we must begin to preserve and foster this hidden life form, soil, instead of depleting it in the ways that many of our farming and forestry practices are currently doing. Detrimental practices such as:\n- Over-fertilization, especially of nitrogen\n- Disturbance, especially plowing\n- Landscape-wide use of pesticides and herbicides\n- Compaction and erosion\nnegatively affect the underground food web, destroying rather than promoting the health of the soil we depend on to grow abundant, healthy, and nutritious plants, and to store carbon below ground where it helps plants instead of harming people.\nWhat Does This Mean for Us?\nWhat can we do, each of us, as gardeners, landscape managers, voters, and community influencers?\nFirst and foremost: knowledge is power. Understanding the issues gives us the means of improving practices to promote soil health and of explaining to others why soil health is important.\nThe Colorado Department of Agriculture has developed helpful guidelines based on the STAR program, originally conceived of to improve methods of commercial farming and livestock operations. However, the five basic principles are excellent guidelines for all gardeners, and interestingly, they are also ones recommended in the two articles referenced above.

The Colorado Extension mentions that bagged and bulked purchased soil amendments are not regulated and many are high in salts, including manure and manure-based composts, which should be used with caution. Plant-based composts are typically higher in price but more effective in soil improvement.

Soil, it’s so much more than dirt!\nColorado Native Plant Society","Dr. Kristine Nichols was the Chief Scientist at the Rodale Institute, an independent research institute for organic farming, from 2014 to 2017. Her training and research focus on the microbes living in soil and how to make soil more productive.\nThe Rodale Institute was founded in 1947 in Kutztown, PA by J.I. Rodale. Inspired by the nitrogen fertilizer shortages during World War II, Rodale wanted to develop practical methods of rebuilding soil fertility. Today, the institute focuses particularly on compost, soil health, weed and pest management, livestock operations, organic certification, wastewater treatment, and climate change. It is home to the longest running comparative study of organic and chemical agriculture, started in 1981.\nDr. Nichols double majored in Plant Biology and Genetics and Cell Biology at the University of Minnesota. She went on to earn a Master’s degree in Environmental Microbiology from West Virginia University and ultimately a Ph.D. in Soil Science from the University of Maryland. After graduating, Dr. Nichols started working at the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) as a Soil Microbiologist. She served as Chief Scientist at the Rodale Institute from 2014 to 2017, where she examined the impacts that crop rotation, tillage practices, organic production, cover crops, and livestock grazing have on soil aggregation, water relationships, and glomalin, a molecule produced by fungi that improves soil productivity.\nFood Tank had the opportunity to talk to Dr. Kristine Nichols about how soil microbes affect agriculture and about some of the trials the Rodale Institute are conducting.\nFood Tank (FT): What is the importance of soil microbes to agriculture and how are they affected by different agricultural systems and changing climates?\nKristine Nichols (KN): Soil microbes are key to the function of agricultural systems. Microbial populations play roles in nutrient cycling, from fixing nitrogen to solubilizing phosphorus. Some microbes assist in the formation of soil aggregates that improve pore space in the soil, which allows for higher infiltration rates, better water-holding capacity, and lowers the compaction that often impedes root growth. Other microbes are involved in extensive predator and prey relationships that can reduce the prevalence of disease. Many microorganisms are involved in organic matter decomposition, which releases nutrients needed by other microbes and plants, while others break down soil minerals for nutrient cycling. Several organisms play multiple roles in the soil or have roles that may change based on the microenvironment. Others work in complex consortia to satisfy functional needs.\nDifferent agricultural systems and changing climates impact microbial communities. Although the impacts of changing climate are felt less directly be microbial communities, changing precipitation patterns can affect them by creating prolonged aerobic or anaerobic conditions. Typically, agricultural management practices have more of an impact on microbial communities.\nInsecticides not only kill macroscopic insects, they also kill microscopic insects, or microarthropods. The normal cycle is for microarthropods to shred organic matter for bacteria and fungi. The bacteria and fungi are then eaten by protozoa and nematodes, which ‘poop’ out nitrogen and other elements as nutrients for plants. Without microarthropods, many bacterial and fungal populations within the soil foodweb begin to decline. This then impacts concentrations of protozoa and nematodes and reduces the amount of nitrogen available for plants. Fungicides directly kill some populations of fungi and nematicides kill all nematodes, most of which aren’t plant pathogens. All of this killing negatively impacts diversity, nutrient cycling, and other functions in ways we do not currently understand. We are still learning about the impacts of herbicides. One thing that we do know is that one of the most widely used herbicides, glyphosate, is a strong metal chelator and metals are important components of enzymes that impact biochemical functions in micro- and macro-organisms. Therefore, they are impacting microbial populations but we don’t fully understand all of these processes yet.\nWhen it comes to synthetic fertilizer use, there are direct and indirect impacts on microbes. The direct impacts stem from the fact that most fertilizers are salt-based, which disrupts hydrologic activities, essentially ‘stealing’ water away from microbes. Ammonia-based fertilizers increase the acidity of our soils and are initially toxic to living organisms that come in contact with them. Several people argue that these impacts are small and microbial populations recover and recolonize an area where other microbes have been killed because they feed on the dead bodies of those microbes. But the long-term impacts of repeated usage may be very large and we don’t know for sure what microbial populations we lost or which ones are increasing by these processes and the impact on overall soil function. The indirect impacts of fertilizers are that we are basically ‘outsourcing the jobs’ of the microbes that are normally involved in cycling and delivering nutrients to the plants. These microbes often receive a carbon ‘payment’ for this service that they can then use to grow and reproduce, but if the fertilizers are satisfying the nutrient demands from the plant without the plant having to ‘pay’ for them, then the microbes do not receive enough carbon to grow and reproduce.\nTillage is another disruptive practice because it physically tears apart the bodies of fungi. It also breaks apart soil aggregates that fungi and bacteria put energy and resources into creating and serve as a habitat for these bacteria and fungi. We recommend reducing the frequency and depth of tillage as well as the overall amount of soil that is disrupted by a particular tillage tool.\nA diverse crop rotation that has at least three, but ideally more like five to ten different crops in the rotation sequence, provides a diverse ‘diet’ to the microbial community and stimulates diversity that builds resilience. The most important thing that a farmer is harvesting is sunlight and using cover crops, companion crops, double cropping, and/or perennial phases are a way for this to happen. We need to ‘keep something green and growing’. Managing livestock, pollinators, and predators, especially predatory insects, are other ways in which soil microbes receive benefits both directly and indirectly. Indirect impacts are often on the plants which provide most of the food sources for soil microbes either as root exudates or plant tissue/residue. Directly there are impacts on the diversity of microbes because these are mechanisms for new microbes to be transported into a new environment and impacts on the physical environments for microbes.\nFT: How can soil improve food security and combat climate change?\nKN: Soil health is critical to both food security and combating climate change because soil is the foundational resource for our food production—basically, without soil, we cannot grow food. Although an argument can be made that we can grow food hydroponically without soil, the resources needed to produce nutrient dense food would be very costly—fiscally and environmentally. Also, research indicates that there are some amino acids and antioxidants important for human health that can only be produced by fungi and some bacteria, meaning that they only get into the human food chain through a connection to the soil. Food security is no longer just about having enough food, it is also about having nutrient dense food so we can solve the twin crises of malnutrition and obesity that we are finding within the same families and sometimes within the same people.\nWhen it comes to combating climate change, we are also confronting a dual threat that a focus on soil health will solve for us. If we can design agricultural production systems that are using biologically-based practices to regenerate soil, we will sequester more carbon (i.e. build soil organic matter). This will also reduce nitrous oxide emissions by reducing nitrogen fertilizer use, particularly if leguminous cover crops are managed appropriately. These systems seem to be more resilient against climatic uncertainty because they have more water-stable soil aggregates, allowing water to get into the soil faster (i.e. reducing runoff) and be held in the soil between rainfall events (i.e. increase drought tolerance).\nFT: The Farming Systems Trial (FST) at RI is the longest-running comparison of organic and chemical agriculture in the United States. What has been learned since it started in 1981 and what objectives for the trial still remain?\nKN: Initially this study was designed to determine how to grow organic grain crops in large-scale fields and how production compared to conventional grain crop yields. Over the years, the goals of this study have evolved to include reducing environmental and health risks in agriculture, improving crop productivity (i.e. yield), water quality, protection of natural resources, and the quality of life for farmers, their employees, and the farm community, reducing costs, increasing net farm income, conserving soil, and mitigating climate change. In 2016, an additional goal was added to evaluate the impacts of management practices on the nutritive quality of food, particularly how soil health is linked to human health.\nFT: An offshoot of the FST is the Vegetable System Trial, in which you are examining the soil health and crop nutrition under the two agricultural systems. As you wrap up your first season, what have you found and what are the future goals of the program?\nKN: The main goal to link soil health and human health remains the same and will probably continue for several years. Along the way, Dr. Smith, who is the Director of the project, is examining innovative ways to manage pests and diseases and the impacts of drought-stress or no irrigation on production and quality.\nFT: What big questions in agriculture do you think still need to be answered?\nKN: Agriculture is imperative to human survival—providing nutritious food, clean air and water, and maintaining the soil resource. The challenges that agriculture faces are not new, but we need to take a new (really an old) approach to solving them. Agriculture has always been a risky business, subject to whims of weather, pest, and disease. Modern agriculture is also plagued by economic volatility and outside pressures, which is strange given how vital it is to our survival as a species.\nThe approach that we need to take rests in using a systems approach with the soil as the foundation even though soil is something that we don’t fully understand and quite possibly never will. We need to identify the agricultural practices that will maximize the use of this soil resource and allow us to eliminate the use of offsite inputs, particularly synthetic fertilizers and pesticides. We also need to understand the best ways to integrate livestock into the system. As we start to put biologically-based, soil enhancing tools into place, we will increase soil organic matter and biological activity. This will automatically improve water and nutrient use efficiency and reduce soil loss and greenhouse gas emissions—particularly nitrous oxide, methane, and carbon dioxide. This will allow farmers to produce abundant and nutritious food under climatic uncertainty.\nThe good news is that we now have a better understanding of the platform (i.e. systems approach with a soil foundation) that we need to use. It will solve the economic and environmental problems of agriculture as well as the needs for nutrient dense food by our growing population. It will also help us to adapt to and mitigate climate change. The bad news is that we have a lot that we need to learn about the management practices we need to implement (i.e. crop rotation, cover crops, equipment, use of insectary strips or trap crops, pollinators, predators, etc.)."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:5052c241-604a-4bc7-a221-5934fe32e9fd>","<urn:uuid:251f1013-79d6-4d07-a8c7-447e697dbc95>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Which animal can strike faster: the mantis shrimp's hammer-like appendages or the trap-jaw ant's mandibles?","answer":"The trap-jaw ant's mandibles strike faster. While the mantis shrimp's appendages move at 13-23 m/s in water, the trap-jaw ant's mandibles have acceleration that is a hundred thousand times greater than standard mandibles and close thousands of times faster than a human eye blink. Both animals use a similar spring-like mechanism to store energy before striking, but the trap-jaw ant has the fastest known acceleration of any animal body part that can return to its original position.","context":["The Physics Behind the Mantis Shrimp\nBy: Andrew Poteres\nThe Mantis Shrimp is a well-known deep sea creature. It may look like a friendly creature out of a Disney film, but it is far from. In fact, the Mantis shrimp is one of the fiercest predators of the sea. They typically reach about 30 cm in length once full grown, and get about 10-12 cm tall. They live alone and are fighters. They're extremely aggressive and use 2 hammer-like appendages to strike prey. These deadly appendages move about 13-23 m/s in water, and aren't weak either....\nIn a study published by The Journal of Experimental Biology, they concluded that these strikes can get up to 1500 N of force! One oddity that they noticed in this study, was that there were two force peaks showing when only one appendage was striking the sensor. Close inspection of the strike, through the use of a high speed camera, revealed a small cavitation bubble being created by the strike. A cavitation is a phenomenon engineers deal with in plumbing. Rapid changes in fluid pressure causes cavitations to occur and create small vapor bubbles. Inertial Cavitation, the type in this case, is a destructive phenomenon; when these vapor bubbles collapse, they essentially cause a small implosion in the water which produces a shock wave sending out heat, light and sound. The study later indicated the average limb strike to be about 327 N and the average cavitation force to be about 278 N.\n(Note: above video was originally filmed in 5000 FPS then later slowed down to 15 FPS to better visualize cavitation bubble) I did a video analysis of the video above to come up with my own appendage and cavitation force observations.\nCalculations for Force of appendage strike:\nx = ½ a t^2 + v(initial) t + x(initial)= -.0394 t^2 +21.42 t - 24.78\n½ a t^2 = -.0394 t^2\na= 2(-.0394 m)\n5000 FPS /15 FPS = 333.33\n333.33 * a = a(adjusted for fps change)\na= 26.26 m/s/s (adjusted for fps change)\nF=~13 g (26.26 m/s/s)\nF= 341.125 N\nNow the Calculations for the Force of the Cavitation bubble:\nF(collapse of one bubble)= 2π * p * r min * ( (√h^2 + r^2) -h)\nwhere p is the pressure of the fluid, r min is the minimum radius of the bubble, h is the distance from the middle of the bubble to the wall, r is the radius of the bubble\nF= 2π * (P(initial) + pgh) * (.001 m) * ((√(1.6e-5 m^2 + .44444m^2)) - .004 m)\nF= 2π * (1e5 Pa + 1000 kg/m^3 * 9.8 m/s/s * .2 m) * .001 m * (.662678666 m)\nF= 2π * (101960 kg/s^2) * 6.6267 e-4 m^2\nF= 2π * 67.566 N\nF= 424.528 N\nNow we have to account for negative Force occurring during implosion/explosion:\ns= (Pr - Pv) / (1/2 ρ v^2)\ns= (1e5 Pa - 23.8 Pa) / (.5 1000 kg/m^3 * (8.7 m/s)^2)\nF(negative)= 160.806 N\nF(positive)= 263.722 N\nwhere s = cavitation number, Pr is the reference pressure, Pv is the vapor pressure, p is the density, and v is the speed of the fluid during explosion (speed of appendage right before contact). The negative force was found to be inversely proportional to the cavitation number of the bubble.\nNegative force does not mean physically negative force. It just means that it was in the opposite direction. I wanted the force in only one direction so i had to account for the force in the opposite direction and subtract it. After all my calculations I got:\nForce of appendage strike = 341.125 N\nForce of cavitation explosion = 263.722 N\nCombined force = 604.847 N\nRatio of strike to bubble = 1.293\nI calculated the ratio because I wanted to weigh the accuracy of my calculations to the accuracy of the force sensors in the actual studies. The studies said that their ratio for strike to bubble was 1.17. Mine was 1.29 so I think i was pretty close to the actual sensors. I feel I was only off a bit because I rounded a couple numbers. The appendage strike was only ~341 N which would be on the low end for the study I looked at but still pretty high for a crustaceans appendage in water.\nHow is this possible?\nAfter analyzing, and figuring out how hard these things actually hit, I became curious as to how this was possible at all. Upon further research, I was led to the mechanism that dictates the appendages movement. The Mantis Shrimp have a saddle shaped spring -like above the appendages that is responsible for the strengths of the strikes.\nThis sort of mechanism is called a 'click' mechanism. These types of mechanisms take awhile to store up energy. The muscles contract, like a spring, and are held in place by a latch. Once the shrimp wants to strike, it releases the latch, and all the stored up potential energy becomes kinetic. Kind of like a catapult. This explains why the shrimp strike significantly harder than a usual crustacean. Instead of relying on the potential energy stored in a small amount of time to strike, like humans and other animals, the mantis shrimp stores it up over time and waits for the opportunity to unleash it. It uses potential energy stored up over a time period instead of drawing up energy in the moment to strike like a human would do in a punch thrown.\nThis dynamically flexible structure is responsible for the energy buildup and release in the mantis shrimp strikes. Though it may not look like it, it is actually a type of spring. A spring is the only way the shrimp could achieve the high levels of force that it came to. During a normal strike, the saddle structure was observed as contracted at the beginning. Then as the strike was carried out the saddle extends and even goes as far to hyper extend. This type of mechanism is known as a hyperbolic-paraboloid, and is the key to paralyzing strikes that mantis shrimp is known for.\nThis was used to bridge a gap between engineering and biology. Many engineers used this design for structures that needed to be very strong while utilizing a small amount of material. This type of structure can be seen a lot in architecture. I just found it amazing that we utilized the biology of a shrimp and applied its years of evolutionary knowledge to our modern day engineering in order to better our usage of resources.\nStudy numbers were all from:\nPhysics equations were from:","Small changes in form can lead to innovative breakthroughs in function, a new study reveals.\n- Researchers have revealed how an ant’s trap-jaw — a powerful, ultrafast and complex evolutionary trait — evolved from a simpler ancestral jaw mechanism\n- The study found that the trap-jaw mechanism evolved 7-10 times independently across the world\n- The trap-jaw function was able to evolve with only minor changes in the form of the jaw, followed by the evolution of diverse trap-jaw forms\n- Researchers saw the same variations of trap-jaws evolving independently on different continents, showing the repeatability of the evolution of this complex trait\n- High-speed videography showed that the trap-jaw is the fastest accelerating animal body part that is resettable\nPowerful and deadly, the bite of a trap-jaw ant is renowned throughout the animal kingdom. Unlike normal gripping jaws, which rely on muscles to open and close, the trap-jaw latches itself open, storing energy like a stretched spring. When released, the jaws of the ant snap shut on their prey in one ultrafast strike.\nTrap-jaws are a record-breaking evolutionary innovation, but scientists still don’t understand how this complex mechanism evolved from simpler ancestors. Now, publishing today (March 2, 2021) in PLOS Biology, a research team led by Professor Evan Economo from the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University (OIST) and Dr. Douglas Booher from Yale University, New Haven CT, along with an international team of collaborators, have shown how trap-jaws originated and then diversified multiple times across the world.\nThe animation shows the changes in form as the trap-jaw mechanism becomes more divergent from the ancestral form. The jaws (yellow) develop small projections that can latch onto the labrum (purple). The labrum changes from functioning as a sensor in the ancestral gripping jaw to acting as a latch in the trap-jaw. The muscles in the head that control the jaw and the labrum undergo large changes in structure.\n“One of the central questions in biology is: how does something complex arise from something simple?” said Professor Economo, who leads the Biodiversity and Biocomplexity Unit at OIST. “Structures like the trap-jaw depend on multiple interacting parts to function correctly. At first it can be hard to see how such complexity can arise through the gradual stepwise changes of evolution. Nevertheless, when we look closely biologists can uncover evolutionary pathways to complexity.”\nMany ant species with trap-jaws are part of the Strumigenys genus — a wildly diverse group with over 900 species found in tropical and sub-tropical regions across the globe.\n“This genus holds many closely-related species where the trap-jaw is present or absent, which gives us a really unique opportunity to understand how it arose,” said Professor Economo.\nHigh-speed videography captures motion at a rate of 480,000 frames per second (fps) and plays it back at 30fps (16,000x slow motion). The trap-jaw accelerates faster and reaches higher speeds than the simpler gripping mechanism.\nAt OIST, in collaboration with Professor Alexander Mikheyev’s Ecology and Evolution Unit, the research team extracted and sequenced DNA from 470 Strumigenys ant species worldwide, including those with ancestral gripping jaws and those with modified trap-jaws.\nThe researchers reconstructed a tree showing the evolutionary relationships between the species. They then analyzed the jaw mechanism by using micro-CT scanners to create 3D images and models of the ants.\nThe researchers found that the trap-jaw mechanism had evolved 7-10 times independently across the world.\nImportantly, only a very small change in form was required to drastically change the function of the jaw from the gripping mechanism to the trap mechanism. After the change in function occurred, then the head of trap-jaw ants started to undergo massive restructuring of the muscles and diversified in the length of the jaw and how wide the jaw opened.\nTrap-jaw ants show remarkable diversity in the length of the jaw and how wide it opens.\n“Previously, we had thought that all trap-jaws had both divergent form and divergent function, so it was much less obvious as to whether the change in function could occur at the start or whether a lot of changes to the form were first needed as a precondition,” said Professor Economo. “But it turned out there are many intermediate forms out there of the trap-jaw mechanism that people just hadn’t identified before, some which differ only slightly from the ancestral form.”\nThe researchers collaborated with the lab of Andrew Suarez at the University of Illinois, who used high-speed videography to capture Strumigenys ant jaws in motion. They found that the trap-jaws have the fastest known acceleration of any animal body part that can return to its original position.\n“The trap-jaw mandible acceleration is a hundred thousand times greater than the standard mandibles,” said Professor Economo. “And they close thousands of times faster than a blink of a human eye.”\nStrumigenys ants have a need for speed, using their ultrafast jaws to thwart the spring-loaded escape mechanism of springtails, their most abundant prey.\nIt’s not yet known how all these different ant species hunt, but ants with shorter trap jaws are typically passive hunters, hiding in the leaf litter with their jaws waiting to snap shut on any unsuspecting prey that ventures too close. Meanwhile, the ants with longer trap jaws are active hunters, searching for prey to strike down.\nThe researchers believe that how the ants use their jaws to catch prey may help explain the surprising level of diversity in the shape of trap jaws. In every region of the world, both on a continental level and on the local community level, both long and short trap-jaws are found.\n“It was really striking how we saw the same variations evolve again and again on different continents. It illustrates how repeatable evolution can be, finding similar solutions to life’s challenges,” said Professor Economo.\nWhat’s less clear is whether the underlying genetic changes needed to build the trap-jaw are the same, or whether the ants achieved these similar outcomes in different ways.\nTo that end, the research team now plans to sequence the genomes of representative Strumigenys species across the world. “We want to bridge the gap between the changes we see on the genetic and molecular level, and what we see on a morphological level. That’s the next big project.”\nReference: 2 March 2021, PLOS Biology.\nFunding: Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University, Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, National Science Foundation, Tinker foundation at UIUC’s center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:a15c0c68-2140-48ac-875f-2d92507dde5b>","<urn:uuid:4f3857d7-00a8-4033-a5ec-65ece2c20c06>"],"error":null}
{"question":"As a mountain rescue expert, I'm interested in how extreme weather conditions affect both avalanches and wildfires. Based on recent incidents, what warning signs indicate an imminent avalanche, and how does climate change impact the occurrence of high-altitude fires?","answer":"For avalanches, key warning signs include dramatic weather changes like rapid shifts from cold to warm, visible signs of recent avalanche activity, and unstable snowpack conditions indicated by cracking, blocking, or whooping sounds. These sounds occur when weak layers collapse within the snowpack. As for high-altitude fires and climate's impact, the East Troublesome Fire demonstrated how climate change enables fires at higher elevations and later seasons. The fire burned above 9,000 feet even in late October, which was unusual. This reflects a broader climate shift where longer summers, extended droughts, and earlier snow melts are making bigger, later-season fires more likely at high altitudes. Before 2000, Colorado had no fires exceeding 100,000 acres, but since then there have been six such fires, with three occurring in 2020 alone.","context":["Survival Skills: What To Do in the Event of an Avalanche\nThere are many stories out there of people being buried in avalanches never to be seen or heard from again and there are just as many urban myths out there that tell you what you should, and shouldn’t do when caught in an avalanche. Which ones you believe can certainly cost you your life if you aren’t careful and sure of how to react should you get caught in a coming avalanche. Avalanches are dangerous, brutal, and life-threatening. Many people, even those who are in the snow on a regular basis, don’t realize that there are actually two types of avalanches out there and what to do if they should see an avalanche coming or heaven forbid, be caught by one and trapped.\nIt’s important to note at this point that avalanches kill more than 150 people worldwide on a yearly basis, those are high, high numbers folks. It is also estimated that about 90 percent of victims of avalanches can be saved if they are pulled from the snow within five minutes of being buried. That percentage drops to 20 to 30 percent after about 45 minutes and to pretty much zero after two hours. That is why it is so extremely important to know what you are doing when you get out there on the mountain, in the snow, from being prepared to knowing the signs and more.\nAvalanches happen all over the world, so anywhere there are snowy peaks, you are in danger of an avalanche happening, at any moment. With the growth of wintertime recreational activities over the years, the number of avalanche victims have begun to grow and has been on the uprise since the 1950s. Statistics show that there are over 150 lives claimed by avalanches worldwide each and every year. Some of this can be avoided by taking the mountains and the tons of snow seriously, being extremely careful and vigilant when you’re out there, and being prepared before you step a foot onto the snow.\nIn this blog, we will discuss what to do in the event of an avalanche, how to prepare before you head out onto the mountain, the myths associated with these deadly occurrences, and even some facts that you might not have known. I’m sure we will discuss even more along the way. So, grab your mug of hot cocoa and your warmest jacket, then follow us into our blog on what to do in the event of an avalanche, and more.\nThe Dangers of an Avalanche\nMany skiers, snowboarders, and climbers don’t realize the serious dangers of an avalanche until the ton of snow is barreling down on them and they have nowhere to go. An avalanche can get up to speeds as fast as 120 miles per hour, a force that no matter how hard you try if you’re in its path, you can’t outrun. The force of the snow can easily toss a human into the trees and rocks in the area, and just as easily sweep you off of a cliff, or tangle you up in your ski or snowboarding equipment. It is said that over one-third of avalanche-related deaths are due to trauma.\nWhile it is possible to survive the trauma of being swept away by 120 miles per hour of snow, you then have to deal with the block of concrete that snow has become. The snow may start as a powdery substance, but as it rushes down that mountain, it starts to refreeze, meaning that you will be encased in a block of ice before the danger is past. Once you are buried beneath the massive avalanche, you have maybe 30 minutes, for someone to find you and dig you out, because most humans can’t survive much longer than, under the snow. So, the dangers of an avalanche are very real and there are many. Your best bet of survival is to educate yourself on avalanches, starting with the fact that there is more than one kind.\nTypes of Avalanches\nThere are two types of avalanches that are a threat to not only those who are out on the snow but the houses and buildings that might be located under that mountain as well. We will go into the different kinds next.\nThese avalanches happen when there is very little cohesion to the snow itself. These usually start at a point near the surface of the mountain and can be caused by snow clumps that have fallen on the surface of the cliff, dislodging the loose snow. Loose snow avalanches can happen whether the snow is dry or wet and in the summer or the winter. The loose snow avalanches in the winter are often caused by snowstorms or even after a snowstorm has occurred. Summer loose snow avalanches usually are triggered by melted water or rain. Either type is extremely dangerous and needs to be avoided.\nSlab avalanches are just as dangerous, maybe more so, because it is a slab of snow that is plummeting down the mountain toward an unsuspecting group of people. These are slabs that break off from the other snow for various reasons and are often triggered by a skier or climber stepping on them. This is the type of avalanche that most backcountry travelers get caught in most often.\nNow, that we know a little bit about the types of avalanches out there, it’s time to move into the signs that an avalanche is possible so that you can get out of the way if possible.\nWarning Signs of an Avalanche\nWhether you’re out on a snowmobile racing with friends or just enjoying the day with a leisurely climb, mother nature gives us several warning signs that an avalanche is on the way. However, even the most experienced of climbers often fail to heed these signs, so read this section carefully before you head out on your own adventure.\nThere’s a Dramatic Change in the Weather\nIf there is a dramatic change in the weather, such as going from cold to warm or snowy and overcast to sunny in a short period of time, conditions are always favorable for an avalanche to occur.\nYou Spot Recent Avalanche Activity\nThis is the rule that is overlooked most often. If you spot signs of recent avalanche activity, don’t take that path or slope. A good rule of thumb to follow is if you see signs of avalanche activity, assume that the snowpack is unstable and head the other way, carefully\nA Snowpack is Cracking, Blocking, or Whooping\nCracking and blocking are sure signs that the snowpack is unstable. If you see cracks in the snowpack you’re on, then that snowpack could cause an avalanche if you aren’t careful. The whooping sound comes from a weak layer that is collapsing inside of the snowpack, and it can mean an avalanche is imminent. If you hear this sound, get as far away as you can, fast, but carefully.\nThese are a few of the signs that there could be possible avalanche activity in the area, now let’s delve into what you should do if one is coming your way\nTips for Surviving an Avalanche\nNo matter how well prepared you are to avoid an avalanche, it is always possible for one to catch you unaware. If one does, then you need to know how to possibly survive it. Read on below for a few tips.\nThe very center of the avalanche is the most dangerous, as it is the place where the snow is moving the fastest, so if you see an avalanche coming towards you, try to move off to the side to avoid as much of the center as possible. If the avalanche starts underneath your feet, try to jump upslope to avoid the center as much as you can.\nTry to Grab Onto Something Sturdy\nWhile grabbing onto a sturdy branch or boulder won’t help you much if it’s a major avalanche, it will if it’s the less powerful cascades instead. Either way, try to grab onto something sturdy that will help you stay rooted, instead of being swept along with the snow itself.\nIt’s important to try to stay on top of the current so that you aren’t buried underneath the avalanche. Try to swim with the current, by using all of your muscles. Thrash around as much as you can to stay on top of the current, instead of slipping underneath the mounds of snow.\nHold Up One Arm\nTry hard to hold at least one arm above the snow, so that if you are buried, rescue teams will have a better chance of finding you quickly.\nCreate Room to Breathe\nMost avalanche fatalities come from the skier suffocating, so it’s important to try to create room to breathe. You can do this by cupping your hands over your mouth to create an air pocket or trying to move the snow away from your face to create a space with air in it until the rescuers can get to you.\nTry to Stay as Calm as Possible\nWhile it’s hard to resist the urge to panic with tons of snow on top of you, panicking will only shorten your air and make it even harder to breathe. Try to stay as calm as possible, regulate your breathing, and wait for help to come.\nIt’s also important to bring an avalanche beacon with you so that you are easier to find should the worst happen. It’s also important to note where your partners are, if at all possible and never, ever go out there alone.\nMyths Concerning Avalanches Revealed\nThere are quite a few urban myths out there that have caused avalanches to happen and many people to be killed. Some of those are dispelled below.\nA Single Noise can Trigger an Avalanche\nHollywood movies give people a bigger voice than they truly have, and have avalanches started just by someone yelling across at his buddy on the mountain. This isn’t true, your voice isn’t powerful enough to start an avalanche, so yell and talk all you want to.\nAvalanches Strike with no Warning\nWhile in some cases, this can be true and has happened, in most cases avalanches are actually easier to predict than many other natural disasters are. Mother Nature gives us plenty of warning signs, you just have to vigilant and know what to look for.\nYou Can Outrun or Out Ski an Avalanche\nThis is one of the myths out there that gets people killed in avalanches the most often. You cannot outrun or out ski an avalanche. They can move down the mountain at speeds of 120 miles per hours, so you couldn’t even outrun them in a car if you had one on the mountain.\nStomping on the Snow can Tell You if the Snow is Stable\nNo, if it was actually that easy, then many more people would still be alive. You can’t stomp on the snow and be able to tell that it’s stable. It’s a foolhardy idea and could very well get you and your party killed. Instead, try taking an advanced class in how to spot the signs of an avalanche and to tell if the snow is stable. That will help you much more than stomping on the snow ever could.\nThis concludes our blog on what to do in the event of an avalanche and a few other things as well. Remember, if you’re prepared and know what to do, you have a much better chance of not being in an avalanche at all, or surviving one if the worst happens.

A week later, high winds whipped the fire into a 100,000-acre inferno racing northeast through Grand Lake and into Rocky Mountain National Park. By the time snows and colder temperatures halted the fire in late October, it had killed two people, destroyed more than 400 houses and other structures, and burned 193,812 acres, making it the second-largest fire in state history.\nThe fire is believed to be human-caused but remains under investigation. Parts of Rocky Mountain National Park remained closed through the week of Thanksgiving. The East Troublesome Fire was the third record-breaking fire of 2020, with all three blazes surpassing 130,000 acres.\nColorado’s 2020 fire season got off to a late start, but fires worsened as a hot, dry summer turned to a dry, warm fall with frequent Red Flag warnings. The Pine Gulch Fire began on July 31 north of Grand Junction and grew to 139,000 acres, while the smaller Grizzly Creek blaze near Glenwood Springs shut down Interstate 70 for weeks. Those fires were fully contained by September. In October the Cameron Peak Fire west of Fort Collins became the largest blaze in state history and Colorado’s first wildfire to surpass 200,000 acres.\nAs the aspen trees turned in Grand County that fall, the entire state was still in a moderate drought, and the drought in the central Rockies became extreme. The Williams Fork Fire still burned on some 12,000 acres in southern Grand County, its smoke plume visible from I-70. Even as night temperatures reached below freezing, higher daytime temperatures, strong winds, and low humidity meant that the threat of additional fires remained high.\nA Troublesome Fire\nIt is not yet known what started the fire east of Troublesome Creek on October 14, but one week later it went on one of the most extraordinary runs in Colorado fire history. The evening of October 21 brought high winds that sent the 25,000-acre fire racing northeast at a rate of 6,000 acres per hour. By the time dawn broke on October 22, it had grown to 125,000 acres, burning through the town of Grand Lake, into Rocky Mountain National Park, and leaving dozens of charred houses and other buildings in its wake. The entire communities of Grand Lake and Granby were evacuated, along with hundreds of other residents from the surrounding area.\nSome 300 firefighting personnel were battling the blaze, but they had managed only 5 percent containment. Crew leaders reported that “weather, terrain, and beetle-killed lodgepole pine contributed” to the East Troublesome Fire’s terrifying run on October 21–22. Even under those conditions, however, officials noted that they never expected runs of 6,000 acres per hour, which amounted to the biggest blowup recorded in the modern fire history of Colorado. It was late in the season and the fire in many places was above 9,000 feet in elevation, burning in areas that would typically have colder daytime temperatures and snow. On the afternoon of October 22, the fire crossed the Continental Divide in Rocky Mountain National Park and added another 50,000 acres, becoming the second-largest fire in state history. The fire's scaling of the Great Divide prompted mandatory evacuation orders for the entire town of Estes Park, displacing some 6,500 people.\nOn October 24, authorities found out that not everyone had evacuated the fire area when they recovered the bodies of Lyle and Marilyn Hileman, a couple in their eighties who had stayed in their home near Grand Lake. Meanwhile, near the popular Bear Lake Road in Rocky Mountain National Park, anxious firefighters fought the East Troublesome Fire under a Red Flag warning all day. Their main objective was to defend Estes Park from the fire, which was being pushed eastward by a cold front blowing in with gusts up to sixty miles per hour. Finally, the front brought snow in the evening, halting the fire's advance toward the city.\nContainment slowly progressed as snow continued to hit the burned area in November. By November 19, the East Troublesome Fire was 72 percent contained. Although it was still not extinguished by Thanksgiving, the fire no longer threatened communities.\nRole of Climate Change\nBefore the twenty-first century, Colorado had not seen a fire grow beyond 100,000 acres. Since 2000, however, there have been six, and three of them occurred in 2020. The accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere from human fossil fuel consumption over the last two centuries has resulted in higher average temperatures that are accelerating a range of natural cycles. Fires like the East Troublesome are products of this climate shift and reflect a new era of fire danger in Colorado. As summers and droughts last longer and winter snow melts off earlier, bigger, later fires at higher altitudes are more likely to occur."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"language-ambiguous"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:228e2c75-08c1-45a0-90fa-c0178216e472>","<urn:uuid:eb32e3e7-e542-4dcf-860d-d18505c7263f>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What is the role of supervision in developing resilience for social workers, and what are the warning signs that indicate insufficient support is leading to burnout?","answer":"Supervision plays a key role in developing resilience by offering space for dialogue and critical reflection, particularly when social workers deal with difficult and distressing situations. Effective supervision helps foster resilience and reduces burnout risk by ensuring risks are carefully considered and best possible decisions are reached. When workers experience strong emotions from practice, supervision helps maintain balanced perspective and sound judgment. As for warning signs of insufficient support leading to burnout, these include lack of enthusiasm about work, reduced compassion for clients, quick-temperedness with colleagues, depression symptoms, job cynicism, and role ambiguity. Additionally, when there is poor supervision or lack of organizational support, social workers may experience a mismatch between job rewards and performance, lack of job control, and difficulty concentrating.","context":["Social Work Scotland, Iriss and the Scottish Social Services Council (SSSC) have worked in partnership to draw together helpful resources for social service practitioners and their organisations to support them to think about and promote wellbeing and resilience.\nWhy is resilience important?\nWorking in social services is highly rewarding but can, at times, be stressful. So it's important that workers and their employers reflect on what promotes resilience and helps people to thrive. Put simply, resilience relates to an individual's capacity to manage and come back from demanding and high pressure situations.\nThe good news is there is a growing body of evidence and research that shows there are steps individuals, and the organisations where they work, can take to develop resilience. Resilience is not a trait that people either have or don't have. It involves behaviours, thoughts and actions anyone can learn and develop (Fox, et al, 2014). Workers and organisations can take positive steps to develop resilience and this resource signposts them to information and tools that help the process of developing resilience.\nBeddoe et al. (2013, p. 102), indicate that resilience is supported by:\n- factors that reside within individuals\n- factors that reside in the organisational context\n- factors linked with the educational preparation of practitioners\nLuthar (2006) states that while many individual and organisational factors contribute to resilience; the single most important factor is quality of relationships. To develop resilience, therefore, workers need organisations that support the quality of relationships through supervision and other processes. We have selected resources we think will help with this.\nThe leadership capability of both managers and workers will also contribute to the development of resilience at a personal and organisational level. The Enabling Leadership research (SSSC, 2016) highlights a leadership logic model which illustrates what good leadership in Scotland's social services looks like and what contributes to this. It identifies resilience as a trait of good leaders.\nIn the Continuous Learning Framework for social service workers (SSSC and Iriss, 2008) there is a specific focus on the development of resilience in the personal capabilities. The framework defines resilience as 'persisting in pursuing goals despite obstacles and setbacks'. You may want to reflect on this personal capability when thinking about your resilience and aspects you need to develop further.\nWho is this resource for?\nThis resource brings together a number of articles, pieces of practice wisdom, guidance, tools and case examples resources we think workers will find helpful when thinking about how they develop resilience. It is not a tool or framework but freely available information for workers and organisations. We have grouped resources under themes with a short introduction outlining why they are important for resilience.\nIndividuals or teams can use this resource to promote a better understanding of how to develop resilience. You don't have to use it in any particular order or way; choose resources that best suit your personal or organisational need.\nIf you want a more structured introduction to developing resilience, the Open University has produced a free online course. It supports the development of resilience in social work but is useful for workers across social services. It guides workers through concepts such as emotional resilience and steps to taking a positive approach to practice problems.\nSupervision, support, coaching and mentoring\nSupervision, and the relationship between a worker and supervisor, play a key role in the development of resilience. Other ways of supporting personal and professional development such as coaching and mentoring also help. In using these methods of development, it is important to consider how a person's attitude or mindset contributes to their personal resilience.\nThe SSSC's Supervision Learning Resource (2017) draws on Adamson et al (2014) who argue that:\neffective supervision helps foster resilience and reduces the risk of burn out. It offers a space for dialogue and critical reflection, recognising social service staff are sometimes involved in situations which can be difficult and distressing. When strong emotions are raised in the worker as a result of practice it can be hard to keep a balanced perspective and exercise sound judgement.

In doing so, it will provide social workers with the tools and information needed to carry out their invaluable work.\nBefore you start reading, we thought you might like to download our three Stress & Burnout Prevention Exercises (PDF) for free. These science-based exercises will equip you and those you work with, with tools to manage stress better and find a healthier balance in your life.\nThis Article Contains:\nBurnout in Social Work Explained\nSocial work is a noble profession. It is often entered into by those who wish to help vulnerable populations to achieve justice and receive vital support and services.\nGiven the nature of the job, social workers are often exposed to various aspects of human cruelty (e.g., abused or neglected children, domestic violence, etc.). As such, social work requires a high level of empathy and compassion.\nAdditionally, a career in social work is generally highly demanding, with large caseloads and minimal compensation. Imagine, for example, performing a job in which your caseload outweighs your time, your clients are victims of chronic abuse, and you barely earn enough money to pay your mortgage.\nYou may also have a supervisor who is overworked and cannot recognize your accomplishments or needs. This situation may cause compassion fatigue, which involves stress and emotional fatigue that results from the chronic use of empathy to help those suffering from trauma (Figley, 1995).\nThe concept of social work burnout is well exemplified in an article by Smullens (2012, p. 1), who noted how her social work supervisor often came home from work exhausted, telling his wife “They [his clients] feel better, but I surely do not.” This experience has also been referred to as ‘secondary or vicarious trauma,’ which occurs when social workers take on their clients’ stress and vulnerabilities (Wilson, 2016).\nOf course, those who enter helping professions are often highly empathetic, caring individuals. As such, being exposed to their clients’ chronic challenges and health disparities becomes emotionally and physically taxing. This is especially likely when workloads and resources are mismatched to the degree that making a meaningful change is unlikely.\nWhen this happens, social workers are at a heightened risk for feeling frustrated, depleted, and, ultimately, burned out. Indeed, the research literature supports a connection between high levels of burnout and stress among social workers relative to other occupations (Lloyd, King, & Chenoweth, 2002).\nIndeed, in a study including 751 social workers, three-quarters of participants experienced burnout during their careers (Siebert, 2005). Considering these correlations, it is essential that social workers know the warning signs of burnout and take necessary steps toward preventing it.\n16 Warning Signs of Burnout in Social Workers\nIf you’re a social worker who is concerned about potential burnout, here are several research studies that have identified warning signs to keep in mind:\n- Lack of enthusiasm about work\n- Reduced compassion or empathy for clients\n- Mismatch between job rewards (e.g., compensation and recognition) and performance\n- A non-collaborative workplace\n- Feeling a lack of job control, which minimizes autonomy\n- Depression symptoms\n- Job cynicism\n- Sense of resignation about work\n- Quick-temperedness with colleagues or family\n- Self-medicating behavior\nKim, Ji, and Kao (2011)\n- Role ambiguity\n- High work challenges\n- Lack of autonomy\n- High role conflict\nSchaufeli, Leiter, and Maslach (2009)\n- Poor fit between values of the social worker and those of the organization\n- Workload responsibilities out of balance with the social worker’s needs and priorities\nOverall, if you find you dread going to work each day and are exhausted when you return home, you may be suffering from burnout. If this is a concern, it may be helpful to ask yourself the following questions as outlined by the Mayo Clinic (2021):\n- Are you feeling disillusioned about your career?\n- Are you having difficulty concentrating?\n- Do you no longer find satisfaction in your achievements?\n- Are you having trouble sleeping?\n- Are you trying to numb or distract yourself from your feelings?\n- Are you irritable with clients or coworkers?\n- Are you experiencing physical symptoms such as headaches or digestive problems?\nAlong with recognizing the red flags above, it also is important to remember that increased burnout is associated with fewer years of social work practice (Weekes, 2011).\nTherefore, if you are dedicated to social work, but new to the job, hang in there. As long as you know the warning signs and practice plenty of self-care, you will probably feel better as you accumulate experience and confidence in your role.\nPreventing Burnout: The Importance of Self-Care\nHave patience with all things. But, first of all, with yourself.\nFrancis de Sales\nEngaging in adequate self-care is essential among social workers, as it helps to protect against the stress that accompanies repeated exposure to traumatized populations.\nAccording to Salloum, Kondrat, Johnco, and Olson (2015, p. 54), trauma-informed self-care (TISC) involves “being aware of one’s own emotional experience in response to exposure to traumatized clients and planning/engaging in positive coping strategies.”\nBy engaging in TISC, social workers benefit from coping strategies that help to moderate the negative impact of working with highly vulnerable clients (Salloum et al., 2015). Research has indicated that TISC is related to higher levels of compassion satisfaction and reduced burnout among child welfare case managers (Salloum et al., 2015).\nSimilarly, Weekes (2011) assessed 185 members of the National Association of Social Workers for both burnout and self-care. The results showed that depersonalization and emotional exhaustion were significantly lower among those who engaged in higher levels of self-care.\nEngaging in self-care represents an important way for social service workers to experience greater job satisfaction with a diminished likelihood of burnout.\n30 Self-Care Activities for Social Workers\nAs important as it is to have a plan for doing work, it is perhaps more important to have a plan for rest, relaxation, self-care, and sleep.\nResearchers investigating the role of self-care in preventing the likelihood of burnout among social workers have reported many effective self-care approaches, with over 30 presented below.\n- Engage in physical or behavioral strategies (e.g., dancing, hiking, sports, deep breathing, etc.)\n- Engage in relational strategies (e.g., spend time with pets; talk about feelings with colleagues, significant others, supervisors, etc.)\n- Engage in cognitive strategies (e.g., distract yourself with music, movies, etc.; avoid exposing yourself to stress or trauma when outside of work, etc.)\nSalloum et al. (2015)\n- Seek supervision\n- Attend trainings on secondary trauma\n- Balance your caseloads\n- Ensure work–life balance\n- Seek continuing education on the effects of trauma\n- Take advantage of agency resources\n- Set realistic goals\n- Attend therapy as needed\n- Engage in stress management activities, such as meditation\n- Be cognizant of your emotional response to traumatized clients\nHere are 17 more self-care suggestions:\n- Don’t bring work home. Home should be your respite from the day’s stress. Keep it that way by avoiding discussions or reminders of work once your shift is over.\n- Take advantage of vacation days. Always, always use your vacation days. It is a wonderful way to restore your emotional wellbeing, along with your connection with significant others. Besides, you earned that time off.\n- Talk to friends and family. Sharing with others is a great way to get a reality check, as well as to generate ideas about how to avoid burnout.\n- Find an artistic release. Whether it’s music, drawing, working with clay, or any other artistic endeavor, engaging in art enhances a sense of flow and happiness.\n- Get plenty of sleep. Adequate sleep is essential to emotional and physical health. Do not skimp on it.\n- Reward yourself. Whether it’s a vacation or simply a cup of tea, take the time to reward yourself for your hard work.\n- Read a good book. Reading is a healthy way to escape from a stressful day. By taking the time to read, you will feel more relaxed and might even sleep better.\n- Avoid self-medicating. If you find yourself craving a drink or some other drug at the end of the workday, this could escalate into a problem. Try to find healthier coping mechanisms, such as exercise or talking to a friend.\n- Get a massage. If you enjoy massages and they are feasible, then go for it. Massage helps with both physical and emotional tension, and it is also a great way to reward yourself.\n- Go on outings. Simply getting away for the day or the weekend is often highly restorative.\n- Make your health a priority. If you are putting your health last, both your work and your health will deteriorate. Always make time for sleep, exercise, doctor visits, and healthy meals.\n- Don’t be too hard on yourself. Social workers deal with terrible trauma. And while they make a huge impact, they can’t save everyone. Know that you aren’t a miracle worker, but are doing the best you can.\n- Spend time in nature. Many people feel invigorated by a hike in the woods, canoeing, bird watching, going to the beach, or being around animals. If you enjoy nature, get outside and reap the rewards.\n- Pamper yourself. Remember: You are performing a highly demanding job that takes a lot out of you. Be kind to yourself.\n- Go for walks. Along with the benefits of exercise, walking may take your mind off of your workday while providing fresh air.\n- Take on a new hobby. Regardless of your skill level or interests, doing something hands-on (e.g., woodworking, knitting, gardening, etc.) is always good for the soul.\n- Ensure that the job is the best fit for you. If you are feeling burned out despite experiencing an adequate work–life balance and engaging in plenty of self-care, it may be time to examine whether you are in the right field. Your job should be rewarding and not leave you emotionally depleted. Remember, there is no shame in exploring other opportunities if you are consistently stressed and dissatisfied.\n15 Minutes a day to prevent burnout – Paul Koeck\nPositivePsychology.com’s Helpful Resources\nWe have many terrific resources here at PositivePsychology.com that help to identify, prevent, and cope with burnout among social workers.\nTo get you started, here are three useful articles from our blog:\n- Warning Signs of Burnout: 13 Reliable Tests & Questionnaires\nIf you are worried that you might be experiencing burnout, this article will help you identify key warning signs.

{"question":"Could you explain the significance of the mbira instrument in Zimbabwean culture?","answer":"The mbira, or thumb piano, is an ancient and sacred wooden box with metal springs that holds deep cultural significance in Zimbabwe. It was traditionally used by tribesmen to summon the spirits of ancestors and guardians. According to guitarist Gilbert Zvamaida, the mbira's importance to Zimbabwean people is comparable to the bagpipes for Scottish people, though he suggests the relationship might be even deeper than that. The instrument's distinctive sound, characterized by plinky metal springs, became a crucial element in the development of modern Zimbabwean music, particularly in the creation of chimurenga music.","context":["AFTER A LONG DAY AT THE RECORDING STUDIO, Afropop superstar Thomas Mapfumo sometimes likes to swing in to an unremarkable teriyaki joint in a strip mall on the southeast edge of Eugene, his home in exile for the last decade or so. Ron’s Island Grill is all but empty when the 66-year-old Zimbabwean singer makes his way toward the brightly lit counter one winter night. He wears big sunglasses, a natty topcoat, and faux-alligator-skin shoes.\nJust weeks earlier, Mapfumo and his band, the Blacks Unlimited, had played a much-anticipated concert in Bloemfontein, South Africa. Thousands of fans came from all over Africa for the rare chance to hear the “Lion of Zimbabwe” perform on his home continent. The chimurenga music—which translates roughly to “the music of struggle” and which Mapfumo essentially invented 40 years ago—is deeply connected to the decades of upheavals in Africa, especially those in his native Zimbabwe. But it’s hardly depressing. Mapfumo’s arrangements generally pair the syncopated rhythms of one or more thumb pianos, a high-spirited traditional Zimbabwean instrument, with keyboards, drums, congas, guitar, and lyrics anchored in the vernacular of freedom fighters. Sung largely in his native Shona language, Mapfumo’s songs are political but ambiguous, decrying corruption or praising justice generally without naming names.\n“He has been the most popular and significant singer in Zimbabwe, with one sensation after another, from 1975 to pretty much now,” says Banning Eyre, senior editor at the National Public Radio program Afropop Worldwide. “He’s one of the greatest, most iconic musicians living in America.”\nYet every day he passes living outside Zimbabwe, Mapfumo becomes less and less relevant to his fans back home. And here in the US, he risks retiring straight into the pages of world-music textbooks. Mapfumo hopes to change that. From his perch among the firs and fog of Eugene, he’s aiming to build momentum with his new album, World on Fire. Set for release this spring, it is an ambitious attempt to attract more fans. Most significant, in a departure from previous albums, this one will be sung predominantly in English, providing an opportunity for Americans to hear, in real time, what this beloved rebel has to say about the world today.\nTonight, though, at Ron’s Island Grill, he’s not exactly feeling the love.\n“Can I help you?” the counter girl asks, more focused on the dozens of thimble-size plastic cups she must squirt full of teriyaki sauce before shift’s end.\n“Yes,” says Mapfumo. “I would like Ron’s Sweet Curry.”\n“I can’t hear you,” she says.\n“I would like the number 11, please.”\nA friend of Mapfumo’s politely asks the girl if she knows that this man ordering the number 11 is a legend.\nShe sets down her squirt bottle, looks at the vast spread of tiny cups, and raises her tired eyes to him.\n“Do you feel famous?” she asks.\nIT’S A FAIR QUESTION. Although Afropop has been rising in popularity since the ’90s (witness the recent Broadway hit Fela!), Mapfumo remains little more than a cult hero and world-music staple in his adopted home country. Over a 40-year career, Mapfumo has released more than 40 albums (even he has lost count). He’s shared a stage with everyone from Bob Marley to the Kronos Quartet. Today, Afropop-influenced indie bands like Franz Ferdinand, Tune-Yards, and Vampire Weekend admire Mapfumo’s sophisticated arrangements. (Merrill Garbus of Tune-Yards used to include his music in radio DJ sets.) And equally hip record labels, such as Analog Africa, expend great effort to unearth early “forgotten” recordings connected to him.\nBut unlike Marley or Benin’s Grammy-winning Angélique Kidjo, Mapfumo has not crossed over and become anything like a mainstream hit maker. Since leaving Zimbabwe for good eight years ago, he has released two albums in the US, both of which met with minimal commercial success, and the man who once played for 100,000 people now might draw US crowds of 1,000. He does not, as he told Ron’s counter girl, feel famous.\nThis is a new position for him.\nRaised on a rural farm in the British colony of Rhodesia, Mapfumo was 20 years old in 1965 when a white man named Ian Smith seized control of the colony and declared it an independent nation—made up of mostly blacks but run by and for whites. Mapfumo’s fellow natives and Shona tribesmen responded by taking up arms against the illegitimate racist prime minister; Mapfumo grabbed the mic.\nLike virtually every semiprofessional bandleader in Africa at that time, he relied heavily on popular “copyright” songs—hits by Otis Redding, Sam Cooke, the Rolling Stones. But in 1969, the supervisor of a remote copper mine hired Mapfumo and a handful of other ragtag musicians to play for employees in the canteen on weekends. The Hallelujah Chicken Run Band, as it was called, quickly exhausted its set list and began to search for its own musical identity. They found it, during the heady days of the early liberation struggle, in the thumb piano, or mbira, an ancient and sacred wooden box with plinky metal springs that tribesmen used to summon the spirits of ancestors and guardians.\n“The mbira is like the bagpipe to the Scottish people,” says Gilbert Zvamaida, Mapfumo’s electric guitarist, “or maybe the relationship is even deeper than that.”\nThe band first used an electric guitar to play a traditional mbira song, a farmer’s melody called “Ngoma Yarira.” Listeners were delighted, at least partly because the 12/8 guitar rhythms were, in the words of one critic, “so precise and intricate that listening to it is like watching someone knit lace.” “Ngoma Yarira” became the A-side track of Mapfumo’s first single.\nThe B-side track on that single proved equally central to his new identity. On “Murembo,” or “Elephant’s Tusk,” Mapfumo took a traditional melody, shuffled the music a bit, and added a few of his own words. “All the children have perished / The war has come,” went one of the phrases. Released on Teal Records in 1974, the record became a hit—and the combination of political lyrics with tradition-tweaking music became Mapfumo’s signature chimurenga style.\n“That is where it really started,” says Mapfumo. “What gave the music a lot of support was the struggle itself.”\nHere in the States, though, there is no such comparable “struggle” from which to draw support, making the odds that Mapfumo crosses over from a world-music standard to a big-time hit maker rather long. Few African musicians make the westward crossing. Never mind the struggles of the music business in general: fans of so-called world music tend to embrace exotic rhythms and instruments, and the escapism provided by not understanding the lyrics. Fans of commercially popular music expect a band to mirror their very American feelings and thoughts, without any weird accents. Between those two lie smaller fan bases, and a deep, dark void that can swallow a career whole.\nMAPFUMO HAS CERTAINLY FACED TOUGHER STRUGGLES. By the mid-’70s, his celebration of the ever-bolder freedom fighters had become wildly popular with the people of Zimbabwe. But the Rhodesian government despised anthems like “Mothers, Send Your Children to War,” a call for new recruits to the revolution.\nFirst, the Ministry of Information outlawed his music on national radio. When that didn’t quiet him, officials jailed Mapfumo for three months. Lastly, in a desperate attempt to co-opt his message, they blared his songs from the loudspeakers of helicopters that bombed rebel camps.\nIt didn’t work. In April 1980, Mapfumo and Bob Marley shared a stage in capital city Harare’s Rufaro Stadium, playing to a crowd of 100,000 in celebration of the new democratic Republic of Zimbabwe. “Thomas Mapfumo embodied the seven years of struggle,” writes Frank Tenaille in Music Is the Weapon of the Future: 50 Years of African Popular Music.\nIndependence, though, proved a false summit. By the late ’80s, the cycle rebooted. The bespectacled “president” Robert Mugabe was already on the road to perpetrating the flagrant injustices that would spur Parade magazine to rank him as the world’s worst dictator in 2009: rigging elections, jailing homosexuals, allowing unemployment to peg 85 percent while plumping his coffers with profits from steel exports.\nMapfumo spelled out his growing disillusionment in no uncertain terms. “People, there is corruption” he sang in the 2000 hit “Disaster.” “People, there is corruption here.” Unsurprisingly, police raided kiosks in the markets of Harare and destroyed Mapfumo’s albums, and Central Intelligence Organization agents threatened to beat Mapfumo if he played protest songs in concert. His family—Thomas and his wife, Verna, son and daughter Tai and Chiedza (then teenagers), and daughter Mati (then a toddler)—no longer felt safe.\nIn 2000, the family boarded a plane out of Zimbabwe.\nAt the encouragement of a friend in Eugene, the Mapfumos relocated to the home of the fighting Ducks.\n“We did not need to see more tall buildings,” Mapfumo says. “We needed a quiet place where the kids could go to school.”\nMoving didn’t end the harassment, though. In 2001, the administration accused Mapfumo and Verna of involvement in the alleged theft of several BMWs; conviction of a similar crime had earned fellow Zimbabwean musician Simon Dendera four years behind bars. Still Mapfumo continued to visit Zimbabwe.\nBut in 2003, the government stepped up its arrests of real and supposed dissidents, including five Lutheran aid workers: two Germans, a Finn, an American, and a Kenyan. Mapfumo became uneasy about his visits. “You don’t know who’s gonna do something bad to you because there’s no rule of law in Zimbabwe,” Mapfumo reflects. He made a final trip to Zimbabwe in the spring of 2004 and hasn’t been back since.\nWITH MOST OF THE FAMILY AWAY ON vacation in California, Mapfumo has their rental house in Eugene to himself.\nHe and his 59-year-old brother, Lancelot, who plays keyboards and congas, watch a European soccer game in the living room of the four-bedroom split-level home perched high above town. Guitarist Zvamaida cooks, as always. An ashtray sits on the coffee table; a pool table dominates a nearby room. Three aging rad-mobiles—a dual-cab Ford F150, a British racing-green Jaguar sedan, and a teal Mercedes SL500 AMG coupe—jam the driveway.\n“This is a place where you can do whatever you want, so long as you’re not hurting someone,” Mapfumo says.\nThe transition to life in Eugene wasn’t easy. A late-night stranger wandered into their first home. Feeling unsafe, they moved into another house, where mold left their drummer laid up sick for months. Mapfumo’s wife traded her lucrative old job as a real estate agent in Harare for caregiver in a retirement home. And Mapfumo’s musical output slowed from roughly one new album release per year to just two in six years, the result of contract problems, lengthy recording sessions brought on by his own perfectionist streak, and difficulty finding and keeping savvy handlers. The first song on his last album, Exile, sung mostly in Shona, reflects on this time. “I’m always thinking about Zimbabwe, since I’m so very far from my friends and relatives,” go the lyrics to “Ndangariro,” or “Memories.”\n“He’s part of a very threatened fringe of an already traumatized music industry,” says Eyre. “I think he needs more help; he needs a really good manager.”\nIndeed, Bob Marley broke into the American charts, for example, only after years of publicity and generous financial support, including the gift of a home in Jamaica, from the founder of cash-flush international label Island Records. While those days of long-term faith and fat contracts are gone forever, Mapfumo, allegedly a sometimes challenging business partner, hasn’t been able to hold on to even small-time managers and agents, or woo a large record label that he trusts. The new album will be released on his own, Chimurenga Music.\nBut still, he says, the decision to go into exile was a good one, and Eyre agrees, with a caveat. “I think that as a person, he did a very honorable thing—he put his family first—and he has nothing left to prove as a musician,” he says. “But he’s been away long enough now that the culture back home is starting to move on.”\nWith much of Mapfumo’s music still outlawed on national radio and his CDs difficult to find, few fans in Zimbabwe’s cities hear his recent work, and even fewer do in the countryside. Instead, older crowds embrace the latest nonpolitical pop music from Mapfumo’s former touring partner Oliver Mtukudzi, whom UNICEF recently named a Goodwill Ambassador. And the younger generation listens to “urban grooves,” a homegrown version of rap and hip-hop. Artistically, Mapfumo is at risk of becoming a man without a country.\nAnd there in his living room, as his baritone refrain emanates from a dusty old sound system, it becomes clear that his lyrics—from the new album’s fourth track—don’t sound specifically Zimbabwean. In fact they don’t sound so different from the slogans of Eugene’s celebrity tree sitters or the chants of its Occupiers in the city below.\nAT THE CRACK OF NOON, MAPFUMO stuffs a sandwich in his mouth, smokes a joint, climbs in his Ford pickup with Zvamaida and his brother, and races toward the recording studio. They’re late for their session to put the final touches on World on Fire at Studio bCd.\nAbbey Road it ain’t. Electrical cords and instruments and flocks of microphone stands clutter the studio, a chilly 25-foot-by-25-foot garage in a humble country home. Mapfumo spritzes his mouth with an herbal vaporizer called Singer’s Secret, sits on a couch at the back with his brother, and promptly falls asleep.\nTwo hours later, after Zvamaida has virtuosically reworked two of his solos, it’s Mapfumo’s turn. He stands at the mic, swaying unsteadily with sleep and weed, headphones over his wool hat, hands clasped in front of him. He yawns. Sniffles. When the engineer is ready to record, Zvamaida signals and Mapfumo sings.\nHe chokes on the second syllable.\nHe tries again and doesn’t reach even the fourth syllable before his voice breaks. He clenches his fists, genuinely frustrated that his cold, smoked-out, 66-year-old vocal cords can’t hit the high notes that wiser musicians might avoid. “Can I please do that again?” he asks.\n“I’m sorry, again.”\nAnd so it continues.\nA quick listen of the rough album, though, reveals that however long it may take to record the songs, many of them are good. Great, actually. While mbira-inspired guitar-work is largely gone, Mapfumo and the band have sketched out tunes that nonetheless seem to pull the best from his past and combine it with adventurous new ideas. World on Fire will feature some political tracks and some cuts that are just fun, all of them embracing far-ranging themes and styles, from chimurenga to rock.\nThe first song, “Are You Ready,” is happy, slow pop about jamming till the wee hours, with Zvamaida’s clean, almost-effect-free guitar sounding like Dire Straits. The second song, “Celebration,” has another easygoing riff, almost reggaeish even though the chord progression is typical of a traditional Shona song. The third song signals a return to Mapfumo’s quintessential themes of equality and revolution, its earnest lyrics paired with a simple, powerful, solo guitar. The song’s central question of “What’s going on?” could be about life in Oregon, the US, Zimbabwe, or anywhere.\nAn hour after his first failed notes, Mapfumo finally finds his voice, and he looks back at his brother, who grins. He continues repeating verse after verse on another track, singing, “God bless Africa / god bless the continent / god bless the world.” And he still warbles. And there’s no telling if the vibrato is intentional or a sign of age.\nBut it doesn’t really matter. As Mapfumo stands there—bouncing now, hands swaying like a sea chanty singer, paying a heartfelt tribute to Africa from a cold garage in Eugene—he’s belting it out, and the slight breaking of his voice sounds … real. As if the striving in his singing is actually what’s important, a testament to hard years and the fact that this simple “god bless” sentiment is well-earned.

{"question":"How do the military strategies of Helmuth von Moltke and Antoine Jomini differ in their approach to warfare?","answer":"Moltke and Jomini had contrasting approaches to military strategy. Moltke developed a meticulous planning style that transformed the Prussian army into a formidable machine, as demonstrated in the 1866 campaign where he prepared plans in the minutest detail and successfully led a smaller Prussian army against numerically superior forces. In contrast, Jomini advocated for a more rigid, systematic approach based on strict rules and geometric formations, emphasizing that armies should mass their forces to strike enemy weak points for quick victory. While Moltke's strategy proved highly adaptable and effective in making Prussia the strongest military power in Europe, Jomini's concepts were later criticized for being too inflexible, particularly as they did not account for technological advances like long-range, accurate, rapid-fire rifles.","context":["By Quintin Barry\nPrior to the battle of 1866 the identify of Helmuth von Moltke used to be scarcely identified outdoors the Prussian military. His appointment as leader of the overall employees used to be in lots of methods stunning, and he definitely didn't himself count on it. He was once hence placed on the head of an army establishment that used to be already to a point more desirable to its opposite numbers somewhere else; he was once to show it right into a ambitious computing device that turned, in his arms, just about invincible. This used to be as a result of variety of elements which coincided along with his appointment. between those have been the numerous advances in army know-how and logistics at the one hand, and at the different the emergence of Otto Von Bismarck as Minister-President of Prussia, with whom Moltke had a vital, if sometimes uneasy, courting.\nThis ebook follows Moltke's half during the crusade on the finish of which his identify had develop into a loved ones observe. It strains his upward thrust to the location of leader of the final employees, opposed to the history of the political state of affairs of Prussia in the course of the nineteenth Century, and how within which he built the capabilities of the overall employees. Moltke's contribution to the allied crusade of Prussia and Austria opposed to Denmark in 1864 used to be an incredible a part of his personal improvement, earlier than the inevitable battle among the winning allies in 1866.\nAs the booklet indicates, for that struggle Moltke ready his plans within the minutest element. The victorious good fortune of his method in Bohemia used to be supplemented through the arrogance of his crusade in western Germany, within which a small Prussian military overcame a big numerical drawback. by way of the top of the Seven Weeks' warfare Moltke had made Prussia the most powerful army energy in Europe. The crusade of 1866 in Bohemia is roofed in nice aspect, together with the main wide insurance of the conflict of Königgrätz but released in English.\nThe writer has made complete use of an in depth variety of German language resources.

This publication explains why such strength shifts bring about struggle breaking out from time to time, yet now not in others.\nIn distinction to latest methods, this e-book argues that the army technique of declining states is the most important determinant of no matter if energy shifts lead to warfare or move peacefully. extra particularly, Dong sunlight Lee argues that the chance of conflict is essentially a functionality of whether a declining kingdom possesses a ‘manoeuvre technique’ or an ‘attrition strategy’. The argument is built during the research of fourteen energy shifts between nice powers over the last centuries.\nShifts within the stability of strength and the attendant dangers of battle stay a permanent function of foreign politics. This ebook argues that policymakers have to comprehend the standards influencing the chance of struggle due to those alterations, specifically the modern shifts in energy as a result of the increase of China and from the expansion of nuclear proliferation.\nThe writer cuts throughout the myriad interpretations surrounding the idea that and will get again to the unique proposal as conceived by way of its writer, the Prussian army theorist, Carl von Clausewitz. In going again to the unique idea, Lieutenant Colonel Echevarria unearths that Clausewitz meant the heart of gravity to operate a lot as its counterpart within the mechanical sciences does, that's, as a focus. He hence argues, really persuasively, that the Clausewitzian middle of gravity isn't a energy, nor a weak point, nor even a resource of energy. a middle of gravity is the single aspect inside a combatant's complete constitution or method that has the required centripetal strength to carry that constitution jointly. it is because Clausewitz wrote blow directed opposed to a middle of gravity can have the best impression. the writer concludes with ideas for revising Joint and repair doctrine in order that they will mirror a extra exact and coherent definition of a middle of gravity.

Jomini’s writings reduced the conduct of war to a few guiding principles, foremost of which was that armies should strike enemy weak points in mass to quickly achieve victory. Generals on both sides of the American Civil War and European leaders in the various conflicts of the mid-nineteenth century carried Jomini’s Summary of the Art of Warfare as their primary guide to conducting large-scale operadons.\nJomini began his life as the son of the mayor of Payerne, Switzerland, on March 6, 1779. After briefly clerking in a bank, Jo¬mini joined the French-sponsored Swiss army at age nineteen and earned the command of a brigade two years later. Jomini proved to be a great student of the military and almost immediately began publishing thick volumes of his thoughts and discoveries. His First four books, published in 1804-1805, so impressed French marshal Michel Ney that he asked the young author to join his staff as an aide-de-camp during the Austerlitz campaign in late 1805.\nNapoleon I, also impressed with his writings, promoted him to colonel in 1805, after which Jomini joined the emperor’s general staff during the war against Prussia in 1806 and served in the Batdes of Jena and at Eyulaus, earning the Legion of Honor.\nJomini joined the Spanish campaign of 1808-1809, where, despite a personality conflict with Ney, he became the marshal’s Chief of Staff. Jomini and Ney’s relationship ranged from mutual admiration to open hostility, peaking with Jomini’s threatening to resign and join the Russian army. Napoleon intervened and promoted Jomini, allowing him to continue to assist Ney and simultaneously accept a commission as a general in the military force of Russia’s Alexander I.\nJomini served as a general in both armies until 1814, when Napoleon’s chief of staff, Louis Alexandre Berthier, blocked his promotion to general of division by having him arrested on a charge of being tardy in submitting a report. Although the charges were minor, Berthiec’s resentment of the vain, pompous Jomini was not. Unwilling to work with Berthier, Jomini deserted the French army and joined Alexander I, who promoted him to lieu¬tenant general and consulted with him in his role as aide and adviser for the next two years. Jomini refused, however, to join directly in Russia’s subsequent combat against France and, following the Battle of Waterloo, lobbied unsuccessfully to stop the execution of Ney by the French monarchy.\nMany of Jomini’s old French comrades criticized him for supporting the Russians, while others expressed their displeasure with his support of Ney. Napoleon, however, communicating from his St. Helena exile, expressed his forgiveness for Jomini, excusing his actions because of his Swiss, rather than French, ancestry.\nFollowing Waterloo, Jomini continued his writings in semi- retirement until 1823, when the czar recalled him to Russia and promoted him to full general. For the next ten years Jomini organized the Russian military staff college, tutored Nicholas, the future czar, and briefly served in the 1828 war against the Turks at the siege of Varna. In 1829, Jomini retired from the Russian army and, except for returning to advise the czar during the Crimean War from 1853 to 1856, lived the remainder of his life in Brussels, continuing to record his concepts of warfare. He died there on March 22, 1869, at age ninety—the undisputed expert of the period in the art of war.\nDuring his long life, Jomini published more than thirty books on the history and theory of warfare. His works included studies of FREDERICK THE GREAT, the French Revolution, the Seven Years’ War, and the life of Napoleon, but his 1838 Summary of the Art of War was by far the most influential. Shortly after its publication, the book became the principal text at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point as well as at other military institutions. Around the world, military leaders, who honored Napoleon for his methods of conducting war, were convinced that the Swiss officer Jo¬mini had provided the secrets to the French emperor’s success.\njomini’s writings are verbose and difficult to summarize. Depending on the intent, readers can use the same texts to prove or disprove opposing points. Still, Jomini produced the first popular writings that attempted to analyze Napoleon’s art of war in a systematic manner. In addition to theory, he defined such concepts as tactics and strategy in a manner still accepted today. Other terms recorded and defined by Jomini included “theater of conflict,” the borders or boundaries of the conflict, and “lines of direction,” the focus of approach and attack.\nIn Summary of the Art of War, Jomini emphasized that “infantry is undoubtedly the most important arm” but added that foot sol¬diers must receive support from properly coordinated artillery, cavalry, and logistics. He emphasized the importance of soldier morale and a “national spirit” supporting the field army.\nAt the heart of Jomini’s concepts of the art of war lay a strictly regimented system of plans and actions for various situations and terrain. Each revolved around a series of plans to amass friendly forces and vigorously attack the enemy’s weak points, penetrating their lines and then exploiting the advantage with a follow-on. Although thorough reading of his works reveals that Jomini was more flexible than he usually receives credit for, more recent students of the art of war criticize his restricted plans containing geo¬metric formations and absolute rules—doctrines which did not foresee the invention of long-range, accurate, rapid-fire rifles that could concentrate massive fire.\nDuring his life, Jomini enjoyed the adulation as the premier author of military concepts. His terminology of warfare has survived long after his basic tenets of the conduct of combat have been mostly forgotten. Interestingly, his replacement as the leading theorist of warfare shared the times with Jomini and many of the same experiences. KARL VON CLAUSEWITZ , like Jomini, left his own Prussian army to serve briefly with the Russians. Both Clausewitz and Jomini participated in several of the same campaigns, and, of course, both wrote of their interpretations of war.\nJomini produced the first widely read books on the concepts of warfare, but in the late nineteenth century, military students began turning to the more profound, philosophical writings of Clausewitz. Although their conclusions are similar, those of the less rigid Clausewitz have become the preferred doctrine for commanders seeking flexibility in warfare. Both Clausewitz and SUN TZU rank ahead on this listing because of their lengthier and more current influence."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:1dea1f51-c79c-419d-8845-77095d081376>","<urn:uuid:f0259655-6b6b-44d8-8a1d-1eabe93e8b84>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do Great Green Macaws contribute to forest ecology, and what are the potential consequences of their population decline?","answer":"Great Green Macaws play an important ecological role through their feeding habits and seed dispersal. In Ecuador, they feed heavily on orchids (71% of their diet) and require large feeding ranges of about 2,000 hectares. Their decline, along with other large frugivores, threatens forest composition since they are among the animals capable of dispersing large seeds from heavy-wooded trees. Their loss could reduce a tropical forest's carbon storage capacity by 5-20%, as smaller animals like bats and birds can only disperse small seeds from smaller trees that store less carbon.","context":["|Scientific Name:||Ara ambiguus|\n|Species Authority:||(Bechstein, 1811)|\nAra ambigua BirdLife International (2000)\nAra ambigua Sibley and Monroe (1990, 1993)\nAra ambigua BirdLife International (2004)\nAra ambigua Stotz et al.

Salaman in litt. 1999), and occurs in Serranía de Majé and south Cerro Hoya (Robbins et al. 1985). In Colombia, it is also found in the north of the Serranía de Baudó and the West Andes, east to the upper Sinú valley (Hilty and Brown 1986, Snyder et al. 2000). In Honduras, it is now rare near the río Plátano (Snyder et al. 2000) and, in Nicaragua, it persists in the Bosawas Reserve and the Indio-Maíz and San Juan Reserve may hold the second largest global subpopulation (C. J. Sharpe in litt. 1999, O. Chassot verbally 2004). Ecuador's population has been estimated at 60-90 individuals in 2002 in two widely separated populations (Benítez 2002), but the population continues to shrink fast (O. Jahn in litt. 2004 and 2005, E. von Horstman in litt. 2005) and a census conducted in the Cordillera Chongon Colonche and Esmeraldas Province in 2010 found only 8 birds (E.

The majority of these are in Esmeraldas (Benítez 2002), and very small numbers remain in the Cordillera de Chongón-Colonche, Guayas (Snyder et al. 2000, Benítez 2002). The southern Nicaragua - northern Costa Rica population held an estimated 1,530 individuals in 2009. Recent estimates suggest that the global population is less than 2,500 mature individuals (or less than 3,700 in total including juveniles and immatures), with the largest subpopulation in Darién, north-west Colombia estimated at less than 1,700 mature individuals (or less than 2,500 in total) (O.

It is found mainly below 600 m, but occurs to 1,000 m and occasionally 1,500 m in Darién. In Costa Rica, local movements may reflect the asynchronous fruiting of Dipteryx panamensis, the principal nesting and feeding tree (Powell et al. 1995, Juniper and Parr 1998). In south-western Ecuador, it breeds in June-November, and nests in cavities of dead Cavanillesia plantanifolia trees (Berg and Horstman 1996, Lopez-Lanus 1999). Orchids made up 71% of the diet of a pair watched in Ecuador, and their feeding range was estimated at 2,000 ha (Lopez-Lanus 1999). In the non-breeding season, it tends to form flocks that disperse over large distances in search of food (O. Jahn in litt. 2004 and 2005, O.

Dipteryx panamensis is selectively logged in Costa Rica (Powell et al. 1995). Annual deforestation rates are very high throughout its range (FAO 2001). Deforestation in Panama probably exceeds 30% of its original range (G. R. Angehr in litt. 2005) and in some other countries (e.g., Costa Rica and Ecuador) the historical range was reduced by ~90 % over the past 100 years. (Chassot et al. 2002, O. Jahn in litt. 2004 and 2005). In its South American range, plans to colonise and develop remoter areas are progressing through infrastructural improvements, particularly the rapid expansion of the road network, which have increased the impact of logging, small-scale agriculture, illegal coca plantations, gold mining, and hunting, which is even affecting some key protected areas (Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund 2001, Álvarez 2002, Benítez 2002, Jahn in press a). Large areas western Ecuador are being purchased, denuded of forest and converted to industrial oil palm plantations (Sharpe 1999). Urbanisation and agriculture have largely extirpated race guayaquilensis, and it is reportedly shot as a crop-pest (Pople et al. 1997, Juniper and Parr 1998). There is illegal capture for (mostly internal) trade, food and feathers (Low 1995a, Powell et al. 1995, Sharpe 1999, C. J.

The stronghold is in Darién Biosphere Reserve, Panama, and adjacent Los Katíos National Park, Colombia. There are important reserves in all range states, but these provide insufficient protection for seasonal wanderers (Juniper and Parr 1998). In Costa Rica, a proposed moratorium on logging D. panamensis has not been implemented (Powell et al. 1995, Snyder et al. 2000). A government-backed conservation strategy is being implemented in Ecuador (E. von Horstman in litt. 2005). In 2007, a successful rapid assessment study in search of the last surviving individuals was carried out in the Cordillera Chongón-Colonche, Ecuador (O. Jahn in litt. 2004 and 2005). A bi-national campaign in the lowlands of the San Juan River (Nicaragua and Costa Rica) aims to increase awareness of biology, threats and conservation, and strengthen management of natural resources (Chassot et al. 2006). Habitat restoration utilizing native dry tropical forest species that are known or potential macaw food sources is being carried out by the Pro-Forest Foundation, with >250 hectares so far replanted with 35 native species (E. Horstman in litt. 2012). Conservation Actions Proposed\nImplement population monitoring programs (Benítez 2002, Jahn in press a). Monitor rates of habitat loss and degradation. Quantify levels of persecution and capture for trade. Effectively protect reserves in Honduras, Nicaragua (Snyder et al. 2000), Ecuador (Benítez 2002, O. Jahn in litt. 2004 and 2005, Jahn in press a) and other countries. Sustainably manage the buffer zones of key protected areas and reserves (Benítez 2002) and develop captive breeding programmes. Curtail trade through law enforcement and educational campaigns (J. Lyons in litt. 1998, C. J. Sharpe in litt. 1999, Benítez 2002). Designate the proposed Maquenque National Park, Costa Rica (Powell et al. 1995). In Ecuador, designate the Awá reserve, Cotacachi-Cayapas Ecological Reserve, Awacachi corridor, Gran Reserva Chachi, and Canandé Reserve, including the Río Santiago, Cayapas, Ónzole, and Hoja Blanca drainages, as a biosphere reserve (Benítez 2002, Jahn in press a). In Ecuador, efficiently guard all known nests during the entire nesting period to avoid the destruction of nesting trees and the collection of nestlings by poachers (O. Jahn in litt. 2004 and 2005). Acquire private reserves in selected areas (Lopez-Lanus 1999, Sharpe 1999). Create a biological corridor for the species (and others), linking forest remnants in the Cordillera Chongon Colonche with the Cerro Blanco Protected Forest.\n|Citation:||BirdLife International. 2013.

The decline of fruit-eating animals, such as large primates, tapirs and toucans, means that there is reduced seed dispersal of large trees and therefore fewer trees in forests to soak up global carbon dioxide emissions.\nA new study, published in Science Advances, has shown that hunting and poaching of large tropical animals could change the species composition of rainforests. Seed dispersal by large-bodied vertebrates is via the ingestion of viable seeds that pass through their digestive tracts intact. The removal of these animals from the ecosystem upsets the natural balance and leads to a loss of heavy-wooded large trees, and may reduce a tropical forest’s ability to store carbon by between 5 and 20%, depending on the trees species that are present in a given area.\nA research team from Brazil, Spain, Finland and the UK studied data from more than 2,000 trees species in Brazil’s Atlantic Forest, and more than 800 animal species. They found that fruit-eaters (frugivores) that are not targeted by hunters, such as small bats and birds, are only able to disperse small seeds from small trees. But large, heavy-wooded trees – the ones that capture and store greater amounts of carbon – are associated with larger seeds that can only be dispersed by large animals, those which are targeted by hunters.\nProfessor Mauro Galetti from São Paulo State University said: “The big frugivores, such as large primates, the tapir, the toucans, among other large animals, are the only ones able to effectively disperse plants that have large seeds. Usually, the trees that have large seeds are also big trees with dense wood that store more carbon.\nCarolina Bello, a PhD student from the São Paulo State University, added: “When we lose large frugivores we are losing dispersal and recruitment functions of large seeded trees and therefore, the composition of tropical forests changes. The result is a forest dominated by smaller trees with milder woods which stock less carbon.”\nProfessor Carlos Peres, from University of East Anglia’s School of Environmental Sciences, said: “Large birds and mammals provide almost all the seed dispersal services for large-seeded plants. Several large vertebrates are threatened by hunting, illegal trade and habitat loss. But the steep decline of the megafauna in overhunted tropical forest ecosystems can bring about large unforeseen impacts. We show that the decline and extinction of large animals will over time induce a decline in large hardwood trees. This in turn negatively affects the capacity of tropical forests to store carbon and therefore their potential to counter climate change.”\nTropical forests, especially the Amazon and Africa’s tropical rainforests, as well as the Atlantic forest, are the earth’s largest and densest natural carbon sinks. In their trunks and roots they store more than 25% of our carbon dioxide emissions. More research is needed before scientists can quantify the full effects but this study provides even more evidence that biological diversity and healthy forest ecosystems are essential if we are to have a healthy climate."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:26ace2e5-cdd5-4f34-a4ad-0eb0bf63949c>","<urn:uuid:3487c98d-1113-4d86-8fc9-ce9c68330ec3>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I'm researching genetic factors in disease resistance. How does the IFN-γR1 gene mutation affect a person's susceptibility to mycobacterial diseases?","answer":"The IFN-γR1 gene mutation severely compromises the immune system's response to mycobacteria. The mutation disrupts the gene responsible for making a receptor for interferon γ, which normally directs immune cells to organize an attack. When the receptor is absent or rejects the molecule, it disrupts an immune system pathway specifically targeting mycobacteria. Across 32 countries, 33 different mutations on IFN-γR1 have been identified in 118 patients, who have either complete or partial deficiency of IFN-γR1 and are severely susceptible to mycobacterial disease.","context":["Fighting an illness is not just about fighting the bacteria or viruses that cause it, it also has to do with your genes. In new research from Rockefeller University and the Necker Medical School in Paris, scientists have identified a gene mutation that makes children susceptible to a severe form of mycobacterial disease, any disease caused by species of Mycobacterium such as tuberculosis and leprosy. The mutation represents a new layer of disease severity in children who lack a vital disease-fighting component from their immune system.\nLed by Jean-Laurent Casanova, head of the Laboratory of Human Genetics of Infectious Diseases, the work lends further support not only to the controversial idea that an error in a single gene is enough to dramatically alter an individual’s risk for bacterial disease, but also to the notion that humans have sets of genes that are pathogen-specific.\n“It’s incredible,” says Stephanie Boisson-Dupuis, a research associate in the lab. “In the past 10 years, the way that we think about the genetics of infectious disease has been redefined. Instead of just targeting the bacteria, we can now also target the immune system, and try to patch the holes that allow the bacteria to slip through.”\nThe mutation disrupts a gene known as IFN-γR1, which is charged with making a receptor for interferon γ, a molecule that directs immune cells to organize an attack. When the receptor is absent or rejects the molecule, it disrupts an immune system pathway that specifically targets mycobacteria.\nAcross 32 countries, 33 different mutations on IFN-γR1 have been identified in 118 patients, who have either a complete or partial deficiency of IFN-γR1 and are severely susceptible to mycobacterial disease. Casanova’s team reports on a new form of partial IFN-γR1 deficiency with particularly severe consequences. “The severity of the disease depends on the severity of the deficiency,” says Boisson-Dupuis. “In this case, the deficiency is almost as severe as complete deficiency, leading to a dramatic increase in the severity of the mycobacterial disease.”\nCasanova, Boisson-Dupuis and postdoc Xiao-Fei Kong discovered the mutation in a young patient who had developed mycobacterial disease after receiving the BCG vaccine for tuberculosis. Suspecting that IFN-γR1 was involved, the team began sequencing the gene not only in the patient, but in her healthy parents and sibling. The tests revealed that each parent had one copy of the mutation located on a stretch of DNA where transcription begins — the initiation codon. But the patient inherited both copies of the gene, severely compromising her immune system’s response to mycobacteria.\nFurther investigation pointed to a never before known transcriptional mechanism of the immune system pathway. Because the mutation affects the first methionine (thus, the translation of the initiation codon) the team did not expect to see the interferon γ receptor expressed, but they did, albeit in dramatically reduced amounts on manipulated cells from the patient, suggesting that there was a second stretch of DNA from which the receptor could be transcribed. But that wasn’t the only surprise. Some cells translate and express the receptor while others do not, even though all cells have the same mutation.\n“It is the first time we have seen such a finding for this immune system pathway,” says Boisson-Dupuis. “Understanding the basis of this finding should make it possible to devise ways to make the immune system succeed so that perhaps one day, a genetic legacy will no longer write a family’s history.”\n|Human Molecular Genetics online: November 16, 2009\nA novel form of cell type-specific partial IFN-γR1 deficiency caused by a germ line mutation of the IFNGR1 initiation codon\nXiao-Fei Kong, Guillaume Vogt, Ariane Chapgier, Christophe Lamaze, Jacinta Bustamante, Carolina Prando, Anny Fortin, Anne Puel, Jacqueline Feinberg, Xin-Xin Zhang, Pauline Gonnord, Ulla M.

{"question":"I travel frequently through U.S. cities - how might autonomous vehicles change the way public roads are accessed in American urban areas?","answer":"Autonomous vehicles could significantly restrict public road access in American cities. As self-driving cars become more prevalent, roads might become accessible only to robocars, excluding human drivers for safety and efficiency reasons. This could start with freeways and major thoroughfares before spreading to secondary roads and residential streets. This impact would be particularly significant in sprawling American cities like Houston or Atlanta, where walking or using rail transit is nearly impossible, potentially making citizens dependent on oligopolistic technology transit companies for transportation.","context":["Whenever people go from one place to another, they don’t think much about the roads and sidewalks that pass beneath them. But this infrastructure, known as the public right-of-way, doesn’t work by magic. It is managed and regulated by specific laws. People don’t own the roads they travel on, but streets and sidewalks provide an easement—a right of use or passage separate from that of ownership.\nFor example: a single-family homeowner usually owns the sidewalk that flanks a property, particularly if that sidewalk falls behind a tree-planting strip that separates it from the street. By local standard or writ, the homeowner grants an easement to the general public to use the sidewalk, utility companies to use the curb where utility lines run, and so forth. Similarly, cities, towns, and the federal government own the roads, but they grant easement to the public to make use of them for transport. The relationships between private and public landowners is managed by local land use and planning agencies. If a builder wants to construct a new driveway from an undeveloped private property to the public right of way, it needs to get permission to do so from the appropriate public agent. That same agent is responsible for maintaining the roads so that they are usable. Some roads, like freeways, don’t offer any private access and restrict public easement to vehicles.\nUnfortunately, America’s roads have seen better days. After a massive investment in new infrastructure since the mid-20th century, streets, roads, and freeways have ossified. New roads are tough to build in established cities, and existing ones are increasingly difficult to improve. When roads do get built, they are usually constructed for new development in suburbs or subdivisions. Fear, local resident entrenchment, and lack of funding has hampered adequate upgrades of roads, too. America’s car cities—Los Angeles, Houston, Atlanta, and Dallas, for example—have endured increased congestion when more and more cars travel on roads built for far fewer.\nEven when the roads are clear, they are often in poor condition. The economic crisis of 2008 reduced the tax base that supports public service in the near term, but it also inaugurated a prolonged program of social austerity justified by that supposed crisis. And the longer maintenance and support gets deferred, the more complex and costly it becomes to catch up.\nThe state of public roads might have a surprising and substantial impact on the role of self-driving cars. Cars need roads to drive on, so the technology companies at the center of the robocar revolution might become increasingly invested in them. But roads themselves might become inaccessible to citizens if driving becomes fully autonomous.\n* * *\nIf one thing’s clear about cities of the future, it’s that they will become more and more intertwined with the technology business. Public-private partnerships—mergers of private and public funding and support—are helping make costly, unpopular urban development projects more palatable, including tech-enabled transit. Altamonte Springs, a city of 42,000 residents north of Orlando, Florida, for instance, is set to begin offering Uber public subsidies to service its residents. The initiative, which is worth up to half a million dollars a year to the ride-hailing company for starters, effectively turns it into a private provider of public transit.\nEventually, other, larger cities might choose such arrangements to spare themselves the cost and trouble of maintaining public transit services. Such an outcome wouldn’t be entirely new, either. Before the car took over after World War II, public transit was mostly privately owned and operated in America. A return to privatized transit in the form of car-hailing services would make a poetic victory for the automobile over the train and the bus.\nA welcome one, too. Citizens are becoming more and more accustomed to the conveniences of app-based services like Uber and Lyft. Google’s parent company, Alphabet, reportedly has 100 people working on future urban design projects at a new entity, Sidewalk Labs.\nIt’s not hard to imagine a near future in which municipalities like Altamonte Springs might use the cost savings (or direct investment) of companies like Uber, Lyft, or Google to invest in much-needed maintenance and updates. Once cars become autonomous, the benefit of investments like these will increase even further, since the cost and liability of human drivers can be averted. Better roads mean lower maintenance costs.\nSubstantial, new infrastructure development might even be impossible without private-sector investment. For example, engineers have been researching future electric motorways that could charge electric vehicles while they drive. These roads would be very expensive in the near-term, but by reducing the weight and complexity of batteries in vehicles, it could pay off in the long term—but only with the leverage of scale. It’s hard to imagine many governments investing in such infrastructure right now, but if tech or automotive companies end up building new fleets of autonomous, electric car-service vehicles in the future, the opportunity to outsource power to the roadways might become appealing enough to “wire” the roads like Google is currently wiring cities for fiber broadband.\nPublic-private partnerships for roads might begin the erosion of the public right of way. But it’s also possible that autonomous vehicles will all but require limited access to public roads to operate effectively.\nToday’s self-driving cars have to be designed and programmed to interact with messy circumstances. Pedestrians, dogs, bicycles, human-driven vehicles, and other obstacles all pose challenges to robocars, and if autonomous vehicles are even modestly successful, avoiding collisions with fallible human drivers will prove a temporary problem.\nThat transition could take years, and for the moment it is subject to state-by-state rather than federal regulation. But massive private wealth and widespread public approval among tech companies, along with overall regulatory decline in general and explicit federal support for self-driving cars in particular, make it just as likely that robocars will become widespread sooner than anyone expects.\nThe more self-driving cars there are on the roads, the less complex and more predictable the overall behavior of traffic becomes. One technological model for both semi- and fully-autonomous cars is vehicle-to-vehicle communication. Once installed with GPS, networking, and sensor arrays, cars will be able to communicate with one another directly, allowing for better routing options and increased safety response, such as adaptive accident avoidance. Drivers could use the relief. Thanks in part to smartphone-caused distracted driving—a circumstance created by the same technology companies that might soon offer autonomous vehicles as respite— traffic deaths last year rose at the fastest rate since 1965. Some proponents have predicted that self-driving cars will prevent so many traffic deaths, human-driven cars will be illegal within the next two decades on safety grounds alone.\nThe rise of automobiles in the 20th century pushed out pedestrian access in cities almost everywhere in America. Future connected vehicles could perform more sophisticated feats than just replacing human fallibility, ones that might exclude human drivers even from operating vehicles alongside robocars. And with that exclusion, traditional vehicles might meet the same fate in this century that pedestrians did in the last.\nConsider intersections. Stop signs, traffic lights, and other common flow control tools give human drivers a common set of conventions for piloting their vehicles. But future autonomous cars would have no real need for them. Networked, computer-controlled vehicles can coordinate with another, evaluating traffic conditions and altering their course in real time to avoid collisions. Like the Lexus-branded pods in Steven Spielberg’s Minority Report, future self-driving vehicles might drive at high speed, coordinating with and around one another in a highly choreographed way. The result might look like the labyrinthine traffic in a chaotic city like Delhi, but without the risk of calamity.\nIf electric motorways become a reality, it’s even possible that they could be built in such a way that roadways could physically or electronically prohibit traditional vehicles from traversing them. If cars can get smart, why can’t roads? And if roads get smart, it’s likely that they’ll express some of that supposed wisdom through new controls and restrictions.\n* * *\nOnce autonomous cars reach a tipping point, cities and the private companies that operate robocar services might voluntarily exclude human drivers from the roads. Not only because doing so could save hundreds of thousands of lives per year, but also because ceding the roads to robots might become a more convenient and economical alternative to sharing the roads with them. Given the opportunity, autonomous car services will likely be willing to invest heavily in redeveloping urban infrastructure that would give them an economic advantage in serving the populations that live there. Especially if it would mean a monopoly on local transit. The results could change city life entirely.\nSome consequences of widespread robocar transit are clear already. Parking lots and structures are commonly cited future casualties of the future rise of autonomous cars. As Clive Thompson wrote in Mother Jones earlier this year, “many urbanists predict that fleets of robocars could become so reliable that many, many people would choose not to own automobiles, causing the amount of parking needed to drop through the floor.” Nobody likes parking lots, and it’s possible that robocars could inaugurate an era of redevelopment for these urban blights.\nBut if parking lots are the organs of the urban creature, roads are its circulatory system. They are the primary means by which people move from place to place—whether they do so by car, bus, foot—or even streetcar or light rail. No matter how hypothetical, the potential eviction of human access to roads ought to raise far more eyebrows than the philosophical gimmickry of robocar Trolley Problems.\nSurely not all roads would be made robot-only at once. Perhaps freeways and major thoroughfares would do so first. But a city is a network of roads, and the shift from shared to computerized streets would spread. Roads connect to other roads, such that the transition from hybrid passageways to fully autonomous ones would imply an alteration to the urban landscape not yet conceived. It might be easier just to ban people from roads entirely—even secondary roads and residential side-streets. After all, that’s also how the car took over from the train and the sidewalk in the United States.\nThe possibility of being locked out of public rights of way is a problem somewhat unique to America. Dense European cities like Paris and London are already criss-crossed by public rail transit and relatively small in physical size. It’s easy and even pleasant to walk across Paris or Barcelona. Crossing Houston or Atlanta by foot or rail isn’t just unpleasant; it’s all but impossible.\nUnless the nascent renaissance of pedestrian-friendly urbanism expands significantly and rapidly, the self-reliance cars have provided for decades could reverse course. Instead of offering freedom to maneuver, cars would yoke citizens to the services of oligopolistic technology transit companies.\n* * *\nThere are reasons beyond pride and tradition to worry about future autonomous car service providers’ impact on urban life. Social justice, for one. There’s evidence that gig economy companies like Uber and AirBnB make it easier to discriminate against racial minorities, disabled people, and other disadvantaged populations.\nAmerican streets have long been a site for racial strife, whether through the federal endorsement of housing prejudice known as redlining, via urban planning that further segregated minority neighborhoods from economic centers, or from the white flight and dissent that stymied the development or expansion of public transit networks in the civil rights era. Once wealthy, non-local technology companies have a direct impact on the financing and planning of urban spaces, the negative impact on less white, less wealthy communities could be severe.\nThe past offers lessons for the future in this regard. In Atlanta, where I live, urban planners of the mid-20th century effectively zoned the city into distinctly separate black and white areas. As public transit and economic development-driven investments like stadia entered the picture, black communities were physically cut off from white ones. Streets were dead-ended and renamed, hampering navigational continuity. The effects of these choices continue today, invisibly. They would become even more entrenched if the publicly-passable thoroughfares that already segregate the city were made impassible except by robocar. Historically, thoroughfares have already helped isolate neighborhoods by race and class. If those arterials were impassible like freeways, their divisive effect would only intensify.\nThere are also economic concerns. We already know that Uber and Lyft are overwhelmingly used by the wealthy and well-educated. Those services are still relatively expensive compared to public transit, even if they are often more convenient. With the exception of private property that explicitly limits public easement, roads and sidewalks currently can be accessed free-as-in-beer as much as free-as-in-speech. But in a hypothetical future in which local municipalities enter into arrangements with future versions of Google or Uber, that access might come at a price. It’s easy to imagine that cross-town transit might soon require acceptance of non-negotiable terms of service that would allow your robocar provider to aggregate and sell where you go, when, with whom, and for what purpose.\nOther, stranger realities are possible. Imagine if walking across the street required a microtransaction to insure safe passage. Violations might be subject to tickets or fines—although more likely, your local transit vendor would already know where you are thanks to your smartphone, and just debit your metered service plan accordingly. (Cities like Los Angeles and Honolulu, which impose steep fines for jaywalking, offer a prototype. The car industry has a long history lobbying against jaywalking.) And imagine if Google or Apple, which already provide most folks with mapping services, also got into the business of conveying those citizens through cities. Maps might become accessible only by the good graces of car services. Perhaps you could buy a subscription for unlimited access to your block or neighborhood. The materially fortunate might spring for an all-access plan—the only way to see a whole-city street view.\nIf this sounds preposterous, consider the fact that tech companies tend to spurn negotiation with local communities if they don’t get their way. Just as Uber and Lyft pulled out of Austin to protest an undesirable regulatory hurdle, Google or Apple might restrict access to their mapping services in areas that don’t adopt political positions convenient to their corporate interests.\nThey might even elect to alter the physical environment accordingly. In America, street signs are yoked to signage built for human drivers, mounted atop traffic signals and stop signs. Once those devices aren’t needed, their attached markings might also disappear. Perhaps tech giants could persuade municipalities to remove street signs and markers to realize cleaner, less distracting urban conveyance via the synergy of app-street-and-car transit networks.\nNo matter the scenario, one thing’s for sure: When Silicon Valley runs our automobiles, they’ll do so according to the business practices of the technology industry, not according to the principles of local urban planning and civic life.\n* * *\nThe communities most resilient to whatever changes autonomous cars might bring to the public right of way are likely to be those that wean themselves from cars in the meantime. Here, American urban planners and citizens alike can learn from recent trends in Europe, where the relative powerlessness of the automobile has allowed cities to suppress and even reverse its advance. As my colleague Adrienne LaFrance reported last year, Oslo is trying to ban cars entirely from its downtown by 2019. And Barcelona hopes to combat pollution and noise with nine-block “superblocks,” neighborhoods that are bounded by car-accessible streets, but which reserve internal passage for citizen use.\nWith a few notable exceptions, American cities will never be dense and small enough to adopt European approaches to urban planning. But efforts to make sprawling U.S. cities denser, more walkable, and less reliant on automobiles are more popular than they have been since the car and the suburb took over for the train and the city-center after World War II. Increasing safe access to major roads for bicycles and walkers, for example, might offer an unexpected benefit should the robocarpocalypse arrive: Neighborhoods with deliberately-built, well-maintained paths for non-automotive transit will retain the freedom of entrance and egress that the car currently insures everywhere. And a renewed interest in denser, mixed-use zoning and development has created more opportunities for superblock-like communities in car-centric cities like Atlanta and Houston. Even so, the automobile still rules these towns, and especially in the cheaper, more sprawling suburbs and exurbs where a majority of metropolitan-area inhabitants still reside. Avoiding the roboway entirely might prove impossible.\nWhen imagining a future with self-driving cars, the impact on the immediate future seems most urgent. For the moment, safety and liability issues concern the public most. But even if imperfect, autonomous vehicles are already much safer than human-driven ones. When it comes to robots on the roadways, city dwellers would be better off worrying about their future access to the roads in the first place. Eventually, those citizens might enjoy a new kind of freedom, that of avoiding owning and operating automobiles altogether. But in exchange, they might also give up freedom to move around the city without the help of a few, large global technology companies. Then the suburbs might reverse their fortune and become desirable once more. Not as a place to live, but as a place to escape and move about freely, without the intervention of Big Robocar. That is, if you can still get there in the first place.\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.

{"question":"How do traditional preservation methods like drying compare with modern pickling techniques in terms of their historical significance and cultural impact?","answer":"Traditional preservation methods like drying date back to the Neolithic era, with dried lentils being among the earliest preserved foods. Different cultures developed specific preservation techniques, such as pemmican in North America and biltong in South Africa. Modern pickling, while also ancient (dating back to 2030 B.C.), has evolved into a contemporary food trend. Today, pickling is practiced in three ways: quick pickles, hot water bath canning, and lacto-fermentation, each affecting shelf life and nutritional value differently. While preservation was historically about survival, both traditional drying and modern pickling have become valued for adding flavor and maintaining cultural connections. Modern pickling has expanded beyond necessity to become a philosophy, with a diverse community of practitioners including young urbanites, professional chefs, and home cooks, preserving everything from traditional cucumbers to unconventional items like fruits and watermelon rind.","context":["For much of the past, none of this was so. Preserving foods from the good times to tide over the bad was built into the daily routine of hunting, growing and cooking. Our modern understanding of preservation is built on the work of Victorian scientists who discovered micro-organisms: exclude or kill those organisms and food will last. But it wasn’t necessary to know why or how something worked to know that it did. The simplest and earliest method was drying; pulses were one of the first things to be dried and archaeologists have found dried lentils stored from the Neolithic era. Fish, meat, fruit and vegetables were also preserved by air drying, often with the addition of salt, the exact techniques varying by culture and geographic location.\nMeat was a focus – prestigious as well as nutritious – and different cultures developed highly specific preservation methods. In North America, there was pemmican: dried meat mixed with fat and berries. South Africa had biltong; South America had jerky. In Britain, hams were made by brining and hot-smoking meat, using highly regionalised recipes. Most were pork, but there are also recipes for mutton, beef, badger and even small bear. The process of making them was often a community affair, with the curing and smoking taking several weeks before each ham was wrapped in cloth and hung up to mature.\nBut food preservation has always been about more than just survival. Smoking and salting add flavour, and by the 17th century, as farming improvements alleviated seasonal supply issues, preserved foods were valued for this as much as for their longevity. Pickling became popular. One recipe for pickling larks took six months, dissolving the bones in the process. Pickles were made with beer, wine or vinegar plus herbs and spices, and were used for everything from brawn to beans, which would then keep for months, if not years. And it was only a short step to using the liquid itself – as ‘catsups’ (otherwise known as ketchup) or essences such as Worcestershire Sauce.\nFor fruit and vegetables, preservation could transform the quotidian into something magical. Strings of dried produce were practical and beautiful – citrus was highly prized as lemons and oranges were expensive, while Louis XIII of France threaded mushrooms onto strings. When sugar became fashionable, candied fruit became a sign of sophistication and wealth. Flowers brushed with whipped egg white and sprinkled with fine sugar were dried in a low oven overnight: a heady mix of colour, texture and flavour. Then came marmalades. The word comes from the Portuguese ‘marmelo’ – quince – from whose honeyed flesh the earliest examples were made. By the 19th century, jams were a mainstay of any kitchen. Chutneys, meanwhile, were adapted from Indian recipes, sometimes with an optimistic view of the English climate – one recipe read ‘put in the sun every-day for a month’. Jars were sealed with pigs’ bladders, stretched and dried. Even this took time – a couple of weeks to dry out fully.\nBy the 20th century, there was no real need to preserve foods in these ways. The fridge, the freezer and the supermarket gave us food at our fingertips. But industrial versions of slow-preserved foods don’t always have the flavour, and we can lose touch with the way our food is produced. So while we shouldn’t rose-tint the past, we can still appreciate that time itself adds value, and that sometimes the best things really are worth waiting for.","It’s ancient. It’s culinary cool. We’re talking pickling and canning, and fall’s brimming farm markets mean now is the time to gather friends (men are into this BTW) for a good old-fashioned/new-fashioned weekend canning confab. Make a weekend of it with these pickling and canning recipes and tips.\nLet those December winds bellow ’n’ blow\nTaste a little of the summer,\nTaste a little of the summer,\nYou can taste a little of the summer\nMy grandma’s put it all in jars.\nShe cans the pickles, sweet & dill\nShe cans the songs of the whippoorwill\nAh, she’s got magic in her—you know what I mean\nShe puts the sun and rain in with her green beans\nAnd the morning dew and the evening moon\n’N’ I really got to go see her pretty soon\n’Cause these canned goods I buy at the store\nAin’t got the summer in them anymore\n– Greg Brown, The Canning Song\nIf you were lucky enough to grow up having a grandma (or anybody, for that matter) who preserved summer’s abundance of fresh produce in jars, the memories this song evokes will be sweet—or, in the case of pickling, sour, but still pleasant and nostalgic. Sometimes we yearn for the old days, for simpler times, and reminiscences like this take us back …\nBut wait—cut that trip down Memory Lane short, and head back to the present, because pickling is hot today, and it’s not just for grandmas anymore. In fact, pickles are a major food trend. A whole new demographic has discovered, or rediscovered, the joys of canning and preserving in recent years, with pickling at the top of the list. Last year, both the National Restaurant Association and Urban Spoon declared pickling one of the top trends of 2016.\nBut the rise of pickling to its newfound celebrity status actually started several years back. Evidence that something was afoot in the pickling world began to surface in the early 2000s in such venerable media as NPR, CNN and major newspapers and food magazines, as well as online, and has continued to grow. Allrecipes.com tracked a 109 percent increase in page views of its pickling, jams, canning and preserving articles in 2007, while Barnes and Noble confirmed in 2008 that sales of books and magazines in those same categories were strong throughout the chain—and not only in rural areas.\nIn 2013, Saveur’s “100 Favorites” issue honored number 55, tsukemono (traditional Japanese pickles), with a full-page spread. The Washington Post noted that same year that “one look around the Washington area would seem to confirm that we’re in the throes of pickling mania.” And Condé Nast Traveler wrote in 2015, “All over the country, restaurants are fermenting and brining everything from French fries and shiitake tempura to eggs and pumpkin.” Not to be left behind, social media has picked up the trend and is fanning the ames of pickle love on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Pinterest.\nSo what sparked this pickling frenzy? In all probability, it was a combination of many factors: the economic crisis at the beginning of the 21st century, an upturn in DIY, and of course the farm-to-table movement, which has spurred renewed interest in cooking and eating more foods that we either grow ourselves or source from local farms and farm markets. Another reason may be that our palates have become more sophisticated, which may seem like a contradiction considering that pickles are something that has long been considered a down-home, traditional food.\nBut the more we read and travel and become aware of new and different foods, the more we want to discover and taste them. As a result, there is now a beautiful diversity in the pickling world. Today’s picklers include young and old, urbanites and rural dwellers, home cooks and professional chefs. And the variety of vegetables—and fruits—being pickled has expanded far beyond the classic cucumber version that started everything back in 2030 B.C. (yes, you read that right), according to the New York Food Museum’s “Pickle History Timeline.”\nIt’s not surprising that, like many other trends, this one has ancient and international roots. Middle Eastern and Asian cultures have been pickling for centuries, and pickles were already a common condiment and snack in England in Medieval times (Queen Elizabeth I was apparently a fan, and Shakespeare references pickles metaphorically in both Hamlet and Twelfth Night). The Russians, Germans, French, Scandinavians and Eastern Europeans also have a long history of pickled delicacies. As for the New World, the Caribbean diet began to include pickled elements in the 1500s, and by 1606, pickles were being produced at home and commercially in the colony of Virginia.\nToday, home-pickled foods can be made in three different ways: quick pickles (the “fast food of pickling”), hot water bath canning, and lacto-fermentation. Each method has a specific process that affects shelf life and nutritional value of the finished product. “Quick pickling doesn’t provide the nutrients that the other two do,” says Jen Schaap, food and farm programs coordinator for Crosshatch Center for Art & Ecology in Bellaire, “but it is easy to do, yields a crisp product, and offers a lot of flavor options.\n“Water bath canning uses a brine solution that both encourages good microorganisms and discourages bad ones. And with lacto-fermentation, there is even more nutritional content, because that process introduces both salt and a whey product, so it’s feeding really good organisms, which are beneficial to the digestive system.”\nPickling began as a necessity—a way to preserve food from spoiling prior to refrigeration. It has expanded in modern times to become a conscientious choice, and not only for health reasons. “Now, it is a philosophy,” Schaap says. “We do it because it makes sense and it’s good. As people learn more, they want to know what’s in their food and care about what they are feeding their families. And of course, it’s also about taste.”\nAs culinary legend James Beard wrote in Beard on Food, “… preserving should not be for its own sake, but, like cooking, should be practiced to produce an effect delightful in itself.” With its versatility and variety, pickling is one more way to get creative with food. Flavors, textures, colors and heat can basically be tweaked according to the pickler’s whim, as long as some basic rules are followed (see Safety First). You may start with just a vinegar and salt solution (for quick pickles and hot water bath pickles) or a water and salt solution (for fermented pickles), but it’s when you add spices, herbs and aromatics that the real magic happens.\nWhat can be pickled? Besides cucumbers, how about radishes, turnips, beets, plums, peaches, blackberries, cherries, eggplant, fennel, onions, cabbage, beans, peppers, okra, tomatoes, peppers, carrots, cauliflower and watermelon rind— just for starters. Commonly used spices include, but are by no means limited to, black peppercorns, dill seeds, coriander seeds, cumin seeds, mustard seeds, allspice, bay leaves and cloves; herbs such as dill, tarragon, basil or thyme and aromatics like garlic, shallot, onions or chilies can add yet another flavor dimension. If you can imagine it, you can probably pickle it.\nSounds like fun, right? Well, it can and should be, Schaap says. Still, if you’re using the hot water bath method, it can also be a long, hot, tiring and inconveniently timed job. “That’s where the grueling part comes in,” notes Schaap, “because when that fruit or vegetable is ripe and ready, it doesn’t matter if you have plans for the weekend or if the weather is steamy—you’ve got to get it done then and there. And if you’ve got round after round of jars on just one or two burners, it’s also boring, which is why I always say, ‘Friends don’t let friends can alone.’ You should gather your friends or family and do it together. It’s so much nicer to have someone to talk to and split the effort and share the rewards with.”\nSchaap knows one excellent way to do that, too. Crosshatch operates a mobile three-season “Preservation Station” with a fully equipped kitchen that can be hired to come to your own farm, community garden, farm market or backyard with a canning expert who teaches hands-on group classes on pickling and fermenting during peak season for produce (see Let’s Get Pickling!).\nBrad Kik, Crosshatch co-founder and co-director (with his wife, Amanda), is unabashedly fond of pickling. And he may have found the real secret to its current popularity in the almost poetic terms he uses to describe it. “Pickling is one of those acts, like gardening, hunting and foraging, that connect us twice: first to the natural world and its splendor, and then to our grandparents and more distant ancestors who, with only minor changes in technique and equipment, have been walking these paths long before us. We can almost feel their ghosts in the room with us.”\nThere is also another component, Kik adds, that has almost certainly helped to draw new proponents to this elemental activity. “Pickling is second only to baking in its alchemy. The simple act of soaking sliced red onions in vinegar for ten minutes is as close to proof of miracles as you can get.” For Schaap, that miracle is especially welcome in December, just as Greg Brown sang in his ode to his grandma’s pickles. “That’s exactly the reason to pickle and preserve,” she says. “When I can pull those jars off the shelf, that’s what gets me through the winter. It’s not just the taste—it’s the memory, the connection to the land, all of it.”"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:25493666-630d-4ac8-a146-ac9ea340db43>","<urn:uuid:31dfa181-18fc-49c9-b045-34f778c1d042>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the transmission methods of tick-borne diseases in dogs, and what symptoms should owners watch for in both Lyme disease and ehrlichiosis?","answer":"Tick-borne diseases are transmitted when infected ticks feed on dogs for an extended period. For Lyme disease, ticks must be attached for 36-48 hours, while ehrlichiosis transmission occurs within 24-48 hours of tick attachment. For symptoms, Lyme disease typically causes fever, loss of appetite, lethargy, swollen joints, and in severe cases can lead to kidney failure and cardiac issues. Ehrlichiosis progresses in three phases: the acute phase (1-3 weeks) with symptoms including fever, loss of appetite, weight loss, listlessness, and swollen joints; the subclinical phase where dogs appear healthy; and the chronic phase featuring weight loss and fever in severe cases.","context":["According to the Handbook for Zoonotic Diseases of Companion Animals, ehrlichiosis refers to a group of diseases. The specific type of ehrlichiosis is named according to the host and type of white blood cell it affects. Canine granulocytic ehrlichiosis is caused by the pathogens Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Ehrlichia ewingii, affecting your dog's granulocytic white blood cells.\nGranulocyte + Ehrlichiosis = Granulocytic Ehrlichiosis\nA granulocyte is a white blood cell comprised of small granules containing proteins. This particular type of blood cell wards off bacterial infections, which is why a dog's granulocyte count increases if he's battling this particular infection. In the U.S., the bacterial infection ehrlichiosis is caused by one of three types of ehrlichia: Ehrlichia chaffeensis, Ehrlichia ewingii and Ehrlichia muris-like, with Ehrlichia ewingii targeting granulocytes. Though it doesn't carry the \"ehrlichia\" label, Anaplasma phagocytophilum also can cause granulocytic ehrlichiosis. Both types of bacteria are spread to dogs by ticks.\nComing From a Tick Near You\nContracting granulocytic ehrlichiosis can be as easy as a walk in the park for your dog -- all it takes is a run-in with the wrong kind of tick. If Duff lives in the Northeast or Upper Midwestern U.S., the black-legged tick carrying Anaplasma phagocytophilum can give him granulocytic ehrlichiosis; the Western black-legged trick can do the same thing in Northern California. The lone star tick, found in the south central and southeastern U.S., can transmit granulocytic ehrlichiosis to your dog by carrying Ehrlichia ewingii. Regardless of where he lives or what kind of tick he meets, Duff becomes infected with the disease in the same way: The tick jumps on your pup, feeds and transfers the bacteria to his granulocytes. The bacteria live on, multiplying and spreading through your dog's system.\nDifferent Phases, Different Symptoms\nEhrlichiosis progresses in three phases in dogs: acute, subclinical and chronic. Common symptoms of granulocytic ehrlichiosis in the acute phase include fever, loss of appetite, weight loss and listlessness. Swollen joints, stiffness and hesitation to move are also signs of infection. The acute phase lasts one to three weeks and if left untreated, progresses to the subclinical stage. At this point, your pup will appear to return to his normal good health and remain there for months or even years. For certain dogs, such as one with a compromised immune system, the chronic phase can be life-threatening. In the chronic phase, weight loss and fever are common, particularly in severe cases.\nSearching for Antibodies\nBlood testing is important for diagnosing granulocytic ehrlichiosis; a positive test for antibodies against the bacteria confirms exposure to the pathogen, but doesn't confirm an infection is active. A negative test doesn't give an all-clear because Duff may be too sick to produce the antibodies or it's too soon after infection to detect the antibodies. Other tests may confirm diagnosis, and as Veterinary Partner notes, occasionally the offending organism can be seen on a blood smear. The antibiotics tetracycline and doxycycline are effective at treating granulocytic ehrlichiosis. Prior infection doesn't build immunity to this disease, so if Duff picks up this pathogen again, he'll need treatment again.\nKeep it Clean\nIt takes 24 to 48 hours for an infected tick to pass the bacteria to its host. That means you can help decrease the odds your pup becomes infected by performing a thorough check of him after he's been outside. Look for and remove any attached ticks from Duff promptly to minimize any chance of infection. Using a topical acaricide vastly decreases his chance of getting a tick bite. Finally, keeping his outside environment free of brush and yard debris discourages ticks from taking up residence near your home.\n- Iowa State University Center for Food Security and Health: Ehrlichiosis and Anaplasmosis: Zoonotic Species\n- Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association: Zoonosis Update: Ehrlichiosis and Related Infections\n- Handbook for Zoonotic Diseases of Companion Animals; edited by Glenda Dvorak et al\n- Companion Animal Parasite Council: Ehrlichia SPP and Anaplasma SPP\n- Veterinary Partner: Ehrlichia Infection in Dogs\n- Medline Plus: Granulocyte\n- Centers for Disease Control: Ehrlichiosis","Lyme disease is the most common illness transmitted by ticks. It’s a bacterial infection, which makes its way into the bloodstream through bites. Both humans and dogs are vulnerable to Lyme disease, and the illness can trigger a range of unpleasant symptoms including fever and swollen joints. Lyme disease can usually be treated with a course of antibiotics.\nBoth dogs and their owners are particularly vulnerable to Lyme disease in the summer months, when young ticks are most prevalent. This means that now is the perfect time to make yourself aware of Lyme disease symptoms to watch out for, and find out how you can help to prevent it.\nLyme disease is caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, and is usually carried by the eastern black-legged tick (also known as the “deer tick” or “bear tick”). The bacterium is a spiral shaped microorganism, which is harboured in the tick’s digestive system, and can enter the bloodstream of its host animal through a bite. Ticks themselves are thought to pick up the disease through feeding on mice and other rodents during the larval stage of their lifecycle.\nTicks pose a risk to humans and dogs throughout the US and much of the world, but the following US areas have particularly high rates of Lyme disease:\n- The Northeast\n- The Upper Midwest\n- The Pacific coast\nGenerally, ticks must be attached to their host for 36 to 48 hours before Lyme disease can be transmitted. Because of this, the disease is actually quite preventable if owners are vigilant. Most cases of Lyme disease are caused by bites from immature ticks, which are called nymphs. This is because their small size – only around 2 millimetres (just under a tenth of an inch) – makes them very difficult to see, meaning they’re more likely to stick around for the 36 hours required for Lyme disease infection. There is currently no evidence that Lyme disease can be transmitted through any means other than tick bites. If your dog does contract the disease, it will not be spread to you through contact with them. Similarly, if you contract Lyme disease, you won’t be at risk of spreading it to other humans or your pets.\nIf Lyme disease does manage to enter an animal’s bloodstream, it tends to gather around the joints, so swelling in these areas can be a good indication that Lyme disease might be present.\nLyme disease has quite a wide range of unpleasant symptoms in both humans and their canine companions. If your dog exhibits one or more of the following symptoms, Lyme disease could be the culprit:\nLike many infections, Lyme disease raises the body’s temperature, which makes antibodies more effective at fighting the bacteria. This change can sometimes manifest itself as a fever.\n- Loss of appetite\nLoss of appetite can be another sign of infection in animals. Sometimes their bodies attempt to purge themselves of the infective agent, and part of the process involves reducing food intake.\n- Lethargy and tiredness\nWhen an animal’s body is busy fighting off infection, little energy is left over for activities they usually find enjoyable. Dogs who have contracted Lyme disease are far less likely to enjoy their usual games and walks, and will probably sleep more.\n- Stiffness, discomfort, or general pain\nLyme disease can also cause some flu-like symptoms, including achy muscles. If your dog is unusually stiff or appears to be experiencing pain – especially in the summer months – the disease could be at play.\n- Swollen joints\nAs mentioned earlier, Lyme disease bacteria tend to gather around the joints when they enter an animal’s bloodstream. The body’s immune system will try to fight off the invading microorganisms, and the chemicals involved can cause the area to swell and become inflamed. If your dog appears unwell, check to see whether their joints are swollen, as this is one of the biggest indicators that they may have contracted Lyme disease.\n- Kidney failure\nIn extreme cases of Lyme disease, a dog’s kidneys can fail, which sometimes proves fatal. This is due to the strain put on the organs as they attempt to process the toxins associated with the bacterial infection.\n- Cardiac issues\nIt’s very rare, but in some cases Lyme disease can also affect the heart’s function in a variety of ways, including arrhythmia and heart disease. Dogs suffering from heart conditions might exhibit symptoms such as coughing, shortness of breath, and tiredness.\nIf your dog is suffering from one or more of these symptoms, you should consult a veterinary professional as soon as possible.\nTo predict the development of Lyme disease, you could check your dog carefully for ticks, or signs of bites. If you do come across a tick, it can be sent by your vet for analysis, to find out whether it’s a member of the Lyme disease spreading black-legged family, and if so whether it is infected with Lyme disease. If the tick is found to harbor the disease, your vet may suggest pre-emptive Lyme disease treatment, such as a course of antibiotics.\nWhen your dog shows some of these symptoms, or you suspect they have been bitten by a tick, your vet will probably want to test for Lyme disease. Luckily, Lyme disease is fairly easy to identify through the C6 test, which can be carried out either in-clinic, or by sending a blood sample away for laboratory analysis.\nThe tests work by checking for the presence antibodies which work against the “C6” protein – a protein uniquely present in Borrelia burgdorferi bacteria. Antibodies generally develop in a dog’s body three to five weeks after the initial tick bite, and their presence in the bloodstream suggests that your dog’s immune system has been attempting to fight off Lyme disease.\nIf the results of the C6 test are positive, your vet will proceed to carry out the Quant C6 test. As its name suggests, this test determines the quantity of C6 antibodies present in the dog’s blood. If the concentration is relatively low, your dog is unlikely to require treatment, but at higher concentrations they could benefit from medical intervention.\nIf the initial test for C6 antibodies proves positive, your vet will probably need additional blood samples, as well as a urine sample. This will help to determine whether the dog’s kidneys have been damaged by Lyme disease, which would be suggested by the presence protein in their urine. This indicates that the kidneys are not carrying out their proper function of breaking down waste products before they leave the body.\nChecking for kidney damage is essential, since this is a potentially fatal issue which Lyme disease can trigger, and should be treated as swiftly as possible.\nSurprisingly, some dogs can carry Lyme disease without actually showing any symptoms. This means it’s sometimes difficult to know whether treatment would be worthwhile or even necessary. Your vet will be able to advise you based on your dog’s unique symptoms and medical history, but the decision is usually influenced by the following factors.\n- The quantity of C6 protein in their bloodstream\nIf the Quant C6 test reveals that your dog has moderate to high levels of the protein in their bloodstream, your vet is more likely to recommend that treatment is pursued. Conversely, if the concentration is low, they may decide against it.\nIf your dog has been displaying one or more of the symptoms closely linked to Lyme disease, such as swollen joints or stiffness, a positive C6 test would support the argument for treating the animal.\n- Medical history\nIf your dog has exhibited similar symptoms within the past year, Lyme disease is more likely to be the culprit, since it can stick around in the body for fairly long periods of time, and periodically flare up in some cases.\n- Urine sample results\nIf the presence of protein in a dog’s urine is found alongside C6 antibodies in their bloodstream, your vet is very likely to recommend treatment. This is because the combination of these indicators suggests that Lyme disease is causing some fairly serious problems in your dog’s body.\nSome vets might be reluctant to treat Lyme disease without symptoms for a number of reasons. Firstly, the over-use of antibiotics is a serious issue which has resulted in some harmful bacteria developing a resistance. Additionally, if your dog tests positive the presence of C6 antibodies, especially in low concentrations, it can be difficult to tell whether the bacteria are still present, or if the antibodies are simply left over from a previous infection which went undetected. Finally, since symptoms only develop in around 10% of dogs who contract Lyme disease, treating a symptomless illness could put unnecessary stress on the dog and owner, as well as incurring unnecessary costs.\nIf your vet does decide to treat your dog for Lyme disease, they will likely suggest:\n- Antibiotics, most commonly doxycycline and amoxicillin. Symptoms should begin to improve within 24 to 48 hours, and the course will usually last for around 30 days.\n- If necessary, kidney treatment. This could include intravenous fluid therapy, and drugs.\n- Depending on symptoms and severity, additional treatment. For instance, if inflammation has been an issue and anti-inflammatory drug might be prescribed.\nOnce treatment has been completed, your vet might decide to carry out another Quant C6 test, and require another blood sample. If treatment has been successful, you can expect to see a significant reduction in the quantity of C6 antibodies in your dog’s bloodstream. This result, combined with the improvement or alleviation of symptoms are key indicators that the treatment has done its job.\nAs mentioned earlier, Lyme disease is fairly preventable, since as far as we know it can only be transmitted through tick bites. To protect both yourself and your best friend against the illness, you should try to prevent these bites, and endeavour to catch them as early as possible when they do happen. To decrease the likelihood that your dog will be bitten, you can:\n- Use a spot-on treatment on your dog’s coat. These will repel and kill both ticks and fleas, and each application can remain effective for up to a month.\n- Consider an oral anti-tick medication. These pills are usually given once a month, and kill ticks and immature fleas in your dog’s coat.\n- Wash your dog with an anti-tick shampoo every now and again, especially in the spring and summer.\n- Keep your lawn and any bushes or hedges in your garden or yard well-trimmed, as this reduces the tick populations.\n- Consider treating your home for ticks with an anti-flea and tick spray.\n- Try applying a tick spray to your dog’s coat between shampoos, to ensure they’re kept at bay.\n- Avoid long walks through long grass and brush if possible, since these environments are ideal for ticks hoping to find hosts. They cannot jump or fly, but will crawl to the top of tall plants and try to crawl onto animals as they brush past.\n- Thoroghly check your dog for ticks after walks, especially in the spring and summer.\nFinding and Removing Ticks\nTicks can be tricky to spot on your dog, especially the tiny nymphs. Here are a few tips for finding and removing ticks:\n- Brush your fingers through your dog’s hair rather than using a comb; you’ll be able to feel any bumps which could be ticks more easily.\n- Make sure you check between the toes, behind the ears, under their limbs, and around the tail and head.\n- Be careful when removing ticks, as parts can sometimes break off and remain embedded in the skin.\n- To remove a tick, use tweezers, gripping it very close to the skin, before pulling it away gently. Do not burst its body, as this will increase the risk of Lyme disease infection.\n- Always wear rubber gloves to protect yourself from Lyme disease when removing a tick from your dog.\n- If you are unsure about removing a tick, consult your vet. They will be able to do so safely and effectively, and possibly teach you how to do so for future reference.\n- Remove any ticks within 24 hours to minimize the risk of infection.\n- How to treat Lyme disease in Dogs, Pet MD\n- Lyme Disease in Dogs: Symptoms, Tests, Treatment, and Prevention, American Kennel Club\n- Lyme disease in Dogs, Pet Health Network"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:4749f6e5-0e83-49ab-91dc-4abed856055f>","<urn:uuid:d4528c7d-72fa-4c11-8cae-536582946c39>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I'm researching advanced manufacturing methods. How does additive manufacturing compare to traditional methods in terms of production flexibility, and what sustainable materials are being developed for this technology?","answer":"Additive manufacturing offers superior production flexibility compared to traditional methods like injection molding - it enables design freedom with no restrictions on geometric complexity, allows part consolidation to reduce assembly components, and can produce different product iterations (materials, colors, sizes) within days versus weeks or months for traditional methods. Regarding sustainable materials, biodegradable bioplastics are being developed from renewable sources like corn starch and sugarcane. These materials are not only environmentally friendly with faster decomposition times, but also maintain high-quality print outputs similar to traditional plastics while being less toxic during the printing process.","context":["Additive manufacturing is the industrial name for 3D printing, both involving fabricating products by adding material, usually in layers. Rapid innovation in additive technology has advanced it from being primarily used for prototyping to manufacturing production-ready parts and altering business models. For companies that are planning to launch new products, reevaluating their production approach with 3D printing technology can provide significant advantages. Additive manufacturing is modernizing manufacturing, bringing new products to market faster, and enabling greater supply chain flexibility.\nCommon Misconceptions of 3D Printing\n3D printing technology has been around for nearly 40 years. However, many companies still do not fully understand the wide range of benefits of 3D printing from prototyping to full production.\nFor example, many don’t realize that prototypes can go straight into production—no retooling or redesigns are necessary to increase output when there is more demand. Contrast this with a traditional process like injection molding, which often requires significant prototype redesign and new tooling for production or higher volumes. With four decades of advancements, modern additive manufacturing has developed durable, high-quality materials to create products that rival, and even surpasses, those made using traditional methods.\nCompanies leveraging 3D printing solutions can make higher quality parts at a faster pace than with traditional methods. Additive manufacturing offers several distinct advantages, which easily outweigh the potential disadvantages, as outlined below.\nAdditive Manufacturing Pros and Cons\n-Combining parts to simplify assembly\n-Eliminate tooling costs\n-Accelerate products to market\n-Streamline prototyping to high-volume production\n-Easier to scale-up\n|-Cost for end part can be higher than injection molding for high-volume production of the same part|\nPros of Additive Manufacturing\nAdditive manufacturing has no restrictions on the shape of geometric complexity. Because 3D printing can produce any shape in any orientation, designers do not have to compromise on form for manufacturability. A common phrase heard in the additive manufacturing market is “design freedom.”\nReduction of Assemblies\nWhen designers understand the capabilities of 3D printing, they can harness the flexibility to reduce the number of parts in an assembly. Manufacturing a complex manifold assembly using traditional methods may require many parts to get to the final form. A version of the same manifold designed for 3D printing can reduce the assembly down to one part. This concept can apply to many parts and products across industries.\nEliminate Tooling Costs\nTraditionally, some of the biggest challenges with initial manufacturing stages are tooling costs. Conventional injection molding techniques require high upfront costs to create the molds necessary for manufacturing and assemble the parts for the final product. These steps involve a great amount of risk, both in the capital investment and large inventory of injection molded products.\n3D printing doesn’t use molds. Instead, a digital design guides the 3D printer to create the parts directly, eliminating tooling expenses and unnecessary inventory with traditional manufacturing. Businesses that leverage on-demand 3D printing for production can significantly reduce or eliminate inventory costs and improve capital efficiency and profitability.\nAccelerate Products to Market\nEliminating tooling and test runs with new molds also reduces product turnaround time. For instance, even when creating simple parts, injection molding often takes 12-16 weeks to complete the entire process. Factor in potential supply chain issues, and this time can be significantly longer.\nAdditive manufacturing greatly reduces the production time by providing a one-step printing process. Furthermore, with 3D printing, production can occur anywhere the 3D printing machines are located. Organizations can find or set up convenient Smart Factory locations closer to their markets and customers to reduce logistics costs and complexity as well as accelerate redesign to production cycles. Shortening turnaround time from four months to one to two weeks, allows businesses to introduce products to market more efficiently and reliably.\nStreamline Prototyping to High-Volume Production\nMolds used for prototyping are not built for high-volume production and sometimes the product needs to be redesigned for high volume production. With modern 3D printers, companies can easily accelerate from initial prototyping to high-volume production on the same machine.\nAdditive manufacturing’s lower costs, and capability to produce prototypes and production parts without tooling, make it easy to adopt for low-volume production. As product demand increases, companies can then decide to scale with industrial high-throughput 3D printers or a Smart Factory.\nEasier to Scale-up\nWhen companies have access to a 3D printer or 3D-printer-enabled smart factory, they can scale instantly and as needed. With traditional manufacturing methods, making different product iterations (e.g., altered materials, colors, sizes, etc.) could take weeks and even months. In contrast, additive manufacturing can produce these models in a market-ready form within a matter of days.\nCons of Additive Manufacturing\nAdditive manufacturing offers various advantages compared to traditional methods such as injection molding. However, for high-volume production of simple parts, injection molding is often the most economical option.\nMany companies invest in steel production molds when producing the exact same single part at high volume. Injection molding is also suitable if the final product does not require a lot of manual overhead or significant transportation costs for assembly.\nAs industries shift to take advantage of 3D printing technologies, such as in custom or complex products, additive manufacturing will increasingly become the primary choice for manufacturing. Enabling greater design freedom and supply chain optimization for a broad range of industries, additive manufacturing is becoming widely adopted in dental and is making an impact in footwear, medical, and consumer applications.\nAdditive Manufacturing Pros and Cons: Beyond the Research\nAdditive manufacturing is reducing production costs, accelerating products to market, and allowing more design freedom and supply chain flexibility. Although conventional manufacturing methods may be the best option economically for certain products, additive manufacturing’s fast-evolving technology and globally distributed Smart Factory production is creating more opportunities for process efficiencies, innovative products, and new business models.","biodegradable resin 3d printer\nbiodegradable resin 3d printer, also known as a sustainable or eco-friendly 3D printer, is a revolutionary technology that aims to address the environmental concerns associated with traditional 3D printing. This article will delve into the concept of biodegradable resin 3d printers, their advantages, applications, and potential future developments.\nThe conventional 3D printing process involves the use of various plastic filaments, such as ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene) and PLA (Polylactic Acid), which are non-biodegradable. These filaments, when discarded, contribute significantly to plastic waste, which takes hundreds of years to decompose. biodegradable resin 3d printers, on the other hand, utilize an alternative type of filament made from eco-friendly materials that can break down naturally over time.\nOne commonly used material for biodegradable resin 3d printers is bioplastics. Bioplastics are derived from renewable sources such as corn starch, sugarcane, and other plant-based materials. These materials not only decompose faster but also have a lower carbon footprint compared to traditional plastics. Bioplastics, once used as filaments in 3D printers, can degrade within a few months to a few years, depending on the specific material used.\nThe advantages of using biodegradable resin 3d printers go beyond the sustainability aspect. Bioplastics have similar physical properties to traditional plastics, allowing for high-quality print outputs. They are also less toxic and emit fewer harmful gases when melted, making the printing process safer for users and the environment. Furthermore, biodegradable resin 3d printers can contribute to the circular economy by promoting the use of recyclable and compostable materials.\nThe applications of biodegradable resin 3d printers are vast and diverse. One significant area is product prototyping, where designers and engineers can create three-dimensional models quickly and efficiently. biodegradable resin 3d printers are also used in the medical field for producing customized, biocompatible implants, prosthetics, and surgical models. Additionally, they are utilized in the fashion industry to create sustainable accessories, such as jewelry and footwear.\nAs the demand for eco-friendly alternatives increases, the development of biodegradable resins and biodegradable resin 3d printers continues to evolve. Researchers are exploring new materials that are not only biodegradable but also possess enhanced mechanical properties for a wider range of applications. Efforts are also being made to improve the printing speed and resolution of biodegradable resin 3d printers to compete with traditional printing methods.\nThe future of biodegradable resin 3d printers looks promising. As technology advances, it is possible that biodegradable resin-based materials will become the mainstream choice for 3D printing. In addition, the integration of sustainable manufacturing processes with biodegradable resin 3d printers may lead to the development of fully circular production systems, reducing waste and minimizing the environmental impact of manufacturing.\nIn conclusion, biodegradable resin 3d printers offer a sustainable and eco-friendly solution to the environmental challenges posed by traditional 3D printing. The utilization of biodegradable materials, such as bioplastics, not only reduces plastic waste but also maintains the quality and functionality required for various applications. As the technology continues to advance, biodegradable resin 3d printers have the potential to revolutionize industries and contribute to a greener future."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:be5d4239-c7dc-41ba-8a19-c006f5cb6b8d>","<urn:uuid:88aae5a4-54d8-4813-bff9-d9c1f2684c52>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How cleaning blood spills with bleach compare to PEP medicine side effects - which safety measure has more complications?","answer":"PEP medication has more significant complications compared to cleaning blood spills. PEP commonly causes side effects like nausea, headaches, fatigue, vomiting and diarrhea, making it difficult for some people to complete the month-long treatment. In contrast, blood spill cleaning procedures mainly require protective measures (gloves, eye protection, apron), followed by cleaning with water, detergent and bleach solution, with the main precaution being to avoid direct contact with the substances.","context":["Handling blood and other body substances\nTo minimise the risk of spread of infection, all blood and body substances should be treated as potentially infectious. The techniques used in handling these substances are known as standard precautions.\nStandard precautions are recommended in the handling of:\n- blood, including dried blood\n- all other body substances including saliva, urine and faeces (but excluding sweat), regardless of whether they contain visible blood\n- broken skin\n- mucous membranes (lining of nose, mouth and genitals).\nStandard precautions are good hygiene practices relating to hand hygiene, the use of gloves and other protective clothing (as appropriate), and the safe disposal of waste.\nManaging exposure to blood or other body substances\nIf any person has contact with blood or body fluids, the following procedures should be observed:\n- remove contaminated clothing\n- if blood or body fluids get on the skin, irrespective of whether there are cuts or abrasions, wash well with soap and water\n- if the eyes are splashed, rinse the area gently but thoroughly with water while the eyes are open\n- if blood or body fluid gets in the mouth, spit it out and rinse the mouth with water several times, spitting the water out each time.\nIncidents occurring during or after work hours should be reported immediately to:\n- the supervisor or work, health and safety representative for exposures in the workplace\n- a doctor or emergency department for exposures outside of work\nPotential blood borne virus exposure\nIf a person thinks he or she has been exposed to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or hepatitis B, for further information he or she can:\n- contact their local doctor\n- contact a sexual health clinic\n- visit an emergency department\n- for HIV exposures, call the South Australian 24 hour Post Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP) triage hotline on 1800 022 226.\nIf a potential HIV or hepatitis B exposure occurs in the workplace, the PEP assessment should be provided through the work, health and safety procedures for the workplace.\nPost Exposure Prophylaxis\n- prevent the development of infection\n- make the infection less severe\n- reduce the risk of the infection being passed on to other people.\nPEP needs to begin as soon as possible after exposure to be effective.\nPEP for hepatitis B consists of:\n- immunoglobulin (a solution containing human antibodies that is made from blood products) and\n- three hepatitis B vaccinations over 6 months\nPEP for HIV consists of a 28 day course of medication (anti-retroviral).\nSurface cleaning of blood and body substances\nIf blood or body fluids are spilled on surfaces, the following cleaning procedures should be used:\n- Deal with the spill as soon as possible.\n- Protect yourself by wearing disposable rubber gloves.

It is the virus that can lead to acquired immune deficiency syndrome, or AIDS.• PEP involves taking anti-HIV drugs as soon as possible after having been exposed• To be effective, PEP must begin within 72 hours after exposure, before the virus has the time rapidly replicate in your body• PEP consists of 2-3 anti-HIV medications taken every day for 1 month\nPEP means Post-Exposure Prophylaxis• Prophylaxis means disease prevention• PEP involves taking anti-HIV drugs as soon as possible after you may have been exposed to HIV to try to reduce the chance of becoming HIV positive; occupational PEP (health-care setting) and non-occupational PEP (condom breakage, sexual assault, etc.)• The medications may have side effects that can make it difficult to finish the program. PEP is not 100% effective; it does not guarantee that someone exposed to HIV will not become infected with HIV.\nWho needs PEP?• PEP is usually used for anyone who may have been exposed to HIV.• Healthcare workers have the greatest risk. They can be exposed to HIV by: – Needle sticks or cuts – Getting blood or other body fluids in their eyes or mouth – Getting blood or other body fluids on their skin when it is scraped, or affected by dermatitis• The risk of HIV transmission in these ways is low—less than 1% for each exposure\nWhy can’t PEP therapy be taken after72 hours from the point of exposure?• HIV grows faster and faster once it enters your body.• If you start taking PEP more than 72 hours after exposure, the meds can’t keep up, and research has shown that PEP has little or no effect in preventing HIV infection after the 72-hour mark.• Better if PEP starts within 6 hours from injury\nDifferent kind of exposure• Exposure to a large amount of blood.• Blood came in contact with cuts or open sores on the skin.• Blood was visible on a needle that stuck someone.• Exposure to blood from someone who has a high viral load (a large amount of virus in the blood).• For serious exposures, it is recommended using a combination of three drugs for four weeks. For less serious exposure, the guidelines recommend treatment with two drugs for four weeks: AZT and 3TC\nTwo drug regimens• AZT and 3TC: Zidovudine 300 mg BID + Lamivudine 150 mg BID or Combivir 1 Tab BID +• FTC and TDF: Emtricitabine 200 mg OD + Tenofovir 300 mg OD or Truvada 1 Tab OD\nThree drug regimens• Combivir BID or Truvada OD• Associated with: – Lopinavir 400 mg and Ritonavir 100 mg BID: Kaletra 2 tabs BID or – Atazanavir 300 mg OD + Ritonavir 100 mg OD: Reyataz 300 mg OD and Norvir 100 mg OD\nCombivir/Kaletra +BD: twice a day regimen; 6 Tabs a day\nTruvada/Reyataz/Norvir OD: once a day regimen; 3 Tabs a day\nWHAT ARE THE SIDE EFFECTS?• The most common side effects from PEP medications are nausea and generally not feeling well.• Other possible side effects include headaches, fatigue, vomiting and diarrhea.\nPrevention strategies• Health care workers should assume that the blood and other body fluids from all patients are potentially infectious. They should therefore follow infection control precautions at all times.• Routinely using barriers (such as gloves and/ or goggles) when anticipating contact with blood or body fluids,• Immediately washing hands and other skin surfaces after contact with blood or body fluids, and• Carefully handling and disposing of sharp instruments during and after use.\nDisposal containers• Safety devices have been developed to help prevent needle-stick injuries. If used properly, these types of devices may reduce the risk of exposure to HIV.• Many percutaneous injuries, such as needle- sticks and cuts, are related to sharps disposal. Strategies for safer disposal, including safer design of disposal containers and placement of containers, are being developed.\nConclusions• Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is the use of anti-HIV drugs as soon as possible after exposure to HIV, to prevent HIV infection. PEP can reduce the rate of infection in health care workers exposed to HIV by 79%.• The benefits of PEP for non-occupational exposure have not been proven. This use of PEP is controversial because some people fear it will encourage unsafe behaviors.\nTHANK YOU!free download from www.slideshare.net"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"language-ambiguous"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:a5f94212-1da0-4faa-a08a-6382b8fd9f7d>","<urn:uuid:6fd285a7-4fd2-4241-8579-b4517a97b0b8>"],"error":null}

Low-risk areas include the developed countries of North America, Central Europe, Australia, and Japan.\nWhat causes traveler's diarrhea?\nTraveler's diarrhea is usually caused by a bacterial infection. Bacteria such as Escherichia coli (E. coli), Campylobacter, Shigella, or Salmonella are the most common causes. These bacteria are in water contaminated by human or animal stools. Drinking water, water used to wash food, or irrigation water may be affected. When the traveler drinks this water or eats contaminated food, he or she is likely to get diarrhea.\nCommon sources of bacteria that cause diarrhea are undercooked or raw foods, contaminated food, or contaminated water (including ice cubes).\nWhat are the symptoms of traveler's diarrhea?\nTraveler's diarrhea can be mild to severe. Most people who develop traveler's diarrhea experience symptoms within the first 2 weeks, and often within 2 to 3 days, of arriving in a developing area. Symptoms include:\n- Abdominal cramps.\n- Mild to severe dehydration .\n- General lack of energy, nausea, and vomiting.\n- Fever, vomiting, and stools with blood or mucus. These symptoms mean you have serious diarrhea, which is more likely to lead to problems with dehydration. Dehydration may alter the effect of any medicines being taken, such as oral contraceptives or antimalarials.\nHow is traveler's diarrhea treated?\nTreatment for traveler's diarrhea includes drinking fluids to avoid dehydration, taking nonprescription medicines, and in some cases, antibiotics and intravenous (IV) fluids.\n- Let your stomach rest. Do not eat for several hours or until you are feeling better.\n- Take frequent, small sips of bottled or boiled water or a rehydration drink and small bites of salty crackers.\n- If possible, drink a solution made with World Health Organization (WHO) oral rehydration salts. Packets of the salts are available at stores and pharmacies in most developing countries. Add one packet to boiled or treated water, making sure to read the instructions regarding the proper amounts of salts and water. Drink the solution within 12 hours if kept at room temperature, or within 24 hours if refrigerated.\n- Begin eating a simple diet of bland foods, such as crackers, rice, bread, potatoes, or bananas, which usually will help slow diarrhea. After your diarrhea is gone, you may eat a regular diet again.\nChildren 2 years old or younger are at high risk of dehydration from diarrhea. If your child has diarrhea:\n- Give your child a solution of WHO rehydration salts in addition to his or her regular food as long as diarrhea continues. If your baby has trouble keeping the liquids down, try giving frequent sips by spoon.\n- Continue breastfeeding normally. Bottle-fed babies should continue their usual formula.\n- Feed your child starches, cereals, yogurt, fruits, and vegetables.\n- Seek medical help immediately if you or your child has bloody diarrhea, fever, or persistent vomiting, and give rehydration fluids in the meantime.\nNonprescription medicines may help treat diarrhea. Use nonprescription antidiarrheal medicine if you do not have other signs of illness, such as fever, abdominal cramping or discomfort, or bloody stools. If you have fever, bloody stools, or vomiting, antibiotics may be needed.\nBismuth subsalicylate, or BSS (such as Pepto-Bismol or Kaopectate), has been shown to be effective in preventing and treating traveler's diarrhea. It is usually not recommended for treatment in children younger than age 12 years. Bismuth subsalicylates may reduce the effectiveness of medicines taken to prevent malaria, should not be used for more than 3 weeks, and should not be taken by those who can't take aspirin. They may cause you to have a black tongue or black stools. The black color is usually not serious. Brushing your teeth and tongue after taking a BSS may keep your tongue from turning black.\nIf your child or teen gets chickenpox or flu , do not treat the symptoms with over-the-counter medicines that contain bismuth subsalicylate or aspirin (such as Pepto-Bismol, Kaopectate, or Alka-Seltzer). If your child has taken this kind of medicine and he or she has changes in behavior with nausea and vomiting, call your doctor. These symptoms could be an early sign of Reye syndrome , a rare but serious illness.\nNonprescription medicines to slow diarrhea, such as loperamide (for example, Imodium), may be used to treat diarrhea but should not be used to prevent traveler's diarrhea because they can cause constipation.\nIf you have a high-risk medical condition such as diabetes or cancer, you take prescription medicines that cause diarrhea, or you are traveling with a child 11 years old or younger, seek advice from your doctor to determine what medicines you may want to take on your trip. Be aware that dehydration caused by diarrhea may alter the effectiveness of any medicines you are taking for other medical conditions.\nCan I prevent traveler's diarrhea?\nThe best way to prevent traveler's diarrhea is to avoid food or water that may be contaminated. A good rule of thumb for food safety is, \"If it's not boiled, well-cooked, or peeled, don't eat it.\" Raw seafood and milk products usually are high-risk foods for bacterial contamination. Dry foods, such as breads, or fruits that you can peel are safe to eat.\nAvoid drinking local water where you are traveling. Beverages that are usually safe to drink include:\n- Tea and coffee if made with boiled water.\n- Carbonated bottled water or soda pop.\n- Bottled beer and wine.\nWater also can be filtered or treated with iodine to make it safe to drink.\nAlso, be aware that contaminated water may be used to wash fruits and vegetables, clean utensils and plates, and make ice cubes. Brushing your teeth with untreated water also may increase your risk of infection.\nAvoid eating food from street vendors where flies can transmit bacteria and poor hygiene practices are more likely to contaminate foods. If you purchase food at an outdoor market, make sure you boil it, cook it thoroughly, or peel it before you eat it.\nGood hand-washing is important in preventing the spread of infectious diseases. Washing with treated water or using alcohol wipes or antibacterial gels to disinfect your hands are good ways to reduce your risk of getting an infectious disease.\nTalk with your doctor about antibiotics you can carry with you on your trip and instructions on when to use them just in case you should develop diarrhea.\nOther information sources\nIn the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) maintains current information on infectious diseases around the world. Local health departments can access this information to help you determine what prevention measures-such as vaccines, antimalarial medicine, or supplies to treat water-are appropriate for the area of the world you are traveling to. The CDC website (www.cdc.gov/travel/default.aspx) also updates information for travelers.\nResources for medical care in a foreign country include embassies or consulates and major hotels. For English-speaking travelers, multinational corporations or credit card companies also may have referrals for local medical care in the foreign country.\nPrimary Medical Reviewer E.

{"question":"How do intentionally added microplastics compare to unintentionally formed microplastics in terms of their environmental impact?","answer":"Intentionally added microplastics represent about 10-15 percent of the total microplastics in the environment, while unintentionally formed microplastics from sources like wear and tear of larger plastics and car tires account for a much larger portion. In the European Union alone, intentionally added microplastics release about 42,000 tonnes per year, while unintentionally formed microplastics release around 176,000 tonnes annually to surface waters. While intentionally added microplastics may be a smaller portion, they significantly impact aquatic life, affecting processes like mortality, development, reproduction, and metabolism in marine species.","context":["Researchers have found that low-grade silk can replace intentionally used microplastics in cosmetics, vitamins, agricultural chemicals and paints, offering a biodegradable, non-toxic alternative to pollution.\nAs microplastics continue polluting our planet’s seas and oceans, ubiquitous in their use from cosmetics to agricultural chemicals, a team of scientists offer a way out.\nA team of international scientists devised a silk-based system that could offer an inexpensive and easily manufactured microplastics substitute. The MIT scientists, led by the researchers, describe their process in a paper published in the journal Small.\nMicroplastics used in today’s products generally serve the purpose of protection of an active ingredient or ingredients from interacting with air or moisture before they are meant to be released. They ensure “a slow release of the active ingredient for a targeted period of time, and minimise negative effects to its surroundings,” a news release notes.\nAmong the products benefitting from microplastics’ ability for timed release are vitamins, delivered in the form of microcapsules packed into a pill or capsule, and pesticides and herbicides that slowly release deadly toxins to the environment. All of these products use microplastics that do not naturally biodegrade and remain in nature as pollutants for as long as decades. Until now, there were no naturally biodegradable microplastics substitutes that also met the criteria of being practical and inexpensive.\nIn small doses\n“Microplastics are small plastic pieces less than five millimetres long which can be harmful to our ocean and aquatic life,” explains the US National Ocean Service.\nMicroplastics have infiltrated the air, water and soil worldwide and “pos[e] a potential threat to aquatic life,” not to mention human beings and other terrestrials. They have even been found in the bloodstream of animals and people.\nAccording to a 2015 factsheet by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), “Since their appearance in cosmetics 50 years ago, plastics have become widespread in cosmetic and personal care formulations and have replaced natural options.” In addition to cosmetics, microplastics can be found in agricultural chemicals and paints.\nThe same report notes that “A total amount of 4360 tonnes of microplastic beads were used in 2012 across all European Union countries plus Norway and Switzerland according to a survey by Cosmetics Europe, focusing on the use of microplastic beads, with polyethylene beads representing 93 percent of the total amount equaling 4037 tonnes.”\nThe European Chemicals Agency has determined that “Each year around 42 000 tonnes of microplastics end up in the environment when products containing them are used.” Moreover, there is also microplastics that emerge from the wear and tear on regular-sized plastics: “In addition, the releases of unintentionally formed microplastics (when larger pieces of plastic wear and tear) are estimated to be around 176 000 tonnes a year to the European surface waters.”\nThe European Union (EU) has declared that the added microplastics must be eliminated by 2025, spurring companies and individuals to search for suitable replacements that do not take a toll on nature.\nWhile it is a fact that a big portion of microplastics that pollute the environment originate from other sources, such as the degradation over time of larger plastic objects such as bottles and packaging, and from the wear of car tires.\nMIT professor of civil and environmental engineering Benedetto Marelli says each source may require its own kind of solutions to reduce its spread.\nThe European Chemical Agency has estimated that the intentionally added microplastics (excluding the breakdown of larger plastics) represent about 10 to 15 percent of the total amount in the environment, but this source may be “relatively easy to address” using the silk-based biodegradable replacement, Marelli notes.\n“We cannot solve the whole microplastics problem with one solution that fits them all,” he says. “Ten percent of a big number is still a big number. … We’ll solve climate change and pollution of the world one percent at a time.”\nThe plus side of this approach is that the silk needed to replace intentionally added microplastics does not have to be the high-quality silk that is used for fine fabrics. It is “widely available and less expensive,” MIT postdoc Muchun Liu says.\nFor high-quality textiles, silkworm cocoons must be unwound without breakage; yet as replacement for microplastics, non-textile-quality cocoons can be used. The inferior quality cocoons can be harvested using existing manufacturing equipment, and can be produced worldwide, Marelli says, instead of relying on just China, which is the origin of much of textile-quality silk.\nBeing non-toxic, silk is safe for food and medical use, degrading naturally in the body. The researchers used standard spray-based manufacturing equipment to produce a water-soluble microencapsulated herbicide in lab conditions. After testing in a greenhouse on a corn crop, they found that it worked even better than an existing commercial product, “inflicting less damage” to the plants, Liu says.\nLiu explains that silk is a flexible-use material whose polymer chain arrangements can be adjusted before a surfactant is added, offering different types of coatings once they dry out and harden: the coatings can be hydrophilic (water-attracting) or hydrophobic (water-repelling) regardless of its production process which involves the silk fibres being teased out in a water solution.\nLiu observed the droplets of encapsulated materials as they formed, saying, “To encapsulate different materials, we have to study how the polymer chains interact and whether they are compatible with different active materials in suspension.”\nAccording to the researchers, the new method can utilise low-grade silk that is subpar and cannot be used for fabrics, as well as discarded silk or fabric left over from silk garment production.\nSource: TRTWorld and agencies\nWise (formerly TransferWise) is the cheaper, easier way to send money abroad.

The separation of microplastics from other particles is difficult and limited. Mainly in underdeveloped and developing countries, according to (European Chemicals Agency, 2019) more than around 87% of the microplastics end up in biologically active sludge and aquatic environments (European Chemicals Agency, 2019), (Yurtsever, 2019b, 2019a), (Hidayaturrahman and Lee, 2019), (Li et al., 2020).\nThere are a lot of studies conducted which demonstrate the presence of microplastic particles literally everywhere: in the air we breathe, in bottled and tap water, in foodstuff like salt, in home dust and almost everywhere in the aquatic environment (surface, mildwater, benthos), in freshwater systems. Furthermore, it was detected that there are microplastic particles in all forms of marine species: from tiny organisms to predators.\nAccording to (Haegerbaeumer et al., 2019) and (Xu et al., 2020), there is proven effect of microplastics on our environment and life processes like mortality, development, reproduction, behaviour, cellular response, lifespan, egestion, regeneration, air and food consumption, even on metabolism, gene expression, neurotoxicity and carcinogenicity of aquatic species.\nDid you know that resembling the movement and the size of food, microplastics can be consumed by mistakes by zooplankton and small fish. Microplastics can be absorbed by phytoplankton and filter feeders; and by mistake by larger organisms ending up in the intestine. There are issues with photosynthesis function in phytoplankton species. Thus, microplastics are putting the life of microorganisms at a high risk which leads to the problems of the trophic chain.\nIndirect effects of microplastics should be also mentioned here, as they may contain additional harmful additives like phthalates, pigments or heavy metals, plasticizers, alkylphenols for functionality and conservation purposes. However, afterwards, these additives are released to the environment. Also, there are studies on the interaction of microplastics with inorganic pollutants (Xu et al., 2020). These pollutants and harmful additives may be released into the organisms, it happens more easily with small plastic nanoparticles. Nevertheless, detailed research on toxicity, and effects of plastic nanoparticles on the environment and organisms is needed in order to make specific conclusions.\nMoreover, in terms of humans themselves, further studies are needed in order to ensure toxicity of microplastics on the human organism. However, recent findings have shown the presence of microplastics in the human faces (Yan et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). We inhale, swallow and consume microplastics in the direct way through air, water, and seafood.\nThere are significant gaps in analysis and scientific knowledge on the effects of micro- and nanoplastics on human organisms. A lot of researchers are worried about possible harmful effects of nanoplastics, as they are more likely to be absorbed and distributed in our organisms.\nActions against plastic microbeads\nHaving identified possible effects of microplastics on the environment, it can be said that microplastics may pose a greater risk than macroplastics. Therefore, the policies on exclusion of intentionally added microplastics from products (e.g. microbeads from cosmetic products) started by particular countries. In 2012, there started a global pressure against microbeads in cosmetics by NGOs, scientific findings, and intergovernmental organizations. The topic was thoroughly analyzed by environmental consultants and scientific institutes indicating that microbeads are an unnecessary source of plastic pollution.\nThus, in 2014 the state of Illinois was the first to ban non-biodegradable microbeads from personal care products, then 15 States followed this ban. Therefore, “Microbeads Free – Water Act” was introduced by the U.S. prohibiting manufacture (from July 2017) and sales (from July 2018) of intentionally added non-biodegradable plastic microbeads in rinse-off personal care products. Other countries also took actions, for instance, Canada followed the ban prohibiting the manufacture, import, or sale of toiletries containing microbeads.\nIn October 2019, China also introduced a ban to stop the production of household chemical products which contain plastic microbeads as of the 31th of December 2020, the full-scale ban will be implemented in December 2022.\nNon-European countries like New Zealand, South Korea and the Taiwan province have already banned microbeads usage in rinse-off cosmetics. Iceland joined the ban and signed a commitment. India is considering future restrictions. In Brazil the law was introduced in 2016 and approved in 2019, but has not been accepted as a public law yet.\nIn 2015 two out of six states of Australia signed an agreement to phase out microbeads.\nSouth Africa’s government is currently in discussion and consultation with the cosmetic industry for a microbeads’ phase-out in cosmetic products.\nRegarding the European Union, in 2013 Denmark was the first country to propose a European-wide ban on microbeads. A new directive 2014/893/EU published by the European Commission in 2014 prohibited rinse-off cosmetics that contain plastic microbeads to have the Ecolable sign. Therefore, the Netherlands, Austria, Luxemburg, Belgium, and Sweden joined the European ban on microbeads in personal care products. However. The European ban was not the straightforward policy, as it is in the USA and Canada due to the different EU’s structure.\nNordic countries were the pioneers of promoting the microplastics ban in cosmetics. In 2017, a full ban of microplastics in cosmetics was proposed by the Nordic council. In 2018, Sweden added solid plastic particles in cosmetics in the list of prohibited particles. Finnish government had to exclude microbeads in rinse-off cosmetics by June 2020. Norway being a niot full EU member, has prohibited personal care products containing microplastics to bare the Swan label (eco-friendly Nordic product), and the country is considering a full ban. Belgium signed a phase-out agreement with cosmetic industries which had to be implemented by the end of 2019.\nFrance aims to ensure water quality justifying the prohibition of microbeads by using the European Marine Strategy Framework Directive. In 2018, the national law banning microbeads in rinse-off cosmetics was introduced in France. Starting as of 2020, Italy joined the same restriction of microbeads usage in exfoliating and cleansing rinse-off cosmetics.\nThe UK has preferred to join a European-wide ban introducing the ban into the national legislation, UK’s prohibition is one of the strongest and most comprehensive.\nHowever, the microbeads (from 1 nm to 5 mm) phase-out in exfoliating and cleansing rinse-off cosmetics does not seem to be enough and does not lead to a risk reduction. The European Chemical Agency proposed a restriction of all microplastics (other than microbeads) that are added to rinse-off cosmetics to be initiated 4 years after the ban becomes effective and for leave-on cosmetics 6 years respectively.\nTaking everything into consideration, alternative solutions should be developed. BIOWEG is aiming to fully replace plastic microbeads in cosmetic and personal care products offering biodegradable, 100% bio-based microbeads to cosmetic industries.\nKeep following us on social media channels to know more.\nSource: (Anagnosti et al, 2021).\nSource: Anagnosti, L., Varvaresou, A., Pavlou, P., Protopapa, E., & Carayanni, V.

{"question":"What are the nutritional properties of hemp seeds, and how is modern UK agriculture exploring hemp's potential for sustainable farming practices?","answer":"Hemp seeds are highly nutritious, containing 9.47g of protein per 30g serving, all nine essential amino acids, unsaturated fats including alpha-linolenic acid, fiber, vitamins (E and B-6), and minerals like magnesium, potassium, and phosphorus. In terms of modern UK agricultural practices, hemp is being studied through the Innovative Farmers programme, where researchers and farmers are conducting field trials to gather data on its ecological benefits. The crop requires no pesticides or seed treatments, develops a dense canopy that naturally controls weeds, and its deep roots can extract nutrients from depth and make them available for future crops. These properties make it particularly valuable for sustainable farming practices and soil improvement in British agriculture.","context":["Since ancient times, agriculture has played a massive role in human society. It has led to the establishment of ancient states, the improvement of trade and the growth of populations.\nSome of the plants that played a significant role in the ancient world are wheat, peas,rice, and hemp.\nIn this article, we are going to focus on one of the most important plants of the ancient and modern world, hemp. We are going to dive into hemp, specifically looking at the parts of the hemp plant and their uses.\nLet’s dive in.\nHistory of hemp\nTo fully appreciate the modern-day uses of the hemp plant, we need to look at its history. What did people in ancient times use the hemp plant for? Where was it grown? And was it a useful plant?\nAccording to archaeologists, hemp was probably first grown in 8000 BC in ancient Mesopotamia. The oldest hemp remnants were hemp cords used in pottery.\nThe Chinese were among the first ancient societies to recognize the importance of hemp. According to Lu Shi, a historical document from the Song dynasty, Emperor Shen Nung taught his people to grow hemp for cloth. Therefore, it should come as no surprise that China has the longest continuous history of hemp cultivation spanning more than six millennia. Other countries with a long history of Hemp cultivation include France and Russia.\nHemp was also vital to ancient Indian communities. It was so important that it was mentioned in the sacred text, the Atharvaveda, as one of the five sacred plants.\nHistorians believe that Europeans learned of hemp in 1200 BC, and from there it spread to the rest of the ancient world. In North America, historians believe that hemp was present long before the arrival of the Europeans. This theory is supported by the words of Jacques Cartier who said that the land was, “frill of hempe which groweth of itselfe, which is as good as possibly may be scene, and as strong.”\nUses of hemp in the ancient world\nIn the ancient world, the Chinese were pioneers of finding unique ways to use hemp. One of the ways they used it was in the creation of cloth fabric. Archaeologists have found hemp fabric that was dated back to around 8000 BC. The ancient Chinese also used hemp to make ropes, fishnets, as food and in folk remedies.\nIn most folk remedies, they recommended using the leaves, seeds and roots. They were commonly used for painful childbirth, rheumatism, dysentery, and convulsions. The Chinese also discovered how to make paper from hemp.\nHemp was also crucial to the ancient Egyptians as hemp cloth was discovered in the tomb of Pharaoh Alchanaten at El Amarona. During the reign of Ramses III, apothecaries suggested using hemp for ophthalmic reasons.\nIn 1100 BC hemp was essential to the Carthaginians as they used it in their ships, ropes and medicines. Apart from the Carthaginians, Vikings also used hemp in their boats.\nDuring the Middle Ages, hemp had vast social and economic significance because it supplied most of the fibre they used. Hemp was so important that King Henry VIII passed a law in 1535 requiring all landowners to plant hemp on ¼ acre or be fined.\nIn later years, Queen Elizabeth I passed a law requiring landowners with at least 60 acres to plant hemp. Queen Elizabeth’s decision inspired King Philip of Spain to order that hemp be grown all over his empire. During this period, hemp was primarily used to make fibre, Hemp seeds were also cooked and eaten alongside other grains.\nIt would seem that our ancient relatives had a great grasp on the importance of hemp.\nParts of the hemp plant\nNow that we have looked at the history of the hemp plant let's look at the parts of the hemp plant.\nThe significant parts of the hemp plant are the:\nHemp seeds, also known as hemp hearts, are small brown seeds that come from the hemp plant. These seeds have a wide variety of uses such as in food, lotions and shampoo.\nHemp seeds are used as food because they contain a wide variety of nutrients.\n- Proteins- Hemp seeds are an essential source of proteins. According to FoodData Central, in every 30g of hemp seeds (3 tablespoons), there's 9.47g of protein. The average man requires 56g of proteins per day while the average woman requires 46g of proteins per day. This means that the average man would need 18 tablespoons of hemp seeds to get the required daily protein intake. The average woman would need 15 tablespoons of hemp seeds. And the best thing about hemp seeds is that they provide all nine essential amino acids.\n- Unsaturated fats- Hemp seeds are an essential source of alpha-linolenic acid, an essential fatty acid.\n- Fibre- The shell of the hemp seed is an essential source of fibre, and that’s why people are advised to buy hemp seeds with the shell intact. However, even hemp seeds without the shell can provide the body with a significant amount of fibre.\n- Vitamins- Some of the vitamins found in hemp seeds include Vitamin E and Vitamin B-6.\n- Minerals- Some of the minerals found in hemp seeds include magnesium, potassium and phosphorus.\nIf you are into CBD, then you most likely know about hemp flowers. They are produced by mature hemp plants containing high concentrations of flavonoids, terpenes and cannabinoids.\nAccording to research, you can harvest 1000 to 2000 pounds of hemp flowers from a single acre.\nThe hemp flowers are primarily used to produce cannabinoid products for health and wellness products.\nHemp leaves are some of the most popular parts of the hemp plant. They frequently appear in t-shirts, chains and hoodies.\nHemp leaves are primarily dried to create wellness products such as hemp tea and CBD products. You can also eat raw hemp leaves as they can provide you with some essential compounds such as CBDa, terpenes and chlorophyll.\nThe stalks of the hemp plant are some of its most useful parts. There are two important parts of the hemp stalk, the bast and the shiv.\nTo get to the bast, you have to slice the hemp stalk in half and extract it carefully. It is a long, string-like band that has high tensile strength. Tensile strength refers to the resistance a material has to break under tension. Bast fibre is primarily used in clothing, making paper and construction.\nThe shiv, also known as the hurd or woody core, is the soft inner part of the stalk. It has several properties that make it a significant material; these include:\n- Highly absorbent\n- Great thermal properties\n- Great acoustic properties\n- Rich in cellulose\nThe shiv can be used in two different ways:\n- Untreated and unrefined chunks- In this form, the hurd is used in several industries such as paper, insulation and cement.\nWhen we think about parts of the hemp plant, we might overlook the roots. However, this would be a grave mistake because hemp roots have a lot of value.\nAncient societies valued hemp roots because they believed that the roots had medicinal value. The ancient Chinese used hemp roots as a diuretic, a substance used to increase the production of urine, and also to stop haemorrhaging in women after they had given birth.\nHemp roots were also popular among the ancient Romans. According to Pliny the elder, hemp roots was used to treat joint stiffness, gout and burns.\nIn the modern era, there have been several attempts to study the clinical properties of the cannabis plant. Some of the researchers who worked on the subject include Natasha Ryz, David Remillard and Ethan B. Russo.\nIn 2017, they published a paper where they looked at the efficiency of hemp root for treating inflammation and pain. They concluded that the current data supported the ethnobotanical and historical claims made about the roots of the hemp plant. They suggested that there was a need to reexamine whole root preparations using modern scientific techniques.\nApart from having medicinal properties, hemp roots have several essential nutrients such as choline which is essential for healthy cell membranes.\nSome questions on the parts of the hemp plant:\n- What are aerial parts of the hemp plant?\nAerial parts of the hemp plant are those that are exposed to the air. These include the seeds, flowers, stalks and leaves.\n- What part of the hemp plant is used to make CBD?\nCBD oil is made from the flowers, leaves, stalks and stems of the hemp plant.\n- What part of the hemp plant has the most CBD?\nCBD oil is primarily concentrated in the flowers of the hemp plant.\nThe hemp plant is a versatile plant with limitless potential. At the moment, we are only scratching the surface, and we believe that hemp will play a significant role in our future.","Hemp, which is also known as cannabis, is a plant that can grow in the UK without causing damage to soil and water. It’s a cash crop, providing a source of income for the British farming industry but also a way to help the environment.\nHemp has been cultivated for thousands of years for its fibrous stalk, used in many applications including clothing and paper. It’s also a highly nutritious food, containing protein, fibre, vitamins and minerals. But, due to its appearance, it has never been grown commercially. Hemp is considered to be a low crop risk due to its short lifespan and high organic yield. Its seed is also considered to be an excellent source of protein, and is now being investigated by the pharmaceutical industry as a means of rapidly producing proteins for human consumption. This article will discuss the need for hemp to be grown in the UK, and the potential benefits of doing so.\nIndustrial hemp could be a valuable tool for UK agriculture, helping with the transition to more sustainable practices and providing a new crop, according to a farmers’ group.\nTo further explore the potential of hemp, five farmers are working with researchers from Cranfield University and the British Hemp Alliance as part of the Association of Soil Scientists’ Innovative Farmers programme.\nThey plan to conduct on-farm field trials to gather science-based data on the ecological benefits of this crop.\nHemp has long been stigmatized as belonging to the cannabis family (Cannabis Stiva L strains have low THC content and are not used for drugs), hemp requires no agrochemicals.\nResearchers say there is growing evidence that it can help increase biodiversity, fight pests, improve soil and sequester carbon.\nIt could also be a useful alternative to rapeseed, which is becoming increasingly difficult to grow in the UK.\nHowever, unlike many other countries, industrial hemp in the UK is still classified as a controlled drug and farmers wishing to grow the plant must apply for a licence from the Home Office.\nAs a result, there are only about 20 licensed producers in the UK with a total area of 2 000 hectares.\nWith post-Brexit agricultural policy focused on delivering public goods such as biodiversity and carbon sequestration, we need to rethink the approach to cannabis cultivation in the UK, says Nathaniel Loxley, project coordinator at Innovative Farmers and co-founder of the British Hemp Alliance.\nHemp could be a very valuable tool in the arsenal of UK farmers, but the UK is currently lagging behind internationally and there is a distinct lack of data in the UK context, said Mr Loxley.\nWe hope that by better understanding the benefits of cannabis and gathering evidence of it, we can pave the way for more producers in the UK.\nIndustrial hemp is a versatile plant used for building materials, clothing textiles, animal bedding and as a plastic substitute.\nManufacturers in the construction, fashion and packaging industries are increasingly looking to the factory for environmental solutions.\nBritain has a long history of hemp cultivation, and during the reign of Henry VIII hemp was so important to the British Navy that landowners were not allowed to grow it.\nHenry Ford even built a car from and with hemp, and the plant was used to remove pollutants after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster.\nMore and more benefits are being discovered from this incredibly versatile plant, says Helen Oldis, Innovative Farmers program manager.\nThere is real potential for farmers in the UK to use cannabis to restore their land, deliver public goods and grow a new crop, so it’s great that Innovative Farmers can get involved.\nIt is vital that farmers and researchers work together on these on-farm trials so that we can determine the true environmental benefits of cannabis and share this knowledge with more farmers.\nCurrently, most of the evidence for the environmental benefits of cannabis is anecdotal or from a limited number of studies in the U.S. and Europe, said Dr. Linda Dix, a researcher at Cranfield University who has conducted research on the plant.\nIt’s been shown to be good for the environment, both on the ground and above ground, but it could potentially provide other environmental benefits, and that’s something we need to understand, says Dr. Dix.\nOne of the areas to be studied is the carbon sequestration potential of cannabis. According to Dr Dix, the plant has the potential to store carbon in the soil and, through the use of its fibres in biocomposite materials, for example for construction or the automotive industry.\nData from other studies show different rates of carbon sequestration, likely related to soil types. So we need to know what that would look like under British conditions, she says.\nIt also has a strong taproot that can contribute to soil health by reducing compaction, improving drainage and aerating the soil.\nWhen the roots eventually break down, the carbon should provide a more stable soil structure.\nStudy participant Nick Voise and his company East Yorkshire Hemp are at the forefront of cannabis cultivation and product innovation in the UK.\nFifteen years ago, he converted most of his farmland to cannabis and now has 450 acres planted with cannabis.\nMr Voaz processes the harvest into fibre, animal bedding, HempLogz (firewood briquettes) and hemp concrete (for construction).\nAlthough we’re not an organic farm, we grow cannabis without pesticides, seed treatments, whatever – it works without them, says Voaz.\nCurrently, there are no fungal diseases or insect pests causing significant damage.\nThat makes it very useful for insects, and at this time of year cattails often congregate on the hemp, he said.\nI’m also interested in the carbon sequestration potential – if we turn hemp into hemp concrete, we may be sequestering carbon as long as the building stands.\nCamilla Heiselden-Ashby from Kent is growing cannabis for the first time on her family’s 320-acre mixed farm. She plans to add hemp to the farm’s crop rotation.\nWhen hemp takes root, it gets a very dense canopy, which shades the weeds – we like that, because we have a problem with quackgrass, says Haiselden-Eshby.\nThe roots of the plant go deep, so they take up nutrients from depth and make them available for future crops.\nI hope that by collecting data on the environmental benefits of cannabis, we can facilitate the licensing of cannabis.\nIt is not a dangerous drug, but a crop with great potential, and farmers should be encouraged to grow it, just as they encourage the cultivation of legumes to improve the soil.\nAll the farms participating in the Innovative Farmers survey are licensed cannabis growers and were selected to represent a wide range of different climatic, topographical and soil conditions in England.\nThey will grow commercial hemp at two sites, including a control plot, and analyze the soil for organic carbon content, soil structure, soil biology and biomass nutrients. They will also conduct biodiversity surveys to observe butterflies, insects and birds.\nPre-seeding for baseline data is currently underway.\nhemp treeshemp global warminghemp climate changehemp and soil carbonembodied carbon hempcretehow fast does hemp grow compared to trees,People also search for,Privacy settings,How Search works,hemp trees,how fast does hemp grow compared to trees,hemp global warming,hemp climate change,hemp and soil carbon,how much co2 does an acre of grass absorb,do different trees have different carbon sequestration abilities,embodied carbon hempcrete"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:9714c140-310a-4ac9-9aa8-5dfe88649428>","<urn:uuid:eac3e8af-fbcb-4937-970e-7200e5ca1c11>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the sunlight requirements for growing tarragon compared to salvia in hot climate regions?","answer":"For tarragon, in very hot locations, it should only get sunlight in the early morning. While it loves full and direct sunlight, it performs best in warm temperatures. For salvia, in regions where summer temperatures consistently reach 90°F (32°C), it should be planted in partial shade, while in most other regions it requires full sun.","context":["How to Grow Tarragon At Home (A Beginner’s Guide)\nTarragon is a very particular herb that grows perennially. It matches fish, eggs, chicken, or green vegetables. Tarragon has a pungent flavor that tastes similar to fennel, which is famous for traditional ingredients.\nPeople consume tarragon, either dried or fresh. Either way, it offers you health benefits such as reducing blood sugar, improving sleep quality, and reducing inflammation and pain.\nHaving tarragon grown in your house is one of the most leisurely green thumb activities. Now let’s dig into the soil, shall we?\n- 1 Tarragon Varieties\n- 2 Tarragon Cultivation\n- 3 Best Methods to Grow Tarragon\n- 4 How to Care for Tarragon\nBut before we start planting tarragon, it’s good to know the varieties of it. There are three tarragon varieties you can choose based on your hardiness zone.\nFrench Tarragon (Artemisia dracunculoides)\nFrench tarragon is often called German tarragon. It has essential oil, which amazingly elevates the dish.\nThis type of tarragon is hardy to zone 5 to zone 4B with winter protection. Also, French tarragon loves full sun and tolerates partial shade.\nYou can only plant French tarragon from cuttings, and it needs well-drained soil.\nRussian tarragon (Artemisia dracunculoides Pursch)\nCompared to Frech tarragon, the Russian tarragon has a less intense flavor. Therefore people usually use it for health purposes or just as a visual in a garden.\nRussian tarragon is hardy to zone 4, so it survives 30 degrees below zero F, the average winter temperature.\nMexican tarragon (Tagetes lucida)\nAs for Mexican tarragon, it withstands a hot and humid summer. However, it could withstand cold temperatures below 0 degrees or 32 degrees Fahrenheit.\nAdditionally, Mexican tarragon belongs to the marigold family. Also, people usually use Mexican tarragon to substitute French tarragon.\nNow you know the varieties of tarragon. I guess it’s time for you to learn about tarragon’s cultivation, starting from the soil until the divisions. There you go!\nGrowing herbs needs some soil conditions. As for tarragon, it grows best in aged compost soil with 6.3 to 7.5 pH. Make sure always to keep the soil well-drained and prevent it from overmoist or too acidic.\nTarragon could withstand drought better than overwatering. Once your soil overmoist or too acidic, your tarragon is not going to taste as delicious.\nTarragon loves full and direct sunlight. If you live in a scorching location, place your tarragon to get sunlight in the early morning only. This herb performs best in warm temperatures.\nIf you live in zone 4 or above in the state, tarragon will grow very well in your garden!\nTarragon is a perennial herb that survives in zone 4 and above. It is resistant to cold and heat, but it might die in freezing weather.\nWhat you should take note of is never overwater tarragon. First of all, keep the water moist until the plants are finally established. After that, water the plants occasionally with light watering every few days.\nIt is okay to left tarragon dry sometimes since it could withstand drought. However, over water and less water could affect the flavor and leaves’ quality.\nThe lower the fertilizer, the better the flavor would be. That is what you should remember in cultivating tarragon.\nIt is okay if you want to fertilize your tarragon. But be mindful only to apply it in the initial planting stage.\nMulch is sometimes necessary in some cases of the plants, including some herbs. It covers the soil made of sawdust or compost to reduce evaporation, maintain the temperature, control weeds, and enrich the soil.\nDoes tarragon need mulching? In a frigid temperature, yes, it does. Putting mulch around the tarragon in cold climates like winter helps the root when it dies back and goes into dormancy.\nPrune tarragon every week during the summer season. When the sun hits so hard in the late summer, tarragon will bolt. Once it booms the flower, the delicate tarragon leaves are going to taste bitter. Therefore weekly pruning is recommended.\nHow do you prune tarragon? Pinch off the top 2 inches of all new shoots to encourage a fuller plant with healthy root growth. Simple!\nWhen the spring comes, you’re going to have your tarragon spread continuously in your garden. It needs some space.\nTry to give some air and breathing space for the tarragon by dividing the plants every three years. How to do that? Dig up large chunks of the plant (cutting the tangled roots apart) and transplant them elsewhere.\nBest Methods to Grow Tarragon\nThe first best method to grow tarragon, and apparently what almost all people do, is stem cutting. It means you plant the previously existed plant that you cut beforehand.\nPropagating tarragon by cutting can be done by cutting three to four inches of the stem and put it in a pot with a seedling oil mix. Make sure to have a well-drained hole in the bottom of the container.\nRoot cutting is another method of propagating tarragon. How to do it?\nFirst up, you need to dig up the roots, usually done when plants are dormant. Then, snip the seeds and cut them to be 3 to 6 inches in length.\nAfter that, place the cutting in a container. Lay them horizontally and push a little until a half-inch deep.\nMaintain its humidity by misting and check until the sprouts start growing. You can transplant them to the garden once the sprout has grown with some little root hairs.\nGrowing from Seed\nYou have to remember that the only tarragon that can be grown from seed is Russian tarragon. Other than Russian, you can only grow it from cuttings.\nGrowing Russian tarragon from seed is very simple!\nStart seeding about four seeds in the pot and press the seed into the soil until the soil slightly covers them. Dampen the ground and wait until 10 to 12 days of low-rate germination.\nHow to Care for Tarragon\nAs for pests, tarragon has no significant issues with that. However, tarragon is quite sensitive to downy and powdery mildew when the soil is overly wet. In that case, root rot is also possible to occur in tarragon.\nTarragon can only be grown by propagation or by buying an established plant beforehand. You can cut a young stem for the best propagation result and cut it around five to six inches.\nRemove the leaves from the bottom third. Then you can plant them in moist soil. You can use the root division method as well.\nWhen to propagate tarragon?\nLate spring or early summer is the best time to plan the cutting tarragon. Meanwhile, late winter is the best one for the root division.\nNotice that tarragon is a perennial herb. You can harvest tarragon until the end of the summer. Also, be mindful to stop picking tarragon leaves at very least a month before the first frost about to arrive.\nWhen to start? You can start harvesting once the stems have reached six inches tall.\nPro-tip, keep the top of the plant trimmed back during the peak growing season. That way, you can keep the best flavor of tarragon as well as encourage more bushy growth.\nFinally, we’re storing our tarragon!\nYou can keep it fresh or dry it if you want. Fresh stems can be kept in a fridge, a glass of water, a damp paper towel, or any humid container.\nYou can freeze it for more prolonged use, though.\nIf you want to dry tarragon, tied them, and hang them upside down in a shady spot until they got scorched.\nAfter they dried out, crumble the leaves into a paper container and transfer to another with a tight-fitting lid. Never use that after more than 30 days.","Salvias are grown for their showy spikes of flowers. Flowers are 2-lipped–the upper lips erect and hooded, the lower ones are toothed and spreading. Flowers can be tubular to bell- or funnel-shaped in a wide range of colors.\nSalvias make up a large genus of popular garden plants. There are many species of half-hardy annuals and biennials, as well as herbaceous and evergreen perennials.\nAnnual and perennial salvias can be added to bedding, borders, and containers. Salvias are great additions to sunny borders, woodland gardens, and wildflower meadows. In flower beds, salvias look best in large clumps.\nFlower Garden Success Products at Amazon:\n- Wildflower Seed Mix Attracts Hummingbirds and Butterflies\n- Eden Brothers All Perennial Seed Mix\n- 10 pcs Stainless Steel Garden Hand Tool Set\n- Gorilla Cart 4 Cu.

{"question":"How do market transactions get influenced by reputation mechanisms versus choice architecture?","answer":"Reputation mechanisms work through past behavior records and emotional signaling to establish trustworthiness in market transactions, as Frank demonstrates with his prisoner's dilemma experiment showing people can accurately judge others' cooperative tendencies. In contrast, choice architecture, as developed by Thaler, influences decisions by structuring options in ways that favor long-term planning over short-term impulses, such as in retirement savings programs. While reputation relies on evaluating others' past actions and character, choice architecture proactively shapes decision environments to guide behavior toward better outcomes.","context":["Robert Frank (1988) could hardly be accused of attempting to provide a moral vision for a free society, but he makes a case for one way of resolving the moral contradiction of the free society. He attempts to show how a seemingly selfless adherence to the moral principles that support the efficient operation of the free market might ultimately be justified in egoistic terms after all. The basic strategy is to reap the long term benefits of playing by free market rules by foregoing the short term gains that can be made by breaking them. Of course, this depends on finding other agents who also obey the free market rules—and enabling them to find you. Otherwise, as Frank shows, the strategy will be undercut and ultimately defeated by rule breakers.\nHow this strategy works can be illustrated by the case of honesty. Honest behavior is economically selfless on those occasions when one could gain by dishonesty (for example, perhaps by not paying the bill of a supplier who is about to go bankrupt or the bill of a small contractor who can’t afford to sue). Now, suppose you committed yourself to a policy of strict honesty. If others knew this, they would have reason to prefer doing business with you over others, to give you easier credit, etc. For, they could be confident that you would not rip them off; i.e., impose costs on them through dishonesty. In North’s terms, doing business with you would lower their transactions costs. Thus, by foregoing the occasional rip off, you reap the rewards of doing more business on better terms. And notice, by the way, that even if other people adopt the same honesty strategy, thereby undercutting your “market edge,” your terms of doing business will still be better. Transactions costs are still lowered, even if everybody becomes completely honest (indeed, they are lowered even more).\nOf course, this works only if people know you are completely honest. And how are people to know this? Frank suggests two mechanisms, reputation and emotional signaling. Reputation is basically the record of your past behavior. Learning this entails a transactions cost, but not necessarily a particularly high one. A potential problem with reputation as a sign of honesty is that if a dishonest person is sufficiently clever, he will only exploit only “golden opportunities”—situations where the chances of one’s dishonesty being detected are very low—and remain honest in all other situations. If dishonest people could maintain this strategy, reputation would have little value. However, Frank argues that people typically do not have the discipline to restrict their dishonesty to golden opportunities. Therefore, people who are dishonest will usually in fact have bad reputations. By the same token, people with good reputations will usually have a strong general disposition to honesty, one that leads them to be honest not only when the chances are good that dishonesty would be detected, but in golden opportunities as well.\nFrank thinks a general disposition to honesty is mainly a matter of one’s emotional constitution. One is prone, for whatever reason, perhaps somewhat by nature but especially by socialization, to feel bad about dishonesty. One maintains honesty, then, because the material incentive to dishonesty is counterbalanced by the emotional painfulness of dishonesty. The fact that honesty is maintained by emotional incentives lies at the heart of the second process whereby one’s commitment to honesty can be made known to others, emotional signaling. The idea is that emotions are hard to mimic. Actors and others can learn to do a fair job of imitating various emotional expressions reasonably well with talent and lots of practice. But this takes deliberate effort. For most people, emotional states are not that easy to fake. If this is so, then the emotions associated with lying might be difficult to mask, those associated with sincerity difficult to simulate. And in that case, people might know of one’s commitment to honesty by being able to “judge character.”\nTo support this theory, Frank presents the results of an experiment he performed in which participants met and chatted with one another in groups of three for half an hour before playing, for real money, a simple prisoner’s dilemma game. Each participant would play twice, once with each of the other two in his group. The players’ choices, “cooperate” or “defect,” for each game were kept completely private and anonymous. Even the payouts were partially randomized so that no participant could infer later what choices his fellow players had made. The participants were told at the start that they would finish by playing the prisoner’s dilemma game. The half hour of chat before playing enabled the players to get to know each other, size each other up, even talk about their feelings and ideas about prisoner’s dilemma games. Then, before playing, each participant made predictions about the other two participants’ choices. The results showed reasonably good accuracy. Even after only a half hour with completely anonymous strangers, participants predicted cooperation with 75% accuracy (base rate: 68%) and defection with 60% accuracy (base rate: 32%). The accuracy of defection predictions is particularly impressive: Since only 32% of players defected, 60% accurate predictions is nearly twice the rate that would be expected due to chance.\nIt isn’t just honesty. Frank analyzes certain other moral impulses similarly. For instance, the desire for retribution. As with honesty, there are occasions when it does not pay to exact retribution. For example, suppose I have a $200 leather briefcase. If you were to steal it, I could press charges, but the hassle of doing so and going to court would cost me $300. You are about to leave town, and I will never see you again or have any future dealings with you anyway. In this situation it is economically irrational (it is the sunk cost fallacy) to pursue punishing you if you should steal my briefcase. But there is a particularly obvious downside to economic rationality in this case, which is that, if you know that I am an economically rational person (and know the pertinent facts in this case), and if you are an economically rational person (meaning, in this situation, unscrupulous—see preceding remarks re honesty) then you would get a free briefcase and I would be your patsy. You would be deterred only if you had reason to think I would commit the sunk cost fallacy and pursue you for retribution instead of just buying a new briefcase and getting on with my life. Since pursuing punishment in this case cannot be justified economically, my doing it would have to be motivated by lust for revenge or for righteous punishment. If I were prone to this lust and you could sense it, you would be deterred from stealing from me. The ironic benefit, of course, is that the deterrent effect of my penchant for revenge would mean I would rarely need to act on it. And this is an economic benefit of my uneconomic behavior. By deterring violations of my property rights, I spare myself the need either to punish a thief or buy a new briefcase. Again, to put this in North’s terms of transactions costs, a society with less stealing is a society of reduced transactions costs and correspondingly greater market efficiency. Of course, this economic benefit accrues only because of my (and others’) penchant for a certain form of economically irrational behavior.\nFrank emphasizes the economically irrational element in always pursuing honesty and punishment (and certain other moral principles). In certain situations, being honest and exacting punishment require sacrificing material gains. It may be that these sacrifices are made up for in the long run—Frank argues that this might generally be the case and that its being the case has led to the genetic evolution of certain moral emotions—but there is no guarantee of this, and it will almost certainly not hold true for all agents.\nMore importantly, if long-term material rewards are to accrue, the commitment to foregoing material rewards in certain short-term situations must be genuine. There can be no second guessing, when these situations arise, whether to follow through on one’s commitment to being honest or pursuing punishment. For, if one considers the material rewards in these situations, they will impel one to be dishonest or forego punishment. And this will mean that one’s commitment is fake. But fake commitments will not produce the looked-for long term benefits. People will not trust you if they think you are only honest as long as you can’t benefit from dishonesty or fear you if they think you only seek revenge when it is not economically costly. The strategy requires that people believe that your commitment to honesty and punishment is genuine. The only way they are likely to believe that is if your commitment to honesty and punishment is genuine, as evidenced by emotional and behavioral signals that are very hard to mimic.\nThus, ironically, the strategy for securing long term material benefits requires that you genuinely not care about those benefits as opposed to certain moral values. So, certain genuine moral commitments, distinct from the egoistic material reward seeking of the free market, can be justified ultimately in terms of egoistic material rewards. Frank seems to have shown that the free market itself rewards and thus justifies certain nonegoistic moral commitments.\nFrank’s derivation of moral commitments from the egoistic values of the free market is ingenious. He succeeds in providing a reason why an egoistic utility maximizer should want to make nonegoistic moral commitments and an explanation of the role of these commitments in the operation of the free market. And this is what we asked for. Furthermore, his solution seems potentially comprehensive in that every way in which transactions costs can be reduced through moral commitments might be covered by his strategy—though this has not been shown.\nIf there is any reason to be unhappy with Frank’s approach, it is that it is reductive in what seems to be the wrong direction: moral values of honesty, respect for property, and so forth, are reduced to material values of health and wealth, not vice versa. This comes out in several ways. For instance, as Frank acknowledges, an alternative to the moral commitment strategy is to become good at mimicking moral commitment and exploiting the opportunities for safe and profitable wrongdoing that one thereby encounters. Certain aspects of human psychology might make the mimicking strategy difficult for most people to pull off, as Frank argues (1988, ch. 8), but probably there will be people with the needed talents, and in any event it is from the view of Frank’s theory a merely technical question. From this view, to be a good mimic able to rip people off effectively would be a good thing for the mimic. Moreover, as we have noted before, the mimicking strategy gets easier as the free market becomes more efficient. The more trustworthy, law-abiding, forthcoming, and amiable are the agents in the free market, the less point there is in going to the expense of background checks, credit checks, security guards, vaults, and so on. In the limit of perfect market efficiency, these disappear altogether. And as such safeguards decline, so does the cost of mimicry, to the point where agents practically invite rule violations. And on the view of Frank’s theory, rule violations in such a situation are the appropriate response for many agents. Inevitably such agents will emerge as the free market becomes more efficient, forcing people to be more guarded and market efficiency to correspondingly decline. This process fluctuates until an equilibrium position is reached in which none of the morally committed agents can do better by switching to the mimicry strategy and none of the mimicking agents can do better by switching to the moral commitment strategy. And in this equilibrium, none of the mimickers has any reason, on Frank’s premises, to change.\nThe problem is that although the moral commitment embraced by those who pursue the moral commitment strategy must be genuine, nevertheless ultimately the only values recognized on this view are those of material reward. The moral commitment strategy remains ultimately a sneaky way of maximizing material rewards in the long term. Therefore its normative force is contingent on its ability to actually do this. By the same token, this view finds no place for intrinsic, nonmaterial rewards. As McCloskey asks in her brief discussion of Frank, “What about human flourishing, beyond bread alone?” (2006, 414). A moral vision for a free society should explain the place of this as well.\n- Frank, Robert H. 1988. Passions within Reason: The Strategic Role of the Emotions.

University of Chicago Press.","Richard H Thaler—the Charles R Walgreen distinguished service professor of behavioral science and economics at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business—who is engaged in researching behavioral economics and finance and the psychology of decision making has been awarded the 2017 Nobel Prize in Economics “for his contributions to behavioral economics” that built a “bridge between the economic and psychological analyses of individual decision-making”, paving the way for “the new and rapidly expanding field of behavioral economics.”\nReacting to the award of Nobel Prize, Thaler said that his major contribution to economics is “the recognition that economic agents are human, and economic models have to incorporate that [factor]”. And perhaps, as an acknowledgement of his argument about the sometimes-unreasonable behavior of humans, he jocularly said, “I intend to spend the prize money ‘as irrationally as possible’”.\nJokes apart, what Thaler meant when he said “economic agents are human” is: traditionally, economists assuming that each person makes totally rational choice in pursuit of their own self-interest, built elaborate theoretical and mathematical models to explain how markets work to efficiently allocate capital and set prices. But Thaler along with Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky challenging this underlying premise of the models, demonstrated how often individuals make illogical choices that sabotage their economic interests, that too, believing that they are totally rational. Citing Brexit as a classic example of behavioral economics in action, Thaler observed that British voters chose an economically irrational route while considering the options offered to them by the elites.\nStudying the underlying reasons for people to behave irrationally, he came up with three propositions: one, ‘limited rationality’; two, ‘social preferences’; and three, ‘limited control’. The concept of limited rationality is explained through ‘endowment effect’ where individuals value an item more when they own it rather than when they do not. To test this hypothesis, he gave coffee mugs at random to half of a group of test subjects asking them to sell them, if they wish, to the other mug-less half of the group. Rationality demands that people from both the groups must, on average, value them the same, and accordingly, half of the mugs should change the hands. Contrary to this expectation, the have-nots valued the mug less while the haves have valued it high and as a result few mugs have changed hands.\nMoving to the role of ‘social preferences’ in economic decisions, Thaler says that individuals do not necessarily make choices driven solely by selfish interests. For instance, in an experiment conducted by him, he asked a randomly selected student to divide a $20 bill between himself and another subject. Rarely had he noticed any student retaining the whole amount with himself, as pure rationality would suggest. Similarly, his studies revealed that people find practices like overcharging for a good under duress as unfair.\nAlong with Hersh Shefrin, Thaler developed the third idea, namely, ‘limited control’ that emanates from the conflict between two competing cognitive forces of an individual: ‘doing-self’ which is more concerned with short-term happiness and ‘planning-self’ that values long-term goals more. To resolve this dichotomy, he says that the planning-self perhaps offers fewer choices to the doing-self that lie in the immediately upcoming future. And this phenomenon runs contrary to the economic theory of rationality, for more the choices, the better would be the decision. It otherwise means, presenting people with a “choice architecture” which favors the planning-self than the doing-self can impact people’s behavior in a big way.\nIt is perhaps taking a cue from this phenomenon that Thaler came up with his now famous “nudging” theory. He co-wrote the global best-selling book, ‘Nudge: Improving Decisions about Health, Wealth and Happiness’ in 2008 with Cass Sunstein that nudged governments to explore his ‘nudging’ theory to achieve better outcomes in the financial behavior of people—of the society at large. For instance, we are all aware that we need to save more for our retired life. But under most of the hitherto operating schemes one has to voluntarily choose: you need to first decide to save, then decide how much to put aside, in which scheme and for how long? It is too much for most of the people and thus many in the US were found under-saving.\nThen came Thaler with a paper, “Save More Tomorrow: Using Behavioral Economics to Increase Employee Saving” jointly with Shlomo Benartzi of UCLA that revolutionized designing pension schemes. Under this new design, employees of the company are automatically enrolled in the plan, that they will contribute an initial percentage of their salary, that this contribution will increase each year by a certain percentage of their salary increase, and if the employees make no further choices, they will be assigned to a target date fund that is designed to automatically control asset allocation along the way towards assumed date of retirement of the respective employee. There is, of course, a provision for the employees to always opt out of any of these provisions. Intriguingly, thus default-enrolment proved to nudge employees to save for their retired life more effectively, for seldom anyone opted out. With the result, people in the automatic plans found saving more than those outside of them. And an obvious improvement is: the quality of life for future retirees.\nHe thus came up with the concept of improving “choice architecture”—an architecture that does a favor to their planning-self over their doing-self, so that it can result in better financial behavior. For instance, suppose a prospective client of credit card is provided with all the charges and fees to be paid under its usage right at the time of his choosing the card, would it not enable him to make a better choice rather than to struggle with loads of fine print later and crib at the decision already taken?\nWorking for over three decades in association with a group of behavioral economists around psychology of decision making, economics and sociology, Thaler has simply nudged even the hardnosed rationalists to look differently at how people think when it comes to money and the decision making thereof and importantly nudged rationalists to appreciate that there exists deviations in human behavior, for human agents act fallibly. And all this happily nudged him to pocket his much deserving Nobel Prize too."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:1898b883-6a1d-4c2c-b905-c0009c455239>","<urn:uuid:c29ddd2e-9609-4a06-934c-0f839795a9f2>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the key principles for maintaining healthy garden soil, and what sterilization methods can help protect it from harmful organisms?","answer":"For healthy garden soil maintenance, key principles include avoiding tilling to preserve microscopic soil life, using crop rotation to balance nutrients, and ensuring proper compost proportions (up to 50% for vegetables in raised beds). Good soil should contain about 25% compost and hold together loosely. For protection against harmful organisms, several sterilization methods can be used, including heat-based approaches (using ovens, microwaves, steam, or sun) and chemical treatments (using hydrogen peroxide or formalin). Heat sterilization typically requires maintaining soil at 180 degrees Fahrenheit for 30 minutes, while chemical methods like formalin require a 20-40 day waiting period.

If this is the case, sterilization can be the answer to your question.\nSterilizing eradicates harmful microorganisms in the earth and keeps your plants healthy. If you don’t know how to sterilize soil properly, read on to discover gardening101.net!\nSoil Sterilization – An Overview\nWhat Is Soil Sterilization?\nSoil sterilization is a farming technique that eradicates weed roots, fungus gnats, mites, and other diseases and bugs. Sterilization protects your crops from being destroyed by plant diseases and allows healthier plant growth. This process is popular among commercial greenhouses, farmers, and agricultural sectors.\nThere are pros and cons specific to each sterilizing method. But as long as you carefully follow the procedures, you can minimize the harm and bring the most out of sterilization for the entire garden.\nWhat Are The Benefits Of Soil Sterilization?\nFirst and foremost, sterilization is cheaper and less time-consuming. It costs less than disease treatments and reduces the need for regular soil replacement. This technique is especially helpful for greenhouses that want to reuse earth and for farmers with expensive crops.\nIf you need to grow seed and stem, cut shoot, or transplant juvenile plants, the last thing you want is harmful organisms and fungal diseases in non-sterile soil infecting your garden. In such cases, sterilization for fresh soil comes off as a big help.\nDoes Soil Sterilization Harm Your Garden?\nIn short, yes, it does. Sterilization doesn’t discriminate, so it also wipes out the good bacteria and beneficial soil organisms that bring nutrients to the plants. Besides, strong and mature plants can withstand unsterilized earth, making sterilization redundant for gardens of this crop type.\nHow To Sterilize Soil – The Six Ultimate Methods\nSterilizing Soil Using Chemical Treatment\nThe basis for chemical sterilization is gas: you let the unsterilized soil absorb the gas from the chemical to kill the bacteria. This method takes less effort and works well on outdoor fields. However, it can be harmful and ineffective if not done carefully.\nThe two most popular chemicals used for this technique are hydrogen peroxide and formalin.\nHydrogen peroxide, though relatively safe, can still harm your skin and therefore requires careful use. It needs to be watered down before applying to the earth, and the denser the solution is, the less you should use.\nNevertheless, this method is advantageous for its simplicity. You will only need two steps to carry it out:\n- Mix hydrogen peroxide with plenty of water. How much hydrogen peroxide you need depends on how much water you have and how dense the solution is. Several HP solutions are on the market, but the most popular ones come with 3% and 35% concentrations.\n- Apply the solution to the layers of soil.\nFormalin is diluted formaldehyde, which works well against fungus but not as much against pests like gnats. Like the previous chemical, formalin-based sterilization is pretty straightforward, with only three steps:\n- Add formalin to hot water using the ratio of 1 part formalin 38%-40%, 49 parts water.\n- Apply the mixture to the houseplant soil. The more thoroughly it’s done, the better it is. Ideally, you should aim for 5 gallons of diluted formalin per square yard.\n- Wait for 20-40 days for the sterilization to take part.\nKeep in mind that you should use formalin under warm conditions since this chemical does not fumigate at low temperatures.\nSterilizing Soil Using Heating Methods\nHeat-based sterilization is an environment-friendly, effective and accessible method for anyone. However, it’s more tedious than chemical sterilization and doesn’t work well with large outdoor fields.\nThe four popular devices used in this category are microwaves, ovens, steams, and the sun.\nFor this method, you will go through 5 steps:\n- Place some cups of water in a stockpot or pressure cooker.\n- Fill a container with earth and use aluminum foil to cover the top. Then, put the container on a rack in the pot with water beneath.\n- Put the lid on the pot or close the steam valve of the pressure cooker. Then, begin boiling the water.\n- If you’re using a stockpot, wait for 30 minutes. If you’re using a pressure cooker, let it sit at 10 pounds of pressure for 15-30 minutes.\n- Turn off the heat and wait until the soil has cooled down to remove it.\nThese are four steps to sun sterilization. If you are working on an outdoor garden, you can skip steps 1 and 2.\n- Identify a land area that receives at least 8 hours of sunlight per day.\n- Put a large sheet of plastic on the area and spread the dirt onto the sheet.\n- Moisturize the soil and place the second sheet of plastic on it. Hold down the sheet with rocks to make a seal. For gardeners, burying the sheet corners can work as well.\n- Wait several weeks for sterilization to take place. The hotter the weather is, the less you will have to wait.\nUsing An Oven\nThere are seven steps for this method:\n- Preheat the oven to 180 degrees Fahrenheit.\n- Put the ground on the roasting pan or baking sheet until it reaches 3-4 inches deep.\n- Moisturize the soil until it can be rolled into a ball. Break up the clumps to create a smooth surface.\n- Poke a hole in the aluminum foil and use it to cover the baking sheet. The hole makes space for the thermometer later in the process.\n- Heat the ground in the oven until it reaches 180 degrees. You should use a thermometer to track the temperature. Make sure not to let it get over 180 degrees since it will burn and produce toxins.\n- Leave the ground in the oven for 30 minutes. Occasionally adjust the temperature or open the door to control the heat.\n- Take the ground out of the oven and let it sit at room temperature.\nThe steps for microwave sterilization are as below:\n- Put damp soil mix into a container or a thick plastic bag.\n- For the container, cover it with a lid with ventilation holes. For the bag, keep it open. Put both into the microwave.\n- Microwave for 90-150 seconds.\n- Measure the ground’s temperature, which should be around 180-200 degrees Fahrenheit.\n- If it has reached the right temperature, take it out of the microwave. Then, seal the bag or the container lid’s holes.\n- Let the ground sit under normal temperature.\nMicrowaving is perfect if you want to sterilize a small amount of earth, but not if you’re working on large gardens.\nSome Final Tips For Better Soil Sterilization\nBefore sterilizing, don’t add fertilizers to your ground since this might reduce the effectiveness of the process and potentially harm your garden. After the process, there are also a few things you can do to keep your soil free of diseases and bugs:\n- Rotate crops regularly to prevent pests.\n- Take up healthy garden maintenance habits like testing the ground pre-fertilization, using sufficient compost, and avoiding disrupting the earth.\n- Sterilize your equipment at the start and end of each season.\nSterilization eliminates bugs, pests, and bacteria harmful to your garden through chemical or heat treatment. This technique is useful for every outdoor and indoor plant hobbyist, particularly those who need fresh land to germinate plants.\nHealthy ground makes for healthy crops.

{"question":"As both a classical violinist and an aspiring fiddler, I'm curious about how the approach to bow-string connection differs between classical violin playing and traditional fiddling?","answer":"In classical violin playing, the focus is on achieving a beautiful ringing tone through careful attention to bow-string connection, which requires mastering direction (keeping the bow on a clear path) and absorption (achieving a caressive sound through proper engagement). However, in fiddling, the bow-string connection is approached differently, with more emphasis on creating specific rhythmic effects. Fiddlers may use various bow techniques like shuffles that accent the offbeat, driven up bows, or slurs across beat lines for syncopation. While classical players aim for a consistent, beautiful tone, fiddlers often prioritize groove and rhythmic variation over flawless tone, even using 'scratchy' sounds intentionally as part of the style. The bow usage also varies - while some fiddling styles use long fluid strokes, others employ short repeated strokes, often working from the balance point of the bow for power and mobility.","context":["© 2002, Donna Hébert (reprinted from Strings Magazine)\nHow many times have you heard someone (perhaps yourself) ask, “What’s the difference between playing a violin and fiddling?” Beyond the short answer, “spelling,” this age-old conundrum invites the ponderer to step beyond stereotypes and assumptions, and to explore music’s many meanings. I’ve encountered the question many times myself. I began as a classically trained violinist in a heritage music family, then switched to playing folk music in my 20s. Since then, I’m a fiddle instructor at Smith and Amherst Colleges and have taught fiddling since 1974.\nSome fiddlers say that the only way to learn fiddling is to go hang out and jam with fiddlers, preferably primary sources. It’s what the vast majority of fiddlers past and present have done. Others say they’ve learned most of their repertoire from recorded sources, while some even learn by reading exclusively. Still, jamming remains the prevalent way of sharing fiddle music with others, and jam sessions are cultivated carefully in communities to maintain this opportunity. Dances (contra, square, Cajun, step, clogging) are what fiddling is designed to support, while jams are the ideal setting for actual learning.\nThere are as many styles of fiddling as there are communities with fiddlers in them, and each regional music has a physical and cultural home. The music fits and describes the place it’s played in, the people who play it, the kind of community it is, even the climate!\nBe forewarned: After a lifetime of consciously not tapping your feet when you play the violin, it will start to creep back in when you play fiddle tunes. This is perfectly normal and nothing to be alarmed about: It means you’re hitting the groove, the place where the music flows like honey from your fingers. Welcome to fiddling. Here are 12 questions that classical players frequently ask about fiddling, and yes, even some written examples to help you make the connection.\n1. How does fiddling differ from classical music?\na) Beat, beat, beat! Most classical music has a stronger accent on the downbeat, while fiddling accents the upbeat for dancers. Regional or ethnic fiddling styles use different left- and right-hand techniques to produce authentic sounds, with beat placements and degrees of swing changing from one style to the next.\nb) Fiddle music evolved for dancing, and improvisation and spontaneous composition are the heart of fiddling. Jazz players compose a new melodic line over the chord changes. Fiddlers use the bow and left-hand ornaments to drum a new rhythm over the melody, accenting key parts of the dance with licks, drones, and dynamics, since dancers will use the tune to tell their place in the dance.\nc) Fiddling is an oral tradition. Fiddlers learn hundreds, even thousands, of tunes, almost entirely by ear and in a variety of keys and modes. We learn from other musicians at jam sessions, and from recorded and (sometimes) printed sources. Most classical players use printed music to train the ear, which kicks in when sight-reading the music. But you can’t learn fiddle rhythms or styles from written music; you must hear it first. Fiddling pedagogy asks you to hear all the layered parts of a phrase—melody, beat placement, left- and right-hand ornaments, dynamics, chord changes and other moving lines—and then try to reproduce exactly what you hear. Playing for dances is fiddling’s main function, but jam sessions are the important forum for learning style and for transmitting repertoire and fiddling culture. We learn to play with others at the jam, flowing with the group beat or groove. We create medleys, and arrange tunes creatively on the fly. At “slow-jam” sessions, we play tunes at a slower speed to allow everyone to grab the basic tune, then gradually speed up to a dance tempo: 115–130 beats per minute for hoedowns, hornpipes, and reels in 2/4, jigs or marches in 6/8, and marches in 4/4.\n2. Why does fiddling sound so scratchy and out of tune?\nThere is no universal performance standard in fiddling, nor a universal scale, because scales and standards are culturally relative. We bend notes, raise a scale degree by several cents, and generally emphasize groove over a flawless tone. What you’d call “scratchy fiddlers” are likely to be what fiddlers call “primary sources.” We revere these ancestors and tradition-bearers, often trying to model their styles. Tommy Jarrell is a primary source among southern old-time fiddlers, and Franco-American fiddler Louis Beaudoin is always in my head when I play French-Canadian tunes. This modeling is done with the utmost respect, even reverence, for the source, hearing beyond limited technique or the infirmities of age to their rhythms, creative variations, and the soul they put into it.\n3. Why aren’t you playing what’s written down for the tune?\nPublished fiddle music is usually a only a skeleton of what we play, often lacking bowings, dynamics, ornaments, variations, or even chords. Tunes are usually written unswung, with one full repeat of the melody line (usually two eight-bar phrases repeated—once through most square and contra dances). Variations, beat placement, and bowing syncopations are implied and change with style. Most of this “performance practice” couldn’t be read by the majority of fiddlers. Defining techniques are learned as part of a style, and applied to the tunes as a spoken accent is to a language.\n4. Why does it feel like I’m bowing everything backwards?\nMaybe you are! Some tunes play easier with an up bow on the downbeat, reversing what you may be used to. The bowing pattern may even reverse the next time we play the phrase. We may end up bowing a phrase in both directions, producing the same rhythmic accent both ways. Driven up bows are also common in some styles, while other styles slur across the beat and bar lines for more syncopation. We follow the groove and accent it, regardless of bow direction.\n5. Why don’t you use all of your bow?\nIt’s a misconception that fiddlers don’t use the whole bow. Regional styles change and vary. Some use long fluid bow strokes—Texas, Cajun—and others—Cape Breton, French-Canadian, and some southern old-time styles—use short, repeated bow strokes. Many fiddlers work off the balance point of the bow, using the weighted center for power and mobility. One who favors the tip of the bow might compensate by choking up on the bow hold to shorten the stick length.\n6. What’s that rocking thing you do with your bow?\nUsually it’s a shuffle. Shuffles accent the offbeat for natural syncopation. The basic shuffle forces an offbeat accent in 2/4. We can create different rhythms by tying notes together over a two-bar phrase, often across the bar lines and beats. There’s a “split bowing” shuffle with two notes slurred, two separate over a pattern of four notes. The Georgia Shuffle is a three-slurred, one-separate bowing rhythm that can pop the offbeat out like an elbow in the ribs.\n7. What about dynamics?\nUsually the focal point of the tune is played louder, while some notes are played softer or even ghosted. Dynamics within a bar punch the offbeat like a heartbeat or breathing—soft, loud, soft, loud. One approach is to play a double-stop drone from the harmony on the offbeat.\n8. Don’t you get sick of playing the same 32 bars over and over again?\nWe don’t play them the same way over and over. Learn the ornaments in any style and you’ll be able to vary the melody authentically in that style. We also medley tunes for fun and to avoid repetitive use injuries. Variations begin on the second or third repetition, and then we might vary the rhythm under the tune a little. It’s always moving somewhere, never static.\n9. What about vibrato?\nYou won’t hear it much. Most reels are full of 16th notes played at 120 bpm, with no time for vibrato. You might use it in waltz, but all ornaments in any style are subordinate to the rhythm. If there isn’t room for the ornament “in the groove” we lose the ornament rather than lose the beat.\n10. How do you set up, tune, and hold your instrument?\nMost modern fiddlers have their instruments set up much like a violinist’s. Some fiddlers let the bridge do the work of playing adjacent-string drones, filing the top of the bridge’s curve down a bit. We may also keep a second instrument tuned to an open chord, say AEAE from bottom to top. In AEAE you can play either in A minor or A major—or both in the same tune. Many traditions—American old time, Cajun, Scandinavian, French-Canadian—have tunes that require retuning to (bottom to top) AEAE for tunes in A, ADAE for tunes in D, and AEAC# for A major tuning. Our fiddling postures are personal, based on physique and inclination (and yes, sometimes, ignorance), and often dictated by the rigors of the style we’re playing. You’ll see many variations on bow and instrument holds.\n11. I can already play the violin. How long will it take to learn to fiddle?\nFirst, it’s important to recognize the fiddling stereotypes lurking in your subconscious. A common one is the assumption that because “it’s almost all in first position, it should be easy, and besides, I can play already.” You probably have more left-hand position chops than most fiddlers, and are able to read almost anything with facility and speed. But don’t underestimate what fiddlers do. How many ways could you rearrange the notes in four or eight or 16 bars of music at 120 bpm, playing the tune authentically, with good timing and ornaments, creating tiny rhythmic variations with each repetition, yet never losing the outline of the melody, never playing it exactly the same way twice, keeping a rocking offbeat going all the while, changing tunes and keys in medleys and arranging all of them intuitively, without using sheet music? I put that all in once sentence because we are doing all of that simultaneously!\nFiddling is another language and immersion is the best way to learn. Really loving a sound and style are key. Find a style you love and learn everything you can—tunes, harmonies, rhythms. Listen repeatedly so your fingers can catch minute changes in rhythm and melody. When you learn any tune the first time, you imprint it, so aim high and learn from the best. If possible, find a mentor you can play regularly with, and learn enough tunes to be able to play in a jam session. Keep a music notebook and write down every tune you learn, noting bowings, suggested harmonies, licks. At the very least, keep a recorded journal and a tune list.\n12. Why should I learn fiddling at all?\nThere are two compelling reasons to learn and teach fiddling in schools and private studios. First, it satisfies all ten of the MENC National Standards for Music Educators: a) Singing, alone and with others, a varied repertoire of music; b) Performing on instruments, alone and with others, a varied repertoire of music; c) Improvising melodies, variations, and accompaniments; d) Composing and arranging music within specified guidelines; e) Reading and notating music; f) Listening to, analyzing, and describing music; g) Evaluating music and music performances; h) Understanding relationships between music and other arts, and disciplines outside the arts; i) Understanding music in relation to history and culture; and j) Integrating dance with music.\nSecond, how many of your string students will make it to an orchestra, teaching, or solo career as an adult, or even grow up to play in an amateur chamber group? Don’t you want them to have as many opportunities as they can to become lifelong musicians? Besides, you never know where the next Brittany Haas, Mark O’Connor or Natalie MacMaster is going to come from. Maybe one of your students?","Getting a beautiful tone is one of the great goals of playing the violin, but unfortunately it can be an elusive. One culprit is the slippage that can happen between bow hairs and the violin strings with which they are trying to connect. When that connection results in a beautiful ringing tone, it brings comfort and confidence to the violinist. However, when a student experiences the connection unraveling, he or she may lose interest in playing if the sound just isn’t there.\nEncouraging him or her to let the open strings ring from start to finish is a good place to begin, but making that happen may require extra attention to certain elements. The two main elements of stabilizing the connection are absorption and direction. With a few well-focused instructions, a student can discover the amazing world of the solid bow connection.\nThe Emergency Kit for a Strong Hair-String Connection\nTo sustain a sound, three components are necessary to keep it breathing, sustaining, and alive:\n1. Direction: Start with a clear, uncluttered path as the bow moves in different directions. Even more important than bowing parallel to the bridge is keeping the bow on the course it started out on. Some of the finest violinists even exhibit a zig-zag motion, especially if they have short arms. Plot the course in advance: Being aware in advance of slight detours creates seamless sounds. In the moment when a 90-degree angle becomes 85, the violinist should be ready for it. The bow is designed for quick changes of direction; the mind just needs to be one step ahead of it.\n2. Absorption: The warm sound of a violin is accompanied by a certain fluffiness that you feel in the articulation, much as the way that the felt on the piano hammer contributes to a mellow, finessed timbre. To achieve a caressive sound and deep absorption, the initial contact with the hair should produce an instantaneous full-bodied vibration. This technique, a very specific part of the bow arm, is simply called the engagement. Since the string essentially stops every time the bow changes direction, there should be a subtle awareness that you’re re-engaging the string numerous times within each phrase.\n3. Combining Direction and Absorption: start the engagement, and essentially move the bow horizontally. (Inadvertent vertical manipulations cause scratching and annoying interruptions). This marriage of absorption and direction opens up a channel in which the sound of the vibrating string flows and gushes from one end to another. The rosin creates a field of tiny guitar picks protruding from the hair, and the energy of hundreds of those little things plucking away can't be denied. There is a similarity between bowed strings on the violin and struck strings on the piano. The guitar picks follow the model used by the piano. The sound of scraped strings leaves a lot to be desired. The mechanics of plucking the strings hundreds of times produces organic, ringing, and sustained tones.\nJugglers and Violinists\nI’ve seen Circus Vargas twice and loved their jugglers. Watching them smile while performing made it even more enjoyable. The shapes they conjured with the objects circling in front of them was a perfect illustration of massive movement within a confined space. Sound familiar? It’s similar to how the string, while vibrating in all the right directions, produces the most beautiful sound.\nIn fact, a violinist’s technique comes closer to that of a juggler than that of a pianist. Everything a pianist deals with is static and fortified by lots of hardware. In contrast, just holding the bow with a steady hand needs an imaginative technique. A violinist who balances the bow from the tip to the frog, or a juggler who varies the heights of his objects requires a very steady sense of gravity. Balls and bows have zero stability factors and depend on a well-thought-out aeronautic design, all in the mind of the performer.\nThe Evolution of Your Bow Arm Technique\nThe first time you held the bow it probably felt like nothing seemed right. Yet certain inner forces were at play, and your ear may have started working in tandem with your arm to make the job just a little easier. Then your teacher added a few words to the explanations, and you had enough material to do several bow exercises. Muscle memory was awakened, supplementing the ear and the verbal information. Such is the birth of the bow arm. What follows this beginning is the work of the imagination and the need to fill in whatever is missing.\nThe raw ingredients may vary from player to player; one will have a higher wrist or lower elbow than another. What doesn’t vary is the need for cohesion between the hairs of the bow and the strings of the violin, and the desire for as much stability as is needed.\nNow come the details that each player applies one at a time. It might be extra pressure during a shift to keep the bow from bouncing. Or making the detaché long enough to give the right sound and substance instead of hearing only the beginning of each stroke. Or finessing the stroke to add beauty to the string’s vibration, like brushing your own hair with a caressing touch.\nYour bow arm is born in an environment in which you have no control, but is developed with personal and momentary insights. It will never stay the same because your self-awareness changes and you’ll be too busy applying your new knowledge. The best bow arm is the one that can accept and integrate the changes.\nYou might also like:\n* * *\nWe wanted you to read this article before we make our newsletter pitch, unlike so many other websites.

Thank you.Tweet\n\"the string essentially stops every time the bow changes direction\",-Yes, and the sound must also stop for an infinitesimal moment. Advanced players try to finesse the change with contrary finger motions, but there is no way to violate the laws of physics and math.\nMany players unconsciously try to dodge that little white noise that happens at the change of direction by naturally releasing the leverage, pressure, weight, whatever it is called, but instead they get an unintentional diminuendo, the bow hair looses traction, especially at the tip, changing from down- to up-bow. Instead, plow through the change. That little bit of noise will sound like a clean attack to the audience in a hall with any reverb. It is like the \"chif\" sound on a real pipe organ. Another trick is to start the vibrato before the note and follow through with the vibrato after a note ends.\nJoel, I like you”plow through” image. I think sometimes “barrel through”. It’s interesting that it takes a very straight-forward concept to eliminate an old habit such as hesitating and over-thinking during a bow change. Also, keeping a strong rhythm inside your head and body helps keep the bow strong during a change of string or direction. Knowing when to do something is as important as knowing how to do something.\nThis article has been archived and is no longer accepting comments.\nViolinist.com is made possible by...\nDimitri Musafia, Master Maker of Violin and Viola Cases\nViolinist.com Summer Music Programs Directory\nJohnson String Instrument/Carriage House Violins\nDiscover the best of Violinist.com in these collections of editor Laurie Niles' exclusive interviews.\nViolinist.com Interviews Volume 1, with introduction by Hilary Hahn\nViolinist.com Interviews Volume 2, with introduction by Rachel Barton Pine\nNovember 19, 2021 at 03:18 PM · Paul, thanks for another great article.

{"question":"What are the essential preparations needed before a hurricane hits, and what immediate actions should be taken after the hurricane passes?","answer":"Before a hurricane hits, essential preparations include: securing the building structure including roofs and windows, installing hurricane shutters, stocking up on emergency supplies like batteries, flashlights, first aid kits, and battery-operated radios. It's important to fill the refrigerator and freezer, keep gas tanks filled, and maintain supplies of canned and non-perishable food. Water supplies should be secured, including filling bathtubs and large containers. After the hurricane passes, immediate actions include: checking for damage like broken glass, sharp objects, damaged roofs, leaking gas, and fallen power lines; taking down shutters; making emergency repairs; checking electrical equipment for proper function while being alert to prevent fires; and clearing debris. It's crucial to treat all water as contaminated and ensure proper filtration and disinfection.","context":["Surviving A Hurricane\nHurricane season starts June 1st. While most hurricanes occur in September, now is the time to get prepared. There are things you need to have on hand and preparations to make. The best advice is to evacuate; however, if you do find yourself in the aftermath of a hurricane, survival will be the order of the day.\nBe assured that relief agencies Such as the Red Cross will try to bring aid and assistance in as soon as the storm has passed, but it will take time. Power lines and fallen trees will block the roads that haven't been washed away. In addition, they must determine the kind of aid that is needed. It takes time.\nHurricanes last for at least a few hours. The rebuilding lasts for weeks, maybe months. Get used to roughing it. You will probably spend one to two weeks without electricity, telephone and running water. Unless you are flooded, you will probably still have natural gas, but don't count on it.\nLacking the above utilities, you will be without communication, refrigeration, electric appliances, safe potable water and sewage service; this will mean that gas stations, grocery stores and retail merchants will be closed also. Assuming that you have shelter, you will need clean, safe water, a method of cooking (and boiling water), and a supply of food. All work will be manual, and there will be risks of injury from the damage caused by the storm.\nSome things to prepare for:\n- Batteries for flashlights, radios, etc.;\n- Stock your refrigerator and freezer (fill empty spaces with containers or water/ice if necessary) to preserve your food;\n- Electric kitchen appliances will be useless (if your range is electric, have a barbecue grill handy);\n- \"Strike anywhere\" matches, candles, fire starters (even a magnifying lens);\n- Manual hand tools.\nMake sure that everyone is safe! Check for damage. Look for broken glass, sharp objects, damaged roof, leaking gas, dangerous debris, and check for fallen power lines. You may be without electricity, but fallen power lines may be live, and could kill. If you see any, don't touch, but post warning signs.\n- Have a supply of safe drinking water, and a larger supply of water for washing, etc.\n- Have a supply of ordinary bleach.\n- Have provisions for catching, filtering, disinfecting and boiling rain water;\nObtain safe water\nAssume that all water (including tap water) is contaminated. If you had a supply of bottled water on hand before the storm, it will be okay, as long it was not in flood waters. Other sources of water should be filtered, disinfected (you can use household bleach) and boiled. Disinfecting tablets may be purchased at most sporting goods retailers. Water can be made safe, also, by adding a small amount of common chlorine bleach to clear, filtered water (about 12 drops per quart, let stand for a few hours). Just make sure that your container has been disinfected, also.\nYou should have filled bathtubs and large containers of water to be used for washing and cleaning, also. If necessary, you can collect rain water for these purposes, as well as for cooking and drinking. Just make sure that you gather the cleanest water available.\nNo stores open for business\n- Keep your gas tank filled.\n- Keep a good supply of canned and non-perishable food on hand.\n- Have adequate First Aid supplies.\nConserve food, and obtain safe drinking water. If your refrigerator and freezer were full, your food should be safe for several days. Avoid excessive opening of the doors, in order to maintain the temperature.\nPlan your meals\nYour first meals should be from perishable foods in your refrigerator, especially meats and fish, since they will be the first to spoil, otherwise. When these items from the refrigerator are finished, begin using those items from the freezer. Your canned goods should be saved for last. They will be safe.\nStarting a fire is important\nStarting a fire is important, but can pose a danger. We are not used to having candles or open flame in the house. Carelessness could result in the loss of what is left; but fire is important for cooking and boiling water. An outdoor grill or Bar-B-Que pit would be excellent.\nIf there is an abundance of perishable food, you could cook it in a large container, and keep it on the fire, adding clean water and food regularly. This is what some primitive peoples do, since cooking food remains safe much longer than food at room temperature. Seasonings such as salt and pepper help preserve the food, also.\nThere will be much work to be done, using saws, prying tools, etc. Keep the First Aid kit handy. Hopefully, things will return to normal before you need to start hunting and gathering!","Subscribe to NaDMA Updates\nThere are no upcoming events at this time.\nJoin the Network\nSocial Board: There is no feed data to display!\n3 Days Weather Forecast\nThe location could not be found.\nAt the Start of the Hurricane Season\n- Ensure that the structure of the building is in good condition. For example, secure roofs and windows.\n- Secure hurricane shutters, hooks and latches.\n- Identify emergency power requirements and make arrangements for use of a generator. Determine availability of computer support for computer users who need to remain operational during a hurricane.\n- Stock up on emergency supplies such as a:\n- First Aid Kit\n- Food and water supplies for members of staff who have to be at work\n- Battery – operated radio/television set\n- Flashlight and batteries\n- Management should ensure that there is adequate insurance coverage for the building and the extent of coverage firmly established:\n- Does the insurance cover damage to contents including vital records and office equipment, as well as liability coverage for injury to employees?\n- Does the coverage take into consideration whether your business is in a high risk area or a flood prone area?\nWhen a Hurricane Watch is Issued\n- Taking precautionary measures does not mean that the task is complete. Once a hurricane watch is issued, certain measures must be taken. These include: Identifying and protecting vital records such as accounts, receipts, customer records, tax records and other personnel and administrative documents. These maybe placed in storage cabinets or wrapped in plastic. If necessary, temporarily relocate to an off-site storage facility.\n- Storing chemicals, fertilizers and other toxic materials in a safe section of the building in waterproof containers.\n- Ensuring that roofing is secured and removing from compound all loose objects, which might cause damage during strong winds.\n- Taping all glass windows and showcase to secure them. If your building has extensive glass frontage, clear out that section of the building as much as possible and use shutters to protect the glass. If shutters are not available strong masking tape should be used to tape “X” across the glass to prevent splinters from scattering in case the glass shatters.\n- Securing all furniture and equipment above water level, battening doors firmly and securing shutters especially if business is located in flood prone areas.\n- Moving heavy-duty equipment to a safe location.\n- Dismissing essential employees temporarily so they can secure their property before returning to duty.\nWhen a Hurricane Warning is Issued\nIf the hurricane continues on its path and a hurricane warning is put into effect additional measures should be taken by the organization.\n- Removing all outdoor hazards such as television antennae and hanging signs.\n- Releasing non-essential staff to prepare their homes.\n- Wrapping office equipment such as copy machines and computers in plastic to protect against damage.\n- Moving desk, files, equipment and furniture away from windows without shutters to on area where they will be safe.\n- Disconnecting electrical equipment, turning off lights and all air conditioners.\nAfter a Hurricane\n- Take down shutters.\n- Effect emergency repairs.\n- Check electrical equipment to make sure they are working properly.
