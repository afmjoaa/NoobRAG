{"question":"How do insurance requirements differ between a DNA exhibit installation team and an entertainment performer in Alaska?","answer":"The DNA exhibit installation requires specific insurance coverage of $5 million for general liability and $2 million for property damage insurance, while entertainers and performers in Alaska need more varied coverage types. For performers, the basic required coverages include general liability (for third-party claims), workers compensation (if they have employees), commercial property (if they operate from a commercial space), and commercial auto insurance (if vehicles are used for business). The DNA exhibit has more stringent and specific insurance requirements, while performer insurance is more flexible based on their specific type of entertainment work.","context":["It’s beyond science fiction: we’ve mapped all our genes–the human genome.

Whether you sing, dance, act, do impersonations, paint, juggle – or you're any other type of entertainer or performer – you live to make people happy. The thrill of seeing the joy that your art brings to the faces of others is priceless!\nHowever, being an entertainer or a performer in AK is a big responsibility, and one that is not free of risks. In your industry, you face a lot of the similar hazards that other professionals face; there are liabilities that are unique to your industry, too.\nWhile you make every effort to ensure that the show goes off without a hitch, you never know when something that will come up that you weren't expecting. Fortunately, there's a way to protect yourself from the unexpected. How? By investing in the right type of entertainers and performers insurance Alaska policy.\nEntertainers and performers insurance Alaska protects your firm from lawsuits with rates as low as $27/mo. Get a fast quote and your certificate of insurance now.\nWhy Do Alaska Entertainers And Performers Need Business Insurance?\nWhether you run an operation or you're an independent contractor, if you're an entertainer or performer, you're in charge of your business. Like any other business owner, you are liable for any mishaps that may arise.\nIf a member of your staff suffers a work-related injury, as their employer, you're responsible for their medical care and lost wages while they're recovering. If you damage someone's property – or even if someone claims you damaged their property – you are responsible for making any necessary repairs and the legal fees that could be associated with a lawsuit. If a fire breaks out in the business you operate your business out of, you have to pay for the necessary repairs.\nThe costs that are associated with the above-mentioned situations – or anything similar – can be astronomical. Imagine if you had to pay for them out of your own pocket? The end result could be crippling; your savings could be depleted, you could lose your business, and you could even lose your home, if you don't have the right entertainers and performers insurance Alaska policy.\nIf that doesn't sound appealing to you, then business insurance is an absolute must. If an unforeseen event does occur, instead of paying these expenses yourself, your insurance company will pay them for you. In other words, entertainers and performers insurance Alaska could protect you from financial ruin.\nWhat Type Insurance Do Entertainers And Performers Need?\nAs an AK entertainer or performer, the type of insurance you need depends on the specifics of your business; the type of work you do, where you are located, whether or not you employ a staff, etc. Do you entertain at local fairs, festivals, special events, private parties, convention or tradeshow booths or elsewhere? To determine exactly what type of coverage you require, your best bet is to speak with a reliable agent who specializes in commercial insurance.\nWhile the specific entertainers and performers insurance Alaska you need will vary, here's a look at examples of some of the most basic policies that should be considered at the minimum:\n- General Liability - This type of insurance covers third-party liability claims. For instance, if a client files a lawsuit against you, claiming that you damaged their property or caused personal injury, your insurance provider would cover the cost of any legal defense fees and damages that you may be required to pay.\n- Commercial Property - Do you operate your business out of a commercial space? Whether it's a small office or a larger venue, you should invest in a commercial property insurance policy. If a fire breaks out, a pipe bursts and floods your office, or someone breaks, steals from, and vandalizes your space, commercial property insurance will cover the cost of most repairs. It will also help to pay for anything that needs to be replaced.\n- Workers Compensation - Do you have a staff of performers, agents, managers, or anyone else who works for you? If so, you'll need to carry a workers' comp policy. If any member of your team suffers a job-related injury or illness, workers' comp will help to pay for the medical care that they require. It also covers any wages that may be lost while they're recovering and unable to work; among other associated expenses.\n- Commercial Auto - Whether you use a single vehicle or an entire fleet for your entertainment business operations, commercial auto is a must, too. If you or a member of your team is involved in an accident, this policy will cover the cost of any damages that someone else's vehicle or property sustains.\nIn addition to these industry specific coverage types, you may need other types of entertainers and performers insurance Alaska for your business that are not mentioned above.\nAK Entertainers And Performers\nEntertainers and performers insurance Alaska is designed for independent contractors entertaining at local fairs, festivals, special events, private parties, convention, or trade show booths. Coverages provided include important liability protection for the entertainer or performer for liability claims arising out of their operations.\nBelow are some examples of entertainers that should have business insurance:\n- Acrobatic / Aerialist performer\n- Actor Portraying Historical Person (Actual or Fictional)\n- Actor or actress\n- Balloon Artist\n- Belly Dancer\n- Caricature Artist\n- Celebrity Look-a-like\n- Circus performer\n- DJ / Karaoke DJ\n- Escape artist\n- Exotic dancer\n- Face/body painter\n- Fire handler\n- Group acts or bands\n- Henna/Mehndi artist\n- Holiday character\n- Individual musician/singer/vocalist\n- Ineligible Operations\n- Mascot (college, high school, professional)\n- Performer putting on an athletic exhibition\n- Performer using weapons (with live ammunition or sharpened blades)\n- Permanent tattoo artist / body piercing artist\n- Production/entertainment companies\n- Psychic/fortune teller\n- Public speaker\n- Rap, hip hop, electronic/techno or heavy metal/screamo entertainer, performer or DJ\n- Singing telegram deliverer\n- Story teller\n- Strength performer\n- Stunt performer\n- Touring entertainer/performer\n- Western Performer\nAK Entertainers And Performers Insurance - The Bottom Line\nWith a the right Entertainers and performers insurance Alaska policy, you will be covered should your act cause damage to another person's property, or if you injure someone during your act. Without a liability policy, any claims resulting from your act will come out of your own pocket. To find out exactly what type of coverage you need and how much you should invest in, speaking to an experienced commercial insurance broker.\nAlaska Economic Data, Regulations And Limits On Commercial Insurance\nIf you're an entrepreneur who is thinking about starting a business in Alaska, it's important to have a basic understanding of the state's overall economy before you set up shop. Regardless of how high-quality the products and services you are planning on offering may be, if the location where you open your organization doesn't offer a target market that your products and services will appeal to, chances of success are slim. Furthermore, if a workforce isn't available to support your business, you'll have a hard time staying afloat.\nWith that said, it's important for business-minded individuals who are thinking about starting a company in Alaska to familiarize themselves with the state's economy; it's also a good idea to have an understanding of the commercial insurance requirements.\nFollowing is an overview of economic trends and commercial insurance policies that business owners are required to carry in The Last Frontier.\nEconomic Trends For Business Owners In Alaska\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unemployment rate in Alaska was 6.1% in December of 2019. While that's significantly higher than the national unemployment rate, which was 3.4% in December, 2019, it's lower than it was one year prior, when the rate of unemployment was 6.5% in December of 2018. Though the workforce is growing slower than it is in other states, economists do predict that the rate will continue to decline in the coming years.\nDespite Alaska's remoteness and cold climate, it's actually a great start to start a business. According to the Tax Foundation, Alaska is the second most tax-friendly state for business owners in the United States, as there's no individual income tax or state sales tax. Additionally, Alaska has the second highest rate of new business owners, as well as the second highest percentage of available employees (as per 2016).\nAs in most states, the best spots to start a business in Alaska are the state's biggest cities and the surrounding areas. This includes Anchorage, Juneau, and Fairbanks. Other key areas that are seeing a boost in business development in recent years include Homer, Sitka, Prudhoe Bay, and Ketchikan.\nWhile there are several industries that are experiencing growth in The Last Frontier, specific sectors thrive more than others. Businesses that are related to the following industries are booming in AK:\n- Fishing, which is also one of the largest contributors to the state's economy.\n- Mining, which provides more than 4,500 jobs in Alaska.\n- Petroleum, which is responsible for 34% of jobs in the state. In fact, Prudhoe Bay is North America's largest oil field.\n- Tourism is the second largest private sector employer in the state. Each year, millions of people from around the globe travel to Alaska to marvel at the numerous natural wonders that can be found here.\nCommercial Insurance Requirements In Alaska\nThe Alaska Division of Insurance regulates insurance in AK. Alaska mandates very few forms of insurance coverage by law. They enforce worker's compensation.\nAlaska requires you to have worker's compensation insurance if you hire even one employee on a regular basis. This includes part-time employees, family members, minors, and immigrant employees. It is not required for independent contractors or domestic employees, though you should check to make sure any contractors you have are true contractors, and not employees.\nAlaska also requires all business-owned vehicles to be covered by commercial auto insurance. Other types of business insurance that business owners should carry depend on the specific industry.\nAdditional Resources For Arts & Recreation Insurance\nRead up on small business arts and recreation commercial insurance.\n- Amusement Parks\n- Archery Ranges\n- Athletic Fields\n- Billiard And Pool Halls\n- Bowling Alleys\n- Cave Tours\n- Dance Studio\n- Disc Jockey DJ\n- Drive-In Theaters\n- Entertainers And Performers\n- Event Planning\n- Fairs And Fairgrounds\n- Film Production\n- Fine Art\n- Guides & Outfitters\n- Handball & Racquetball Courts\n- Horse & Dog Racetracks\n- Indoor Sports Complexes\n- Interior Decorator\n- Interior Design\n- Motorsports Racetracks\n- Photo Booth\n- Recording Studio\n- Recreation Centers\n- Riding Stables\n- Roller Sakting Rinks\n- Shooting Ranges\n- Skeet & Trap Shooting Ranges\n- Ski Resorts\n- Talent Agency\n- Tennis Centers\n- Video Arcades\n- Wedding And Special Event\nCommercial insurance policies for arts, entertainment and recreation are specialized policies that protect against the unique risks that arts and recreation businesses face.\nPerforming artists and companies, entertainers including musical groups, theatre groups, comedians and more, writers, performers, photographers, videographers, DJ's and so many other types.\nProfessional liability coverage (errors and omissions) is needed in these cases to protect their financial interests due to mistakes, errors or omissions by these professionals in doing their jobs. Fr example - a bride and groom did not like the way their wedding photos turned out.\nOr a wedding planner might plan a lavish wedding, but the bride's parents who are paying for it did not like the way it went. There is a lot of gray areas with arts, and you need to be protected if your clients don't agree with you that your work was what the agreed to.\nIf your business is involved with children, you need to review your coverages very carefully so certain important protections are not excluded. Abuse and molestation insurance might be needed to fully protect yourself in this instance.\nMinimum recommended small business insurance coverage: Business Income with Extra Expense, Employee Dishonesty, Money and Securities, Accounts Receivable, Commercial Articles Floater, Computers, Valuable Papers and Records, General Liability, Employee Benefits Liability, Umbrella Liability, Hired and Non-owned Auto Liability & Workers Compensation.\nOther commercial insurance policies to consider: Building, Bailees Customers Floater, Money and Securities, Cyber Liability, Employment-related Practices Liability, Business Auto Liability and Physical Damage and Stop Gap Liability.\nRequest a free Entertainers And Performers Insurance Alaska quote in Akutan, Alakanuk, Anchor Point, Anchorage, Badger, Barrow, Bear Creek, Bethel, Big Lake, Buffalo Soapstone, Butte, Chena Ridge, Chevak, Cohoe, College, Cordova, Craig, Delta Junction, Deltana, Denali Park, Diamond Ridge, Dillingham, Eielson AFB, Emmonak, Ester, Fairbanks, Farm Loop, Farmers Loop, Fishhook, Fritz Creek, Funny River, Gambell, Gateway, Goldstream, Haines, Healy, Homer, Hoonah, Hooper Bay, Houston, Juneau, Kalifornsky, Kasigluk, Kenai, Ketchikan, King Cove, Kipnuk, Klawock, Knik River, Knik-Fairview, Kodiak, Kodiak Station, Kotlik, Kotzebue, Kwethluk, Lakes, Lazy Mountain, Meadow Lakes, Metlakatla, Moose Creek, Mountain Village, Nikiski, Ninilchik, Nome, Noorvik, North Pole, Palmer, Petersburg, Pilot Station and Happy Valley, Point Hope, Point MacKenzie, Prudhoe Bay, Quinhagak, Ridgeway, Salamatof, Salcha, Sand Point, Savoonga, Selawik, Seward, Sitka, Skagway, Soldotna, Steele Creek, Sterling, Susitna North, Sutton-Alpine, Talkeetna, Tanaina, Togiak, Tok, Toksook Bay, Unalakleet, Unalaska, Valdez, Wasilla, Willow, Womens Bay, Wrangell, Yakutat and all other AK cities & Alaska counties near me in The Last Frontier.\nAlso find AK local small businesses by General Liability Class Code and learn about Alaska small business insurance requirements for general liability, business property, commercial auto & workers compensation including AK business insurance costs.

{"question":"Hey there, I'm a vet tech - what's the diff between regular x-rays and digital ones in terms of radiation exposure?","answer":"Both traditional and digital x-ray systems expose patients to radiation, but digital radiography uses up to 90% less radiation than traditional film x-rays. With specific devices like NOMAD Pro 2 Veterinary, the exposure is even further reduced to less than 1% of allowed occupational doses, thanks to its external backscatter shield and internal radiation shielding that protect from radiation exposure.","context":["NOMAD Pro 2™ Veterinary – Safety\nX-ray systems typically generate stray radiation when fired. Backscatter radiation from a patient’s jaw can reflect back at the operator or to other parts of the patient. Because of this, lead aprons and/or thyroid shields are usually used to protect the patient, and conventional X-ray generators are operated remotely, in order to protect the operator.\nHowever, NOMAD Pro 2 Veterinary is designed with safety in mind. The external backscatter shield and internal radiation shielding are specially designed to protect the operator from radiation exposure. In fact, the exposure from using NOMAD Pro 2 Veterinary is less than 1% of allowed occupational doses. NOMAD Pro 2 Veterinary is safe!\n- Standards for Protection Against Radiation, 10 CFR 20 (US Federal Standards), 1994 (see also NCRP Report No. 116)\n- NCRP Report No. 145 (National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements), p7-9\n- “Estimated Cosmic Radiation Doses for Flight Personnel”, Feng YJ et al, Space Medicine and Medical Engineering, 15(4) 2002, p265-9\n- Normalized average assumes 7,200 exposures per year, and the average length of exposure for D-speed=0.50 seconds, F-speed=0.25 seconds, digital sensor=0.20 seconds\nAdditional references: Occupational Dose Limit: Suggested State Regulations for Control of Radiation (SSRCR), Section D.1201; Occupational Dose Limit Requiring Dosimetry: SSRCR, Section D.1502; General Public Dose Limit: SSRCR, Section D.1301\nStudies and Reports\nCommentary: ‘Not all handheld x-ray systems are created equal’\nJoel E. Gray, Ph.D., is the founder of DIQUAD, an organization dedicated to improving image quality and film processing in dentistry while lowering patient dose. Dr. Gray is a medical physicist with 20-years experience in clinical medical imaging at Mayo Clinic (Rochester, Minnesota).

This shield produces a cone-shaped protection zone extending behind it. At the position where the operator stands, the zone has a diameter of over 6 feet, enough to protect the operator’s entire body.\nIn addition, radiation shielding inside NOMAD Pro 2 Veterinary ensures that leakage from the X-ray source itself is virtually eliminated, protecting the operator’s hands and other areas close to the device.\nHow much exposure is too much?\nRadiation is all around us, all the time. It varies with your lifestyle and where you live. Click here to find out how much exposure you receive in everyday living.\nThe average dose per person from all sources is about 360 mrems per year. International Standards allow exposure to as much as 5,000 mrems a year for those who work with and around radioactive material. You can see how NOMAD, even with heavy use, provides minimal exposure for the operator.\nContact Aribex to learn more about how NOMAD Handheld X-ray Systems can advance your level of patient care.","Click the image above to view the Digital X-rays gallery\nX-rays are taken to help diagnose a problem, confirm a dignosis, give valuable information to enable a dental problem to be fixed & to find otherwise undetectable dental problems.\nThe physical process for digital radiography is actually similar to traditional dental X-rays that use film: With digital radiography, we either insert a sensor or digital plate into your mouth to capture images of your teeth or have you stand in a scanning xray called an orthopantomogram (panorex) to get a complete image of your jaw.\nThere are several benefits to using digital radiography over traditional film X-rays:\nLess Radiation — The equipment used in digital radiography exposes dental patients to much less radiation. In fact, digital X-rays use up to 90 percent less radiation than film X-rays. While conventional dental X-rays are relatively safe, digital radiography is an excellent option for those who take X-rays on a regular basis or for those who are concerned about radiation.\nShorter Dental Appointments — Digital radiography can also shorten your dental appointment! With traditional dental X-rays, you’ll have to wait while your dentist develops the film. With digital radiography, the sensor develops the x-ray almost instantly & the plate system takes 30 seconds to process. The x-ray image is projected it onto a computer screen right before your eyes.\nHigher Quality Images — The standard size of traditional X-rays can make viewing difficult, but digital radiography has done away with the “one size fits all” mentality. Once on the screen, digital X-rays can be enlarged or magnified for a better visual of the tooth’s structure. Brightness, contrast and colour can also be adjusted, allowing us to see, for example, small cavities more easily. If you need a hard copy of your X-ray, digital images can also be printed out.\nTransferring Dental Records – Digital images can be e-mailed to a dental specialist for immediate review.Digital X-rays are taking away the expense and time needed to copy files and mail them to another dentist, making it easier to transfer dental records or get a second opinion.\nEnvironmentally Friendly – Digital dental X-rays are better for the environment. With digital radiography, no chemicals are used to develop film.\nHaving used digital radiographs for over a decade I have found that I can follow a tooth & monitor its general health in a consistent & predictable manner. If I suspect there is a problem with a tooth & I take a repeat x-ray of the same tooth a year or so later the only variable is the tooth. This is because I am using the same x-ray sensor in the same holder & using the same x-ray dose. This means any change in the tooth is due to the tooth decaying. With old fashioned wet film x-rays there are multiple variables eg the developer or fixer strength, temperature whilst being developed & fixed & time taken to develop & fix can all give x-ray images a different & difficult to diagnose appearance.\nNo matter what type of X-rays you choose, dental X-rays are important part of your regular dental visits. Dental X-rays are necessary to help diagnose problems not visible to the naked eye. If you’re concerned about radiation, talk to your dentist about your X-ray options.
