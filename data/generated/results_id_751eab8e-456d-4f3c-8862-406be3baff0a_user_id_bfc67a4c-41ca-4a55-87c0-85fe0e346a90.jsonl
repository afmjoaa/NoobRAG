{"question":"How do web users' interaction patterns change over time, and what accessibility standards must be implemented to accommodate these changes?","answer":"Web users' interactions change based on age, situation, and ability - what someone can do in their 20s, like using a mouse, might become impossible later in life. To accommodate these changes, websites must implement specific accessibility standards including making content available in multiple formats, ensuring keyboard accessibility, providing transcripts and captions for audio/visual content, enabling zoom functionality for low vision users, and ensuring compatibility with assistive technologies like screen readers. These standards are formalized through Section 508 compliance requirements, which mandate accessibility for all electronic content and communication products.","context":["Product teams should be keen to understand how people interact with digital content and media. For one, web users’ interactions with website content changes over time. Two, it changes by situation. And three, it changes by ability. For example, what a web user can do in her 20’s, such as navigating web pages with a mouse, is impossible later in life. When teams overlook these factors, they inevitably create inaccessible experiences for all web users.\nSo where to start?\nProduct team members must adopt the W3C’s four “POUR” principles of inclusive design (perceivable, operable,understandable, and robust). These principles are the foundation of accessible web design. It helps product teams empathize with web users with disabilities. And it guides teams to design for their adaptive strategies, abilities, and assistive technologies.\nAt first designing with these principles in mind is challenging. Keep these shortcuts handy to make inclusive digital experiences. They are not every example though! Visit the W3C’s site for a complete analysis of POUR.\n- Perceivable: Content is presented in more than one format (e.g., an image, diagram, icon, etc.). Provide transcripts. Use simple layouts.\n- Operable: Functionality is available by keyboard and other input types (e.g., a mobile phone, mouth stick, etc.). Give users enough time to read and use content. Give users control over motion (e.g., carousel, video, etc.).\n- Understandable: Content is clear, familiar, and simple. Web pages look and work predictably (e.g., links presented consistently). Help users avoid and correct their mistakes (e.g., an error message).\n- Robust: Maximize fit with current and future technologies like different screen readers (e.g., VoiceOver, NVDA, Talkback, etc.)\nNext, obsess over users’ behaviors\nDigitally Accessible Experiences: Why It Matters and How to Create Them\nIt’s more critical than ever that your digital assets are easily accessible and usable to all of your users. Adopting an accessibility-first design mindset can help your business create a stronger digital presence and an enhanced user experience for all users and ultimately drive more business.\nPeople have different interaction styles and settings, preferred operating systems and browsers, and various input methods (e.g., touch, voice, etc.). Start by asking a series of questions. Which user experiences do they want improved and barriers removed? Which technologies do they use? How and why are they using them? Take a look at the User Story of Ali. It’s a snapshot of designing for disability.\nAlso consider these essential questions. Keep them handy and refer to them often:\n- Is web content presented in more than one format in our user interface designs? Can our web users access it from different devices and through voice, vision, touch and/or hearing?\n- In other words, are web pages, user interface components, and content perceivable and robust?\n- Did we add transcripts, captioning, and audio descriptionsto live and prerecorded content for hard-of-hearing web users, and users with learning disabilities?\n- In other words, is time-based media perceivable and understandable?\n- Can people with disabilities tab through our website? Can they use screen readers and voice activated devices to access digital content? Did we give them enough time?\n- In other words, are web pages, content, and user interface components operable?\n- Do our mobile websites look and behave like they do on a larger screen? Is Zoom enabled for low vision users?\n- In other words, are mobile web pages adaptable (SC 1.3) and distinguishable (SC 1.4)?\n- Did we remove a user’s control over her interactions? Are we preventing her from viewing or accessing content as needed when it’s needed?\n- In other words, did we ensure web pages are perceivable and operable?\nIt’s almost impossible to create inclusive user experiences without embracing the diversity of web users and their stories.

VPAT (Voluntary Product Accessibility Template) is a self-evaluation tool to declare your compliance with Section 508. The law basically applies to Federal agencies that develop or procure technology products.\nWhen a technology business organization deals with a federal agency or any entity that receives funding from the federal government, Section 508 compliance is mandatory for them. The vendors must abide by the law and declare their accessibility standards via VPAT. In today’s post, we cover what is VPAT and how to use it to protect your business from lawsuits.\nWhat’s Covered In Section 508?\nSection 508 is part of the Rehabilitation Act which is also connected to certain other digital accessibility laws. The Americans with Disability (ADA) Act is one of the most important laws that has become the #1 reason for digital accessibility lawsuits and expensive penalties.\nSection 508 standards are applicableto information technology and communication products, such as:\nElectronic content like PDFs\nTo put it simply, if a remote learning app has electronic documents, then the developers need to make sure that the products are easily accessible by users who have hearing difficulties, vision loss or cognitive limitations.\nThe updated version for Section 508 needs accessibility compliance for color, images, tables, lists, headings, forms and PDFs.\nMake Your Website Accessible With A VPAT\nVPAT was originally developed only for technology agencies that are dealing with the federal government. However, compliance with Section 508 through regularly auditing your VPAT accessibility standards is a step in the direction of avoiding expensive legal recourse.\nWhat Is VPAT Compliance?\nThere are four different editions of VPAT including WCAG edition, 508 edition, EU edition and INT edition. Depending on your requirements, you can select the edition and test your products to declare your VPAT compliance.\nThe VPAT template can be filled out after a thorough accessibility audit of the products/offerings. Below is a step by step approach to make your website compliant with Section 508.\nCaptions and transcripts: Make sure that the audio and videos are accessible via written text or transcripts. Speech recognition technologies are useful to make your website 508 compliant.\nNavigation: Make sure that website navigation is hassle free if a user doesn’t have access to a mouse and uses only the keyboard.\nScreen readers: Access that the available content is easily readable via a screen reading platform. To attain Section 508 compliance, it is important to make things accessible for visually impaired users.\nALT text: Visually impaired users use a screen reader, they must know when the screen is displaying an image. Alt texts are alternative texts that include descriptions that the users are now looking at an image or a video on the screen.\nColor and contrast: Foreground and background color contrast is also a useful element to make a website compliant with Section 508. When filling out a VPAT, make sure to test the colour and contrast. This detail is helpful for users to distinguish easily accessible products and offerings.\nTimeouts: Timed responses are challenging for users with cognitive limitations. Avoid using them if you aim for Section 508 compliance.\nA VPAT testing tool is useful to access your website. Although automated scans are only 30% accurate and can only detect basic errors like missing ALT texts and color contrast. It is best to invest in manual audits to make a website totally compliant.\nRegularly updating your VPAT is essential to reduce the risk of being on the ever increasing list of law violators.

{"question":"How did Sacajawea and Stacy Martorana's roles as interpreters differ in their respective fields?","answer":"Sacajawea served as an interpreter and guide for Lewis and Clark during their exploration of Western North America, helping bridge communication gaps in a physical journey. In contrast, Stacy Martorana's interpretation role was in dance, where she had to interpret between different dance styles, particularly transitioning from Cunningham technique to Mark Morris's style, dealing with challenges like relearning how to move and work with music after being used to ignoring it.","context":["Mark Morris dancer Stacy Martorana talks about her career\nStacy Martorana talks about joining the Mark Morris Dance Group\nMon Mar 25 2013\nTime Out New York: What did you work on during that month?\nStacy Martorana: Squaregame was one of the first things I learned. Rune and Tread,which was the first piece Merce saw me do as a RUG. Changing Steps. A lot of that we started with in the first couple rehearsals. And Fast Dance.\nTime Out New York: Did you have much contact with him during that period?\nStacy Martorana: In class, the only thing I remember him ever telling me was a note that I would get a couple times: to bend my back knee in attitude more. [Laughs] I remember being introduced to him as a RUG. He knew me from class, but Tim Ward—who I was hired with—and I had to almost be presented to him. That was one of the few interactions as a RUG. And I do remember him coaching us on Tread, and saying, “Make the fast parts faster; make the slow parts slower.” One other thing I remember was Merce coaching us in Rune. When we stand in relevé in parallel and pick our leg up fast and lower it slowly multiple times in battement, he said how he wanted it to go up more quickly and go down more slowly, which of course makes it more challenging.\nTime Out New York: What was that time like for you since you knew that Merce was fading?\nStacy Martorana: I didn’t expect it to happen that soon. I didn’t really know much about his health. I knew it would happen, but I didn’t know it would be a month after. At that time though, I also was just so happy to have that job. What am I trying to say? I was so excited to have that job and to start learning the work and working with the company members. My only experience as a RUG was him basically not being around. So I didn’t know much about the other experience. I heard a lot about it; I got a taste of it. But my experience as a RUG was getting a lot of feedback from the company members, them coaching us a lot. After Merce was gone they fortunately took it upon themselves to help us and teach us, and of course we had coaching from Robert. But it was also that when the company was away on tour, we were on our own. We would sometimes have former company members like Banu [Ogan] and Carol come and coach us, but mainly we were working on our own, learning from videos, running things, doing outreach—a lot of outreach.\nTime Out New York: What were those final RUG performances like for you?\nStacy Martorana: I have really good memories. I mean I cried, of course. It was special for us. It was like our moment to shine, and we hadn’t had many performances really over the past two years. So six shows for us was a lot. And we were just there for each other. The four of us and the other dancers added into the show. It just felt like we’d been through this whole long thing together, and here was our celebration. It was so special to have that place full every night and to know that we, even as RUGs, were supported and that people wanted to see the work and pieces that the company wasn’t performing anymore. The most special piece I think for all four of us was Inventions. Robert kind of created that for us. [Inventions MinEvent] was our piece and only we did that and that felt so special. The company didn’t know it, which also made us own it. We could own it. We didn’t have to be worried about if this was right or that was. I mean we did, but not in terms of if other people knew it better than we did.\nTime Out New York: When you knew the end of the RUGs was nearing, were you thinking about Mark Morris?\nStacy Martorana: Yes, very much so. I started understudying L’Allegro [il Penseroso ed il Moderato] in April of 2011. I didn’t think it was possible. I didn’t think I could ever get a job here. It just seemed too big and like a dream come true. Like those things don’t happen, right? I was asked to understudy. It was on the plane ride home from L.A., where I had understudied L’Allegro, that Matthew [Rose] asked to get my number so that they would have me come in and take company class. So any chance I could, any chance they were in town, I was here for class and would go rehearse with the RUGs after. [Laughs] I was taking class here whenever they were in town and Mark was teaching.\nTime Out New York: Please tell me about that. Were you shocked?\nStacy Martorana: Yeah. By everything. [Laughs] It was hard to transition from taking ballet here to then doing Cunningham technique, but it was exciting. It was also kind of learning all over again how to move. It felt so foreign to me. It was like I couldn’t remember how to move my head in port de bras. I had to retrain. Cunningham is all about being on the spine and the one thing I always loved about ballet was épaulement, moving the head. I had to retrain myself to do that.\nTime Out New York: What kinds of corrections would you get from Mark?\nStacy Martorana: A lot about my arms. They were so used to being held. It’s hard to answer that question because there are so many things that have changed from his class in a positive way. In terms of safety, I pronate my feet like crazy—especially doing Cunningham with the big movements. He’s helped me with that. Finding more length in my body. I just always felt so tight and muscular.\nTime Out New York: You have to be soft in this company—soft but strong.\nStacy Martorana: Right. I feel like I’ve learned how to use the right muscles. And I’m still learning; I have to say, it’s the closest I’ve felt to feeling like I’m working like a ballet dancer, which is funny because it’s what I always wanted, but couldn’t find. And it’s hard to make the changes, but when you start to feel something change, it’s like, This is why I do it. This is why you stay a dancer. I mean I’m still working on a plié in first position. [Laughs] But that’s fine. Some days it’s frustrating, like, Shouldn’t I have this already? But it keeps you interested. There’s always something new to find.\nTime Out New York: What interested you about Mark’s work as a spectator?\nStacy Martorana: The dances are beautiful. The group work—I was definitely not used to even watching that kind of group work. The spatial patterns and the dancers—they’re gorgeous. I just remember thinking that they looked so at ease, but what they were doing was hard. It is hard. And what, of course, struck me was the musicality. Having spent so much time not working with music and ignoring it, and then seeing music, it was like something I’d never experienced before. And it’s so clear in his work. Big groups of people move as one, but they don’t all look the same. And they don’t all move exactly the same, but it’s a whole. And that’s so beautiful. And the movement: I stopped training to be a ballet dancer, but ballet moves, I like them. And to see modern dance works that have ballet vocabulary in them was beautiful. And they’re done in a different way.\nTime Out New York: What pieces were you first in?\nStacy Martorana: Well, my first show was L’Allegro as an apprentice. Oh my God![Laughs] That experience was unlike anything I’ve ever felt. It was the Kennedy Center. Wow. It was an amazing experience. I remember watching the finale, and it bringing tears to my eyes. And then to do it? The first night that curtain went down, I just lost it. The first rep piece I was in was Canonic 3/4 Studies, which I still do pretty often. It’s so funny, I remember thinking, After Cunningham, things will be so easy. They’re not. [Laughs] Man.\nTime Out New York: What has been a challenge?\nStacy Martorana: First of all, listening to music was hard. It was really hard to pay attention to what my body was doing, what everybody else was doing and hearing the music. I was very used to ignoring it.\nTime Out New York: Did you get yelled at a lot?\nStacy Martorana: Yeah. But it’s good for me. I mean I didn’t even notice at first that I was ignoring the music. [Laughs] And also at Cunningham, say you’re doing a pirouette and it’s not perfect, and you have to step into something else, but there’s no music to be on time for, so you get there eventually. Whereas here, it’s a beautiful challenge. Now I’m getting used to hearing different kinds of music and learning how to count for myself.","History has produced many famous Native American Indians; including chiefs, warriors, politicians, scientist, actors, athletes, and doctors.

{"question":"What makes Venus' orbit unique compared to Earth's, and could another planet theoretically share Earth's orbit on the opposite side of the Sun?","answer":"Venus has the most circular orbit of any planet with an eccentricity of 0.007 (compared to Earth's 0.0167), with only a 1.5 million km difference between its closest and farthest points from the Sun. However, having another planet sharing Earth's orbit on the opposite side of the Sun is impossible in the long term. While theoretically a planet could briefly occupy such a position, the gravitational influences of other planets would cause the orbits to destabilize. The planets would either eventually collide, forming a larger planet and killing everything on both worlds, or be kicked into new, different orbits. The only stable shared orbits are at Lagrange points L4 and L5, which are 60 degrees ahead and behind a planet's orbit respectively.","context":["If you’ve read your share of sci-fi, and I know you have, you’ve read stories about another Earth-sized planet orbiting on the other side of the Solar System, blocked by the Sun. Could it really be there?\nNo. Nooooo. No. Just no.\nThis is a delightful staple in science fiction. There’s a mysterious world that orbits the Sun exactly the same distance as Earth, but it’s directly across the Solar System from us; always hidden by the Sun. Little do we realize they know we’re here, and right now they’re marshalling their attack fleet to invade our planet. We need to invade counter-Earth before they attack us and steal our water, eat all our cheese or kidnap our beloved Nigella Lawson and Alton Brown to rule as their culinary queen and king of Other-Earth.\nWell, could this happen? Could there be another planet in a stable orbit, hiding behind the Sun? The answer, as you probably suspect, is NO. No. Nooooo. Just no.\nWell, that’s not completely true. If some powerful and mysterious flying spaghetti being magically created another planet and threw it into orbit, it would briefly be hidden from our view because of the Sun. But we don’t exist in a Solar System with just the Sun and the Earth. There are those other planets orbiting the Sun as well. As the Earth orbits the Sun, it’s subtly influenced by those other planets, speeding up or slowing down in its orbit.\nSo, while we’re being pulled a little forwards in our orbit by Jupiter, that other planet would be on the opposite side of the Sun. And so, we’d speed up a little and catch sight of it around the Sun. Over the years, these various motions would escalate, and that other planet would be seen more and more in the sky as we catch up to it in orbit.\nEventually, our orbits would intersect, and there’d be an encounter. If we were lucky, the planets would miss each other, and be kicked into new, safer, more stable orbits around the Sun. And if we were unlucky, they’d collide with each other, forming a new super-sized Earth, killing everything on both planets, obviously.\nWhat if there was originally two half-Earths and they collided and that’s how we got current Earth! Or 4 quarter Earths, each with their own population? And then BAM. One big Earth. Or maybe 64 64th Earths all transforming and converging to form VOLTREARTH.\nNow, I’m now going to make things worse, and feed your imagination a little with some actual science. There are a few places where objects can share a stable orbit. These locations are known as Lagrange points, regions where the gravity of two objects create a stable location for a third object. The best of these are known as the L4 and L5 Lagrangian points. L4 is about 60-degrees ahead of a planet in its orbit, and L5 is about 60-degrees behind a planet in its orbit.\nA small enough body, relative to the planet, could hang out in a stable location for billions of years. Jupiter has a collection of Trojan asteroids at its L4 and L5 points of its orbit, always holding at a stable distance from the planet. Which means, if you had a massive enough gas giant, you could have a less massive terrestrial world in a stable orbit 60-degrees away from the planet.\nWell, it was a pretty clever idea. Unfortunately, the forces of gravity conspire to make this hidden planet idea completely impossible. Most importantly, when someone tells you there’s a hidden planet on the other side of the Sun, just remember these words:\nGo ahead and name your favorite sci-fi stories that have used this trope.

Extended InfoSheet D3\nVenus' orbit and visibility - day, night and seasons on Venus\nWith a mean distance of about 108 million kilometres or 0.72 AU, Venus\nis the second closest planet to the Sun and our nearest planetary\nneighbour. Its orbit about the Sun takes 225 days with its distance\nfrom the Sun being almost three-quarters of the Earth's.\nVenus and its position in the solar system\nThe Earth's sister planet revolves around our central star in an\nelliptical orbit that is the most circular of any planet. The\ndifference between its aphelion (the orbital point farthest from the\nSun) and perihelion (the orbital point where a body is closest to the\nSun) is only 1.5 million km, which gives its orbit an eccentricity -\nthat is the ratio of the distance between the foci of an ellipse to\nthe length of its major axis - of 0.007, the lowest of any planet. For\ncomparison, the eccentricity of the Earth's orbit is 0.0167. The\ninclination of the Venusian orbit to the plane of the Ecliptic (the\nEcliptic is the projection of the Earth's orbit onto the celestial\nsphere) is about 3° 24'.\nThe inclination of the planetary orbits to the plane of the Ecliptic\nWith an orbital speed of about 35 km/s (the Earth moves at 30 km/s), the siderial and synodic periods of Venus are about 225 and 584 days respectively. The term \"siderial period\" means the interval of time one body needs to complete one revolution around another body with reference to the stars and the \"synodic period\" is the interval of time until Venus is again in the same position relative to the Sun, as seen from the Earth. The orbit of Venus which lies inside the Earth's orbit takes it closer to Earth than any other planet. So Venus can be very easily seen from the Earth. It is often called the Morning or Evening Star and it is often the brightest object in the sky, with the exception of the Sun and Moon. At its brightest it reaches magnitude -4.7, far brighter than any other planet.\nThe phases of Venus\nLike all other planets, including our own Moon, Venus shines by\nreflected sunlight. Moreover, as its orbit is inside the Earth's,\nVenus displays phases which are very similar to those of the\nMoon. Galileo Galilei was the first astronomer who discovered this\nphenomenon by using a telescope and it helped him to confirm that the\nplanets are bodies like the Earth. The entire set of Venusian phases\ncould not be explained with the Ptolemaic Earth-centred system. The\nmain difference is that, because of the changing distance between\nEarth and Venus, its apparent size changes considerably more than does\nPhases of Venus\nAnother difference between the phases of Venus and the Moon is that, seen from the Earth, it is not normally possible to observe Venus when it is \"full\" because it is then on the other side of the Sun (at superior conjunction, see below) and located very close to the Sun in the sky. Venus is brightest when it appears as a crescent. That is the case when Venus is in the evening sky and it appears to move from its maximum distance, called \"greatest elongation\", back towards the Sun. When it appears in the morning sky, it is brightest before greatest elongation.\nConfigurations of Venus\nVenus is the closest planet to the Earth at inferior conjunction, a distance of 42 million km. The term \"inferior conjunction\" refers to the configuration when an inner planet passes between the Sun and the Earth. Venus appears in front of the Sun in the sky and it can sometimes happen that Venus transits the Sun's disk. But it is a rare phenomenon, because it occurs only when Venus is at inferior conjunction close to one of its nodes (See: What is the significance of the transit of Venus?)\nAt superior conjunction, Venus is on the opposite side of the Sun and nearly 257 million km from the Earth. This great difference in distance from the Earth produces a large variation in its apparent size. At superior conjunction, Venus' apparent diameter is about 10\" and at inferior conjunction about 64\".\nConfigurations of Venus\nThe maximum elongation of Venus is about 47 degrees. Venus is a remarkable object in the night sky at its brightest, 35 days before or after inferior conjunction, when one third of the visible surface is illuminated. Under favourable conditions it is even possible to see the crescent shape of Venus with binoculars.\nThe rotation of Venus\nThe rotation period was unknown for a long time. Observers in the past saw faint hints of structure in the clouds, which seemed to indicate that these clouds might circle the planet in about four days, moving in the opposite sense to Venus' orbital revolution. Finally in 1962, radar waves penetrated the clouds and the measurements revealed that the rotation period is 243 days in a direction opposite to the other planets; this backwards motion is called retrograde motion, to distinguish it from prograde (forward) rotation.\nThe planet spins from east to west, rather than west to east, like the Earth; so on Venus, the Sun (though invisible through the clouds) rises in the west and sets in the east. This slow retrograde rotation results in a solar day on Venus lasting 117 terrestrial days. The slow rotation of the solid surface contrasts with the rapid rotation of the clouds. The clouds rotate in the same sense as the surface of Venus but more rapidly, once every four days (See: The clouds of Venus!). The axis of rotation is almost perpendicular to the orbital plane; the inclination being 177 degrees.\nThe fact that Venus is in retrograde rotation seems very strange to astronomers, since the planets orbit the Sun in one direction and almost all the planets and satellites spin in the same direction. So it is difficult to explain why Venus spins \"the wrong way\". One possibility depends on the idea that when Venus was in the process of forming, the planetesimals formed clumps of different sizes. Perhaps the second largest clump struck the largest clump at such an angle as to cause the resulting clump to rotate backwards. Another possibility is that sometime later in Venus' history a comet, asteroid or large heavenly body crashed into it causing it to flip. But these ideas are not supported by any good physical evidence, and it is strange that Venus ends up rotating slowly backwards instead of being tipped over at a random angle like Uranus.\nSo it is generally believed that for terrestrial planets with dense atmospheres like Venus one reason for developing a retrograde rotation from a prograde rotation (in the same direction as the other planets) could be the core-mantle friction inside the planet - together with atmospheric tides, and the \"obliquity\" angle between the planet's equator and the plane of its orbit around the Sun.\nSeasons on Venus?\nOne of the important characteristics of the Earth is its seasonal cycle - Winter, Spring, Summer and Autumn. It causes changes of vegetation especially in the mid-latitudes of our planet. But every planet in the solar system has seasons, because seasons are caused by two factors: axial tilt and varying distance from the Sun due to orbital eccentricity. Since the Earth's orbit is nearly circular, it has little effect on the seasons. The main factor is our planet's axial tilt which causes almost all seasonal change. When the north pole is tilted toward the Sun, it is northern spring and summer. Six months later the north pole tilts away from the Sun and we experience northern autumn and winter.\nVenus and Jupiter both have quite small axial tilts of about three degrees compared to the Earth's 23.5 degree tilt. Consequently seasonal changes on those planets are correspondingly small. Spring on Venus is not very different from autumn. The plane's dense, acidic atmosphere produces a runaway greenhouse effect (See: The clouds of Venus!) that keeps the surface at 500 degrees Centigrade the year round - that's hot enough to melt lead!\nGo to the corresponding Brief InfoSheet\nBack to the List of Extended InfoSheets.\n|last modified: 2004/02/16|\n|© ESO Education & Public Relations Department\nKarl-Schwarzschild-Strasse 2, D-85748 Garching, Germany"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:b669e442-bdd5-4c76-9ea1-7c258d86f211>","<urn:uuid:f7b2b128-02ce-4824-9564-6026e1fd3034>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the similarities between the sculptural styles found at Elephanta caves and Mahabalipuram temples, particularly in terms of their UNESCO World Heritage status and religious significance?","answer":"Both Elephanta caves and Mahabalipuram monuments are UNESCO World Heritage Sites featuring significant Hindu sculptural art. The Elephanta caves showcase extensive Shiva-themed sculptures, including the famous Mahesha trimurti and other elaborate carvings of Hindu deities, while Mahabalipuram features various Hindu temples and sculptures, including depictions of deities like Shiva, Vishnu, and Durga. Both sites demonstrate sophisticated rock-cut architecture, with Elephanta dating to the 6th century CE and Mahabalipuram's monuments dating from the 7th-8th century CE. The sites were created under different dynasties - Elephanta possibly by Kalachuris or Konkan Mauryas, and Mahabalipuram by the Pallavas - but both reflect the high level of artistic and architectural achievement in ancient Indian temple construction.","context":["The monsoon has lingered a bit longer this time and we are yet to experience the moderate nippy Konkan winter. So I guess the long ride along the coastline is about 4-5 weeks away. However, Mumbai city is very much inside the Konkan belt and there is a lot to explore here too. Whether it is the rock cut cave architecture or the British era gothic buildings … many monuments to time travel. Mumbai or Bombay was once called Heptanesia in Greek by Ptolemy, because it was then a city made of seven islands. A few miles away in the sea was an ancient trading hub known as Shripuri. For several centuries boats coming into this port were welcomed by a mammoth Elephant statue signifying wealth and prosperity. We can visit this island even today … it is a world heritage site known as Gharapuri or Elephanta; famous for its rock cut Hindu-Shaiva caves. Let us take the first boat out of Mumbai port from the Gateway jetty.\nElephanta was built perhaps 50 years after Jogeshwari caves were excavated; which means around the beginning of the sixth century. (Stories in Stone – Dr. Suraj Pandit) It was an important trading centre from the Satavahan and Vakataka era. It was the capital of North Konkan territory later. Basis the Roman Amphorae and other relics found here it is deduced that Roman ships were coming into this harbour for trading around 1-3rd century BCE. Seagulls gave us company throughout the boat ride. We were extremely fortunate because among many huge ships anchored around Mumbai harbour, we also saw INS Virat … An Indian navy aircraft carrier soon to be retired.\nAfter about 75 minutes in boat we reached the Gharapuri island jetty. The island is encircled by mangroves. There are two hills on the island … the western hill is also known as the gun hill and the main caves have been excavated at the base of this cave. We have to climb up about 200mtrs in height; which is a 15 minute walk through a tiny touristy market to reach the main cave. About 1200 people from the Koli community live today on this island… tourists are not allowed to stay overnight here. Sometimes when you land into Mumbai, you can spot the island next to the JNPT port.\nWhich dynasty sponsored the excavation of Elephanta is not yet fully clear. A few historians have credited this monument to the Konkan Mauryas. Historians like Karl Khandalavala and Hiranand Shastri are proponents of the Konkan Maurya theory. Whereas researchers like Walter Spink opine that Konkan Maurya did not have the capacity to sponsor a mammoth excavation of this scale. Kalachuris who excavated Jogeshwari caves are benefactors of Elephanta too according to Spink. We will revisit this interesting debate between Spink and Khandalavala later in this blog. Though there is a Garbhagriha and linga in the main cave, the whole layout is more like a rectangular museum gallery. Each sculpture has a specific panel like space as if an exhibition has been designed on Lord Shiva. In the medieval times when the Europeans first saw this monument they were astonished. Dom Joao De Castro says that this fine Hindu monument appears to be beyond human capacity.\nThe main cave at Elephanta has striking similarity with the Dumar lena at Verul (Ellora) caves too. According to M N Dhavalikar the sculptural style at Elephanta belongs to the Vakataka-Gupta tradition and has influences of Gandhar style too especially the square stupa base at Mirpur Khas. Considering Kanheri had links with Sindh, this seems probable.\nThe geometric balance of the columns and the rhythm they create in the main cave is beyond verbal description. They hold a striking similarity with the columns at Jogeshwari caves … who knows the same artisans worked on both sites. We start with square shafts and then round carved section and then cushion capitals. Ganesha murtis on the corners add a refreshing flavour to the structure.\nThe Mahesha trimurti, which is also the logo of the Maharashtra Tourism Development corporation is perhaps the most celebrated sculpture of this cave. Many have confused this with Bramha Vishnu and Mahesh but this is a Shiva-Trimurti – meaning three forms of Shiva together. If you see from the viewer’s perspective; the left Murti is Bhairava the destroyer, the central image is that of meditative and calm Tatpurusha and the one on the right hand side is Vamadeva or supporter of life. The fourth form is not carved because it is on the opposite side and the fifth one is beyond the sensorial ability of mortal humans.\nThe doorkeepers are more than 12 feet in height. The dwarfs we see next to them are known as Ayudhapurushas. When the weapons take a human form, they are called Ayudhapurusha.\nThis is the spectacle of Shiva-Parvati wedding. King Himavana is getting the coy bride ready for the union and Bramha is officiating the wedding.\nArdhanarishvara … the idol is 16 feet 9 inches … composite of male-female form … exaggerated hips … full breasts … delicate left hand … balanced by strong robust rigid male form reclining gently on Nandi. Many other gods are depicted here with the Ardhanarishwara … Vishnu on Garuda .. Bramha on lotus … Indra on Airavat … holding his Vajra or thunderbolt .. Ganesha … Kartikeya and several other celestial figures … convinced Bramha that need for female form is necessary to pro create.\n16 feet high Shiva in Gangadhara form … Shiva receiving Ganga through jata … Parvati piqued head turned away … Shiva extending an arm to assure her … Parvati 12 feet 4 inch high … King Bhagirath seen kneeling here.\nShiva as Bhairava 11.5 feet in height … Andhakasura Anugraha Murti … boon from Bramha that every drop of blood fallen will give him a new life … holding a bowl and Chamunda is drinking the blood … skull and cobra on the headdress … crescent moon is iconographic feature … especially in Pashupata tradition … Soma and Rudra implored together … Rigveda .. skull rosary hung over left shoulder … out of 8 hands 5 are now broken so are the legs .. one has sword about to slay the demon … bell for warning … bowl to collect blood … another has head of Nila … elephant friend of Andhakasura\ndancing Shiva 10 foot 8 inch in height … tandava … 6 feet 9 inch tall parvati watching the dance in admiration.\nRavananugraha … Kailasa shaken in arrogance by Ravana … sovled the fight between Shiva and Parvati … Ravana blessed by Shiva…. Another version Ravana was pinned down by Shiva under the mountain …\nIf we walk past the eastern court we see Kartikeya, Ganesha and Matruka sculptures. IN most of the caves the columns are standing strong… in some the rock has been exposed. Ancient fortifications have been discovered too. Shiva is Lakulish form gives us a clue about who sponsored the caves.\nWe see the lord Shiva sitting on lotus supported by two nagas just like Bhagwan Buddha.. he is in meditative pose. This Lakulisha form is the speciality of the Pashupata sect. Considering Kalachuris were Pashupatas Walter Spink’s theory gains credence. As per the copper plate found in Abhona, Kalachuris (King Krishnaraja) were Pashupat sect followers. Krishnaraja’s Krishnaraja rupaka a copper coin was found in large numbers on the Elephanta cave. According to Shobhana Gokhale these coins were minted to pay remuneration to the artisans building these caves. Walter Spink dates the caves to the first part of the 6th century and the Kalachuris ruled the region till chalukya overpowered them in the 7th century.\nThe Portuguese occupied this cave in 1534CE. They destroyed, vandalized, desecrated many sculptures… which were used for firing and target practise. John Fryer and Ovington have documented this. De Coutto has also validated the authenticity of this vandalism by the Portuguese. They tried to convert cave no.6 into a church (something they did at the Mandapeshwar caves) According to Garcia Orta he found waterlogging and grazing cattle here in 1550CE. According to some Shivaji and Sambhaji visited the island in the 17th century.\nWe saw two huge cannons on the gun hill. We can see Raj Bandar and puri village from this high point. We can also spot the massive cranes at the JNPT port and the ancient water stream that flows through the ravine between the east and west hill. Under the canons there is something mysterious to explore.\nPerhaps these underground passages were used to move ammunition between two posts. This island was used to keep a watch on the naval traffic in the region. We can get some understanding of the medieval Elephanta through some British paintings.\nThe elephanta that once stood magnificently at the Raj Bandar was broken while it was being taken to Europe. It is now assembled together and kept outside the Bhau Daji Lad museum.\nSo our time machine is in the early sixth century … Mandapeshwar and Jogeshwari will take us back into fifth century and Kanheri will make us travel to the first century BCE. When we visit the Banaganga lake we will come back in time to the Silahara era. Lots to explore … keep watching this space.\nभारताचे संस्कृती वैभव – शोभना गोखले,\nStories in Stone – Dr. Suraj Pandit,\nCultural Heritage of Mumbai – Dr. M K Dhavalikar,\nElephanta – George Michell","#1 of 19 Places to Visit in Mahabalipuram\nAt a distance of 2 Kms from Mahabalipuram Bus Station, The Shore Temple (700-728 CE) is so named because it over looks the Bay of Bengal.

{"question":"What are the historical significance of opals and what are the proper care instructions to maintain them?","answer":"Historically, opals were discovered as far back as 4000 B.C. in Kenya and were highly valued by Ancient Greek & Roman civilizations. The name comes from Latin 'Opalus' and Greek 'Opallius', meaning 'to perceive a color change.' Queen Victoria particularly loved opals and helped restore their reputation in the 19th century after being considered unlucky. As for care, opals require special attention since they are relatively soft (6 on the MoHs scale) and water-rich. They should be removed during heavy work or gardening, and protected from chemicals, especially chlorine. Avoid ultrasonic cleaners for opals.

There exists artifacts containing this gorgeous gemstone dating back as far as 4000 B.C., uncovered by anthropologist Louis Leakey in a cave located in Kenya. Opal has certainly been described and used further along in history by the Ancient Greek & Roman civilizations, but this finding of artifacts is a significant point in history where we can place opal being used. In gemmology terms, in reference to the most important source of opals today, the discovery of opals in Australia was made by the geologist Johannes Menge in 1849. Gemmology as a distinct science would not exist yet until 1908, when Samuel Barnett proposed setting up examinations and the teaching of gemmology. The name 'opal' is actually derived from the Latin 'Opalus' and Greek 'Opallius', both meaning 'to perceive a colour change' which is very apt for this vibrant gemstone. Opal Lore\n“Some opali carry such a play within them that they equal the deepest and richest colors of painters. Others…simulate the flaming fire of burning sulphur and even the bright blaze of burning oil.” - Gaius Plinius Secundus (AD 23/24 – 79) The opal gemstone is the recognised birthstone for October, and it is brimming with superstition and magic. A novel written in the 1800s sparked this worry of it being seen as 'unlucky' to wear opals unless you were born in the month of October, especially darker toned opals, although by Queen Victoria's reign in the mid to latter half of the 19th century, the Opal was back in fashion. Queen Victoria loved opals, and wore them throughout her reign, famously even receiving Queen Charlotte's opal cabochon and pearl ring from her Aunt Princess Mary in 1849. Prince Albert gifted their daughters with opals on their wedding days, promoting a more positive view of this spectacular gemstone.\nImage source; Royal Collection Trust. Queen Charlotte's Opal Finger Ring. Opal is credited by a mix of culture to be associated with supernatural origins and powers. European legends see the gem a symbol of hope, purity and honesty. Falling from the cosmos in lightning storms, as told by Arabic legends, or the belief that opals lend their wearers the gift of prophecy and guarded them from disease, as believed by the Ancient Greeks.\nGemmology So what are opals made from, and how do they form? Opals are a hydrated amorphous form composed of silicia, which consists of multiple tiny spheres all arranged in a regular pattern with water in-between the spheres . The opals form when silica rich water seeps into deep cracks within the Earth's crust at low temperatures, and then some 5-6 million later under the right conditions, et voila opal is formed. Due to opals having amorphous properties, the opal gemstone is classed as a minerloid rather than a mineral. The silica spheres act as a prism to the light entering the opal, and create the fabulous play of colour for which opal is so prized. The play of colour can be more subtle or extremely intense, dependant on the size of the spheres and the spaces inbetween them.\nBecause opals are so water rich, they are very susceptible to drying out and cracking; It is not uncommon to see incorrectly stored opals begin to show signs of this, and this is also why a lot of gemstone suppliers believe they need to ship their loose opals in water, but this is generally seen in the industry as not necessary and not recommended. Care instructions recommend environments that are not too dry, and in temperatures that are not too high. Opals are also a relatively softer gemstone, sitting at a 6 on the MoHs scale of hardness, a scale that places gemstones relative to each other in their ability to resist abrasion. For reference a diamond sits at a 10 and is the hardest material on the scale. The ranking of 6 means opals can be scratched and scuffed easily, and this is also why you will see them fashioned most frequently as a cabochon, a style that offers more protection than sharp faceted sides and angles.\nTypes Of Opal Opal is sorted into two broad classes, known as common opal and precious opal. It is found all around the world, but the most important source of opal is found in Australia. So what is the difference between these two groups of opal? The opal you see that displays the colour flashes and play of colour is precious opal, whereas common opal is visually distinct from this group and does not display any play of colour, but does still exist in a range of colours. Within this category of common opal, the groups can be split and defined further into ;\nImage Source ; Wikipedia ( Wood Opal ) - Image showing petrified wood which has been replaced by opal and now carries an opalescent sheen Famous Opals\nThe Andamooka Opal is arguably one of the most famous opals, also referred to as 'The Queen's Opal' due to its connection to Queen Elizabeth II. The stone is a 203 carat opal found in 1949 in the Andamooka opal field of Australia. The opal was cut and set into a choker and gifted to Queen Elizabeth II in 1954 during her first state trip to Australia, the piece of jewellery is considered a significant jewel within the Queen's state jewellery collection.\nImage source; Pinterest. The Andamooka Opal set into the choker necklace gifted to Queen Elizabeth II\nQueen Alexandra inherited an opal tiara (The Oriental Circlet Tiara) from Queen Victoria when she died in 1901, which featured 11 precious opals. The tiara was designed by Prince Albert himself to gift to Queen Victoria, opals were said to be his favourite stone so a lot of Queen Victoria's jewellery collection is said to include opal pieces. Queen Alexandra firmly believed that opals brought misfortune so she had them changed to rubies before she began wearing the tiara. The crown still remains within the The Royal Collection with the intention of being worn by all future queens, and still houses the rubies.\nImage source; Left - royalwatcherblog.

Found by an opal miner in an Australian opal mine in 1987, this carnivorous marine reptile's bones had been opalised thanks to the area of land it was buried in to have an exceptional level of opal mineral in the ground. This resulted in the bones having a beautiful shine to them. The miner who found Eric sold him off to a businessman to begin the reconstruction of the skeleton, but due to huge financial difficulty, he considered breaking it apart to be sold off for jewellery. The Australian Museum purchased the skeleton in 1993 where it is now on display and is considered a national treasure to the country.\nImage source; The Australian Museum.\nSome Current Opal Pieces In Stock","Depending on the design of your jewellery, fine and delicately set rings will need lot more care than plain unset bands when you wear them. Over the years we have seen many repairs with rings bent out of shape, missing Diamonds or chipped stones.\nGold is a soft metal and to make your jewellery last follow few simple rules and you will enjoy your jewellery for many years to come.\nAvoid wearing your rings\nLifting weights and other gym equipment can severely damage your band and setting, in some cases we have seen chipped Diamonds and gemstones, bands with impression of bars.\nHeavy work or gardening\nDepending on your ring design, some jewellery especially with fine settings can end up with bent claws, or the whole ring can be bent out of shape.\nYou can also damage your gemstones or Diamonds.\nSome chemicals especially chlorine can cause permanent damage to some gemstones, especially opal and pearls. Your gold can also suffer from discoloration, so protect your rings by using gloves or remove your rings.\nCaring for your jewellery\nGemstone Jewellery Care\nThe hardness of each gemstone is measured by Mohs scale (0-10). It determines the characteristics, durability and care needed, when wearing these gems.\nMost gemstones will scuff over time with every day wear, especially if you wear them while doing heavy work, at gym or gardening (we strongly advice to remove them.)\nCleaning most gemstones at home is safe, but always follow the instructions if you are using the sonic.\nWe recommend to use warm soapy water and very soft toothbrush.\nSome gems like Tanzanite and Emeralds are sensitive to sudden changes of temperature, so if you are unsure of how to clean your gemstone jewellery, or not sure what type of gem is in your jewellery, get in touch with us so we can help you.\nHousehold bleach can damage most gemstones, but also discolour your gold. Remove your jewellery before cleaning.\nStore your jewellery in separate pouches or boxes to prevent them from scratching each other.\nDiamond Jewellery Care\nWe encourage you to bring your Diamond jewels to us for a professional check and clean at least once per year. Daily wear, dust, hand creams and pollution all contribute to dull Diamonds and gems. Diamonds refract light and once the pavilion (underside) of the stone is dirty, they can lose their sparkle depending on the cut. Baguette cut Diamonds need the most frequent care due to their large flat surface areas.\nProtect your jewellery from hard impact, as even Diamonds can chip if hit with enough force or at the wrong angle. If you have an accidental bump, check your setting for any sharp claws or chipped stones.\nIf possible, bring your piece for a professional check as damaged and worn out settings can make your Diamonds unsecured.\nStore your Diamond jewels in separate cloth pouches or lined jewellery boxes to prevent them from scratching each other.\nOpal Jewellery Care\nAustralia produces over 95% of the world’s opal supply. Opals are fragile gems and can break on impact. Their hardness is similar to glass, so extra care is necessary when wearing and cleaning them. We recommend removing your opal rings for any heavy work and gardening. Avoid contact with bleach, chemicals and do not use ultrasonic cleaners.\nSolid opals are a natural opal cut into desired shape and can be cleaned with warm soapy water and extra soft toothbrush or cloth. Solid opals unlike doublets or triplets are fine in water, but some opal varieties can dry out and crack if they are exposed to very dry conditions or extreme change in temperature.\nDoublets and triplets need little more care when cleaning and caring for them. Doublets and triplets are made from layers which are glued together. Doublets have thin slice of opal and black backing and triplets have an extra layer of glass or quartz on top.\nExcessive exposure to heat and water can deteriorate the adhesive and damage your opal. When cleaning, avoid leaving you opal in water, use soapy warm water and soft toothbrush quickly without soaking and wipe dry with soft cloth.\nPearl Jewellery Care\nDue to their organic nature, there are few rules you can follow to keep your pearls looking their best.\nAvoid contact with chemicals and perfume.\nAfter wearing your pearls, wipe them over with soft cloth and store them in a soft pouch to avoid scratching on other jewellery.\nNever clean your pearls in ultrasonic cleaners.\nTo maintain their luster, you can clean your pearls with a damp soft cloth with a drop of olive oil. Restringing your pearls once per year may be necessary if you wear them often, otherwise once every three years is sufficient.\nWe offer restringing services and recommend having your pearls checked once per year if you wear them often.\nPearls in rings and earrings are glued on and it is recommended to have your ring checked regularly as the glue can break down over time and your pearl can become loose.\nSterling Silver Jewellery Care\nSterling silver will tarnish with time, depending on how often you wear it, acids in the skin and exposure to elements (like water and air). Chemicals (like perfume, cleaning products, swimming pool or ocean water) also contribute to tarnishing.\nTo reduce tarnishing, store your sterling silver in a jewellery box or soft pouch in a dry place and remove\nyour jewellery before working out and swimming.\nWe recommend professional cleaning by our staff once per year or as often as you feel necessary.\nOther times you can use a soft jewellery cleaning cloth or Silver cleaning solution.\nFor professional jewellery clean and check\nGet in touch with us or pop in and speak to our jewellers. We recommend having your jewellery serviced about once per year to 18 months.

{"question":"How do the hypothetical planets Nibiru and Planet Nine differ in terms of their scientific credibility and evidence? For example, what kind of observations or data support each one's potential existence? 请详细说明这两个假设行星的区别。","answer":"Nibiru and Planet Nine have very different levels of scientific credibility. Nibiru is considered a complete hoax with no scientific evidence - if it existed with its claimed 3,600-year orbit, it would already be visible to the naked eye and its gravitational effects would be obvious. The Nibiru story originated from unscientific claims by Nancy Lieder about alien communications. In contrast, Planet Nine has multiple lines of scientific evidence supporting its possible existence, including five different observational clues noted by Caltech scientists. These include the strange orbital behaviors of Kuiper Belt objects, the tilted solar system plane, and objects orbiting in opposite directions. Scientists are actively searching for Planet Nine using the Subaru Telescope, though its existence remains unconfirmed.","context":["NASA Warns Disaster is Near: Nibiru is Headed Straight for Earth.\nAsteroid ‘Nibiru’ On Collision Course with Earth, according to NASA Whistleblowers.\nA story doing rounds online, shared widely on social media sites, warns people that the so called rogue Planet/Asteroid in our solar system Nibiru is heading straight for Earth, and that NASA has warned of a Disaster in near future. The story became popular, also because of the historical allegations and conspiracy about the Planet X or Nibiru supposedly colliding with the course of Earth, causing Polar Shift and catastrophic consequences. So let us also analyze all those claims in detail, whether or not they are facts.\nAbout the Current Story\nThe story in question originated from a 10th March 2016 article on News 4 KTLA website news4ktla.com, which as a matter of fact, has been publishing many hoax stories as local and national news. For example, earlier they published a fake article saying a 9 Year Old Murdered his Parents after they Turned off WiFi for Punishment. The article mentioned above stated that NASA has known about the mystery planet Nibiru for years, but declined to warn us until now. Many such allegations have in fact been around online since years.\nOrigin of Nibiru Stories\nThe origin of these messages goes back to 1995, when a Wisconsin woman named Nancy Lieder has claimed that while she was a girl, gray extraterrestrials called Zetas from the Zeta Reticuli star system contacted her and implanted a communications device in her brain. She said that she was chosen by the Zetas to warn mankind that the extraterrestrial object she called Planet X would sweep through the inner Solar System in May 2003, making the Earth undergo a pole shift and destroy most of humanity. Nancy came up with a website called ZetaTalk.com where she published all this information. This prediction spread beyond Nancy’s website and created lot of concern around world.\nDespite the claims, nothing happened in May 2003, and later Nancy Lieder claimed that the date of her prediction was merely a “White Lie” to fool the establishment, and added that, if the true date is declared, it will create chaos. However, part of the copyright information of her website says – “The opinions expressed are solely those of the Zeta Reticulans, and are not necessarily the opinions of their emissary, Nancy, or any other party“. So this explains there is no valid scientific evidence for the claims of Nancy Lieder.\nThere were wild claims on the Internet, supposedly from ‘whistleblowers,’ that NASA scientists have confirmed Nibiru’s existence. There were many such stories about Nibiru on fantasy/satirical websites as well. In later years came the Dooms day claims on 21 December 2012 relating to ancient Mayan calendar – that a planet will collide Earth and the world will come to an end. There were also the messages claiming as the interplanetary Nibiru will pass on our solar system, world is going to witness two Suns in the sky. These two different fables of Planet X and Nibiru were linked by several internet news and doomsday groups and the date of the collision was moved forward to December 2012. Although Nancy called this extraterrestrial object as “Planet X”, it was later associated with Nibiru, a planet proposed by an ancient astronaut, Zecharia Sitchin from his ancient studies of Babylonian religious texts, which was discussed in his 1976 book called “The 12th Planet“.\nIn his book, Sitchin mentioned a giant planet called Nibiru or Marduk that passes by Earth every 3,600 years, and as it passes, it allows its extraterrestrial inhabitants to interact with the humanity. However, Sitchin denied any connection between his studies and Nancy’s claims. He wrote another book called “The End of Days“, partly in response to Nancy’s claims, where he mentioned that the last time Nibiru passed by Earth was during 556 BC, which means it would return again around AD 2900, considering its supposed 3,600 year orbit.\nExistence of Nibiru\nAccording to EarthSky website earthsky.org, the planet/asteroid Nibiru is not real; there is no scientific evidence to support its existence. It is a hypothetical phenomenon that it is going to pass by, or bombard Earth. If Nibiru were to exist in real, given its orbital period is 3,600 years, it should by now be well inside the orbit of Jupiter. It should be visible to the naked eye, just like Jupiter, and Earth would have clearly felt the effects of its gravity. In a related Question & Answers section, NASA confirmed that Nibiru and other stories about wayward planets are an Internet hoax.\nPolar Shift Theory\nIn the link mentioned above NASA explained this phenomenon too. Polar shift theory talks about the reversal in the rotation of Earth, which is impossible and has never happened. It is a fact that there is slow movement in continents like Antarctica (which was near equator some hundreds of millions of years ago), but it is no way related to reversal of rotational poles. The ‘disaster’ websites falsely claim a relationship between the rotation of Earth and its magnetic polarity. The magnetic polarity does change irregularly; the magnetic reversal happening every 400,000 years on an average. But such magnetic reversal is not known to cause any harm to life on Earth.\nTo conclude, there is no scientific evidence to support the existence of Planet X or Nibiru said to collide with Earth. Like the world did not end in December 2012, the stories about Nibiru or Planet X are therefore hoaxes.\nHoax or Fact:\nGiant Asteroid named 1950 DA Will Collide With Our Planet\nPlanetary Alignment Causes Zero Gravity Day on Earth\nNASA Confirms Earth Will Experience 6 Days of Total Darkness in December 2014\nNASA Predicts Total Blackout of Planet Earth in Dec. 2012\nPictures Showing Two Suns in Sky Due to Hunter’s Moon Phenomenon","NASA has stated that it's quite likely that our solar system is home to a massive, distant ninth planet. Its existence could shed light on some burning questions about the cosmos.\nEarlier this month, NASA issued a press release stating that it’s likely that our solar system has a ninth planet—even if it’s proving difficult to find.\nThe planet could have a mass ten times that of Earth’s, and be situated twenty times as far from the sun as Neptune. It’s being referred to as “Planet Nine,” and while it’s very difficult to procure clear evidence of its existence, some scientists are absolutely convinced that it’s out there.\n“There are now five different lines of observational evidence pointing to the existence of Planet Nine,” said Konstantin Batygin, a planetary astrophysicist at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), who is part of a team on the search for the planet.\n“If you were to remove this explanation and imagine Planet Nine does not exist, then you generate more problems than you solve. All of a sudden, you have five different puzzles, and you must come up with five different theories to explain them.”\nIn a 2016 paper, Batygin and co-author Mike Brown detailed six known objects in the Kuiper Belt that behave rather strangely. All of them have elliptical orbits pointing in the same direction, and all of those orbits are tilted the same way. Both of these traits serve as clues to the presence of Planet Nine.\nComputer simulations that took the hypothesized planet into account indicated that there should also be several other bodies with more extreme tilts from the solar plane, on the order of 90 degrees. Brown realized that astronomers are already aware of five such objects, meaning nature did fit with the simulations.\nPlanet Nine would also explain why the plane in which the other planets orbit is tilted about six degrees away from the sun’s equator: over time, Planet Nine’s distant gravity has made the entire solar system plane wobble away from center.\nFinally, there are the objects in the Kuiper belt that orbit in the opposite direction of everything else in our solar system.\n“No other model can explain the weirdness of these high-inclination orbits,” explained Batygin. “It turns out that Planet Nine provides a natural avenue for their generation. These things have been twisted out of the solar system plane with help from Planet Nine and then scattered inward by Neptune.”\nBased on the behavior of these distant objects, the astronomers believe the planet to be a Super-Earth, a massive rocky planet that is extremely common in the universe—but which our solar system, oddly, lacks. The planet could have coalesced out in the cold reaches of our system over millions of years, formed close to the sun and then been flung outward, or even been captured by the Sun from another system.\nBatygin and Brown are using the Subaru Telescope at Hawaii’s Mauna Kea Observatory to continue their search for Planet Nine. According to Batygin, this telescope is the best tool available to hunt down something dim and distant in the vast expanse of sky.\nHowever, Planet Nine isn’t the only explanation for the orbital behaviors observed. A recent survey of the outer solar system found over 800 trans-Neptunian objects. A random distribution of this matter could also potentially have the same effect on the tilt on the traits observed in various orbits—but the jury is still out."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:2ef8e4d8-8fc6-45c1-8725-d0cc470a27ea>","<urn:uuid:61ab4d58-6d5d-40a2-bf46-96ce083d3ae2>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I'm studying insects! Do the Green Longhorn moth and Longhorned beetle have anything in common regarding their antennae?","answer":"Yes, both species are characterized by their notably long antennae. The male Green Longhorn moth has very long white antennae with rough black hair on their heads, while the Longhorned beetles are easily recognized by the long antennae on their heads.","context":["Is the stag beetle coming back to the Sonian?\nThe stag beetle is our country’s largest and most impressive beetle. The adult male has huge pincer-shaped jaws and can grow to 7 or 8 centimetres. The female has smaller jaws and is only half as large. The larvae live mainly in oak stumps, but also in rotten beech or chestnut wood. The metamorphosis takes place only after four or five years. The adult insects crawl out of their hiding place on the first warm days of June. Stag beetles live a short but intense life. The males fight to determine who wins the female for himself. The winner takes her between his jaws and then it is time to mate. The female digs a corridor and after two weeks, lays some fifteen eggs there.\nIn the Sonian Forest, the stag beetle has no longer been observed for a number of decades. In a residential area in Boitsfort, a few hundred metres from the forest, a colony has still been able to maintain itself. With appropriate stewardship, the managers hope to again be able to welcome this protected species to the Sonian Forest.\nThe ground beetle: keen on dead wood\nThis beetle is brown-black in colour with a purplish sheen and can be between 2.5 and 4.5 centimetres in size. It has rough wing cases. These were originally wings that hardened in order to protect the insect. Because of that, the ground beetle can no longer fly, but it has evolved into a great runner.\nThe ground beetle is a predator that feeds primarily on slugs, snails, larvae of other insects and earthworms. It loves undergrowth, especially dead leaves, which it finds mainly beneath tree trunks, fallen branches and old tree stumps. To maintain the populations of this insect, it will thus suffice if you always allow enough dead wood to remain on the\nBroad-bodied chaser dragonfly gives as good as it gets\nThe broad-bodied chaser is a commonly found true dragonfly. It is a pioneer species that is usually found in newly landscaped pools and ponds. The male defends his territory from a lookout post. He uses twigs or reeds for that. Rivals of his own species are chased away, but other dragonfly species are also forced to surrender. How do you recognise the broad-bodied chaser? Males have a frosty blue abdomen. Females are often brownish with a lighter to yellow colour along the sides of the abdomen.\nThe vapourer moth and its motley caterpillar\nButterflies are among the insects that undergo a complete metamorphosis. The vapourer moth is a diurnal moth of the family of yellow-tail moths. Noteworthy in this species are its colourful caterpillars. These are more brightly coloured at a young age than when they are fully grown. Oddly enough, it would appear that brighter coloured young caterpillars are more difficult for birds to detect, while this effect decreases as the caterpillars mature. The imagos, that is to say the adult butterflies, no longer feed and thus only live for a fairly short while, even in the SonianForest.\nThe Green Longhorn moth: shining in the sun\nOne of the most numerous, most often sighted moth species in spring is undoubtedly the green longhorn moth. It is a small diurnal moth with metallic wings that shine like a jewel in the sunlight. These moths feel best in forests, between April and May. You will often encounter them in the SonianForest too. The males can be easily recognised by their very long antennae that are coloured white and by the rough black hair on their heads. The females, on the other hand, have somewhat shorter antennae, with shorter, lighter coloured hair. The caterpillar lives on the ground in a kind of pouch, made of plant debris, from which it also feeds.","Common pests that attack logs.\nWood Boring Beetles\nWood Boring Powderpost Beetle-\nA small wood boring beetle that begins its life on the surface of an unfinished log and burrows in as larvae where they tunnel through the wood eating the starches and nutrients in the wood needed for development. Because they begin as larvae on the surface, finished wood is a great defense against further infestation as the baby larvae do not have the ability to bore through a finished surface. Once in the wood the larvae can spend many years inside before emerging through a round emergence hole with a small pile of dust left as an indicator. True Powderpowder post beetles or lyctid beetle only attack hardwoods generally such as oak, maple and mahogany, so their real threat comes in the form of flooring, hardwood furniture and other hardwood household items.\nExit Holes- Round and vary from 1/32 to 1/16 inch\nFrass- Small piles of very fine flour-like wood powder on or under the wood. A slight jarring of the wood makes the frass sift from the holes.\nLonghorned beetle or Round Headed Wood Borers (larvae common name)\nLonghorned beetles are one of the most common pests that can be found in log homes. They are easily recognized by the long antennae on the heads. Treatment is up to the homeowner as if this is the pest that is affecting your home there is no really good treatment. They do not re-infest a home after their emergence because they will not bore into seasoned wood. Treatment is not recommended.\nExit Hole- 3/16 to 1/4 inch oval\nFrass- course and fibrous\nFlat-headed wood borers\nAdult beetles are sometimes called metallic wood borers because of their showy coloration. The larvae are similar to longhorned beetle larvae, except that the area behind the head is somewhat flattened. Like longhorned beetles these wood borers do not re-infest and thus their potential for damage is limited.\nExit Holes- flattened oval in shape 1/4 to 5/8 inch long oval holes; twice as long as wide.Frass- Powdery and fibrous\nAnother beetle that is often called a Powderpost beetle, Anobiid beetles can infest both hard and softwoods making them a common pest in many infestations. They have a slow productivity time in the infestation so even if a home is infested from the beginning of its life it may not be detected for up to ten years. Anobiids prefer moist areas so thought treatment is possible, moisture prevention should be a number one concern.\nBorates are a good treatment for this beetle.\nFrass- The frass of most Anobiid beetles contains numerous fecal pellets which are often stuck together in clumps. Look for the accumulation of powdery frass and tiny pellets underneath infested wood or streaming from exit holes.\nExit holes- round and vary from 1/16 to 1/8 inch in diameter.\nOld House Borers\nThey are large insect that attacks softwoods with a life cycle that can extend to 10 or more years with the first emergence five to seven years after construction. Some studies show that they remain in the larval stage up to 15 years. Early signs can be the noise made by older larvae chewing in the wood, especially in the middle of the night when larvae are most active.\nLike an anobiid beetle infestation, most structural damage is caused by water infiltrating into exterior emergence holes, thus promoting decay.\nExit Holes- 1/4 to 5/8 inch oval-almost round hole\nFrass- Fine powder with small tight packed pellets\nCarpenter bees are bees that bore into solid and decaying wood to create nests. These nests can extend up to 10 inches into the wood and be used more than once. If they are reused they can be made larger and more complex and can house more than one grouping eventually creating tunnels that can reach up to 10 feet into larger timbers.\nExit/Entrance Holes- slightly less than 1/2 inch and perfectly round\nFrass- yellowed stained coarse sawdust\nFlat Headed Wood Borer\nOld House Borer\nTreatment for infestations is generally not that difficult, but more often then not there is a root cause for the problem that involves moisture in the wood. Many wood boring insects search out decaying wood so to truly solve the issue one must replace the wood that is rotting to control the problem. Replacing the infested wood in conjunction with proprer insecticides is the proper way to take care of wood boring insects."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:38158143-8fd6-4f4f-9be6-9b38b396bade>","<urn:uuid:96ec2ea1-dce5-4529-8aee-63e8036f002c>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What were the devastating consequences of introducing the Skafandro diving suit for sponge diving in Greece? Looking for specific mortality statistics.","answer":"The introduction of the Skafandro (standard diving suit) in 1865 led to severe casualties among sponge divers. While it allowed divers to reach depths of 70 meters for longer periods, they suffered from decompression sickness due to lack of knowledge about proper decompression procedures. Between 1886 and 1910, approximately 10,000 divers died and 20,000 became permanently disabled. In the first years of using the standard suit, about half of the divers either became paralyzed or died from decompression sickness. The situation was so severe that Turkish authorities temporarily banned the suit in 1882 at the request of Kalymnos women who were losing their male relatives to diving accidents.","context":["Diving the Skafandro suit\nCopyright © by Sandra Hendrikse and André Merks\nTranslation and layout: Bert Dodde\nWith it's size of about 8 by 16 kilometers Kalymnos is a fairly small island in the Aegean Sea. It is part of the Dodekanesos, a group of over 50 islands in the southeast of Greece.\nAlthough sponge diving was a source of income for several Greek islands during the last centuries, Kalymnos is known to be the center of the Greek sponge diving industry. The waters around the Greek islands are very suitable for the sponges to grow, because of the high temperature. The best sponge quality is found in the southeast of the Mediterranean sea.\nIt is unknown when exactly the sponge became an article of use. In ancient writings (Plato, Homerus) the sponge is mentioned as an object used for bathing. In Kalymnos also sponge diving had it's roots in ancient times. It can be seen as the oldest profession on the island. Diving for sponges brought social and economical development to the island.\nIn the old days the \"skin diving\" method was used. The crew went out to sea in a small boat. They used a cilyndrical object with a glass bottom to search the ocean floor for sponges. As soon as one was found, a diver went overboard to get it. He was usually naked and carried a 15 kilogram flat stone, known as the \"skandalopetra\" with him to take him down to the bottom quickly. The diver then cut the sponge loose from the bottom and put a special net around it. Depth an bottom time depended on the divers lung capacity. They usually went down to about 30 meters for 3 to 5 minutes.\nAlthough this was very hard work, this way of diving brought so many sponges to the island that the trade from Kalymnos expanded in a great way around 1800. Half-way the 19-th century Kalymnos had several merchants that became very wealthy. Through the big profits they made on the sponges they also gained a big influence on the social life on the island.\n||As from 1865 trading sponges became \"booming business\". The reason for this was the introduction of the standard diving suit or Skafandro as the Greeks call it. A merchant from the island of Symi brought equipment, probably Siebe Gorman, to the island. The advantages seemed enormous. Now, divers could stay down as long as they wanted in greater depths. The best sponges could be found at depths of about 70 meters. A diver could now walk on the ocean floor and look for them.|\nIn her book \"Bitter Sea\", Faith Warn discribes that in 1868 the sponge diving fleet consisted of:\n|Due to the\nstandard suit the sponge trade got an unlimited growth.\nFrom Kalymnos, ships sailed the Aegean sea and the Medeterranean sea. They went as far as Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Syria and Lebanon. They stayed out at sea for at least 6 months.\nThe profit on the sponges was high. For the divers the working circumstances were better than diving naked. However, there was a big danger in staying down deep for long times: decompression sickness. soon after the standard suit was introduced, the first casualties appeard. The symptoms, heavy pain, paralysis and eventually death must have been terrifying for divers and other crew because they did not have a clue what caused all this !\nA combination of several dives a day to depths up to 70 meters and then coming up without decompression stops did not miss its devastating effect: in the first years the standard suit was used, about half of the divers got paralised or died of decompression sickness. In her book \"Bitter Sea\", Faith Warn discribes that between 1886 and 1910 about 10.000 divers died and 20.000 got pemanently disabled.\nThis was also of big influence on all the people on Kalymnos. Every family had fathers, sons, brothers or other relatives that were paralised or never returned from the sponge diving season. By the end of the 19th century this caused big anxiety on Kalymnos, especially among women. In those days Kalymnos was ocupied by the Turks. The women asked the Turkish sultan to forbid the standard diving suit, which he did in 1882. Profits dropped: the divers had to go \"skin diving\" again. About 4 years later the suit was back and so were the decompression accidents.\n||It is easy to understand why the divers used the standard suit not knowing the dangers: The knowledge of decompression and decompression sickness developed in the 19th century. The studies used sponge diver experiences as input. The first workable decompression table came available around 1910. After that it took several years to get the knowledge to the remote Greek islands. Decompression tables could not prevent all diving accidents. The first tables did not cover repeated dives and the sponge divers made several repeated dives each day. As soon as they found out how important the bottom time was to prevent accidents the bottom time was kept by somebody aboard the ship. They used an hour-glass for this that was not very accurate.|\nSponge diving brought wealth to the island but took a lot of lives as well. In the beginning only the merchants profited from it, later the whole community. Health care and education came available for everybody for free. The merchants posessed the fleet, the factories, restaurants, bars and a factory on Kalymnos were standard diving equipment was produced. English standard diving equipment was copied. Thus, the equipment was cheap and easy to maintain and repair. Spare parts were available on their own island. The \"Xyth Pio\" factory produced standard diving equipment for many years.\nIn the beginning of the 20st century the sponge diving industry had hard times in the Dodekanesos. Around 1900 the growth got to her maximum and both worldwars caused limitations to the trade. From Kalymnos and other islands like Halki and Symi large groups of divers settled in other parts of the world to do what they did best: diving. Around 1905 a group of about 500 divers from the Dodekanesos settled in Tarpon Springs, Florida, USA. These days diving helmets are still made by Nicolas Toth. Nic is the grandson of Antonios Lerios, born on Kalymnos, who settled in Florida in 1913 as a helmet maker.\nAfter the second world war the sponge diving industry almost completely stopped in the Dodekanesos. In those days Australia refused to work together with Japanese divers in the pearl industry. Therefore many Greek divers settled in Australia.\nMany people feel that the introduction of the synthetic sponge ment the end for the sponge diving industry. The biggest problem however, occured in 1986. Nearly all the sponges in the Aegean sea turned out to be infected. The cause of this never became clear. A sudden rise of the water temperature could be the cause. Similar infections appeard in the Gulf of Mexico in the 1940's 70's and 90's.\nAnno 2001 there is hardly anything left of the sponge diving fleet from 1868. From 400 ships, about 10 to 15 are left. In recent years the sponges in the waters around Kalymnos have recovered in a great way. However, local sponge divers announced that they encountered infected sponges again in october 2000.\n|Some sponge diving witnesses can be found on some Greek islands. The capital of Kalymnos, Pothia, has a number of workshops left were sponges are cut and sold. In the harbour, a nautical museum has a display on sponge diving. The helmets you see in the previous page are in this exhibition. Vlihadia, a little town close to Pothia holds the \"Sea World Museum\". The privat collection of the Valsamidi brothers.|\n|Sponge diver in full action. The use of standard diving equipment stopped in the 1970's. Many helmets were then sold as scrap-iron ! Still there are some divers in the sponge diving business. They now wear neoprene suits and a diving mask. They hold a mouthpiece between their teeth. This is attached to a air hose that leads to a compressor on the boat.||\n||One of the many sponge shops you can still find on Kalymnos today. Due to pollution and huge harvesting there are hardly any Mediterranean sponges left. Tourists go home with the higher quality (and more expensive) Greek sponges or with Caribbean and Philippinean sponges that the Greeks import to sell.|\nIf you want to know more about Greek sponge diving and about the effects that it had on the community of Kalymnos we would like to recommend two books:\nMrs. Charmian Clift & Mr. George Johnston (1955), The sponge divers, pub.

{"question":"Can I learn all the technical skills on the job, or do I need classroom training?","answer":"Classroom training through an apprenticeship program is essential because learning technical skills solely on the job is very difficult. While basic tasks like installing receptacles can be taught in the field, there isn't enough time for journeymen to properly teach technical skills like wire sizing, motor calculations, and service building. These technical aspects are better learned in a classroom setting without rushing or fear of failure.","context":["Welcome to Electrician Mentor! The best place on the web for information about How To Become An Electrician and the Electrician Salary. We have all the resources you need to make your journey on becoming an electrician easier.\nApprenticeship requirements, job description, different types of classifications and expected salaries are just some of the helpful guides you will find here at Electrician Mentor.\nI want to personally congratulate you on your decision to enter the electrical field. You are entering a field that is always in high demand for quality skilled men and women.\nThis field is always expanding due to massive new construction projects. In addition older residential, commercial, and industrial electrical systems become outdated and require upgrading or alterations. Below is a list of the my top Electrical books to get you started on your journey.\nMy Favorite Electrician Books:\n# 1 Learn the Electrician Job Description\nThe first step on your journey of learning How To Become An Electrician will be to understand what your new job description entails. It will vary depending on what type of work your employer asks you to perform. An example of this would be residential and the commercial work. Each will have its own set of codes and specific tasks. It will be important to do work that brings you joy. You may decide that this career path could be something you do for the rest of your life therefor you need to make sure its something you really enjoy and could potentially develop a passion for.\nYou need to be able to say YES to most of these questions:\n- Do I enjoy working with my hands?\n- Do I enjoy working outdoors?\n- Would I be good with working in confined spaces?\n- Can I work most of the day off a ladder or areal lift?\n- Do I like heights?\n- Would I enjoy learning a new life skill?\n- Do I enjoy working with others?\nTypically, however, the job entails:\n- Installing, repairing and, maintaining equipment and components in compliance with national electrical codes, standards, and regulations.\n- Operation various testing equipment in locating and determining different types of malfunctions.\n- Knowledge of electrical tools, equipment, and materials common to the trade.\n- Knowledge of the national electrical codes, standards, and regulations.\n- Ability to work off a ladder for an extended period of time.\n- Good written and verbal communication.\n- Ability to pass a background check, drug screen, and physical abilities test.\n- Must have valid drivers license.\n#2 Obtain Appropriate Training\nThe best way to get the appropriate training is to join an apprenticeship program. I have a personal relationship with the representatives in my area for the I.E.C or Independent Electrical Contractors. It is imperative you join an apprenticeship program. I have found that while in the field it is very hard to train an apprentice in the technical areas of become an electrician. Problems arise for example your boss makes you work longer and the time schedule for the project has been accelerated.\nThese are just a few of the problems that make it difficult for a seasoned electrician to teach an apprentice. Small tasks can be taught like how to install a receptacle or set up a new light fixtures. Teaching calculations and the “Why” can be super difficult. Lets face it even I do not know everything and I am a master electrician. In a class room setting an electrician has the opportunity, with out rushing or fear of failure, to learn how to size wire, perform motor calculations, build a service for a house on paper and lots more.\n~~~VERY IMPORTANT INFO ~~~\nIn the field there is just not enough time for a journeyman electrician to teach an apprentice electrician the technical skills an electrician should know.\nRemember, your supervisor wants you to learn and grow because that makes him look good and his job look good which means more money! If you have questions don’t be afraid to ask. Find some time during lunch or before you arrive at the job site. Be curious and ask why he is doing something in a certain way. You can find more about the IEC @ www.IECI.org.\nIndependent Electrical Contractors\nThe IEC is an electrician apprenticeship program registered with the U.S department of Labor, Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training. They have nationally registered pattern standards. It is a Four Year apprenticeship program. Below are the Key points to know and the awesome benefits!\n- Students work full time while attending class one night a week.\n- Students are supervised by a Journeyman electrician for their on the job experience.\n- A master electrician teaches the classes.\n- Wages shall increase regularly while enrolled in the program.\n- Graduating students may receive up to 37 college credit hours.\n- Scholarship funds are available to graduates on a limited basis to continue their educations.\n- Age requirement is a minimum of 18\n- Must have obtained a high school diploma or GED\n- Must have a way to and from work and class\n- Social Security Card and Valid Drivers License\n- Passed a background check and drug test\n- Upon acceptance, applicant must supply his own tools.** Note: Take a look at the electrical tools that I carry. My Electrician Tool List! **\nCost and Tuition:\nNote: Tuition is deducted from your pay each week.\n- $25 application fee\n- $50 registration fee upon acceptance\n- 1st year – 1,000 hours of on the job training $0.37 per hour for each hour worked\n- 1st year – Next 1,000 hours $0.41 cents per hour for each hour worked\n- 2nd year – $0.49 cents per hour for each hour worked\n- 3rd year – $0.56 cents per hour for each hour worked\n- 4th year – $0.64 cents per hour for each hour worked\n#3 Start Working\nThe best way to learn the trade is to just jump in with both feet! Start working now! This is a career that you have to just learn by doing. When joining an electrical contractor you will be referred to as a helper. A helper will be assigned to a journeyman to assist him in the daily tasked dispensed by the project manager or Master Electrician. You can expect for your first year to be assigned to jobs that are repetitive.\nMost helpers are assigned to crews that run wiring, install light fixtures, and install receptacles. In addition a shovel will become your right hand. It is expected for new helpers to dig and clean out ditches for new underground conduits. You will also be assigned to material delivery. This may seem like a waste of time but this is an important task.\nYou will be able to learn the different types of materials electrician use daily. Once you become established and respect is built a Journeyman will start to assign more complicated task for example assisting in building a panel, helping installing a generator or helping install a UPS (uninterrupted power supply) system. At this time you will start to learn the more advanced skills of becoming an electrician. It is very rewarding when you can say you took part in the construction of a house or building.\n#4 Define your states requirements for licensing and certifications.\nLicense and certifications requirements differ by location. For example in Texas you must apply and have in your possession an apprenticeship license before you start working. Check with your local authority having jurisdiction on requirements for licensing.\nWhen applying for advanced licenses make sure you have all of your hours worked documented. Majority of states and cities require you have a minimum amount of hours worked in the trade for an advanced license. Most places convert 1 year of working to 1,000 hours of experience.\nTexas requires that you have 4,000 documented hours before you can apply for a Journeyman license. For this reason is it important that you keep employment records and past pay stubs. For your Master license Texas requires that you hold your Journeyman license for 2,000 documented hours before they will allow you to take the state masters exam.\n#5 Study the Electrical Code.\nMost authorities having jurisdiction and electrical inspectors use the National Electrical Code (NEC).You can find one here NEC 2011 (NFPA 70). You will need to determine if the version used for enforcement is the NEC, state code, county code or city code.Become accustomed with the codes for that region. In addition, find out which code year has been adopted by the local authorities.\nNote: It is not required that you understand the entire code.\nThis huge document is written by lawyers and other authorities and the language used can be quite confusing to understand. The most important skill you can acquire is mastering the Index. The Index will show the location of every code and exception in the book.\nIn addition, will even direct you to the code number. This is a vital skill because during testing for your advanced license majority of test are open book. An applicant has the ability to use his or her code book. But the code book is a huge document and would take a person a long time to locate a specific code without using the Index. In addition most test give an applicant a certain time limit for the test. This is why understanding how to use the index of the code book is the most valuable skill."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:ba88bdee-c20c-4873-8372-77ac3b2b1d01>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How is a total hip replacement surgery performed?","answer":"A total hip replacement involves several steps: First, an incision is cut along the lateral hip and the muscles are gently separated. Then, the hip is dislocated and the femoral head is resected. The acetabulum is enlarged with a special tool to accommodate the prosthesis. Next, the concave artificial acetabulum is fixed to the pelvis, sometimes using screws. Finally, the femur prosthesis is introduced in the bone cavity and after reduction connected to the artificial acetabulum.","context":["Osteoarthritis of the hip is a degenerative condition of the hip joint, which progressively leads to loss of articular cartilage of the femoral head and acetabulum.\nOsteoarthritis is the most frequent form of arthritis concerning millions of individuals worldwide. Often osteoarthritis of the hip involves other joints of the body including the knee, spine, hands and fingers. Hip osteoarthritis is a pathology resulting from the erosion of the joint due to ongoing destruction of the cartilage surrounding the bones (femoral head and acetabulum) with consequent joint deformity. The condition is generally progressive and becomes problematic in the population over 50s years. Women are generally more frequently affected than men. Hip osteoarthritis can arise following a traumatic event that alters the alignment of the hip eventually causing wear and tear of the joint. Ongoing local inflammation may also stimulate the growth of bone spurs. When the cartilage is worn out or injured, the hip fails to absorb impact during movement triggering pain and reducing mobility. Occasionally, hereditary factors may predispose to osteoarthritis of the hip.\nPrimary osteoarthritis is a global condition affecting joints of the hand, fingers, spine, hips and knees.\nSecondary osteoarthritis results from a traumatic injury, overuse, chronic inflammation and medical conditions that alter the composition of the joint cartilage (e.g. haemochromatosis).\nIntra-articular fracture extends to the wrist joint (or articulation)\nExtra-articular fracture is located outside of the wrist joint\nOpen fracture when bone fragments perforate the skin\nComminuted fracture when the bone breaks into multiple fragments\nNon-displaced when the anatomical alignment of the bone is maintained or displaced when the bone fragments move apart.\nMelone’s classification describes the characteristics of intra-articular fractures of the radius:\ni Stable fracture\nii Unstable \"die-punch\"\niii \"Spike\" fracture\niv Split fracture\nv Explosion injuries\nThese fractures are divided into:\nAnterior pillar (not weight bearing part of joint)\nPosterior pillar (often associated with dislocation of the hip including the weight bearing part of joint)\nComminuted involving both column type\nSacral / coccygeal fractures\nThe sacrum is a triangular-shaped bone formed by 5 fused vertebrae, which provide a posterior wall to the pelvic ring. At each side of the sacrum, the ala structures articulate with the ilium bones forming the sacro-iliac joints. Sacral fractures are usually parallel to the spine and can involve the ala. Less frequently sacral fractures may display an “H” shape, including a transversal fracture uniting both sides of the sacrum. Three zones are described where sacral fractures can occur that are along vertical lines relative to the alignment of the foramina. Sacral fractures may result in sacral instability and require treatment via sacroplasty (injection of bone glue into the fracture). Surgery is necessary in case of associated neurological symptoms.\nFractures of the coccyx involve the tailbone, the terminal portion of the spine situated below the sacrum formed by 3 to 5 fused vertebrae. Coccyx fractures occur when falling on a seated position. They are more common in elderly women and seldom require surgical treatment.\nThe causes underlying hip osteoarthritis are not known. Some factors have been identified as a possible origin of the pathology:\nOveruse and repetitive stress to the hip in strenuous physical work and sport\nPrevious hip fracture\nCongenital malformation of the hip\nGenetic predisposition to osteoarthritis\nThe risk factors for a hip osteoarthritis include:\nAge > 50 years\nObesity due to stress to the hip joints\nChronic medical and inflammatory conditions (diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, gout)\nLack of physical training (muscle weakness)\nRace (Asian population and African Americans less prone)\nIn hip osteoarthritis, the clinical symptoms develop gradually with pain and stiffness building up and changing from sporadic to chronic. The main symptoms of this pathology are:\nPain in the groin, thigh, buttocks, knee\nPain during or after movement\nTenderness at touch\nStiffness of the hip joint particularly after inactivity (sleep, prolonged sitting)\nReduced flexibility and range of movement\nMalalignment of the joint\nGrating sensation during motion\nBone spur formation\nThe diagnosis of hip osteoarthritis begins with medical examination including the history of chronic conditions, past injuries and familiar predisposition. Radiologic evaluation with X-rays and MRI is used to establish the degree of cartilage damage, presence of spurs, changes in joint alignment and possibly avascular necrosis of the femoral head. Understanding the stage of joint degeneration will assist the orthopaedic surgeon in devising a suitable treatment, from conservative to surgery, relative to the patient age and general health.\nLaboratory blood tests are recommended to exclude chronic inflammatory autoimmune conditions (e.g. Rheumatoid arthritis). To ascertain the possibility of local infection to the hip or gout, the hip synovial fluid is drawn with a needle inserted in the joint for analysis.\nAs there is no cure for hip osteoarthritis, nonoperative therapy aims at reducing pain, improve movement and delay cartilage degeneration. Conservative management is recommended in the initial stages of the disease and consists of:\nAntiinflammatory therapy (NSAIDs)\nGlucosamine and chondroitin sulphate (cartilage supplements)\nLocal steroid injection (limited amount to prevent further cartilage degeneration)\nSurgical management of an osteoarthritic hip is necessary when the cartilage damage is so advanced to cause severe pain and limit ambulation. Different methods are available having gradually invasive interventions such as hip arthroscopy, osteotomy and prosthetic total hip replacement.\nHip arthroscopy is used for various conditions of the degenerative hip in case of developed articular damage or osteoarthritic changes. Due to the small access to the hip with keyhole incisions, it is less invasive than open surgery and shortens the recovery period. An endoscope (camera) is placed through one incision while the surgical tool inserted through a second incision. The surgeon uses a monitor to visualise the area of interest during surgery. The procedure consists of rinsing the hip joint with a saline solution and removing fragments of cartilage that may be floating in the joint. This simple procedure brings a temporary relief of the symptoms.\nOsteotomy is performed when misalignment of the hip joint caused by an injury is the cause of arthritis. In order to reduce pressure between the articular bones, the surgeon resects part of the acetabulum and/or femoral head to establish a new anatomical relationship and reduce pressure. This method preserves the hip joint for longer and delays a prosthetic hip replacement.\nTotal hip replacement\nA total hip replacement or arthroplasty is necessary with advanced hip osteoarthritis. Through this method the damaged femoral head and the acetabulum are firstly removed and then replaced with artificial prostheses. A total hip replacement involves the following steps:\n- An incision is cut along the lateral hip and the muscles gently separated\n- The hip is dislocated and the femoral head is resected\n- The acetabulum is enlarged with a special tool to accommodate for the insertion of prosthesis\n- The concave artificial acetabulum is fixed to the pelvis sometimes using screws\n- The femur prosthesis is introduced in the bone cavity and after reduction connected to the artificial acetabulum\nComplications that may occur following a total hip replacement include:\nProsthesis dislocation -although rare it can occur when the ligaments and muscles that have been severed during surgery are still weak\nLocal infection – despite prophylactic administration of antibiotics prior to surgery it can occur\nDeep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism – blot clotting or thrombosis mostly occurs in the deep veins of the lower limbs due to prolonged immobility. If the thrombus dislocates it may cause pulmonary embolism, which is a life threatening condition. Patients are usually given prophylactic administration of anti-clotting medications (warfarin, aspirin).\nBlood loss - this can occur during or after hip replacement\nPressure ulcers – due to prolonged bed immobilisation, the pressure of the body weight on the fragile skin of elderly people can form skin ulcers. These can be prevented using particular bed characteristics, massage and frequent reposition of the patient. When pressure ulcers are infected they need immediate antibiotic and/or surgical treatment\nPneumonia – used to be the main cause of death in older patients that were immobilised for several weeks. Nowadays physiotherapy begins immediately after surgery to restore patients’ mobility, reduce the risk of infections and facilitate recovery\nUrinary tract infection – is due to prolonged bed-stay, hygiene and poor hydration.\nParticularly in elderly people it is critical that immediately after surgery the patient begins rehabilitative therapy with gradual and assisted walking to prevent medical complications. This phase may require the patient to be admitted to a cared facility or receive regular in-home visits by an occupational therapist. A wheelchair, crutches, walking stick, or walker may be necessary to support the patient during the first weeks up to 12 months following a hip prosthesis. Rehabilitation during the first 6-12 weeks post surgery may also include:\nAntiinflammatory therapy (NSAIDs)\nPhysical exercise to strengthen quadriceps, hamstrings and gluteal muscles\nGuided return to activity\nUse of high chairs and walking devices\nWeight loss in overweighed patients\nHip osteoarthritis is not easily preventable, as the causes of the disease are not fully understood. There are however simple changes in life style can keep hip osteoarthritis under control and delay joint degeneration. These preventive measures include:\nExercise and maintenance of muscular strength (walking, swimming) to support the hip and prevent cartilage damage\nMaintain a healthy weight\nAvoid injuries by reducing strenuous, repetitive physical activity\nStretch and warm up before exercise\nAvoid running on hard surface\nUse of walking devices in the elderly\nWearing suitable fitting shoes\nAdherence to occupational health and safety procedures for labourers\nFrequent monitoring of chronic inflammatory diseases and pharmacological use\nImprove nutrition with supplements (omega-3 fatty acids or fish oil, vitamins C and D)\nTreat pain with NSAIDs to reduce chronic inflammation\nPreventing the dislocation of a hip prosthesis\nTo avoid displacement of hip prosthesis changes in the arrangement of furniture and in the bathroom may help preventing risky movements. This is achieved by elevating the furniture to avoid bending. The following rules, which depend on the surgical approach used, either anterior or posterior, will support the rehabilitative care post surgery.\nAnterior approach - avoid:\nBending/stretching the hip backwards\nTurning or swing leg/foot outward\nThe hip backward\nWalk with short steps\nKneeling on one knee (use both)\nPlace a pillow by the hip while lying on the back\nDon’t twist the body away from the operated hip\nPosterior approach - avoid:\nCrossing legs when in a sitting position\nRolling leg and foot internally (use a cushion)\nTwisting upper body towards the hip\nBending hip over 90 degrees\nWhen standing up from seating swivel the upper body (do not bend)"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:fc3f4747-ed51-450f-a6e9-4da85ec0b659>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I am researching community-based agricultural initiatives. What are successful examples of community organizations improving farming, and what modern techniques like vertical farming are being implemented?","answer":"In Afghanistan, Community Development Councils (CDCs) have been successful in managing community-driven development activities and improving agricultural productivity through market accessibility programs and pasture management committees. For example, the Ganjabad research station worked with communities to test wheat and potato varieties, producing 15 metric tons of seed potato that farmers could sell in local markets. As for modern techniques, vertical farming is being implemented globally using controlled environments in buildings, shipping containers, and tunnels. These systems use scientific approaches like hydroponics, aeroponics, and aquaponics, along with customized LED lighting to maximize plant growth. By 2020, there were approximately 30 hectares of operating vertical farms worldwide, demonstrating significant technological advancement in agricultural practices.","context":["Afghanistan is known to the world as a failed state. Who decides what a failed state is, and the extent to which one has failed? Max Weber describes a failed state as one which is unable to maintain a monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force within its borders.1 Noam Chomsky includes in the definition a state which fails to provide security for the population, to guarantee the population’s rights at home or abroad, or to maintain the function of a democratic state.2 The Fund for Peace & Foreign Policy has created an index system that quantifies a dozen aspects of state failure, including: physical control of its territory and erosion of legitimate state authority to make collective decisions, inability to provide reasonable public services, extensive corruption and criminal behavior, inability to collect taxes or otherwise draw on citizen support, and environmental decay.3 Contrast this list to indicators of successful societies, which include measures of education, literacy, health, and well-being, and it becomes clear that visions and indicators of success and failure have become disconnected.\nThis apparent disconnect between the symptoms of a failed state and the remedies suggested by what is seen to constitute its healthy counterpart makes it difficult to imagine a way out of failed-statehood. We contend that it is necessary to rethink what a failed state is, to understand, at a rather more practical, grassroots level, the drivers of failed or successful societies.\nThe impracticality of the blurry failed-successful state dichotomy, and the potential of rethinking its criteria, can be illustrated by looking at the region of Badakhshan in Tajikistan and Afghanistan. The provinces of Afghan and Tajik Badakshan share a watershed that is inhabited by Pamiri people with a common language, religion, and culture; these provinces are separated only by the Amu Darya River and 70 years of divergent development paths. Tajik Badakhshan benefited from Soviet development of infrastructure, education (99.5 percent overall literacy rate), a health care system, and access to markets. In stark contrast, 30 meters across the river, many Afghans still walk up to 12 days along donkey trails to the nearest commercial center and have severely limited access to healthcare (maternal mortality is the highest in the world at 6,507 deaths per 100,000 births)4 and education (18 percent and 36 percent literacy rates for women and men, respectively). Yet despite these stark contrasts in development and traditional indicators of “success”, many Tajiks will say that Afghans are better off because their livelihoods are more autonomous, independent of external inputs, and their economy is much less affected by global price fluctuations. One farmer in the Tajik district of Rushan said,\nNow, life on the Afghan side of the river is better because they are able to feed themselves from their own land. They have money because they are not dependent on the global economy. Their clothes are much better because there is a tailor in every village. There are no tailors in Tajikistan.\nSuccess or failure, then, depend on scale of analysis: success at the level of everyday livelihoods may or may not coincide with whether a state is deemed to have failed or not. In fact, often it doesn’t, since the criteria of failed statehood are quite disconnected from the lives of normal people. Part of the reason for this is that people fail to see a causal connection between how people lead their lives and how states fail or succeed, yet it is precisely in this connection, between the local and higher national, even global levels, that it becomes possible to look for solutions to the failed state.\nIn other words, identifying the systemic role of state failure requires a break away from the indicators mentioned above, and asks us to question the processes that create resilient communities in a system ridden with political rigidity, corruption, and violence. Given the uncertain future stability of a country subjected to complex, intertwined cycles of violence and despair, it can seem ridiculous to talk about solutions. Yet many Afghans in the north of the country have lived through, and even thrived, during 30 years of war.\nIn this paper we draw on cases from the province of Badakhshan, in Northern Afghanistan, to present three local solutions that all have some potential to break, from the bottom-up, the self-reinforcing loop that characterizes the trap of failed states. While all deal with local-level solutions to food production and diversification, they work at very different levels of human activity: the first describes an agricultural research station’s attempt at improving agricultural production, through an innovative approach to governance. The second example is a bold and innovative experiment to teach women the skills to grow and process vegetables in the high Pamir Mountains. It succeeded in introducing greens and beans to seminomadic communities who had never eaten vegetables before. The third works at the level of identity and imagination: using food culture to rekindle people’s sense of pride in who they are, it helps to offer a different basis from which to re-imagine a future that is their own, free of war.\nCase 1: Community Organizations and Research Stations Respond to Low Agricultural Yields\nDevelopment organizations often consider environmental resource management separate from economic development and conflict reduction. In Afghanistan, these are intimately related. Scarcity of natural resources can drive environmental degradation, perpetuating a positive feedback cycle in which scarcity leads to conflict, and conflict leads to scarcity.5 The irreversible loss of forests and top soil in many parts of Afghanistan decreases the availability of already scarce water resources in lower catchment areas and deepens economic hardship, spawning migration and social strife. The eastern region of Afghanistan lost between 50 and 80 percent of its forest cover between 1977 and 2002.6 Moreover, particularly in the northern mountainous region where the case studies in this paper are located, climate change is influencing glacial runoff, inducing flash floods and rendering downstream water availability erratic. Land is subdivided into smaller portions with each generation. Eventually, the plots cannot properly support their cultivation, fallow periods are neglected, and greater poverty prevents investment in conservation.\nPressured to produce more wealth with less land, farmers increasingly resort to opium production. From 2010 to 2011, opium production in Afghanistan increased by 61 percent, or 15 percent of total GDP.7 The trend was fuelled by falling wheat prices, making opium cultivation 11 times more profitable than growing wheat. Consequences are felt both at the state level, with increased income for the insurgents, and by farmers and traders, further increasing violence and stressing an already limited social infrastructure. Not only does the opium trade increase intracommunity violence, it also brings violent norms to the north of the country.\nWhile the northern region of Badakhshan Province has been less plagued by physical conflict, it has also remained largely isolated from the infrastructural development in the rest of the country. Local systems of trade, development, and culture have not only managed to persist, but diversified over the decades of war. The people of Badakhshan have proven to be extremely resilient amid constant social, economic, and environmental shocks. The current government of Afghanistan and its implementing partners are working to build on these successful traditional management systems in order to adapt to pervasive changes. Development organizations have been active in Badakhshan, working closely with regional government authorities to implement community-based approaches to development, namely the National Solidarity Programme, under which Community Development Councils (CDCs) are established. CDCs have been established in two-thirds of the country, and while their place among local existing institutions remains disputed, their role in managing community-driven development activities has established them as primary governance actors at the subnational level.8 Compared with most international aid initiatives, which invariably run into the complexities of customary law and Afghan norms and customs, CDCs have been relatively successful in achieving equitable election processes, women’s inclusion in decision making, and overcoming entrenched power establishments.8\nIn response to the interacting environmental and social threats in the region, various successful interventions have improved agricultural productivity. Market accessibility and the promotion of “alternative licit livelihood strategies” have been successful in transforming opium fields to orchards or other staple crops.9 These successes can be attributed in part to support by physical infrastructure (canal systems and storage), but primarily to the community organizations around natural resources in the form of pasture management committees and water use associations. The Ganjabad research station outside Sultan-Ishkashim has spearheaded the rebuilding of legitimate government authority in the region by testing local and improved varieties of wheat and potato varieties. The station sowed 1.75 metric tons of true potato seed, imported from Peru in 2009, resulting in 15 metric tons of seed potato harvested this year.10 Farmers were able to sell this seed at local markets for further multiplication, thereby improving their food security and establishing a meaningful partnership with the national government. Positive impacts of this partnership have crossed the boundary with Tajikistan, as Afghan and Tajik researchers have begun sharing results and seeds.\nThe experiment could be improved by paying more attention to local customs and landscape. While true potato seed has obvious technical benefits (less chemical input, reduced risk of infection, reduced transport and storage costs), their long-term yield capacity and adaptation and the demand of farmers for true potato seed in the Pamir Mountains is unknown. These interventions are largely based on developing value chains for current market conditions, which for many Afghans are inconsistent with their traditional values. In many cases, the growth-based market paradigm undermines local ingenuity and survival. Several years ago, the agricultural office in Afghan Shugnan handed farmers a package with an improved European wheat variety and the corresponding necessary fertilizers. Local wheat, of which 153 varieties have been identified in the Pamirs, is grown without chemical fertilizers, which are prohibitively expensive; animal manure is used instead. Not surprisingly, the new fertilized wheat grew beautifully tall and provided a good harvest. Equally unsurprising, the extra demands posed on the soil meant that yields dropped after two years, and the taste of the flour poorly suited the dishes traditionally prepared with it.11\nCase 2: High-Altitude Vegetables in the Wakhan and Little Pamir?\nExtending beyond the idea of increasing production and economic growth, a rather daring initiative has managed to increase crop diversity and improve women’s health in the extraordinarily harsh environment of the Little Pamir of the Wakhan corridor in northeast Afghanistan. This area is inhabited primarily by semi-pastoralists, the Wakhi, and nomads, the Kirghiz, who mostly live off fresh milk products and meat from the summer pastures. Yet as isolated as the region is from the rest of the country, it has not been immune to change, and over the past 10 years communities have become more sedentary and are increasingly dependent on imported products from the expanding trade routes with China, Pakistan, and Iran. Traditional agricultural and pastoral practices and products are abandoned for third-grade, but “easy,” market goods, most of which are the world’s “left-over” products and seem to have negative impacts on regional health.\nTo improve health and increase nutritional diversity, development organizations have worked with women to establish small vegetable gardens. Through participatory technology development, plastic film technology was introduced, with which Kirghiz herders in the region managed to grow vegetables at an altitude of 4,000 meters for the first time this year.10\nWhile the vegetable patches have been largely successful, few women knew what to do with the vegetables themselves. As the coordinator of the project explained:\nThe cucumbers grew to such a size, I was sure they would explode. Yet, the women did not use them. I asked them why they had not harvested the cucumbers and they told me they did not know how to eat them.12\nTraining was then given to the women on how to prepare salads, which they had never done before, and on preservation techniques to keep the vegetables for the long winter, when there are precious few sources of vitamins available. As with the improved wheat variety mentioned above, integrating new crops into livelihood strategies must be done with an understanding of local knowledge and traditions.\nCase 3: Food to Imagine the Future\nThe past three decades of conflict have brought farmers in northern Afghanistan more than their share of hardship. The resilience they have shown in the face of these challenges has been remarkable. The source of this resilience must, for an important part, be sought in the autonomy they have managed to maintain vis-à-vis external influences, most notably with regards to their food and agricultural systems.\nIn recent years, development projects have begun to address some of the major physical and social challenges faced by farmers, with varying degrees of success. Unfortunately, growth-driven interventions, such as the example of the improved wheat variety above, are all too common, and sociopolitical pressures from drug traders and the Afghan military compound these misguided efforts.\nEnsuring that all Afghans maintain a strong voice in the development process, for example, in the form of the CDCs mentioned above, may seem like an obvious solution. It isn’t. For most Afghani farmers, thinking about the future, imagining things they would like the future to bring, is not something they dare to do. When asked about their ideas, the response is often little more than a weak reflection of the discourse of markets and growth that has been promoted by development organizations for a long time.\nIn our work in the region over the past four years (2008–2011), we found food to be one way in which people, particularly women, are able to reflect on their ancestral history and rich culture, much of which revolves around agriculture and food. It appeared to be a powerful tool for farmers to make sense of the present, to explain drastic changes in landscape, trade, and social relations, and so to imagine solutions that could inspire development trajectories which are their own, unmarred by the unyielding presence of corruption, violence, and foreign markets.\nA hint of the beauty with which local food culture could imbue development practice, if given the space, is offered by the story of the formation of the famous Lake Shewa, told by a farmer in the Afghan district of Shugnan:\nAt the bottom of what is now Lake Shewa, there was once a village. One evening, an old man came to the village and asked for food. His clothes were torn and people laughed at him, threw stones at him. But there was one woman who treated him kindly. She was poor and had only shiroghan to offer him – a warm cream made of milk, fresh butter and some salt. Thanking her, he told her to take her son and belongings and to seek refuge in a place high up on the mountain. That night there was a strong earthquake. Water appeared and flooded the village and its inhabitants. Later, the woman understood that the old man had been the holy Nasir Khusraw. Since that day, shiroghan is considered a holy food.\nFood provides a common ground for discussion, invokes memories of the past, establishes identity in a turbulent world, and allows for an empowering vision of the future. Such narratives are deeply powerful metaphors in the local context and could, if married with the type of meaningful initiatives described above, inspire real solutions in a country whose future is looking increasingly uncertain.\nWe thank the many Pamiri families and colleagues who have helped us develop the thoughts presented in this paper. Financial and logistical support for this work were generously provided by the Christensen Fund, the Indigenous Partnership for Agrobiodiversity and Food Sovereignty, the Swiss Cooperation Office Tajikistan, the Aga Khan Foundation Afghanistan, and the Mountain Societies Development and Support Programme.

Vertical farming is one such method that has been used all around the world. Food crops may be conveniently farmed in urban settings using Vertical Farming by planting in vertically stacked layers to conserve space and require little energy and water for irrigation.\nVertical farming is the process of producing crops in layers that are vertically stacked. Controlled-environment agriculture, which tries to maximise plant development, and soil-less farming techniques such as hydroponics, aquaponics, and aeroponics, are frequently used.\nBuildings, shipping containers, tunnels, and abandoned mine shafts are among popular structures used to host vertical farming systems. There are approximately 30 hectares (74 acres) of functioning vertical farms around the globe as of 2020. Vertical farming, in conjunction with other cutting-edge technology such as customised LED lighting, has resulted in crop yields that are more than ten times greater than those obtained by standard agricultural methods.\nVertical farming is still in its early stages in India, but there are a few entrepreneurs and agri-tech enterprises aiming to revolutionise the area.\nVertical Farming Background and Concept\nGilbert Ellis Bailey originated the phrase “vertical farming” and published a book named “Vertical Farming” in 1915. William Frederick Gerick pioneered hydroponics at the University of California, Berkeley, in the early 1930s.\nke Olsson, a Swedish ecological farmer, devised a spiral-shaped rail system for growing plants in the 1980s and proposed vertical farming as a method of raising vegetables in cities.\nProfessor Dickson Despommier invented the concept of vertical farming in 1999. His idea was to grow food in urban areas, utilising less distance and saving time in transporting food produced in rural regions to cities.\nHe aimed to produce food in urban areas in order to have fresher goods available sooner and at a reduced cost. As a result, vertical farming is defined as the cultivation and production of crops/plants in vertically stacked layers and vertically inclined surfaces.\nThe plants are vertically piled in a tower-like form in the physical arrangement. This reduces the amount of space needed to cultivate plants. Following that, a combination of natural and artificial lighting is employed to ensure an ideal atmosphere for the plants’ effective growth. The third component is the plant’s growth medium. Aeroponic, hydroponic, or aquaponic growth media are employed instead of soil as the growing medium.\nAs the methodology gets more scientific, the process’s efficiency grows, and as a result, vertical farming becomes more sustainable, consuming 95 percent less water than previous agricultural methods.\nAlso Read, Oxagon: The World’s First Floating City in the World\nVertical Farming Techniques\nIt is a method of producing food in water without the use of soil by employing mineral fertiliser solutions.\nThe primary benefit of this strategy is that it lowers soil-related cultivation issues such as soil-borne insects, pests, and illnesses.\nAeroponics was inspired by NASA’s (National Aeronautical and Space Administration, USA) endeavour in the 1990s to develop an effective technique to grow plants in space. There is no growth medium in aeroponics, hence there are no containers for growing crops. Instead of water, mist or nutrient solutions are utilised in aeroponics. Because the plants are attached to a support and the roots are sprayed with nutritional solution, there is very little space, very little water, and no soil required.\nThe name aquaponics is derived from the combination of two words: aquaculture (fish farming) and hydroponics (the process of growing plants without soil in order to develop symbiotic interactions between the plants and the fish). The symbiosis is established by feeding nutrient-rich waste from fish tanks to hydroponic production beds called “fertigate.”\nIn turn, the hydroponic beds act as biofilters, removing gases, acids, and chemicals from the water, such as ammonia, nitrates, and phosphates. Furthermore, the gravel beds serve as a home for nitrifying bacteria, which aid in nutrient cycling and water filtering. As a result, the newly cleansed water may be recirculated back into the fish tanks.\nThe Benefits of Vertical Farming\nVertical farming offers various advantages, making it promising for agriculture’s future. The land need is fairly minimal, water usage is 80% less, water is recycled and stored, pesticides are not used, and in the case of high-tech farms, there is no true reliance on the weather.\nA vertical farm makes farming possible within the constraints of a metropolis. When the farms are close by, the food is delivered swiftly and is always fresh, as opposed to the chilled stuff commonly seen in stores. Transportation reduction minimises the cost of fossil fuels and the accompanying emissions, as well as transportation spoilage. Vertical farming, like anything else, has its limitations. The biggest issue is the initial capital expenses for building the vertical farming system.\nThere are further expenditures associated with building the structures as well as their automation, such as computerised and monitoring systems, remote control systems and software, automated racking and stacking systems, programmable LED lighting systems, temperature control systems, and so on."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:226ce3ad-5d65-448e-953a-c03cccd102bb>","<urn:uuid:38abc93f-c15d-442d-abe3-4bcfbd141419>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How does Kawasaki syndrome affect the cardiovascular system, and what are the mortality outcomes with and without treatment?","answer":"Kawasaki syndrome can severely affect the cardiovascular system by causing inflammation of blood vessels, particularly the coronary arteries. If left untreated, it can lead to serious complications including heart aneurysms, myocarditis, heart attacks, pericarditis, and cardiac arrhythmias. Even with early recognition and treatment, about one quarter of children develop complications with the coronary arteries. However, the prognosis differs significantly based on treatment: with timely diagnosis and proper treatment, the disease usually heals without complications and has a good prognosis. Without treatment, the condition can be life-threatening, though death occurs in only about 1% of affected children.","context":["Kawasaki syndrome is an acute febrile illness characterized primarily by inflammatory reactions of the arterial blood vessels with multiple organ involvement and occurs in infancy (up to 5 years of age). Kawasaki syndrome is mainly found in Japan and with increasing frequency in Germany (about 9 out of 100,000 children).\nWhat is Kawasaki Syndrome?\nInfants and young children suffering from Kawasaki syndrome suffer from severe inflammation of the vessels throughout the body. The inflammation causes symptoms such as fever and a rash.\nKawasaki syndrome (also mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome) is an acute fever illness that primarily occurs in infancy, particularly between the ages of 2 and 5, and is associated with vasculitis, an inflammation of the small and medium-sized blood vessels. See AbbreviationFinder for abbreviations related to Kawasaki Syndrome.\nIn most cases, the Kawasaki syndrome, which is initially very similar to other infectious diseases such as scarlet fever or measles, also manifests itself as a systemic inflammation of the internal organs.\nIn addition to the suddenly occurring fever, there are swellings in the lymph nodes in the neck and throat (cervical lymphadenopathy), non-purulent conjunctivitis (conjunctivitis), stomatitis (inflammation of the oral mucosa) with strawberry or lacquer tongue, a polymorphic exanthema (non-itching, multi-shaped rash on the trunk) and scaly erythema (redness) on the hands and feet characteristic of Kawasaki syndrome.\nThe underlying causes of Kawasaki syndrome have not yet been clarified.\nIt is assumed that the etiology of Kawasaki syndrome is due to an infection with previously unidentified bacteria or viruses whose superantigens (toxic proteins of the pathogens) cause the affected children’s immune system to react with pronounced inflammatory reactions as a result of a genetic defect.\nThe significantly higher incidence (number of new cases) of Kawasaki syndrome in Japan compared to Europe or North America also speaks for a genetic predisposition (predisposition).\nSymptoms, Ailments & Signs\nInfants and young children suffering from Kawasaki syndrome suffer from severe inflammation of the vessels throughout the body. The inflammation causes symptoms such as fever and a rash. The disease is characterized by a gradual rise in body temperature, which is usually associated with chills, weakness and a general feeling of being unwell.\nThe rash presents as painful redness that can appear on any part of the body and occasionally develops into ulcers or cysts. It can also lead to conjunctivitis and swelling of the mucous membranes in the mouth and throat. Also characteristic are the red lips and the reddish tongue, also strawberry tongue. If treated early, affected children usually recover relatively quickly.\nIn severe cases, however, the rash can leave scars or lead to permanent sensory disturbances. If not treated, there is a risk of death. Then the skin lesions worsen and the fever increases. Eventually, there may be complications of the heart and the death of the child as a result. The symptoms usually appear between the ages of one and eight. However, adolescents and young adults can also be affected. Kawasaki syndrome is particularly common in boys.\nDiagnosis & History\nKawasaki syndrome can be diagnosed based on the characteristic symptoms. In addition to the acutely occurring high fever, at least four of the main symptoms of the disease must be detectable in order to assume Kawasaki syndrome.\nIn addition, similar infectious diseases such as measles or scarlet fever should be excluded in the differential diagnosis. The diagnosis is confirmed by a blood analysis. So-called autoantibodies (cANCA), antibodies directed against endogenous antigens, can be serologically detected in Kawasaki syndrome. An increased number of leukocytes (white blood cells) and an increased CRP value (C-reactive protein) also indicate a possible Kawasaki syndrome as inflammatory markers.\nIn order to rule out involvement of the coronary vessels (arterial coronary vessels) or a heart aneurysm (protrusion of the arterial coronary vessels), an echocardiography (heart ultrasound) should be performed.\nIf left untreated, Kawasaki syndrome can lead to an aneurysm of the heart, which can lead to life-threatening secondary diseases such as myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle), infarcts, pericarditis (inflammation of the heart sac) and cardiac arrhythmias, which have a significant impact on long-term mortality (mortality rate). With timely diagnosis and treatment, the prognosis is good and the disease usually heals without complications.\nIn most cases, the Kawasaki syndrome in babies and children leads to a very strong fever. Those affected also suffer from a red discoloration of the skin, lips and tongue. The mucous membranes in the throat and mouth also swell, making it difficult to eat and drink.\nIt is not uncommon for babies and children to have Kawasaki syndrome with a rash all over the body and inflammation of the conjunctiva. The patient’s quality of life is significantly restricted and reduced by this syndrome. If left untreated, the syndrome can also cause heart problems and inflammation, which can eventually lead to death.\nThe treatment itself usually does not lead to any particular complications and the course of the disease is always positive. This is done with the help of medication that significantly reduces the discomfort and symptoms. If the treatment is successful, there are no further complications or reduced life expectancy. Consequential damage does not occur with successful treatment of Kawasaki syndrome in babies and children.\nWhen should you go to the doctor?\nA doctor’s visit is necessary if the fever persists or increases. Redness of the skin, an increase in cardiac activity and changes in the complexion must be examined and examined by a doctor. Children up to the age of 5 who suffer from sudden acute symptoms that lead to serious health impairments must be treated by a doctor as soon as possible. Since Kawasaki syndrome in babies and children can lead to premature death in severe cases without medical care, a doctor’s visit is recommended at the first irregularities.\nRed discoloration of the lips and tongue resembling strawberry color should be evaluated. Swelling of the lymph, pain in the lymph nodes or a change in the mucous membranes in the mouth and throat should be presented to a doctor. If conjunctivitis occurs, you need to see a doctor. In the event of cardiac arrhythmias, a doctor must be consulted immediately. The heart muscle can be damaged, which can have serious consequences. If the child refuses to eat and drink enough fluids, there is a risk that the organism will be undersupplied. A visit to the doctor is required without delay so that a life-threatening condition does not develop. If the child shows behavioral problems or an increased need for sleep, a doctor should be consulted.\nTreatment & Therapy\nIn the case of Kawasaki syndrome, the therapeutic measures are primarily aimed at reducing the inflammatory reactions and avoiding aneurysms in the coronary arteries, for which there is an increased risk of manifesting in the second and third week. For this purpose, immunoglobulins, which play an important role in the body’s defenses and cannot be synthesized to a sufficient extent by the children affected by Kawasaki syndrome, are infused (2 g/kg body weight over 12 hours).\nIf necessary, the therapeutic measure must be repeated if the affected child does not respond sufficiently. In addition, high-dose acetylsalicylic acid (30 to 100 mg/kg body weight per day) is used to reduce acute inflammation and fever. As long as there is a risk of a coronary aneurysm, acetylsalicylic acid should continue to be taken at a lower dose (2 to 4 mg/kg body weight per day) because the substance has an anticoagulant effect.\nIf there is a pronounced aneurysm, drugs such as coumarins are recommended to inhibit blood clotting more. If necessary, cardiac surgery measures are indicated for Kawasaki syndrome. In addition, cortisone-like drugs are being researched as part of clinical tests, with at least one additional positive effect for the treatment of Kawasaki syndrome being demonstrated. After the successful end of therapy, regular check-ups by a cardiologist should take place in the case of Kawasaki syndrome in order to rule out long-term damage to the heart (e.g. stenoses).\nOutlook & Forecast\nKawasaki syndrome is a very serious infection that requires medical treatment to avoid complications and possible long-term effects. However, parents of the affected children can help to alleviate the symptoms with simple means.\nIn most cases, cold calf wraps are sufficient to reduce the fever. If these do not help and the fever is dangerously high, a shower can provide relief. Direct cold showers or cold baths should be avoided. The blood vessels in the extremities would constrict quickly and the heart would have to beat faster. This is too much of a strain on the already stressed circuit. If you instead regulate the temperature slowly and not too far, this leads to a moderate drop in body temperature and only minimal strain on the circulatory system.\nBecause children dehydrate very quickly, it is imperative that parents stay hydrated. Patients have to be slowed down in their physical activity in order to avoid possible heart damage and subsequent complications. Simply adding fresh or dried turmeric to food, thanks to its anti-inflammatory effect, helps with both fever and skin rashes, which can also be alleviated with creams.\nA regular cardiological check-up after the symptoms have subsided is advisable so that possible late effects can be treated at an early stage.\nDue to the unknown etiology (underlying cause) of Kawasaki syndrome, no preventive measures exist.\nIn most cases, those affected with Kawasaki syndrome in babies and children have no special or direct options for aftercare. With this disease, however, a doctor should be consulted very early on, so that there are no further complications and no further deterioration of the symptoms.\nAn early diagnosis usually always has a very positive effect on the further course of the disease, so that the parents concerned should contact a doctor as soon as the first symptoms and signs of Kawasaki syndrome appear in the baby and child. The treatment itself is usually carried out by taking certain medications.\nParents should ensure that the dosage is correct and that the medication is taken regularly. If anything is unclear or if you have any questions, you should always consult a doctor first so that no further problems arise. Regular check-ups and examinations by a doctor are also very important for babies and children with Kawasaki syndrome in order to monitor the condition of the affected person over the long term. The child should not exert himself unnecessarily, since the heart is generally weak. In many cases, this disease reduces the life expectancy of those affected.\nYou can do that yourself\nKawasaki syndrome is a serious infectious disease in young children. Medical treatment is necessary to avoid complications and long-term effects. However, there are a number of ways parents can reduce the symptoms.\nThe disease is accompanied by a high fever. Calf wraps or moderate full-body cooling usually lower the body temperature by one to two degrees. Due to the fever, parents should also ensure that their sick child is drinking enough fluids. Still mineral water or unsweetened herbal teas are ideal. In order to avoid complications in the heart, strict attention must be paid to physical protection. Cooling compresses and the application of anti-inflammatory ointments are recommended for treating the rash. Coconut oil – which also has an antiseptic effect – or olive oil are recommended as natural substances. Specially mixed preparations can also be purchased in pharmacies.\nNaturopathy recommends the homeopathic remedy Belladonna for high fever. Furthermore, the administration of vitamin C preparations is recommended, as this vital vitamin is consumed at an increased rate during an inflammatory process. The turmeric root also has a strong anti-inflammatory effect. Parents can buy these fresh in the supermarket or in powder or capsule form (nutritional supplements) in the pharmacy.\nAfter the illness has been overcome, parents should take their child to a cardiologist for regular check-ups in order to be able to promptly identify and treat the occurrence of long-term effects.","See what questions\na doctor would ask.\nKawasaki disease is a rare disease that occurs in children and leads to vasculitis, in which there is an inflammation of the blood vessels of the body. This blood vessel inflammation can result in many manifestations in different organs and body systems and can lead to serious complications, such as aneurysms and heart attack.\nKawasaki disease is also known as mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome, lymph node syndrome, and Kawasaki syndrome. Kawasaki disease has no known cause, but it is suspected to be an autoimmune disease, in which the body's immune system mistakes healthy cells of the body as dangerous invaders and attacks them.\nKawasaki disease is most common in Japan. In the U.S., Kawasaki disease is the second most common cause of heart disease in children. Kawasaki disease most frequently occurs in children under five and in boys.\nKawasaki disease begins with a high fever, up to 104 degrees F, that lasts five or more days. Unlike fevers due to many other causes, the fever associated with Kawasaki disease does not come down with usual doses of acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil). In addition to vasculitis, Kawasaki disease can result in a variety of symptoms many parts of the body. The most common sites of symptoms include the mucus membranes and lymph nodes. For more information on symptoms, refer to symptoms of Kawasaki disease.\nMaking a diagnosis of Kawasaki disease begins with taking a thorough medical history, including symptoms and fever history, and completing a physical examination. There is no single test that can diagnose Kawasaki disease. A history of a high and persistent fever combined with other classic symptoms is generally used to make a diagnosis.\nA variety of tests may be done to rule out other diseases that can cause fever. These can include a blood culture, urinanalysis and urine culture and sensitivity, and throat culture and sensitivity. Other tests that may be done to evaluate any potential complications of Kawasaki disease, such as heart disease, include a chest X-ray, C-reactive protein, echocardiogram and electrocardiogram.\nIt is possible that a diagnosis of Kawasaki disease can be missed or delayed because there is no specific diagnostic test for it, and because some symptoms, such as fever, vomiting, diarrhea and cough can resemble symptoms of other more common diseases, such as strep throat and influenza. For more information on misdiagnosis, refer to misdiagnosis of Kawasaki disease.\nIt is vital that children with Kawasaki disease get treated as soon as possible to prevent the development of serious, life-threatening complications, such as aneurysms and heart attack. Even with early recognition and treatment, about one quarter of children with Kawasaki disease develop complications with the coronary arteries. Treatment of Kawasaki disease includes hospitalization, close monitoring, medications and ongoing medical care and screenings for heart disease.

{"question":"I'm learning web development. How do you configure debugging in ASP.NET, and what considerations should be made for responsive design?","answer":"For ASP.NET debugging configuration, you need two steps: First, activate the ASP.NET debugger by right-clicking the project in solution explorer, selecting Property Pages, then Start Options, and checking ASP.NET in the Debuggers section. Second, enable debugging by setting debug='true' in the web.config file's compilation section, either for the whole application or specific pages. For responsive design considerations, you should ensure your site looks good on all devices, keep images small and lightweight to prevent slow loading, make navigation easy to use with clear buttons and links, and ensure fonts are clear and readable. Remember that debugging should be disabled in production as it can slow down the application.","context":["Dealing with errors is an important part of every application. Web applications aren’t an exception, in the contrary, they should be even better in graceful error handling, because of their huge amount of users.\nWe have three possible locations of caching errors in an ASP.NET application. The first one is the source of the error itself, by wrapping our code, which is likely to fail, in a try-catch block. This is a very good solution for the problem, since the error gets treated on the spot of its occurrence. You can decide to bubble the error forth, and catch it in the Page_Error event, or even further, in the Application_Error event, defined in global.asax. There’s a fourth opportunity, but it isn’t the best solution: define custom error pages in the customErrors section of your web.config. They are part of the apologize, not the solution for the problem, so you should restrict the use of them. Even worse, when you are on a custom error page, you have no way to get and deal with the error lead you there.\nBefore writing error-handling code, make sure that you do everything to prevent errors from happening. The best way to do so is to use a massive amount of validation. String.Empty and the Exists method should be very close friends of you.\nBut if the worse happened, you should fail elegantly, and without showing any inner workings of your application. Hold the detailed error messages to server administrators, and give user-friendly and meaningless errors to the everyday users. Also, you should log the exception (Health monitoring comes handy for this task).\nContinue reading “Establish an error-handling strategy”\nTo debug an ASP.NET application, first you need to configure debugging. This is a process requires two steps to be taken. First, you must activate the ASP.NET debugger for your current project. To do this, right click on the project in solution explorer, and select Property Pages. In the dialog box, then select Start Options. Look for the Debuggers section in the bottom, and make sure ASP.NET is checked.\nThe second step is to enable debugging either for your whole application, or just different pages of it. To do so, in the compilation section of the web.config file, set debug=”true”. This causes debugging symbols to be added to your whole page. If you want to debug only some pages, you should set Debug=”true” in the @Page directive of them.\nIf you have the necessary rights for debugging (the application is running locally under your own user entity, or you’re an administrator) you can debug by now. If it is not the case, you should seek a way to grant yourself these rights. It’s because debugging an application needs more rights than just running it. Debugging can be harmful if not implemented carefully.\nIf you need to perform remote debugging then check back later, I’ll post how to do it very soon.\nWhen you want to debug a deployed application (which is currently in production usage) you need to attach to the (possibly) remote ASP.NET worker process, and then use Visual Studio to debug it. Note that when you set a breakpoint in the application, any production user will be halted there, so be careful when using one.\nWhen you published your web application to a production server, it is suggested that you set compilation debug to false, because it may slow down your application.\nContinue reading “Configure Debugging and Custom Errors”","Responsive web design is a new trend in the world of web design. It requires you to think about your website’s user experience from the perspective of the end user. This can be a difficult task, but it is essential for creating a great user experience.\nThink About What Users Want\nResponsive design is all about taking into consideration what users want, and designing the site or application to be as user-friendly and comfortable as possible. Websites that are responsive design-friendly generally look good on any device, whether it be a desktop computer, laptop, tablet device or even a mobile phone.\nSome of the benefits of responsive design include:\n1. Increased Visibility – Sites that are responsive design-friendly generally look good on any device, no matter how large or small. This means that potential customers can see your site regardless of their screen size or what kind of device they’re using.\n2. Improved User Experience – Websites that are responsive design-friendly generally load faster than those that are not, making the site more user-friendly and convenient. Users who have to wait long periods of time for a website to load can quickly become frustrated and switch to another website instead. Responsive design-friendly sites minimize these delays by adapting content and layout automatically so there’s never a need to reload the page completely.\nUse Media Queries For Responsive Design\nResponsive design is all about making websites that look great on all devices, from desktop to phones and tablets. But how do you make sure your website looks good on a range of devices without resorting to using different versions of the site? One way is to use media queries.\nProvide Clear Instructions For Users\nResponsive design is all about making a site or app that looks great on any device, regardless of its size or resolution. In order to make sure users have the best experience, it’s important to provide clear instructions for how to use the site or app. Not all devices are the same, so it’s important to provide instructions for both mobile and desktop users. Ideally, these instructions should be available in both the user’s native language and in English.\nAvoid Flashy Effects In Your Designs\nResponsive design is all about making a site adaptive to different devices and screen sizes. This means that you need to use simplified graphics, avoid flashy effects, and make sure your site looks good on a phone as well as a desktop. Grungy or outdated designs can be jarring on smaller screens and can actually take away from the overall user experience.\nKeep Images Small And Lightweight\nResponsive design is all about making websites that work well on a wide variety of devices. One of the things you need to keep in mind when designing a responsive site is how to reduce the size of images. Images can make a website feel heavy and slow, so it’s important to make sure you use light images that won’t bog down your website.\nMake Navigation Easy To Use\nWhen users visit a website, they need to be able to easily navigate through the site. Navigation is important because it allows users to find what they are looking for quickly and easily. A website that is easy to navigate will be more user friendly, which will lead to more visits and more sales.\nThere are a few things that can help make navigation easy. First, the layout of the website should be designed so that all of the major sections are easy to find. Second, all of the buttons and links on the page should be big enough for users to see and use easily. Third, all of the content on the page should be organized in an intuitive way so that users can find what they are looking for quickly and easily. Finally, any animations or other effects used on the page should not interfere with navigation. By following these tips, businesses can make their websites easy to use for both visitors and customers alike.\nEnsure That Fonts Are Clear And Readable\nFonts can make or break an online presence. Clear and readable fonts ensure that your website is easy to navigate, read, and use. Not all fonts are created equal and some may be harder to see or read on a screen due to their size or style. When selecting fonts, keep the following factors in mind:\n-The font should be legible at a large size\n-The font should be appropriate for the content\n-The font should be easy to find on a website\nOptimize Images For Mobile Viewers\nResponsive design is important for web and mobile devices. Not only does it ensure that a site looks good on a range of devices, but it can also optimize images for download and storage on smaller devices. Images that are optimized for mobile viewing can take up less space on a device, which can save you money in the long run.\nTest Your Designs On Multiple Devices\nWhen it comes to web design, one size definitely doesn’t fit all. That’s why it’s essential to test your designs on multiple devices, including mobiles and tablets. Not only will this help you ensure that your website looks great on all devices, but you’ll also learn which features work best on different devices. In short, responsive design is key when designing for the web!\nBe Flexible With Your Designs\nResponsive web design is all about making sure that the layout and design of your website adjusts automatically to fit any device or screen size. This means that you’re not limited by the dimensions of a desktop computer screen, or the width of a phone’s display. You can make your site look good on smartphones, tablets, laptops, desktops and even large-screen TVs!\nBut being flexible with your designs isn’t just about making things look good on different devices. It’s also about making sure that your website is easy to use no matter what device someone is using it on. If someone is using a smartphone, they might not want to have to zoom in and scroll around just to find what they’re looking for. Responsive web design makes sure that all content is easily accessible from anywhere on the page.\nBeing responsive isn’t always easy – but it’s definitely worth it if you want your website to be as successful as possible!\nThese are some tips on how to create responsive web designs that will satisfy users and increase conversions."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:7029bc14-ed97-42e0-860e-25caa395b242>","<urn:uuid:4b8e6a0e-4328-4ccd-9084-71f3cd1dbb67>"],"error":null}

As data volume continues to grow exponentially, understanding how to effectively manage and leverage it becomes increasingly essential. A key aspect of this involves understanding the difference between client-side and server-side data management, each having its own strengths and drawbacks. In this comprehensive guide, we’ll provide a simplified overview of these concepts to help you choose what’s best for your business needs, data strategy, and budget.\nThe Significance of Data Management\nBefore delving into client-side and server-side data management, it’s crucial to understand the concept of data management and its importance. In the simplest terms, data management refers to the practices, architectural techniques, and tools for managing, organizing, retrieving, maintaining, and preserving data. The ultimate goal of data management is to produce high-quality, reliable, and accessible data to support informed decision-making.\nEffective data management is the backbone of successful businesses in today’s data-driven world. It enables organizations to control their data, ensure data quality, enhance productivity, and meet regulatory requirements. Moreover, it allows organizations to draw meaningful insights from their data, leading to more informed decision-making, improved customer engagement, better marketing strategies, and ultimately, a competitive edge in the market.\nGiven the crucial role of data management, it’s not surprising that companies invest heavily in tools and technologies to streamline their data management process. Among these tools are platforms like Google Tag Manager, which offer both client-side and server-side data management options. These platforms provide organizations the flexibility to choose the method that best suits their unique needs and budget.\nMaking the Choice: Client-Side and Server-Side Data Management\nChoosing the right approach to data management is crucial for your organization’s success. The decision to use client-side or server-side data management will largely depend on your business needs, budget, technical capabilities, and the nature of the data you’re handling. In some cases, you may find that a combination of both methods is the best way forward.\nTo make an informed decision, it’s important to understand what these two methods entail, how they work, and their pros and cons. So, let’s take a closer look at each one.\nExploring Client-Side Tracking\nClient-side tracking, often carried out using tags, is a prevalent method for sending data from web pages. This process involves the user’s browser, also known as the client, sending data directly to a server.\nTypically, client-side tracking is utilized to collect and share data from your website with your marketing technology providers. This process is commonly referred to as tag management. Tag management systems enable marketers to manage and unify their customer data and digital marketing applications.\nA prominent advantage of client-side tracking is its lower cost. Unlike server-side tracking, which relies on third-party cloud resources, client-side tracking leverages the target user’s device for data transfer. As a result, it generally incurs lower costs, making it an attractive option for smaller businesses or those with budget constraints.\nClient-Side Tracking: Benefits and Drawbacks\nAs with any technology, client-side tracking comes with its own set of benefits and drawbacks. Understanding these can help businesses make an informed decision about whether it’s the right choice for them.\nBenefits of Client-Side Tracking\n- User Experience: Since client-side tracking occurs directly in the user’s browser, it allows for real-time data collection and analysis. This can significantly enhance user experience, as businesses can provide immediate feedback or personalized content based on the user’s behavior.\n- Accessibility and Ease of Use: Client-side tracking is typically easier to implement than server-side tracking. Many vendors provide a snippet of code that can be easily copied and pasted to start tracking data. The prevalence of client-side tracking has led to a wealth of online resources and expertise, making it a readily accessible option for many businesses.\n- Cost-Effective: As mentioned earlier, client-side tracking generally incurs lower costs compared to server-side tracking. This is because the data transfer process leverages the user’s device rather than third-party cloud resources.\nDrawbacks of Client-Side Tracking\n- Dependence on the User’s Device: Client-side tracking relies heavily on the user’s device and browser to function effectively. If the user’s device is old or the browser is outdated, it could impact the effectiveness of data tracking. Similarly, issues such as a slow internet connection or browser crashes could lead to data loss.\n- Potential Privacy Issues: With increased concerns about user privacy and data protection, using client-side tracking could potentially lead to compliance issues. Since the data is collected directly from the user’s browser, businesses must ensure they comply with all relevant data protection regulations.\nUnderstanding Server-Side Tracking\nIn contrast to client-side tracking, server-side tracking, also known as cloud delivery, is a method where data is sent to your web server or a different type of server by a pixel or tag. Your web server then passes that data to the destination system or server. This data could be used by various platforms such as a marketing automation platform, an analytics provider, a personalization tool, or another type of execution system.\nServer-side tracking provides greater control, accuracy, and reliability over data management. As the scope of data management is more concentrated, organizations can exert more control over the transmission process, leading to more accurate and reliable data.\nFurthermore, server-side tracking shifts the processing load from the user’s device to the cloud, which can significantly enhance application and device performance. A faster application that uses less power can improve the customer experience and potentially boost conversion rates.\nServer-Side Tracking: Advantages and Challenges\nJust like client-side tracking, server-side tracking also has its set of advantages and challenges that businesses should consider before making a choice.\nAdvantages of Server-Side Tracking\n- Improved Control and Accuracy: With server-side tracking, businesses have greater control over the data collection process. This can result in more accurate data and better insights for decision-making.\n- Enhanced Reliability: Server-side tracking isn’t as susceptible to data challenges due to client-side issues, such as an interrupted connection or an over-active ad blocker. This makes server-side tracking generally more reliable than its client-side counterpart.\n- Better Performance: By transferring the processing burden to the cloud, server-side tracking can significantly improve application and device performance. This can lead to an enhanced user experience and potentially higher conversion rates.\nChallenges of Server-Side Tracking\n- Higher Costs: Compared to client-side tracking, server-side tracking can be more expensive. This is because it involves using third-party cloud resources for data transfer.\n- Complex Implementation: Implementing server-side tracking can be more complex than client-side tracking. It requires more technical expertise and resources, which could be a challenge for smaller businesses or those with limited technical capabilities.\n- Data Latency: In some cases, server-side tracking may introduce a slight delay in data availability. This is because the data needs to be processed by the server before it can be used, which could take some time depending on the volume and complexity of the data.\nEmbracing the Data Layer Approach for Effective Data Management\nWhether you’re managing data on the server-side or client-side, one thing is certain: effective data management requires a robust data foundation. This is where the data layer approach comes in.\nThe data layer approach is a strategic method for managing data that involves creating a central repository or “layer” where all your data is stored. This data layer serves as a single source of truth, simplifying the process of defining and accessing data.\nTealium employs this data layer approach to create a vendor-neutral data foundation. This not only simplifies data management but also maximizes the benefits of balanced client-server data management. With an intuitive management interface, Tealium enables businesses to create a data taxonomy that can be accessed anywhere the client operates.\nBy standardizing your data and centralizing it in one place, the data layer approach significantly simplifies the process of using data, whether it’s client-side or server-side. This ensures that all your data is accurately tracked, securely stored, and easily accessible, regardless of where or how it’s collected.\nChoosing the Right Data Management Solution\nChoosing the right data management solution isn’t a one-size-fits-all approach. Depending on your specific needs, you might opt for cloud deployment (server-side) for data collection and delivery. Alternatively, traditional client-side tags may prove to be the optimal solution. In some cases, a combination of both methods might be the most effective way forward.\nWhen choosing between client-side and server-side data management, it’s crucial to consider a variety of factors. These include your business needs, budget, technical capabilities, the nature of the data you’re handling, and the regulatory environment you’re operating in.\nUltimately, the best data management solution is one that provides flexible capabilities that support both traditional and new data management practices. This enables you to adapt to changing business needs and technological advancements, ensuring that your data management process remains effective, efficient, and relevant.\nRemember, the key to successful data management lies not only in choosing the right method but also in understanding how to use it effectively. This requires a deep understanding of your data, your tools, and your overall business strategy. By keeping these considerations in mind, you can make an informed decision about your data management process and leverage your data to drive business success."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:f1a2d601-f675-472f-bfb9-2a60ff7231f9>","<urn:uuid:e06c79ca-b2f8-4423-bc62-624f2f04861e>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do elevation requirements differ between ankle sprain and carpal tunnel surgery recovery in the first week?","answer":"For ankle sprains, elevation is part of the POLICE protocol (Protection, Optimal Loading, Ice, Compression, Elevation) and should be maintained as needed throughout recovery. For carpal tunnel surgery, elevation is particularly crucial in the first four days after surgery to limit swelling, and the wrist should be kept elevated above the chest level when sitting or lying down. An arm sling can be used while standing or moving around.","context":["In the last couple of posts we've been discussing the details of ankle sprains and rehab. The major issue with the treatment of this injury is that it's often left incomplete before athletes head back into action. The good news is that there is a better way to rehabilitate this injury. We hope that by shedding light on the issue we can get everyone rehabbed the right way and send our athletes back to sport more confident and safe.\nWe spoke extensively about the RICE protocol last post, and while it's a good start this protocol needs an update. In an editorial in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, C.M. Bleakley suggests we adapt the RICE protocol to include protection and optimal loading and call it POLICE.\nProtection Optimal Loading Ice Compression Elevation\nLet's talk about the two new terms here: protection and optimal loading.\nProtection: This concept is similar to the idea of rest. In the previous paradigm rest meant staying off the injured foot as to protect the area from too much stress, which might disrupt the healing process. That sounds like it makes sense right? We don't want to setback any progress; however, too much rest can be a bad thing. When you don't give your muscles and ligaments load it actually weakens the structure of the tissue.\nOptimal Loading: While too much rest can be a bad thing, too much activity is still a bad thing too. Ideally it's about finding the right balance of rest and activity or in other words - the optimal load. Load is necessary to restore the strength and structure of collagen, the main tissue in ligaments. We've got to find the happy medium, enough load to stimulate your tissues without overloading them.\nSo when it comes to designing an effective rehab program we have to consider the big picture. What effect has the injury had on the damaged tissue itself? To the joint mechanics of the ankle? To the nervous system and communication with the brain? Considering these components and incorporating what we've learned from current research, its important we go beyond RICE. We need to implement manual therapy and appropriate exercise in to ankle rehab protocols. Of course, every injury is unique and will require it's own assessment and treatment plan, but all three of the following components should be included in ankle sprain rehab in some capacity.\n1. POLICE - Ice, compression and elevation is a good place to start but it's important not to be afraid of load. Loading is important and safe if applied correctly. Animal studies have shown that giving load to tissues actually helps them synthesize the proteins needed for soft tissue healing. Applying the right load helps you functionally too, by getting you moving comfortably sooner.\n2. Restoring Biomechanics - This is an important step in making sure that the involved bones and joints are positioned well and moving correctly. The most common dysfunction involves the talus bone (although other bones like the fibula and cuboid can also be affected.) In this case the talus can be sitting slightly forward, limiting motion of the ankle. A number of techniques can be used to restore motion of this joint, including hands-on ankle mobilizations, taping or even exercises. This can alleviate pain and make sure that athletes head back to sport with full range of motion. A review article by Bekerom in 2012 reported that patients who had manual therapy on their ankle had faster walking speed and better range of motion compared to those who only received RICE. Without treatment this dysfunction has been shown to persist for up to 6 months.\nHere are some examples of what these treatments and exercises\ncould look like:\nAdditionally, we should be looking at restoring correct movement patterns in the foot, knee, hip and trunk. More and more studies are showing that an ankle sprain injury can actually cause changes up the chain. This creates movement dysfunctions in the knee, hip, and even back. There is evidence that these changes outside of the ankle can also contribute to future ankle sprain injuries. So it's important to ensure that we don't just look at the mechanics of the ankle in isolation.\n3. Exercise - This is probably the most important component of ankle rehab. Multiple studies have shown that exercises reduce the incidence of future injury. The right exercises at the right time can help decrease swelling, increase range of motion, increase strength, improve joint position sense and improve your confidence and performance.\nExercises early on in the injury can be particularly important. In these early phases the muscles around the injury site actually are inhibited from functioning optimally. This inactivation has a direct impact on muscle strength, balance and the brain-muscle connection. So not moving the ankle just makes things worse. A 2010 study by Bleakley and collegues showed that those who initiated simple exercises in the first week (you can see the exercises below) after the injury were able to be significantly more active. They spent more time walking and were able to do more light intensity activities. These exercises included a simple circular range of motion exercises, isometric strength exercises, a functional movement pattern and stretch.\nGetting active quickly, under the right guidance, is nothing to fear after an ankle sprain. In fact, it's really good for you!\nIn the longer term, 4 studies have shown that training balance and coordination actually helps prevent the reoccurrence of ankle injuries for up to 12 months. Another long-term effect of ankle injury is reduced strength, so including strengthening exercises is also important.\nHere are some examples of exercises that were used in these studies. Single leg knee flexion on a disc, toe raises, a static single leg stance on a balance disc, knee swing-throughs on a disc, lateral knee swings on a disc, and toe walking.\nAs you can see, these exercises are pretty simple and don't require much equipment; but taking the time to include them in your rehab can make a big difference. Not only will you feel better sooner, but also it can actually affect whether or not you suffer future injuries. It's a win-win.\nSo if you suffer an ankle sprain, know that there's more you can do than just wait. In fact, there are a lot of good reasons to be more active about properly rehabilitating this type of injury. Begin with identifying the type of injury you've suffered so that you can be specific about what is included in your rehab. From there remember to go beyond the RICE acronym and think about what is included in POLICE. Finally, it's important to have a biomechanical assessment and treat the injury with a targeted exercise program. We hope that sheds some light on the importance of correctly managing this common and often poorly managed injury.\nWhat Is the Evidence for Rest, Ice, Compression, and Elevation Therapy in the Treatment of Ankle Sprains in Adults? journal of athletic training Bleakley, C.

However, it is important to take things slow and ease back into using your wrist. Take it week by week to ensure that you do not overexert your wrist and cause damage.\nDuring the First Week after Surgery\n1Follow a doctor-recommended rehabilitation plan. This plan will involve healing of your soft muscles, preventing wrist stiffness, and repairing your nerves and tendons. You will most likely have to check in with your doctor and/or physical therapist regularly to make sure that everything is going according to plan.\n2Keep your wrist elevated as much as possible. This is particularly important in the first four days after surgery to limit swelling. You can use an arm sling while standing or moving around to keep your wrist elevated.\n- When sitting or lying down, prop your wrist up on a cushion so that your hand and wrist are elevated above your chest. Doing this will help to limit swelling, which can also limit the pain you experience.\n3Move your fingers. Gently and slowly move your fingers, extending them so that they are straight as much as possible. After extending your fingers, bend them at the knuckles to try to touch the bottom of your palm with your fingertips. Repeat this process 50 times within an hour. Doing this will help to strengthen your weakened tendons.\n- Switch between these finger motion exercises until you feel like you can do them relatively easily without stress of pain.\n4Do finger abduction and adduction. This is a simple exercise aiming to train your fingers to move with the flexor tendons. Doing this can also help to reduce swelling. To do this exercise:\n- Open your hand and keep your fingers straight. Open your fingers as wide as you can, then squeeze them back together.\n- Repeat this exercise ten times.\n5Use your hand for simple everyday activities. While exercises are very beneficial, simply using your hand to do commonplace things will give it a good workout. However, don’t use your hand for prolonged periods of time, particularly if the activity involves pressure on the wrists like typing on your laptop.\n- As a reminder, you should not return to work for at least two weeks after your surgery so that your wrist muscles and tendons can heal. If you force yourself to begin typing again, your pain will get triggered again and your weak tendons will become irritated.\n6Apply ice to relieve any pain or swelling. Apply ice routinely, every day, especially in the first four days after your surgery. The cold temperature will help to reduce swelling and pain, as the cold constricts your blood vessels.\n- Wrap ice or a cold compress in a hand towel so that you do not apply the ice directly to your skin, as applying ice for too long a period of time could cause skin damage. Leave the cold compress on your wrist for 15 to 20 minutes.\nDuring the Second Week after Surgery\n1Have the post-surgery dressing removed. You will receive a heavy duty band-aid to cover the stitches. You will have to replace the band-aid as it gets soiled; when you remove it, take the time to clean your wrist and around your stitches.\n- While you will now be able to take a shower and get your wrist wet, you should not dunk your wrist in a pool or bowl filled with water.\n2Wear a wrist brace. Your doctor will give you a wrist brace to wear during your second week after surgery. You should wear it during the day, and when you are sleeping at night. The brace is meant to keep your wrist safe and in a fixed position.\n- You should remove the brace when taking a shower and when doing the exercises listed in the following steps.\n3Introduce thumb flexion exercises into your previous routine. Keep on performing the previous finger motion exercises; they should be much easier to perform this week. Add in the “thumb flexion”. Do this by opening your hands and extending your fingers. Place your palm face up, then bend your thumb, trying to reach the base of your smallest finger to the other side of your hand. Return it back to its original position.\n- Repeat this process about ten times.\n4Do a thumb stretch exercise. An exercise called “Thumb stretch” is made by opening your hand palm, straightening all your fingers and turning your palm up. Grab your thumb outside so that it is pulled back.\n- Count to five then release. Repeat this process ten times.\n5Try a forearm extensor exercise. This exercise can be done by extending your arm in front of you, while keeping your elbow straight and your palm pointing towards the ground. Use your other hand to hold your fingers of the extended arm and gently push it down until you feel a stretch. This will help to stretch your muscles in your forearm and the back of your wrist.\n- Hold this position for five seconds. Repeat this process five times throughout the day.\n6Perform a forearm flexor exercise. This exercise can be done by extending your arm in front of you, while keeping your elbow straight and your palm pointing to the ceiling. Use the other hand to hold your fingers of the extended arm and gently push down until you feel a stretch. Pull your fingers toward your forearm. Hold this position for five seconds, then release. Repeat this process five times.\n- Transition into the next part of this stretch. Point your palm down and use your other hand to grab your fingers. Move them up toward your forearm until you feel a stretch. Count to five and then release. Repeat this process five times.\n7Do some wrist curls. This one is done with the aid of a table, chair or with your other hand. Extend your arm in front of you and make a fist. Place your forearm on the table and hang your hand off the edge. Face your palm down towards the ground.\n- Move your hand up and down by bending your wrist; do this very gently. Repeat this process ten time, then rotate your arm so that your palm points towards the floor. Move your hand up and down another ten times.\n- You can use your other hand, rather than a table, to support your elbow.\nDuring the Third Week following Surgery\n1Get your stitches removed. Head to the doctor’s office to get your stitches out. You will be allowed to soak your wrist in water three to four days after your stitches have been removed. You will have to wait so that the small stitch holes can heal and close.\n- Use lotion or cream to rub on the scars that the stitches may have left. Doing this will help to heal scar tissue that may have formed. Do not use perfumed lotion, as this may irritate the area where the stitches were.\n- Massage the area with lotion for five minutes, twice a day.\n2Gradually use your wrist brace less and less. You will no longer have to wear your wrist brace at night but you should still wear it during the day. You will soon be able to limit the amount of time you wear it to when you are doing physical activities.\n- If you decide to go back to work, you should continue to wear your brace for roughly six weeks after you return to work.\n3Start strengthening exercises, such as the forearm extensor exercise and wrist curls. Make a fist with your hand to increase the pressure on your wrist and stretch in your forearms while performing the extensor exercise described in the previous section. This will deepen the exercise and make it more rewarding.\n- The wrist curls described in the previous section can be enhanced by holding a light weight, like a water bottle or tennis ball. This extra weight can increase the intensity of the exercise by increasing the resistance put on your wrist.\n4Try an ulnar glide exercise. This exercise is done by sitting with your back straight and looking forward. Bend your head to the side opposite to the affected arm, raise your affected arm to your side in your shoulder line. Form the “okay” sign with your hand by pushing your thumb and index finger together.\n- Raise your arm, then bend it toward your head while raising your elbow so that the circle made by your thumb and forefinger is placed next to your eye. The other three fingers should be placed on your face and ear. Apply pressure to your face with your wrist to fully extend your wrist. Count to five, then repeat ten times.\n5Work on some grip exercises. Grip exercises are done at this time too to build up and strengthen your muscles at the forearm, wrist and grip area. They can be done using a chair. You can add some weights on the chair to increase the exercise intensity and give yourself more challenging exercises.\n- Lie on the floor on your stomach in front of the chair so that if you extend your arms you could grab its first two legs. Hold them tight with your hands while keeping your elbows straight and resting on the floor.\n- The first exercise is to try to elevate the chair up in the air for ten seconds without making it touching the floor again, then return it back to the floor, the second exercise is the same but with elevating the chair for 30 to 40 seconds, you should have the minimal rest between each exercise and the other as much as possible to be able to work on the all forearm muscles group.\n- The third exercise is done by raising the chair for two seconds, then lowering it down quickly without making it reach the floor, then raising it again for two seconds and lowering it and so on, the reason for the two seconds that you don’t want to perform much quick up and downs.\n- The last exercise is done while making twisting motion that need more stability and strength from your muscles, just raise the chair above the floor for about twenty to thirty seconds while making a twist motion bringing it slightly quickly right and left.\nHow would a minor surgery with minor sutures affect exercises that one can do?wikiHow ContributorWhat one considers \"minor\" may not be, depending on age or other factors. Without more specifics it would be best to ask your doctor. As a general rule of thumb, you want a slow, steady increase in strength training. Nothing but range of motion, then gentle resistance, maybe tension bands, then light weight (as little as a pound), increasing as you gain strength.\nIs it normal to have pain and numbness in my fingers two weeks after surgery?wikiHow ContributorNo. One of the risks the surgeon should've covered with you as part of your pre-op review is the possibility of nerve damage from the procedure. It is possible that a nerve was nicked or severed during the procedure. It is also possible that scar tissue has adhered to the nerve during the healing process. Most people (myself included) experience immediate nerve relief from the procedure.\nIs it possible to push or pull on the hand? What if the person has left handed weakness after a stroke?wikiHow ContributorI suffered a stroke and feel your frustration. The important part of the above exercises is the positioning of the recovering hand and arm as shown in the images. What moves your injured hand to achieve the described exercise is irrelevant (another person, a theraband from physical therapist, a wall or book shelve, or whatever helps you achieve the stretch). Just be gentle, patient, and don't injure yourself in being creative!\nIt's been five weeks since I've had my surgery. I'm still having pain in my wrist when pushing or pulling. Is this normal?wikiHow ContributorYes. Different people heal differently. If you're concerned, contact your doctor about it.\n- If you are going to have a shower, wrap a plastic bag around your wrist to prevent water from reaching your dressing.\n- To prevent the plastic bag from detaching, be sure to turn the water on low to avoid a powerful stream of water hitting your arm/hand and ripping the plastic off."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:fc8d4415-3dae-4e36-9fa7-ca343baa5976>","<urn:uuid:1f2ba25e-f99c-4d0d-84d4-89b7cf7c78b5>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How does the polar vortex contribute to extreme winter weather, and what is its connection to Arctic warming trends?","answer":"The polar vortex, a whirlpool of frigid air, normally remains locked up over the Arctic during winter. However, it can become unstable, possibly due to melting ice and warmer polar winters. When weakened, it allows streams of cold Arctic air to flow into other parts of the Northern Hemisphere. This instability is connected to Arctic warming, as increased heat from open water in the Arctic Ocean rises into the atmosphere, weakening the jet stream (polar vortex). The weakened jet stream then disintegrates into lobes that carry cold air south and warm air north, leading to unseasonably frigid temperatures in places like Florida and unusually warm weather in the north. For instance, in November-December, the North Pole experienced temperatures 32 degrees Fahrenheit higher than normal due to warm weather drawn up from California.","context":["The past couple weeks have given climate change sceptics plenty of events that seem like reasons to dispute global warming.\nAn inundation of wintry weather across the country carried snowstorms and freezing temperatures everywhere from the Pacific Northwest to the Southeast.\nMost recently, snowstorms in Buffalo, NY have made travel impossible, caused roofs to buckle, and left at least a dozen people dead.\nIf it’s so cold and there’s a dangerous amount of snow, then how could the Earth possibly be warming?\nPart of the confusion comes down to our understanding of weather and climate. People question the scientific reality of global warming because they don’t know the difference between the two.\nWeather is what we see day-to-day. It explains changes in the atmosphere over short periods of time and is highly unpredictable. A sudden thunderstorm or blizzard is what we refer to as weather.\nClimate, on the other hand, describes the behaviour of the atmosphere over long periods of time.\nUsing weather (i.e a few very cold days) as evidence against global warming (i.e a decade of hotter summers) is kind of like using one man’s early death to disprove the fact that, on average, life expectancies are increasing.\nThere will continue to be hot and cold extremes, but when the weather is averaged over time, a clear warming trend emerges. The 2009 State of the Climate Report, compiled by hundreds of scientists around the world, revealed that the first decade of this century was the hottest since scientists started recording data in the 1880s.\nThe current decade is shaping up to be a record breaker, as well. Data just released by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) show that this October was the hottest one on record — and April, May, June, August, and September all broke their own records this year, too.\nNOAA’s map below shows how this October’s temperatures stack up to average temperatures for this time of year. Red areas are warmer than average and blue areas are colder than average. Overall, there is a general warming pattern across the map — and that’s true not just of this month, but of the entire year. In fact, 2014 is currently on track to become the hottest year on record.\nBut climate contrarians will still protest: “Our climate has gone through huge transitions before!” That’s true.\nOver the past million of years the Earth has shifted between warm “interglacial” periods and cool “glacial” periods. These changes, however, occurred over long stretches of time and were caused by natural variation in the Earth’s system. The changes in climate that scientists are observing today are man-made, caused by an increasing level of heat-trapping greenhouse gases in the planet. As a result, the warming of our planet is happening on a much shorter time-scale than ever before.\nIn fact, the whirlpool of frigid air, known as the “polar vortex” — which was blamed for last winter’s “eye-popping” cold weather and has been held responsible for some of this month’s frigid conditions — may actually be tied to warming temperatures in the Arctic.\nDuring the winter, these winds normally remain locked up over the Arctic. Last winter, the polar vortex made headlines when it became notably unstable (a pattern that was also observed in 2009-2010), possibly because of melting ice and warmer polar winters. The weakened vortex allows streams of the cold Arctic air to break free, flowing into other parts of the Northern Hemisphere.\nEarlier this month, polar winds were disrupted by a weather event known as a “bomb cyclone,” which rammed into the polar jetstream and sent a flurry of unseasonably cold weather south through North America. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, warming temperatures are likely to cause an increase in extreme weather events around the globe, including the kind of cyclone mentioned above.\nSo while this wintry weather may seem like a sign of hope for the earth, it’s important to note that climate change is capable of producing all kinds of effects. And paying attention to longterm patterns rather than short-term weather events is the best way to find out the truth about what’s happening on the planet.\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts\nSite highlights each day to your inbox.","Arctic climate warming higher and faster than expected\nOpen water in Arctic Ocean affecting weather patterns around world\nA new international report shows that Arctic temperatures are rising higher and faster than expected, and the effects are already being felt around the world.\n\"The Arctic's climate is shifting to a new state,\" warns the report.\n\"This transformation has profound implications for people, resources and ecosystems worldwide.\"\nThe Snow, Water, Ice and Permafrost in the Arctic assessment was written by more than 90 scientists from around the world who compiled the latest northern research on how climate change is affecting the Arctic ice and ecosystems.\nIt's part of the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Program of the Arctic Council, which represents eight circumpolar countries.\nAmong the findings in this year's report:\n- The Arctic Ocean could be largely free of sea ice in the summer as early as 2030 or even before that.\n- Arctic temperatures are rising twice as fast as the temperatures in the rest of the world.

Increased heat from the open water is rising into the atmosphere, which in turn is causing the polar vortex, also known as the jet stream, to weaken in strength.\nThe jet stream is the line of powerful winds between the cold dry air of the North Pole and the warm moist air mass farther south. As it weakens, it disintegrates into a series of lobes dipping up and down, carrying cold air south and warm air north.\nScientists believe that's the reason why we are seeing unseasonably frigid temperatures in places like Florida and unusually warm weather in the north.\n\"For example, last fall in November-December, the temperature at the North Pole was 32 degrees Fahrenheit higher than it should have been in November-December, because one of these lobes had extended all the way to the North Pole and was drawing up warm weather from California,\" said Barber.\nThe report says the weakened jet stream is also causing extreme weather events like heavy rain in North America and heavy monsoons in Southeast Asia.\nAmid the dire predictions, the report contains some hope. It says that while these changes in the Arctic will continue until 2050, they can be slowed down after that.\nIt predicts that if governments make substantial cuts to greenhouse gas emissions, like those contained in the Paris climate agreement, it can help to stabilize the warming trends in the Arctic and stop further loss of ice and snow by the end of the century.\nThis report is being released ahead of the Arctic Council meeting in Fairbanks, Alaska, on May 11.

{"question":"What is the key difference between area 3a and S1 (area 3b) in terms of what type of sensory information they process in primates?","answer":"Area 3a is activated mainly by muscle spindle receptors and other proprioceptors that respond while the body moves and provide a sense of body part position, while S1 (area 3b) responds almost exclusively to touch receptors.","context":["Primate S1 cortex\n|Jon H. Kaas (2013), Scholarpedia, 8(6):8238.\n|revision #150514 [link to/cite this article]\nIntroduction All mammals have a region of somatosensory cortex that is called primary somatosensory cortex or S1. The term stands for the cortical representation of touch that was discovered and described first. The name became useful when other cortical representations of touch were discovered, starting with the second representation, S2. Early investigators used Roman numerals for cortical areas, but now Arabic numerals have become common. S1 or SI has also been referred to as SmI by Clinton Woolsey and co-workers to recognize that somatosensory area I also has a small motor (m) component. S1 was first described in cats in 1941 as a single, systematic representation of the contralateral body surface located in parietal cortex of each cerebral hemisphere. The experimental results, obtained by recording the activities of neurons in many locations throughout the representation with penetrating electrodes, indicated that medial recording sites in S1 are activated by touching the hind foot, more lateral sites by the forefoot, and the most lateral sites by the face. The disclosed representation of the contralateral body surface was described as somatotopic because neurons in S1 were activated from tail to tongue in a mediolateral sequence across cortex. From this beginning, S1 has been considered to be a single, roughly somatotopic representation of the contralateral body surface that has a characteristic mediolateral orientation and internal organization across mammal species.\nSubsequent studies have associated S1 across species with a strip of cortex that has a distinctive laminar appearance, as cortical layer 4 is densely packed with small neurons that receive activating inputs via axons from the ventroposterior nucleus of the somatosensory thalamus. S1 sends somatosensory information to other areas of somatosensory cortex, including S2. Neurons in S1 (3b) are activated by light touch on the skin. Each neuron is typically activated by inputs from a small region of skin, such as part of the tip of a single finger, and this activating surface is called the receptive field. Touch outside the activating receptive field usually reduces the response to touch within the receptive field, or has little effect. After damage to S1, small objects may be unrecognized by touch and ignored, and grasping with the hand may be difficult.\nThe S1 Region of Monkeys and Humans In early studies of parietal cortex in monkeys and humans, S1 was not correctly identified. In brief, the region often called S1 in monkeys, apes and humans mistakenly included four different architectonic fields that are called Brodmann's areas 3a, 3b, 1 and 2 after the early studies of Brodmann over 100 years ago. Each of these areas has its own representation of the body, but only the area 3b representation has the defining characteristics of S1 as described in cats, rats and other mammals. These include having a representation that is almost exclusively responsive to the activation of touch receptors, a characteristic internal somatotopic organization that is coextensive with a cytoarchitectonic field that has a layer 4 that is more densely packed with small neurons than adjoining areas, and more dense inputs from the ventroposterior nucleus to layer 4 than any other area. In monkeys and humans, areas 3a, 1 and 2 contain additional representations of the body surface that parallel S1 in somatotopic organization. While area 3a is dominated by inputs from muscle spindle receptors for proprioception, and area 2 also has major inputs from proprioceptors, neurons in area 1 and at least much of area 2 respond well to light touch. The responsiveness of these other cortical areas to touch was part of the problem of defining S1 in early recording studies of somatosensory cortex in monkeys and humans. The other part of the problem was that most of the recordings in early experiments were done with surface electrodes on the exposed surface of somatosensory cortex, and most of area 3b is hidden on the caudal bank of the deep central sulcus of Old World monkeys, apes and humans. Thus, most of the recordings were from areas 1 and 2, as they were largely on the cortical surface. As areas 1 and 2 paralleled area 3b in their mediolateral somatotopic sequence, recordings from areas 1 and 2 were considered to be from S1. Furthermore, as areas 3b and 3a were also recognized as responsive to touch, all four architectonic strips, each now known to contain a separate representation of the body, were considered to be parts of a single representation, S1, by early investigators. This misnomer persists in many reports today, as S1 is often used to refer broadly to anterior parietal cortex in current studies in humans and monkeys. Since each of the four architectonic fields has its own representation and functions, this careless misuse creates confusion and impedes further progress and understanding.\nHere, S1, sometimes called S1 proper, refers only to the area 3b representation. Electrophysiological evidence that area 3b of monkeys contains a complete representation of touch receptors of the contralateral body surface was first obtained in New World owl and squirrel monkeys, as these monkeys had most of area 3b exposed on the surface of the brain. Owl monkeys have only a shallow dimple in cortex rather than a deep central sulcus, and squirrel monkeys have only a short, shallow central sulcus. Thus, it was possible to visually place microelectrodes into hundreds of sites in area 3b of these monkeys, record the responses of neurons at these sites to touch on the body, and determine where on the body touch activated neurons for each site. In this manner, receptive fields were determined for neurons at each site. By outlining the cortical territories of sites where neurons were activated by the same body part, such as digit 1 (thumb), maps of where body parts are represented in area 3b were constructed (Fig. 1). The results indicate that the area 3b representation (S1) extends from the medial wall of the cerebral hemisphere lateral to the margin of the lateral sulcus where it curves rostrally to end near the ventral margin of the hemisphere. Part of the posterior leg and tail are represented on cortex of the medial wall, followed in a mediolateral sequence by representation of the toes and foot, anterior leg, genitals and trunk, arm, and hand and digits. In cortex just lateral to the hand representation, parts of the face are represented, followed as the representation curves anteriorly by the teeth, tongue, and finally the ipsilateral teeth and tongue as these important mouth parts are represented in S1 of both cerebral hemispheres. The cortical territories devoted to the teeth are activated by sensitive receptors around the roots of the teeth that respond to when the teeth are touched. Large proportions of area 3b (S1) that respond to touch on the digits of the hand, the teeth and the tongue, show how important these parts of the body are in providing touch information to the cortex.\nA similar area 3b (S1) representation has been revealed in all studied primates. This representation was examined first in microelectrode mapping studies in other New World monkeys, such as marmosets and titi monkeys, and in prosimian galagos, where a central sulcus is absent, but area 3b has been explored in some detail in Old World macaque monkeys with electrodes that penetrated into the cortex along the posterior bank of the central sulcus. In addition, a similar organization of area 3b has been determined in less detail in humans using functional magnetic imaging.\nArea 3b (S1) is bordered along its anterior border in all primates by a narrow strip of cortex, area 3a that is activated mainly by muscle spindle receptors and other proprioceptors that respond while the body moves and provide a sense of the position of body parts. This information is relayed to area 3a from a separate nucleus in the somatosensory thalamus called the ventroposterior superior nucleus (VPS). A similar proprioceptive strip of cortex is found along the anterior border of S1 in at least most mammals. As area 3a receives inputs from area 3b (S1), neurons in area 3a also responds to touch, but such responses are often not apparent in anesthetized animals. Area 3a provides an important source of proprioceptive information to the anteriorly adjoining motor cortex. The posterior border of area 3b (S1) is formed by area 1 in primates. Area 1 receives direct inputs from area 3b, and it appears to be dependent on area 3b for most of its neural responsiveness. Thus, area 1 is a second order cortical area, much like the second visual area, V2, or the second somatosensory area, S2. Nevertheless, area 1 does receive somatosensory inputs directly from the ventroposterior nucleus of the somatosensory thalamus, but to layer 3 rather than layer 4. In most monkeys neurons in area 1 are highly responsive to touch, even in anesthetized animals, and area 1 contains a complete somatotopic representation of the contralateral body that parallels that in area 3b (S1), thus accounting for the confusion of including area 1 in S1 in early studies on monkeys. However, the internal order of the somatotopy in area 1 differs from that in area 3b in that area 1 basically forms a mirror reversal of the somatotopy in area 3b. For example, the digits tips are represented anteriorly in area 3b and posteriorly in area 1. A variously named strip of cortex with inputs from S1 exists along the posterior border of S1 in most mammals, but this cortex is not highly responsive to touch in anesthetized animals. This is also the case in prosimian primates, and even in marmoset monkeys, where the area 1 cortex is unresponsive or poorly responsive to touch in anesthetized animals. Thus, in these primates, and in most mammals, there would be little chance of mistakenly including the area 1 territory in S1 in recording experiments.\nIn a similar manner, a strip of cortex along the posterior border of area 1 is variably responsive to touch across primates. At least in parts of this area 2 field neurons are highly responsive to touch in macaque monkeys, and this responsive region was included in S1 in early studies in Old World macaque monkeys. Area 2 receives proprioceptive information directly from the ventroposterior superior (VPS) nucleus of the thalamus, and touch information from area 3b (SI) and area 1. Neurons in area 2 are not very responsive to touch in some New World monkeys, and in prosimian primates, and even in Old World monkeys, neurons in all parts of the architectonically defined field are not highly responsive to touch. Area 2 provides an important source of somatosensory information to posterior parietal cortex.\nKaas, J H (1983). What, if anything is SI? Organization of first somatosensory area of cortex.

{"question":"Hey, need help fast - how to safely mix muriatic acid with water? Gotta do pool maintenance tmrw","answer":"When mixing muriatic acid with water, follow these essential safety steps: 1) Wear full-face protection, respirator, thick clothing, and acid-resistant gloves. 2) Use a glass or acid-resistant plastic container. 3) First fill the container with water. 4) Slowly and carefully pour the acid into the water - never add water to acid as this will cause a dangerous reaction. 5) The general dilution ratio is one-part muriatic acid to 10 parts water, though this may vary by job. 6) Keep baking soda or garden lime nearby to neutralize any spills.","context":["Muriatic acid, a less-pure variant of hydrochloric acid, is available in high concentrations for use in a host of home restoration and maintenance projects.\nWhile this powerful chemical agent runs cheap-about $10 a gallon at home centers, hardware stores, and even on Amazon-it's still very caustic stuff, capable of corroding everything from some plastics and metals to clothing and skin. In fact, working with it poses numerous health risks: Momentary skin exposure can cause severe burns, inhaling its fumes can burn lung and nose lining, and contact can also cause irreversible eye damage or blindness.\nHomeowners should never reach for muriatic acid lightly. Instead, consider it a “last resort” when less toxic products fail to do the trick in cleaning, prepping, deoxidizing, or removing mold from masonry, concrete, metal, and swimming pools. Before you begin any project with this multipurpose substance, read on, first for guidance in using it safely, and then for its range of practical applications around the house.\nEssential Safety Measures with Muriatic Acid\nDue to all of the damage this chemical could cause in one wrong move, extreme caution is mandatory when using, storing, and disposing of muriatic acid. Adhere to the following best practices before beginning any project that involves the acid:\n- Wear full-face protection, a respirator, thick, full-coverage clothing, and acid-resistant protective gloves.\n- Muriatic acid must be diluted in water. Though degree of dilution will vary depending on the job, the general formula is one-part muriatic acid to 10 parts water.\n- When making a dilution, slowly and carefully pour the acid into the water. Never add water to acid, as an exothermic reaction will occur, propelling the acid out of the container and onto you.\n- Never pour muriatic acid into an empty vessel. Fill the container with the right amount of water before adding the acid.\n- Never mix muriatic acid with other acids.\n- Only mix muriatic acid in a glass or acid-resistant plastic container (find a list here).\n- Always store muriatic acid in the container it came in.\n- Keep a supply of baking soda or garden lime nearby in case you need to quickly neutralize muriatic acid. While sprinkling these substances full-strength will work, the best plan is to mix ½ cup of baking soda and a quart of water in a sealed spray bottle and keep it nearby.\n- Work with a hose or large container of water nearby to wash skin in case of accidental splashing.\n- If using muriatic acid on large surface areas, it will need to be applied with a plastic sprayer. The plastic is bound to deteriorate quickly, so you'll likely need more than one to complete the job.\n- Contact your local recycling center for instructions on safe disposal of muriatic acid in your area.\nEffective Uses for Muriatic Acid\nPractice all the safety precautions above, and you should be able to use muriatic acid with great success. Here are six projects where you might find it indispensable:\n- Neutralizing alkalinity in masonry. Masonry alkalinity can discolor or burn off paint finishes. Washing brick, concrete, or stone with muriatic acid can neutralize alkalinity, allowing paint finishes to last for years. Brush or spray on a 1:10 diluted mix of acid in water onto the surface, allow to sit for up to 10 minutes, but no longer, then spray it with a solution of 1 cup ammonia in a gallon of water to neutralize the acid. Allow the surface to dry completely before applying paint or other treatments.\n- Removing efflorescence and prepping masonry for paint. Efflorescence refers to the white crystalline blooming that can occur on masonry surfaces, including brick and concrete. Often a sign that masonry contains too much moisture, efflorescence may indicate that a sealant is needed to contain moisture issues. Prior to applying sealant, however, efflorescence must be removed. Likewise, if you want to paint masonry, the surface needs to be “etched.” You can remove efflorescence and etch a masonry surface in one shot: Apply a 1:10 dilution of muriatic acid to water, let sit for a few minutes until you see the efflorescence lifting, then brush with a stiff nylon brush to remove residue. Spray down the surface afterwards with a 1:16 ammonia-water neutralizing solution.\n- Basement makeover. Fight mold and mildew in your basement while restoring surface appearance with muriatic acid. Just be sure to ventilate the basement as much as possible, and wear a respirator. Apply a 1:9 acid-to-water dilution, scrub visible mold patches on hard surfaces like concrete, bricks, and on some glazed tiles and grout, with a stiff nylon brush, and rinse thoroughly by hosing down with water. Use a wet vac to suck up excess water. Air the basement out for a few hours after this task is completed.\n- Busting rust. The use of muriatic acid to remove rust on metal is a contentious topic, as the substance can potentially lead to more rapid oxidization in the future. So the cautious DIYer should only use it only on stainless steel (and never cast iron) that will be painted after rust removal. Brush the acid on at a 1:10 acid/water dilution and scrub with a nylon brush. Immediately after removing rust, neutralize the acid with a baking soda-water paste (1:1). Apply paste generously so it thoroughly coats acid-washed and let sit for 10 minutes and then rinse with water, dry, and prep for paint. (Find more specific how-to info here.)\n- Swimming pool maintenance. Muriatic acid can get your swimming pool's surface looking like new again. Spray a 1:16 acid-to-water diluted solution on the drained surface of the pool, let it sit for 10 to 15 minutes. For stubborn stains, scrub with a nylon brush. Rinse thoroughly with plain water.\n- Swimming pool pH balance. If the pool's pH level is too high, muriatic acid can bring balance to the water. Purchase “swimming pool acid” for this maintenance task. Though nothing more than muriatic acid-and the same price-it will have thorough instructions and formulas for use in a swimming pool. You'll added it in, re-test the pH levels after a few hours and once it's back in range, you'll be ready for that dip!"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:c3f50bf2-4478-440d-84b3-68486c0ec072>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I teach both horseback riding and skateboarding - what's the first safety rule to teach kids in both sports?","answer":"In both horseback riding and skateboarding, wearing appropriate protective gear is paramount for safety. For horseback riding, an appropriate fitting safety helmet is essential. Similarly for skateboarding, a helmet that meets ASTM F1492 board helmet standards is a must for both beginners and experienced riders. Additionally, both sports require proper supervision and understanding of basic safety rules before starting to practice.","context":["While horses are an amazing experience for kids there are also risks involved so safety has to be paramount. However, with care and attention, it’s easy to instil respect for the dangers without making children fearful and spoiling their enjoyment.\nBy laying down ground rules from the start, using the right kit and equipment and ensuring children are fully aware of all the issues, horse riding can be a safe and beneficial experience for all ages and families.\nThe basics of wearing an appropriate fitting safety helmet, having the right size saddle and appropriately supervised riding sessions should go without saying to keep children safe at all times while riding horses.\nHowever, there are also a number of key areas which children should know about when spending time around horses and handling them, to keep them safe and accident-free. We spoke to Russ from Australia’s top equine classified website, Horseseller, for his advice. Here are his top five safety tips for kids who are spending time with horses:\n- Advise children to always approach a horse shoulder on\nHorses don’t have great vision and have strong blind spots, particularly in the front of their heads. So children need to learn early on that it’s very dangerous to approach a horse head on and they should always approach the animal shoulder on instead. Anyone standing in a horse’s blind spot can cause it to spook and run, which can be incredibly dangerous.\nChildren should also be taught never to duck underneath a horse’s neck as the horse might not see them and could spook. Unfortunately, children do have a tendency to want to go underneath horses so it’s really important they understand the dangers from the beginning.\nLikewise, children often want to sit or crawl around at ground level but around horses, they need to understand that the horse might not be able to see them so it’s important they stand up at all times near a horse. If they make a horse jump it can be incredibly dangerous.\n- Tell children not to run away from a horse, but to face it and back away\nHorses like to play and chase and if a child runs away from them they make think it’s time to play and give chase, which could be dangerous. Children should face the horse and back away, so they can keep their eyes on the animal and show the horse they are not playing, just leaving the field.\nIf a child backs away slowly, the horse will think they are easy to catch and will, therefore, be less likely to start playing chase with them, reducing the risk of danger and potential accident to them.\n- Make sure children know what ears back means\nWhen a horse pins its ears back it means the horse is upset or angry so it’s important that children understand this warning sign. Children are generally good at understanding body language so they won’t have any difficulty making sense of this signal from a horse either.\nThe best way to teach children is to show them when a horse puts its ears back, so they can see and recognise what ears back looks like first hand.\n- Teach children the dangers of wrapping ropes around hands or limbs\nChildren need to understand the danger of wrapping the horse’s lead rope around their hands or arms when holding a horse. Any kind of lead rope or rein around fingers, arms or hands could cause a break or major injury if the horse were to spook and pull the rope tight.\nThe same goes for never leading a horse by its halter with their fingers through the straps – they need to always use a rope and hold the loose bundle of rope within their palm, not wrapped around them.\n- The back end of a horse can kick hard\nIt’s vital for children to understand they should never go behind a horse as the power of a horse’s kick can kill an adult so make sure children know from the start, to stay away from a horse’s hind legs at all times.\nChildren do sometimes get tempted to duck under a horse’s belly as it’s about the right height but they need to understand the dangers of doing this. Children can be too small for a horse to see, so it might not know they are there and get spooked.\nChildren and horses can be a fantastic combination, with many health and fitness benefits associated with riding, as well as the companionship and responsibility of looking after an animal of their own.\nBy providing all of the right equipment during riding, and instilling rules and guidelines for safe behaviour around horses, from the outset, there is no reason why horseback riding can’t become a safe and enjoyable activity for the whole family.","So, you have just received your first skateboard and you are ready to explore the world of skateboarding. By now you must have known all the parts of a skate setup (deck, bearings, wheels, and trucks) and the other items that will assure you a safe riding experience (proper clothes, helmet, and pads).\nBut stepping on your board for the first time can be a challenge. A skateboard seems dangerous and unstable. Every time you step on it you might almost seem to flip over.\nIt makes you wonder; how do skaters stand on this thing? How is that possible? What about those riders who do crazy tricks? How can I get used to this board without hurting myself?\nDon’t fret out! You can easily step on your board too.\nI will teach you all the techniques in this article, and then with a little practice, it will be as if you have been riding for decades.\nSafety First: Important of Being Safe\nIt is easy for a beginner to lose balance when learning how to ride a skateboard. With every slip and fall, there is a chance you will get injured and end up in hospital. Some of these injuries can be fatal and skateboarders have even died due to collision with cars and head injuries.Beginners and kids are the most venerable. Over 50% of skateboard accidents happen to children of 15 years and below. 33% happen to beginners; people who have had a skateboard for less than 7 days. Experienced skaters also get hurt as the difficulty of moves and tricks increase.\nAlso, you can easily get hurt if you ride in places with poor surface and rocks.\nGear Guidelines: Important of Wearing Protective Gears\nMost people assume that all they need to begin skateboarding is a skateboard and a never give up attitude – until the first wipeout. Wood, concrete, asphalt, and other riding surfaces are not soft. A helmet is a must for a beginner as well as the experienced rider, and so are proper shoes, pads, and wrist guards.\nHere are the skateboarder’s gear start-up packs:\nDifferent models of skateboards do different tricks. If you want to learn mountain-boarding, you will require a big skateboard with knobby tires. Something small is perfect for the park. In addition to getting the right board, ensure that it’s working properly.\nInspect your board for damaged wheels, sharp edges, loose parts, and cracks before you start your first lesson (always do this before you start skateboarding).\nGo for a helmet that was designed for skateboarding, not riding motorcycles. Ensure that it has a sticker saying it meets all the ASTM F1492 board helmet standards. Your helmet should have a strong buckle and band, and the band should be securely tightened and snug when you ride.\nSkateboarding is rough on ankles, feet, and shoes. Always put on closed shoes, drop the sandals. If possible, get a shoe that is made of suede or leather. Also, make sure that the sole is made of grippy gum rubber and the shoe fits well.\nWrist Guards and Pads\nElbow and knee pads, as well as wrist guards, are recommended for all riders. These gears should have a tough plastic shield and should facility easy movement. Also, ensure that your pads are snug when you move.\nPadded jackets, shorts, skateboard gloves, and hip pads are all easily available and provide added protection. Mouth guards are also good for protecting your mouth and teeth from getting injuries.\nRiding Surface: Where to Ride\nThis might be the most critical decision you make when learning how to skateboard, as far as safety is concerned. Rough skating surface is responsible for over 50% of skateboarding injuries.You will probably start skateboarding in a skate park, your driveway, or your friend’s driveway. Wherever you choose, ensure that the surface is free of sticks, rocks, and other objects. In addition, watch out for cracks in the floor before you start skating, and ensure that there is zero chance of encountering a car.\nHere are some great skateboarding areas that you can begin your lesson at:\n- Skateparks: Follow the rules and regulations governing the use of the park, and go through the recommended part etiquette before you begin to skate around the park. Most parks have surfaces set for beginners. Stick to this corner or somewhere easy.\n- Empty pools: If you can get an empty pool, it’s even better. Familiarize yourself with its surface and watch out for any hazard that might be present.\n- Trails: If you want to learn mountain-boarding, then you will be using trails. Inspect the area for any fallen tree or any other object.\n- Warning: As a beginner, do not try riding in the street. The greatest cause of skateboarding death is cars.\nBefore You Start: Be in Top Shape\nIt’s common sense. The better shape you are in, the better you will be at skateboarding, and any other athletic activity. Eat a balanced diet and work out regularly. Stretch and warm up, especially your ankles, legs, and back, before you step on the board.\nWhile Riding: Riding Tips\nYou will certainly fall while learning how to ride a skateboard. Therefore:\n- Learn how to fall the right way without hurting yourself. If you begin to lose your balance, bend down so you won’t fall from a higher distance. Try to fall on your fleshy part of your body and roll over. Do not break the fall with hands or arms.\n- Bigger features and bigger tricks mean bigger injuries. As a beginner, learn a few simple tricks and then practice them before you try more complicated ones. Leave the never-die tricks to the professional until you have enough experience to try them safely.\n- Know and practice riders’ etiquette. In case you are at a skate park, always wait for your turn. Don’t jump in blindly into the mix. This will help you avoid accidents and prevent fights from breaking out.\nLet’s us move to the fun part.\nStep-by-Step Guide: Learning to Skateboarding\nI believe you are now ready to start learning the real skateboarding process.\nStepping on Your Skateboard\nThe first thing is to get comfortable with stepping on your skateboard. You will feel something uncomfortable about the board, especially if you have never stepped on one before, it’s new, or it’s borrowed.Set your skateboard on the carpet in your room or is some grass, and try stepping or even jumping on it. Try to balance on the back or front wheels only. Stand on your board and move your feet into various positions.\nThrough this, you will get used to the size of your skateboard and feel, and get comfortable while standing on it.\nSkateboard Stance: Regular vs. Goofy\nDetermine whether your ideal board stance is regular or goofy footed. This is a personal decision. Some people skate best when their left foot is forward while others prefer putting the right foot forward.What’s your preference? Ultimately, it will depend on what makes you feel comfortable. Just like people are left or right handed, some will use their left or right foot, or easily switch between them.\nRegular skating is putting your left foot forward while goofy is putting your right foot forward.\nFiguring out whether you are a goofy or regular skater can be a problem when starting. But don’t worry; here are a few tricks that you can try to figure it out:\n- The ball trick: Take a football or something like that, and place it on the surface and kick it. Whichever foot you have kicked the ball with is your back foot. The other foot is your balancing foot.\n- The step trick: Walk up a staircase. Note the first foot you used to step on the staircase. That’s your back foot.\n- The friend trick: Find your friend and stand with all your feet close, Then, request him/her to safely and lightly, push you from behind. The foot you will use to catch yourself is your back foot.\nPushing Your Skateboard\nBegin to Roll Your Board\n- First, attempt moving around your parking lot. Step on your board using your front foot, and place it such that your toes are just over the front truck or just a little behind, on top of your board.\n- Using your back foot, push off so that the board can begin to roll, and place your back foot on the board too, once you are moving at a comfortable speed.\n- When you begin to slow down, push off again with your back foot.\n- To make a turn, you can lean toward the direction you want to take, but this will be a slow turn. The best way to turn is to balance for a few seconds on the back wheels and swing the front wheels the side you want to turn. This will take a lot of practice (stick with the leaning for now).\nPractice This Technique\nIt’s vital you get comfortable with rolling around like that. Spend enough time practicing; this will really help. After feeling comfortable with rolling like that, try riding carefully down a hill that has no obstacles or cars.\nSpend some time skating downhill.\nHow to Stop Your Skateboard\nThe best way for a beginner is to take off the back foot and drag it on the surface. It will take time; you should spend sufficient time focusing on it so you can stop when you want.\nThis is another great way of stopping a board, but it is recommended for skaters who have the experience. Place the heel of your back foot such that it’s sticking off the back of the board and lean back such that the front of the board lifts up.\nNext, step down on your heel, but ensure that ½ of your foot is stepping on your skateboard. Remain in this position until you come to a stop. You might fall on your back a few times before you master this trick.\nPower slides are fairly advanced. Although it is fun, I cannot recommend you to try it until you become a professional.\nIf the first two tricks fail, simply jump off your skateboard. Ensure that your knees are bent before you jump. The board will stop if you jump forward. One thing though, you might break it; but it is better to buy a new board than visiting a doctor due to a broken bone.\nCarving Your Skateboard\nCarving involves leaning heel-side or toe-side to get your skateboard to turn in the direction you want. Here are some helpful carving tips:Push your skateboard and put sufficient weight on the heels while riding. This will enable you to slowly turn toward that side. You will execute a sharper turn if you push your heels harder. While rolling around, you will be executing this trick a lot.\nI would recommend you to go out to the parking lot and try pushing forward and then carve around stuff. For instance, try pushing toward something that you want to avoid, like a curb, and try to carve away or around it.\nIt will be easier if you lean your upper body to the direction you want to take. Carving on a board is similar to carving on snowboards. If you wish to carve deeper, bend your knees, and crouch low on your skateboard.\nSkating at a Skatepark and Over Flow\nSkateboarding Over Flow\nThe sloping areas or curves of a skatepark are called flows. Skating overflow, down and up slopes and ramps, is very tricky. The trick is to keep your body weight on the front foot when skating down a hill, a big bump. Through a skatepark, or down a driveway, it’s critical you keep your weight on the front foot.\nRemember to relax when performing this trick and make sure that there are no people or cars on the way.\nTransfer Your Weight\nOne trick here: when riding up a slope or ramp, pause, and then roll back down, your front foot will change. That’s simply because your front foot is not always your left or right foot, It is, in fact, the one facing the side you are moving. When riding up a hill or ramp and coming down, you will want to shift your body weight from front to back foot when at the top.\nBend Your Knees\nThe other trick is to bend your knees and loosen them. This will ensure that your body absorbs all the impact and shock of changes and bumps. As a rule of the thumb: the more bent your knees are and relaxed you are, the better you will execute. Also, don’t hunch the shoulder and keep them relaxed and at the back.\nTime to Kickturn\nBalance for a Moment\nKickturning is simply balancing on your back tires for a few seconds and then swinging the front part of your skateboard to another direction. It will take practice and balance to learn this.\nOnce you are comfortable, ensure that you can perform the trick in both directions. Also, try kick turning when on a ramp and when moving. For instance, move up and then kick turn 180 degrees.\nSkate and Create\nThis is an important trick to master. Follow these simple steps:\n- Position your back foot such that the ball of the foot is on the backside of your board. Put your foot between the front and middle trucks on your board. That’s where your feet should be before you do an Ollie.\n- Start to bend your knees and crouch. Simultaneously, snap the back of the board with your back foot and slightly hold back while leading out the nose with your forward foot.\n- Lift your knees toward your chest and then land. Ensure that you land with both legs at once, and as near the trucks as you can.\nThis is a technique in which your skateboard does a 180-degree turn while you remain in the same position, as you watch it rotate. Here are the steps of doing a successful Pop Shuvit:\n- When your legs are in an Ollie position, snap your back foot and have your front foothold back your board. Similar to the Ollie.\n- When your skateboard completes the 180 degrees turn, catch it and step on it.\nThis trick will help you to balance better. You can do this trick with other tricks. Follow these steps:\n- Find a manual pad with a height of a curb or lower.\n- Pick up reasonable speed and perform an Ollie onto the pad, shifting your body weight onto the back of your skateboard while in the air.\n- Land on the back tires, and balance yourself while ensuring that the front tires don’t touch the ground.\n- Continue riding in that position.\n- When done, snap an Ollie from the back. Rollaway.\nThere are other tricks that you can try as you become a professional including Rail Stands, Kickflips, and grinds. Learn them when you are ready and have fun.\nGetting Back Up After Falling When Skateboarding\nSkateboarding is a painful sport for beginners. It is normal to fall and get hurt while riding. You can wear all the right protective gear, but still fall and hurt yourself. Besides, wearing your pads and helmet, there are some stuff you can do to ease your pain.\nDo Not Use Your Arms or Hands\nWhen you are falling, ensure that you don’t use your arms or hands to support yourself. When you lose your skateboard and you are about to hit the surface, you should position your body and shoulder in such a way that they will take all the fall, rolling with the momentum as many times as possible.\nSupporting yourself with your arms or hands is a sure way to twist or break your wrist and although putting on wrist guards might protect you, it is very dangerous as after a while you will be skating without guards (when you become a professional).\nShake It Off\nOne of the best things to do when you fall is to get up, if you aren’t hurt seriously, walk around, and then shake it off. With every fall, your body will learn not to fall.\nYou cannot be hurt too severely when skateboarding, but sometimes you might break your bones – it is common. If you feel or think you have hurt yourself badly or broken a bone, see your doctor immediately.\nEven if you ride your skateboard daily, as a beginner it will take you weeks and even months to get used and feel comfortable with your board. Natural talent and dedication will keep you learning and graduate from one speed to the other or one trick to the other, and become a professional skater.\nBegin slowly, avoid the complicated tricks, master your board, and you will be teaching others on how to ride a skateboard. I wish you all the best as you put your forward foot forward."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:4d24c51d-6978-45e2-b9f7-d2e30f34528f>","<urn:uuid:cc9d4f7d-83e2-4982-94cd-30e02ae90ff6>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What is difference between Korean reunification cost estimates and German reunification economic impact?","answer":"The cost estimates for Korean reunification and German reunification's economic impact show stark differences. For Korea, estimates range from $200 billion (optimistic view) to $1.5 trillion (pessimistic view) to narrow the income gap between North and South Korea. The per capita GDP gap between the Koreas is the world's largest between neighboring countries, with South Korea's being 14-30 times higher than North Korea's. In contrast, Germany's reunification challenges were less severe, as the income gap between East and West Germany was only between 1:2 and 1:3. However, even with this smaller gap, German reunification still faced significant economic difficulties, including the collapse of East German firms, massive unemployment in the east, and heavy dependence on federal subsidies. The eastern German economy was in worse condition than anyone had realized, requiring extensive infrastructure investment and continued economic support more than a decade after reunification.","context":["Last week, South Korean media reported that South Korean government agencies had finished the compilation of a contingency plan of economic reforms to be implemented in case of Korea’s German-style unification. The plan dwells on how the South Korean government should handle such a scenario and what should be done to transform the North Korean economy.\nThe South Korean military is known to do regular rounds of contingency planning for a possible regime collapse in the North. However, such plans usually focus upon the immediate response of the military. The new plan is seemingly different because it considers what should be done in the longer-term.\nOn paper, both Koreas are firmly committed to the principle of national unification. Of course, during official contacts between the two governments, both sides regularly pay lip service to the idea that their eventual unification should be peaceful, gradual and agreed upon by the two current governments, currently co-existing on the Korean peninsula. Some in South Korea sincerely believe that such pronouncements bear some relation to reality. But in real life, a gradual unification is highly unlikely, if not outright impossible.\nNow, when the world celebrates the 25th anniversary of German unification, it is a good time to be reminded: If the two Koreas are to be re-united in the foreseeable future, the German scenario is highly likely to be repeated on the Korean peninsula.\nOfficially, Koreans on both sides of the border are supposed to believe that unification, in whatever form it eventually comes, would be a great triumph for their long-suffering nation – recently, the ROK president even said that unification would be a “bonanza” for her country. However, with the passage of time, it becomes increasingly clear that the younger generation of South Koreans have different opinions about unification. Put simply, younger Koreans do not see Northerners as their brethren, and are not willing to make sacrifices for the impoverished North. At the same time, there is a belief, especially among the younger generation, that the immediate economic impact of unification is likely to be disastrous for the taxpayers of the rich South.\n|Inside Story – The two Koreas: from kind words to shots fired|\nThere are significant reasons that should have the South Korean public worried. In the past decade or so, there have been over a dozen attempts to estimate how much unification is going to cost South Korea.\nGiven the near complete absence of reliable statistics regarding the state of the North Korean economy, and the near unprecedented nature of the task, one shouldn’t be surprised that estimates vary considerably.\nBe that as it may, most of the estimates cluster around two points: optimists believe that unification is likely to cost about $200 billion, while pessimists believe that the figure is liable to be in the neighbourhood of $1.5 trillion. Both camps believe that their respective figures represent the amount of money required to narrow the income gap between the two Koreas.\nCurrently, the entire GDP of South Korea is roughly $1.2 trillion, so even at the low end we are talking about a massive burden. If pessimists are correct, the burden could be truly crushing, capable of wiping out the South Korean economy.\nOnce upon a time, North Korea was well ahead of the South in its per capita income (largely, but not exclusively, because it inherited pretty much all the industry the Japanese companies built in Korea during the colonial industrialisation boom of the 1930s and 1940s). These years are long gone, though.\nAfter 1960, it would be a minor exaggeration to say that Korean economic history can be presented as the near perfect success of the South and near perfect failure of the North. The results are clear for all to see. Exact estimates remain impossible because the North Korean government ceased to release all economic statistics in the early 1960s, but the per capita GDP in the South has been estimated to be between 14 and 30 times higher than the North. Even if we take the most conservative estimate, this still means that the per capita income gap between the two Koreas is the world’s largest gap between two countries that share a land border.\nNorth Korean refugees … have great difficulties in finding work and basically find themselves ill-adapted to life in a modern, technologically advanced, hyper-dynamic and highly competitive society.\nWhen it comes to social and cultural issues, the gap is equally great. For security reasons, the North Korean government has always been very careful in controlling interaction between its citizens and the outside world. As a result, the average North Korean has very little understanding about the ways a modern society operates.\nIt is not incidental that North Korean refugees in the South do not normally fare well: their average income is roughly half the nationwide average, they have great difficulties in finding work and basically find themselves ill-adapted to life in a modern, technologically advanced, hyper-dynamic and highly competitive society. Given that defectors usually come from more socially active groups of the population, this bodes ill for the future of a unified Korea.\nNo wonder that the above mentioned report assume that the unemployment rate in the post-unification North might reach the totally unprecedented 30 percent level. Indeed, one can only wonder what would happen to North Korean engineers who might have good training in calculus, but have never used computers.\nSimilarly, North Korean medical doctors who are well educated in treatments and drugs that would be seen as out of date in the 1960s are likely to be lost. Manual workers, trained in the 1930s technology, would also be of little use in the high-tech economy of the South. And what of the North Korean Army, one of the largest standing military forces in the world, that currently has over one million soldiers?\nExposure to capitalism\nShould German-style unification occur on the Korean peninsula, North Koreans would immediately find themselves exposed to the ways of modern capitalism, of which they currently have very vague ideas. One can easily imagine how South Korean speculators would descend on the North and buy all valuable property they can find (they will be able to afford it with their far higher incomes). And the scions of former North Korean landlords, whose lands were confiscated during the 1946 land reform, are also likely to reappear and make their claims on what used to be their great-grandfathers’ lands.\nThis does not mean that unification will ruin the North Koreans. Most likely, in absolute terms it will bring fast and dramatic improvements to their living standards, albeit accompanied by great social confusion and, perhaps, sense of alienation. For the Southerners, things are different. In the long run, the unification will indeed make Korea a safer and better place, but its immediate impact will be a crushing blow to the South Korean taxpayers – and they are increasingly aware of this.\nAll of this is understandable, but it does not negate one fact: unification can happen regardless of what people want and what they fear. History seldom cares about us, humble humans, and as the experience of countless crises and revolutions has shown, the situation can easily get out of control.\nAfter all, the existence of the rich South is a great destabilising factor in itself. East Germans challenged their state once it became clear that Soviet tanks would not come to crush their rebellion. They wanted western freedom and, even more, they wanted western prosperity. But we should not forget that the income gap between the two Germanys was between 1:2 and 1:3, an almost unnoticeable gap by current Korean standards. So, if things start crumbling in the North, South Koreans will have little to do but to accept fate and embrace unification.\nWhen seen in such a light, it is indeed good news that the South Korean government is planning for such a contingency.\nAndrei Lankov is professor of Korean Studies at Kookmin University, Seoul. He is the author of “The Real North Korea: Life and Politics in the Failed Stalinist Utopia”.","The reunification of Germany\nThe swift and unexpected downfall of the German Democratic Republic was triggered by the decay of the other communist regimes in eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. The liberalizing reforms of President Mikhail Gorbachev in the Soviet Union appalled the Honecker regime, which in desperation was by 1988 forbidding the circulation within East Germany of Soviet publications that it viewed as dangerously subversive. The Berlin Wall was in effect breached in the summer of 1989 when a reformist Hungarian government began allowing East Germans to escape to the West through Hungary’s newly opened border with Austria. By the fall, thousands of East Germans had followed this route, while thousands of others sought asylum in the West German embassies in Prague and Warsaw, demanding that they be allowed to emigrate to West Germany. At the end of September, Genscher, still West Germany’s foreign minister, arranged for their passage to West Germany, but another wave of refugees from East Germany soon took their place. Mass demonstrations in the streets of Leipzig and other East German cities defied the authorities and demanded reforms.\nIn an effort to halt the deterioration of its position, the SED Politburo deposed Honecker in mid-October and replaced him with another hard-line communist, Egon Krenz. Under Krenz the Politburo sought to eliminate the embarrassment occasioned by the flow of refugees to the West through Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Poland. On the evening of November 9, Günter Schabowski, a communist functionary, mistakenly announced at a televised news conference that the government would allow East Germans unlimited passage to West Germany, effective “immediately.” While the government had in fact meant to require East Germans to apply for exit visas during normal working hours, this was widely interpreted as a decision to open the Berlin Wall that evening, so crowds gathered and demanded to pass into West Berlin. Unprepared, the border guards let them go. In a night of revelry tens of thousands of East Germans poured through the crossing points in the wall and celebrated their new freedom with rejoicing West Berliners.\nThe opening of the Berlin Wall proved fatal for the German Democratic Republic. Ever-larger demonstrations demanded a voice in government for the people, and in mid-November Krenz was replaced by a reform-minded communist, Hans Modrow, who promised free, multiparty elections. When the balloting took place in March 1990 the SED, now renamed the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS), suffered a crushing defeat. The eastern counterpart of Kohl’s CDU, which had pledged a speedy reunification of Germany, emerged as the largest political party in East Germany’s first democratically elected People’s Chamber. A new East German government headed by Lothar de Maizière, a long-time member of the eastern Christian Democratic Union, and backed initially by a broad coalition, including the eastern counterparts of the Social Democrats and Free Democrats, began negotiations for a treaty of unification. A surging tide of refugees from East to West Germany that threatened to cripple East Germany added urgency to those negotiations. In July that tide was somewhat stemmed by a monetary union of the two Germanys that gave East Germans the hard currency of the Federal Republic.\nThe final barrier to reunification fell in July 1990 when Kohl prevailed upon Gorbachev to drop his objections to a unified Germany within the NATO alliance in return for sizable (West) German financial aid to the Soviet Union. A unification treaty was ratified by the Bundestag and the People’s Chamber in September and went into effect on October 3, 1990. The German Democratic Republic joined the Federal Republic as five additional Länder, and the two parts of divided Berlin became one Land. (The five new Länder were Brandenburg, Mecklenburg–West Pomerania, Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, and Thuringia.)\nTest Your Knowledge\nLet’s Move: Fact or Fiction?\nIn December 1990 the first all-German free election since the Nazi period conferred an expanded majority on Kohl’s coalition. After 45 years of division, Germany was once again united, and the following year Kohl helped negotiate the Treaty on European Union, which established the European Union (EU) and paved the way for the introduction of the euro, the EU’s single currency, by the end of the decade.\nThe achievement of national unification was soon shadowed by a series of difficulties, some due to structural problems in the European economy, others to the costs and consequences of unification itself. Like most of the rest of Europe, Germany in the 1990s confronted increased global competition, the increasing costs of its elaborate social welfare system, and stubborn unemployment, especially in its traditional industrial sector. However, it also faced the staggering added expenses of unifying the east and west. These expenses were all the more unsettling because they were apparently unexpected. Kohl and his advisers had done little to prepare German taxpayers for the costs of unification, in part because they feared the potential political consequences but also because they were themselves surprised by the magnitude of the task. The core of the problem was the state of the eastern German economy, which was far worse than anyone had realized or admitted. Only a handful of eastern firms could compete on the world market; most were woefully inefficient and also environmentally destructive. As a consequence, the former East German economy collapsed, hundreds of thousands of easterners faced unemployment, and the east became heavily dependent on federal subsidies. At the same time, the infrastructure—roads, rail lines, telephones, and the like—required massive capital investment in order to provide the basis for future economic growth. In short, the promise of immediate prosperity and economic equality, on which the swift and relatively painless process of unification had rested, turned out to be impossible to fulfill. Unemployment, social dislocation, and disappointment continued to haunt the new Länder more than a decade after the fall of the Berlin Wall.\nThe lingering economic gap between the east and west was just one of several difficulties attending unification. Not surprisingly, many easterners resented what they took to be western arrogance and insensitivity. The terms Wessi (“westerner”) and Ossi (“easterner”) came to imply different approaches to the world: the former competitive and aggressive, the product of what Germans call the West’s “elbow society”; the latter passive and indolent, the product of the stifling security of the communist regime. The PDS became the political voice of eastern discontents, with strong if localized support in some of the new Länder. Moreover, the neofascist German People’s Union (Deutsche Volksunion), led by millionaire publisher Gerhard Frey, garnered significant support among eastern Germany’s mass of unemployed workers. In addition to the resentment and disillusionment over unification that many easterners and some westerners felt, there was also the problem of coming to terms with the legacies left by 40 years of dictatorship. East Germany had developed a large and effective security apparatus (the Stasi), which employed a wide network of professional and amateur informants. As the files of this organization began to be made public, eastern Germans discovered that many of their most prominent citizens, as well as some of their friends, neighbours, and even family members, had been on the Stasi payroll. Coming to terms with these revelations—legally, politically, and personally—added to the tension of the postunification decade.\nDespite the problems attending unification, as well as a series of scandals in his own party, Kohl won a narrow victory in 1994. In 1996 he surpassed Adenauer’s record as the longest-serving German chancellor since Bismarck. Nevertheless, his popularity was clearly ebbing. Increasingly intolerant of criticism within his own party, Kohl suffered a humiliating defeat when his first choice for the presidency was rejected. Instead, Roman Herzog, the president of the Federal Constitutional Court, was elected in May 1994 and fulfilled his duties effectively and gracefully. As Germany prepared for the 1998 elections, its economy was faltering—unemployment surpassed 10 percent and was double that in much of eastern Germany—and some members of Kohl’s party openly hoped that he would step aside in favour of a new candidate; instead the chancellor ran again and his coalition was defeated, ending his 16-year chancellorship. Kohl was replaced as chancellor by Gerhard Schröder, the pragmatic and photogenic leader of the SPD, which formed a coalition with the Green Party.\nSchröder’s government got off to a rocky start, the victim of the chancellor’s own indecisiveness and internal dissent from his party’s left wing. The coalition also suffered from internal dissension within Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer’s Green Party, which was divided between pragmatists such as Fischer and those who regarded any compromise as a betrayal of the party’s principles. In 1999 the government’s problems were swiftly overshadowed by a series of revelations about illegal campaign contributions to the CDU, which forced Kohl and his successor, Wolfgang Schäuble, to resign their leadership posts. In April 2000 the CDU selected as party leader Angela Merkel, who became the first former East German and first woman to lead a major political party in Germany.\nSchröder’s government focused much of its efforts on reforming the German social welfare system and economy. In particular, the government wanted to reduce the costs of the generous but bloated welfare system; as the population was aging, the number of beneficiaries was increasing at a rate exceeding the number of contributors, threatening the solvency of the system. Moreover, the government attempted to relieve the burden on businesses of the country’s high taxes and labour costs, which had driven away foreign investment and encouraged German firms to close German plants and move them overseas. The government also aimed to eliminate the country’s reliance on nuclear power, agreeing to phase out its use by about 2022. In 2010 the government extended that deadline into the 2030s.\nWhen the 2002 election campaign began, the government’s efforts to improve the economy had not succeeded. Economic growth remained sluggish, and unemployment (particularly in eastern Germany) remained high. Faced with a vigorous challenge from Edmund Stoiber, the head of Bavaria’s government, Schröder based much of his campaign on opposition to U.S. policy regarding the Iraqi regime of Ṣaddām Ḥussein—a view that was widely shared throughout Germany. As a result, Schröder and the Greens were able to win a narrow victory in September 2002. The new government attempted to build a consensus for economic reforms, which would require sacrifices from trade unions and other important parts of the Social Democrats’ constituency. At the same time, Schröder sought to repair the damaged relationship with the United States, though he opposed U.S.-led military action against Iraq in 2003. As the country’s economy continued to worsen, early elections were held in 2005. The CDU and CSU won a narrow victory, and a coalition government was formed with Merkel as chancellor; she became the first woman to hold that office.\nAt the start of the new millennium, Germany remained a leader in Europe and was the key to the continent’s security, stability, and prosperity. For more than 50 years, from Adenauer to Kohl, Schröder, and Merkel, Germans had played an important role in the creation of European institutions. Germany remains essential to the success of both the EU’s ambitious program of economic and political integration and its efforts to expand to include members from the former Soviet bloc. Germany will also be an important part of European efforts to craft a new security strategy, based on an enlarged NATO and a revised relationship with the United States.\nIn Germany’s parliamentary elections on September 27, 2009, Merkel’s mandate as chancellor was renewed, this time with the CDU-CSU and the FDP winning enough seats to form a coalition. The SPD, which since 2005 had served as the junior partner in a grand coalition with the CDU-CSU, thus was forced into opposition. Germany comfortably weathered the debt crisis that shook the rest of the euro zone, and Merkel and French Pres. Nicolas Sarkozy brokered a series of deals that were intended to contain the damage to the single currency.\nWhile Merkel’s international presence was on the rise, she suffered domestically. The resignations of Pres. Horst Köhler in 2010, Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg in 2011, and Pres. Christian Wulff in 2012 were all blows to Merkel’s prestige. After Japan’s Fukushima nuclear accident in March 2011, Merkel pledged to phase out nuclear power in Germany by 2022, but this move came too late to boost the CDU’s performance in state elections later that month. In contrast, the Green Party, which had long opposed nuclear power, captured enough support to form a government in Baden-Württemberg, a CDU stronghold since 1953. Joachim Gauck was elected president of Germany in March 2012, becoming the third person to hold that office in as many years. Unaffiliated with any political party, Gauck was a popular choice for the largely ceremonial role because of his history as a pro-democracy dissident in East Germany and his supervision of the Stasi archives after the fall of the Berlin Wall. For the first time since Germany’s reunification, the posts of both chancellor and president were held by individuals from the former East Germany.\nAs the campaign for the 2013 federal election began to intensify, the CDU coalition continued to suffer setbacks at the state level. Elections in Lower Saxony in January 2013 shifted the balance of power in the Bundesrat, giving the Greens and the SPD a majority in the upper house of Germany’s legislature. Peer Steinbrück, the SPD candidate for chancellor, had served as finance minister under Merkel in the grand coalition government from 2005 to 2009. While his performance in that role was widely praised, its connection with the Merkel administration made it difficult for Steinbrück to set himself apart from the incumbent. The sole televised debate between the candidates was inconclusive, and Merkel’s personal popularity was bolstered by strong economic numbers, which included an unemployment rate that was the lowest since reunification.\nHer handling of the economy and her approach to the euro-zone debt crisis appeared to receive a huge endorsement from the German electorate when the CDU and CSU captured nearly 42 percent of the vote in the September 22, 2013, election, winning almost an absolute majority of the seats and setting up Merkel to become the third chancellor in the post-World War II era to win three elections. Because her government’s junior partner, the FDP, failed to reach the 5 percent threshold for representation for the first time in the postwar period, Merkel faced the possibility of forming another grand coalition with the SPD (which finished second with about 26 percent of the vote) or bringing the Green Party (which finished just behind The Left Party with about 8 percent) into government, though neither party was likely to come without a great deal of bargaining. After two months of negotiations, a grand coalition between the CDU-CSU and SPD was proposed, but it hinged on the approval of SPD members in an unprecedented party ballot. In December 2013 more than three-fourths of SPD voters voiced their support for the coalition. Among the stated priorities for the new government were the continued transitioning of Germany’s energy system to renewable sources and the adoption of the country’s first minimum wage law."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:b7b50d2f-d0f8-48d7-bdb4-15a924fe2d9b>","<urn:uuid:34071a96-26d9-4510-be57-e8049c242398>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What is the relationship between credit expansion and economic growth in major economies since the 1980s?","answer":"Data shows that increases in credit supply have generally been accompanied by increases in nominal output and wealth. In the US, credit expansion was weakly correlated with nominal output but strongly related to wealth growth. The Euro area showed close alignment between bank loans and output growth until the early 1990s, after which credit growth increased while output remained stable. In Japan, domestic credit expansion was strongly correlated with nominal output changes.","context":["Freedom and Sound Money\n\"It is impossible to grasp the meaning of the idea of sound money if one does not realize that it was devised as an instrument for the protection of civil liberties against despotic inroads on the part of governments. Ideologically it belongs in the same class with political constitutions and bills of right.\"\nSo wrote Ludwig von Mises in The Theory of Money and Credit in 1912. And further: \"(...) the sound-money principle has two aspects. It is affirmative in approving the market's choice of a commonly used medium of exchange. It is negative in obstructing the government's propensity to meddle with the currency system.\" Against this backdrop, modern day's monetary systems appear to have been drifting farther and farther away from the sound money principle in the last decades.\nIn all countries of the so-called \"free world,\" money represents nowadays a government controlled irredeemable paper, or \"fiat,\" money standard. The widely held view is that this money system would be compatible with the ideal of a free society and conducive to sustainable output and employment growth. To be sure, there are voices calling for caution. Taking a historical viewpoint, Milton Friedman stated: \"(...) the world is now engaged in a great experiment to see whether it can fashion a different anchor, one that depends on government restraint rather than on the costs of acquiring a physical commodity.\" Irving Fisher, evaluating past experience, wrote: \"Irredeemable paper money has almost invariably proved a curse to the country employing it.\"\nThe primary cause for concern rests on a key characteristic of government controlled paper money: the system's unrestrained ability to expand money and credit supply. In contrast, under the (freely chosen) gold standard, money (e.g. gold) supply was expected to increase as well over time, but only in proportion to how the economy expanded — i.e. an increase in money demand, brought about by an increase in economic activity, would bring additional gold supply to the market (by, for instance, increased mining which would become increasingly profitable). As such, the gold standard puts an \"automatic break\" on money expansion — the latter would be, at least in theory, related to the economy's growth trend.\nThe government controlled fiat money system has no inherent limit to money and credit expansion. In fact, quite the opposite holds true: Central banks, the monopolistic suppliers of governments' money, have actually been deliberately designed to be able to change money and credit supply by actually any amount at any time.\nTo prevent abuse of their unlimited power over the quantity of money supply, most central banks have been granted political independence over the past decades. This has been done in order to keep politicians who, in order to get re-elected, from trading off the benefits of a monetary policy induced stimulus to the economy against future costs in the form of inflation. In addition, many central banks have been mandated to seek low and stable inflation — measured by consumer price indices — as their primary objective. These two institutional factors — political independency and the mandate to preserve the purchasing power of money — are now widely seen as proper guarantees for preserving sound money.\nBe that as it may, Mises's concerns appear as relevant as ever: \"The dissociation of the currencies from a definitive and unchangeable gold parity has made the value of money a plaything of politics. (...) We are not very far now from a state of affairs in which \"economic policy\" is primarily understood to mean the question of influencing the purchasing power of money.\" \nWhereas the objective to preserve the value of government controlled paper money appears to be a laudable one, the truth is that it is (virtually) impossible to deliver on such a promise. In fact, there are often overwhelming political-economic incentives for a society to increase its money and credit supply, if possible, in order to influence societal developments according to ideological pre-set designs rather than relying on free market principles.\nThis very tendency is particularly evidenced by the fact that central banks are regularly called upon to take into account output growth and the economy's job situation when setting interest rates. And these considerations are what seem to cause severe problems in a paper money system if and when there is no clear-cut limit to money and credit expansion.\nTo bring home this point, it is instructive to take a brief look at the relationship between credit and nominal output and \"wealth\" growth (which is defined here, for simplicity, as gross domestic product plus stock market capitalisation) in the US, the euro area and Japan since the early 1980s. A visual inspection reveals that in the US, the relationship between domestic credit and nominal output growth is relatively weak. If, however, credit expansion is plotted against wealth growth, we see that these two variables are actually quite closely related.\nIn the euro area, bank loan and output growth were relatively closely aligned up until the early 1990s. In the period 1995 to late 2000, though, credit and output growth seemed to have decoupled quite markedly: Whereas loan growth went up strongly, nominal output growth remained fairly stabilized. If, however, bank loan growth is plotted against wealth expansion, the correlation seems to be more evident, especially during the second half of the 1990s.\nIn Japan, domestic credit expansion appears to be strongly correlated to changes in nominal output. The relationship between changes in credit and changes in wealth, however, appears much less pronounced (especially when compared to the constellation in the US). All the same, it appears that the decline in domestic credit around the end of the 1980s has been accompanied by a (trend) decline in nominal wealth growth.\nLooking at the data, the overriding message seems to be: an increase in credit supply has, on average, been accompanied by an increase in nominal output and/or wealth and vice versa. It is tempting to draw a simple conclusion from these findings, indeed: changes in monetary policy do not appear to be \"neutral\" when it comes to exerting an effect on peoples' dispositions; in fact, monetary policy induced increases in money and credit supply might be sooner or later accompanied by changes in economic activity.\nBut a money and credit supply induced stimulus to the economy is short-lived, insights from the classical economic theory warn, and will eventually lead to inflation — as outlined by David Hume in 1742: \"augmentation (in the quantity of money) has no other effect than to heighten the price of labour and commodities. (...) in the progress towards these changes, the augmentation may have some influence, by exciting industry, but after the prices are settled (...) it has no manner of influence.\"\nHowever, the intellectual conviction of the economic mainstream, which is dominated by Keynesian Economics, is that by lowering interest rates the central bank can stimulate growth and employment. So it does not take wonder that, especially so in periods in which inflation is seen to be \"under control,\" central banks are pressured into an \"expansionary\" monetary policy to fight recession. In fact, it is widely considered \"appropriate\" if monetary policy keeps borrowing costs at the lowest level possible.\nIn the work of Mises one finds a well-founded criticism of this broadly held conviction. He writes: \"(...) public opinion is prone to see in interest nothing but a merely institutional obstacle to the expansion of production. It does not realize that the discount of future goods as against present goods is a necessary and eternal category of human action and cannot be abolished by bank manipulation. In the eyes of cranks and demagogues, interest is a product of the sinister machinations of rugged exploiters. The age-old disapprobation of interest has been fully revived by modern interventionism. It clings to the dogma that it is one of the foremost duties of good government to lower the rate of interest as far as possible or to abolish it altogether. All present-day governments are fanatically committed to an easy money policy.\"\nMises also outlines what the propensity to lower interest rates and increasing money and credit supply does to the economy. The Austrian School of Economics' \"Monetary Theory of the Trade Cycle\" maintains that it is monetary expansion which is at the heart of the economies' boom and bust cycles. Overly generous supply of money and credit induces what is usually called an \"economic upswing\". It is wake, economic growth increases and employment rises.\nWith the liquidity flush, however, come misalignments, a distortion of relative prices, so the theoretical reasoning is. Sooner or later, the artificial money and credit supply-fuelled expansion is unsustainable and turns into a recession. In ignorance and/or in failing to identify the very forces responsible for the economic malaise, namely excessive money and credit creation in the past, falling output and rising unemployment provoke public calls for an even easier monetary policy.\nCentral banks are not in a position to withstand such demands if they do not have any \"anchoring\" — that is a (fixed) rule which restrains the increase in money and credit supply in day-to-day operations. In the absence of such a limit, central banks, confronted with a severe economic crisis, are most likely to be forced to trade off the growth and employment objective against the preserving the value of money — thereby compromising a crucial pillar of the free society.\nSeen against this backdrop, today's monetary policy actually resembles a \"ruleless\" undertaking. The Zeitgeist holds that \"inflation targeting\" (IT) — the so-called \"state-of-the-art\" concept from the point of view of most central banks — will do the trick to prevent monetary policy from causing unintended trouble. In practice, however, IT does not have any external anchor. Under IT, it is the central bank itself that calculates inflation forecasts which, in turn, determine how the bank set interest rates; setting a quantitative limit to money and credit expansion is usually not seen as a policy objective. IT can thus hardly inspire confidence that it will mitigate the threat to the value of paper money stemming from governments (in the form of fraud/misuse) and/or politically independent monetary policy makers (in the form of policy mistakes).\nThe return to \"monetary policy without rule\" began in the early 1990s, when various central banks abandoned monetary aggregates as a major guide post for setting interest rates. It was argued that \"demand for money\" had become an unstable indicator in the \"short term\" and that, as such, money could no longer be used as a yardstick in setting monetary policy, particularly so as policy makers were making interest rate decisions every few weeks. However, that guide post has not been replaced with anything since then.\nIn view of the return of discretion in monetary policy, it might be insightful to quote Hayek's concern, namely that: \"(...) [inflation] is the inevitable result of a policy which regards all the other decisions as data to which the supply of money must be adapted so that the damage done by other measures will be as little noticed as possible.\" In the long run, such a policy would cause central banks to become \"the captives of their own decisions, when others force them to adopt measures that they know to be harmful.\"\n|The ultimate money book: $17|\nEchoing the warning that Ludwig von Mises gave back in The Theory of Money and Credit, Hayek concluded: \"The inflationary bias of our day is largely the result of the prevalence of the short-term view, which in turns stems from the great difficulty of recognising the more remote consequences of current measures, and from the inevitable preoccupation of practical men, and particularly politicians, with the immediate problems and the achievements of near goals.\" \nWhat can we learn from all this? The inherent risks of today's paper money standard — the very ability of expanding the stock of money and credit at will by actually any amount at any time — are no longer paid proper attention: Putting a limit on the expansion of money and credit does not rank among the essential ingredients for \"modern\" monetary policy making. The discretionary handling of paper money thus increases the potential for a costly failure substantially. A first step for moving back towards the sound money principle — which is doing justice to the ideal of a free society — would be to make monetary policy limiting, eg, stopping altogether, money supply growth.\n Mises, L. von (1912), The Theory of Money and Credit, p. 454.\n Ibid, p. 455.\n Friedman, M. (1994), Money Mischief, San Diego et al., p. 42.\n Fisher, I.

{"question":"I'm researching art institutions with pottery connections! Can anyone tell me about the contrasting ways The Potter's Wheel in Wisconsin and the New Orleans Museum of Art have preserved and showcased ceramic arts through their history?","answer":"The Potter's Wheel and the New Orleans Museum of Art (NOMA) have preserved ceramic arts in distinct ways. The Potter's Wheel, established by Abe Cohn in Milwaukee in 1953 and later expanded to Fish Creek, served as an active studio and teaching space that helped establish Door County as a pottery destination. After a fire in 1975, it relocated to share space with the Milwaukee School of Art and Design, continuing its mission of pottery education and production. NOMA, founded in 1910, takes a different approach as a major museum housing over 40,000 artworks. It has specifically preserved ceramic history through exhibitions like Katherine Choy's show in the 1950s and the recent 'Katherine Choy: Radical Potter in 1950s New Orleans' exhibition, which brought together 25 pots from various collections to celebrate her contributions to modern pottery. While The Potter's Wheel focused on creating and teaching pottery, NOMA has worked to preserve and showcase ceramic arts through formal exhibitions and permanent collections.","context":["Paying tribute to a man who taught, encouraged and flamed the creative spark of countless individuals was what blues musician and clay enthusiast Steve Cohen had in mind when he shared his idea for an online exhibit about renowned Wisconsin potter, Abe Cohn. With Steve’s collection of Abe Cohn’s work and recollections of the iconic pottery mentor as a jumping-off point, other of Abe’s friends and family members shared their memories and photographs of his work.\nAfter serving in WWII, Abe, a visionary and pioneer, opened his first studio in Milwaukee in 1953, The Potter’s Wheel, and married his wife Ginka in 1954. In the summer of 1956, they established the first pottery studio in Fish Creek, laying the foundation for Door County to become a renowned destination for potters and pottery fans alike. Following a fire in 1975, the Milwaukee branch of The Potter’s Wheel found a new home in an old warehouse shared by the Milwaukee School of Art and Design. After years of maintaining both locations, founding the seminal Door County Potter’s Guild in 1976, and spending solely summers in Fish Creek, Abe and Ginka moved there in 1994, making the Door Peninsula their permanent home.\nAlong the way, he received several awards including the Louis Comfort Tiffany Award (1958) and a Smithsonian Institute Purchase Award for its 7th Annual Exhibition of Ceramic Art (1961). In 1964, Abe was granted the first one-man show by a craftsman at the new Memorial Art Center in Milwaukee – the precursor to the Milwaukee Art Museum, which has several pieces of Abe’s in its permanent collection. In 2010, Abe received the Wisconsin Visual Arts Lifetime Achievement Award.\nFollowing a lifetime of prolific creative productivity and inspired guidance, Abe died in May 2013, leaving a legacy to students, collectors and other artists. A number of those people provided information and materials to make this online exhibit possible. I would like to thank Steve Cohen (Milwaukee), Robin Cohn, Tamar Cohn, Jon Cohn, Steve Cohen (California), Dick Woppert and Greg Miller for their contributions.\nCurator, Jewish Museum Milwaukee\nMY TIME WITH ABE COHN\nBy Steve Cohen\nI was among the many potters who passed through the doors of Abe’s two studios. I was 24 years old and had briefly operated my own pottery studio a few blocks away from The Potter’s Wheel. My studio was also destroyed by fire shortly before the fire at The Potter’s Wheel. I had been buying some supplies from The Potter’s Wheel during this period, and though this had been the extent of my association with Abe at the time, I was one of many who helped him relocate. It was the beginning of what became an important period in my life.\nWhen his new studio was set up, I became an apprentice to Abe. One of the other potters working in the studio at the time was Greg Miller. Through Greg and Abe, as well as another associate potter, Dick Woppert, I absorbed great information about potting, glazing, kilns, firing, aesthetics and expression, and in exchange, I helped sell supplies, taught some classes and helped with the day-to-day upkeep of the studio. Greg, Dick and I remain friends to this day.\nSnapshot of potters at The Potter’s Wheel, in Milwaukee, 1978.\n(Left to right)\nSteve Cohen, Ivy Balian, Joan Backes-Sills, Ginka Cohn, Abe Cohn, Greg Miller, Dick Woppert. Image courtesy of Steve Cohen.\nSteve Cohen at the Wheel\nAbe was a quiet person, but he chose his words carefully and offered his critical opinion only when he felt it was absolutely necessary. He had a wry and understated sense of humor, and I never saw him lose his temper. He worked slowly, meticulously, and pragmatically. What he chose to contribute to my education was always carefully considered, and his example as a potter and as a person helped me become the person and the potter that I am today.\nMy time as one of Abe’s apprentices concluded when I and my future wife, Karen, traveled for a year. When we returned, I opted to have a career as a musician. Though my time as one of Abe’s apprentices lasted only about 18 months, the lessons I learned stuck with me, and I have returned to making ceramic art at the age of 65, still much influenced by my time at Abe’s studios.\nThrough the last 10 years, I have accumulated a couple dozen of Abe’s pots, mostly at estate sales and Goodwill stores. Abe’s pots are among the very few things that I collect, and they are important to me. This presentation of my small collection has been a pleasure to assemble. Thinking about Abe and looking at the pots that he made takes me back to a happy and developmental time in my life. I think of this project as an opportunity to look back fondly at my time with Abe.\nABE COHN: EARLY CAREER, FRIENDS, FAMILY\nAbe Cohn grew up in Waukesha, the youngest of six brothers. He joined the army at a young age, studied painting in Paris and at UW-Madison, where he discovered his love of clay. This led to studios and galleries in Milwaukee and Door County, a marriage to his wife Ginka and a rewarding life filled with teaching, children, grandchildren and many friends.\nABE COHN: PROLIFIC POTTER\nDuring his decades-long career, Abe created a prolific body of work. Public and private collections throughout Wisconsin and the country include his creations. His children have diverse collections of their father’s work, proudly displaying many pieces in their homes.\nTHE POTTER’S WHEEL\nAbe and Ginka learned of the beauty of Fish Creek, Door County in the early 1950s and after visiting, became smitten. The Milwaukee Potter’s Wheel gallery gained a second location following their establishment of the first pottery studio there in 1953. The venue would soon become an iconic destination for potters seeking guidance and for pottery enthusiasts.\nWe know that there are many Abe Cohn pieces, experiences, and stories in the greater Wisconsin community and beyond, and we want to collect those experiences! Share your story and any Abe Cohn pottery you have collected throughout the years with us via Facebook, Twitter, Instagram or by emailing us at [email protected]. Use the hashtag #FiredUpWithJMM so we can find your story on social media and share it with our visitors. Select stories are shared below.\nCarol Vihon Hirsch (Evanston, IL)\nRoger and I enjoy Door County with its charming little stores, beautiful nature to drive through, the same Inn we like as well as the art galleries. Quite a while ago we found this piece of pottery at The Potter’s Wheel. Then we found out Abe was Jewish. I did think I saw the spirit of Judaism in this piece of pottery. After I found out our favorite Jewish Museum Milwaukee was having a showing of his work I was going through old business cards while being kept inside due to COVID-19. Lo and behold, there was a card from The Potter’s Wheel among those old business cards. I could not believe it.\nI worked with Abe starting in 1968 after graduating from UNI, Cedar Falls, Iowa. When I was drafted into the Army, I served in RVN and returned home in June 1970. I worked at The Potter’s Wheel until May 1972, when we moved to Missouri until I retired in 2018. Whenever I think of making pots, I think of Abe and how stoic he could be. We had many conversations about the smallest details of throwing, glazing, firing and selling the work. I only hope I had the same effects on young potters I met along the way. So when it was time to leave, he gave me this pitcher which I’ve used daily for over 40 years as our water pitcher\nKathy and Tacitus Bond\nFor one summer in 1999, Road Scholar (then called Elderhostel) conducted 6 week-long programs in Door County, for which I was the facilitator. These life long learning programs featured local artists, educators, musicians and even a taxidermist. Abe and Ginka were two of our experts, kindly offering tours of Abe’s studio to our 48 participants per week. Abe, in his quiet way, welcomed these oversized groups into his studio so they might watch him at his wheel. I sometimes think that this was the highlight of the week, a week that featured up to three events per day. In addition, Ginka gave a dance/exercise class on the last morning of the week that translated to a wonderful farewell memory. These two were an amazing couple! We did manage to purchase our pot from Abe during one of these week-long programs, a pot we have treasured since.\nRachel Baron Heimovics (Maitland, FL)\nI have one piece by Abe Cohn – a casserole that I have never used other than to display. We visited Door County and the Potters Wheel in Fish Creek most likely in the mid-1970s – with my husband and three children in tow. We made a point of visiting the studio because my mother (Bernice Baron) urged us to do so. She was a friend of Ginka’s, especially admired her dancing, and spoke highly about Abe. When we went to the studio, I felt that it was important that I leave with something of Abe’s. These pictures show my selection and I have treasured it ever since.\nMy mother-in-law, Jean Frackman, was a student of Abe’s and her pottery and glazes are so incredibly reflective of the pieces in the exhibit on your web site. Jean took classes from Abe in downtown Milwaukee. When my wife, Kippy, and I traveled up to Door County each summer for a few days and stopped at the studio, Abe always had wonderful things to say and memories of Jean as his student. He was such a nice man and a mentor to so many people.","NOMA PRESENTS KATHERINE CHOY: RADICAL POTTER IN 1950s NEW ORLEANS\nThe Exhibition Explores the Work and Short but Impactful Life of Ceramic Artist Katherine Choy\nNEW ORLEANS – The New Orleans Museum of Art (NOMA) presents Katherine Choy: Radical Potter in 1950s New Orleans, on view now through April 23, 2023. An innovative artist in a number of mediums, Katherine Choy (American, b. China 1927–1958) developed radical ceramic work that was distinctively her own. In her short mid-1950s career in New Orleans, Choy was a national leader in evolving ceramics from utilitarian objects into the purview of expressive fine art.\nThis exhibition and forthcoming catalogue Katherine Choy: Radical Potter in 1950s New Orleans mine archives and gather oral histories to tell the story of an artist that was widely celebrated by the American craft world, but who has been nearly forgotten. NOMA’s exhibition is the first presentation of Choy’s ceramics in New Orleans since the artist’s Louisiana friends mounted the Katherine Choy Memorial Show at the Orleans Gallery in fall 1959.\n“A star of midcentury experimental ceramics, Katherine Choy indelibly left her unique mark on New Orleans, while continuing the great tradition of pottery at Newcomb College,” said Susan Taylor, Montine McDaniel Freeman Director. “NOMA’s exhibition celebrates the artist’s assuredness in a radical vision for what artists working in clay can contribute to the world.”\nKatherine Po-yu Choy was born into an affluent merchant family in Hong Kong. During her childhood in Shanghai, Choy experienced privilege and a fine education but also the upheavals of war, including the occupation by Japan. In 1946, Katherine Choy left her home to study in the United States, earning degrees from Mills College in Oakland, California, followed by a prestigious fellowship at Cranbrook Academy for Art in Michigan. At age 24, Choy, already a rising star of American craft, became director of ceramics at Newcomb College in New Orleans. Soon after, NOMA (then the Delgado Museum) presented Ceramics by Katherine Choy, one of many exhibitions of her modern ceramics across the United States. Choy was one of the early members of the Orleans Gallery, a collective of like-minded artists who fostered contemporary work in New Orleans.\nChoy’s early pots show inspiration from Asian ceramics, as was popular among American potters in the 1950s. She mastered classic forms and applied calligraphy-like brushwork, but she increasingly expanded from those clay traditions. Her jagged, painterly vessels were as artistically advanced as any made elsewhere in the United States. A considered departure from the refinement of her training, Choy’s pots sprouted additional necks, could be aggressively large or asymmetrical, and had glazes that intentionally left parts of the raw clay exposed for all to see. Her enlarged, abstracted pottery conveyed—in a new approach from the world of painting—that ceramics, too, could be a canvas for emotional expression.\nThe artist’s ambition led her away from Newcomb in 1957, when she left New Orleans to found the Clay Art Center in Port Chester, New York. While establishing her collaborative artist’s center, and as she was preparing work for the 1958 Brussels World’s Fair, Katherine Choy died unexpectedly at age 30 in February 1958. Shocked by Choy’s untimely passing, colleagues at Newcomb remembered her “eager spirit and probing mind,” and artist friends at the Orleans Gallery organized an exhibition of her works.\nNOMA’s exhibition Katherine Choy: Radical Potter in 1950s New Orleans brings together 25 pots from the permanent collection of NOMA, local loans from the Newcomb Art Museum and the artist George Dunbar, and from the Clay Art Center, which is still in operation.\n“Katherine Choy’s powerful ceramic works demonstrate remarkable achievements during a short career, and this celebratory exhibition aims to place her as a major contributor to the advancement of modern pottery,” said Mel Buchanan, RosaMary Curator for Decorative Arts and Design. “Presented at NOMA is a significant body of work by an accomplished artist who created objects that were revolutionary in the 1950s, and that still look fresh today.”\nKatherine Choy: Radical Potter in 1950s New Orleans is curated by Mel Buchanan with Winston Ho and is supported by the Elise M. Besthoff Charitable Foundation, George Dunbar, and Charles L. Whited Jr. Special thanks to the artist’s family, Reena Kashyap and the Clay Art Center, and the Newcomb Art Museum.\nThe exhibition catalogue for Katherine Choy: Radical Potter in 1950s New Orleans will be available in fall 2022. The publication looks at the artist’s biography, her network of teachers, students, and colleagues, her contribution to the field of ceramics, and her merging of artistic expression with handcraft in the mid-1950s.\nAbout NOMA and the Besthoff Sculpture Garden\nThe New Orleans Museum of Art, founded in 1910 by Isaac Delgado, houses more than 40,000 works of art encompassing 5,000 years of history. Works from the permanent collection, along with continuously changing special exhibitions, are on view in the museum’s 46 galleries Tuesday through Sunday, 10 am–5 pm.* The adjoining Sydney and Walda Besthoff Sculpture Garden features more than 90 sculptures, including works from several 20th and 21st-century master sculptors.

{"question":"I work in metals research - what's the contrast between silver's economic role in Mesopotamia and its strategic importance at Abel Beth-Maacah?","answer":"In Mesopotamia, silver served primarily as a standard of value and equivalence for goods, with established weighing procedures and standardized forms (like discs, rings, and ingots) facilitating economic transactions across the Near East. At Abel Beth-Maacah, while silver was also valuable as hacksilver for exchange, the site's significance was more tied to its strategic location controlling key trade routes between Lebanon's Beq'a, the Huleh Valley, and the road to Damascus, making it a crucial border point for controlling movement and commerce between different cultural regions including Israelites, Canaanites, Arameans and Phoenicians.","context":["SCANE – Silver Circulation in the Ancient Near East\nA research project investigating the role of silver in ancient Near Eastern economies during the Bronze Age. An interdisciplinary team of Italian archaeologists, numismatists, Assyriologists and economists coordinated by Luca Peyronel is analysing silver hoards and silver objects, to be managed in an open-source and open-access database. Development of a comprehensive vocabulary for silver terminology in the various texts is planned in order to cross-check archaeological and epigraphic information.\nHoards of objects and pieces of silver dating to the mid-3rd millennium BC onwards are found in Mesopotamia, in both public and private contexts. These hoards may contain just silver, or there may also be other precious objects, or instruments used for craftwork and economic administrative activities such as scale weights, seals, cretulae and tablets. Silver has been found in the form of various types of ingot, rings, spirals – intact or broken, plates, and recycled fragments. Silver hoards reveal that this precious metal circulated from southern Levant to Anatolia, and from Mesopotamia to Iran and the Persian Gulf over a wide timespan, up to the introduction of coinage (6th century BC), when hoards containing pieces of silver, coins and broken coins were still deposited.\nStatistical studies of the masses of the pieces of silver in several hoards have shown significant repetitions of certain weight values in line with contemporary metrological systems, suggesting that the metal was divided into lumps of standard weight – and therefore value. Weighed silver, as an economic and financial instrument accepted throughout the Near East, easily transportable and with a convenient value: weight ratio, was thus also the preferred tool for circulation in the form of readily convertible weight units adopted by the various economic and administrative systems.\nThe project’s aim is to create a digital archive of all the Bronze Age silver hoards recorded in the Near East, containing quantitative and qualitative data regarding the artefacts, together with information on the discovery contexts and association with other objects.\nSilver in Cuneiform Sources\nMesopotamian written sources indicate that since at least the mid-3rd millennium BC onwards, silver (Sumerian kù-babbar; Accadian kaspu) was adopted as the standard of value and of equivalence between portable and non-portable goods, involving weighing procedures to verify transactions.\nBronze Age cuneiform sources exhibit a rather varied terminology in relation to the quality and forms in which the metal circulated and was exchanged. Third millennium documentation from Ebla (c. 2400-2300 BC) attests to the employment of silver artefacts of standardized shapes and weights (discs, pottery, bracelets, ornaments, weapons) in a ceremonial gift circuit. Texts from the palace of Mari and those of the Assyrian merchants of Kanesh (Middle Bronze Age, c. 2000-1750 BC) refer to silver in the form of discs, plates, ingots, rings and spirals, as well as the exchange of silver and gold vases (GAL/kâsum). Of particular importance are mentions during the 3rd dynasty of Ur and in the Palaeo-Babylonian period of silver rings (HAR/šewirum), bestowed by the central administration upon high officials and members of the court on special occasions. Late Bronze Age letters relating to diplomatic relations between Near Eastern kingdoms and Egypt show a contrast between a trading-type circuit in which is silver referred to by weight and a gift exchange circuit featuring luxury items in silver and gold.\nThese records are extensive but diverse, and their correct evaluation calls for careful and critical examination. One of the project’s main objectives is therefore a comparative analysis of the textual documentation dating to the 3rd and 2nd millennia BC, in order to quantify the circulation of silver in Near Eastern economies during the Bronze Age, define the various terminological aspects relating to the processing of this precious metal, and investigate its social and ideological role and significance.\n2019 – Peyronel, L.: Weighing Silver on the scales.

In one of these dramatic tales, a local Wise Woman (an oracle of sorts) had Sheba Ben Bichri beheaded, as he took refuge in the town after fleeing from Jerusalem in the wake of a rebellion he initiated against an infuriated and vengeful King David. The town was saved by her actions, only to be destroyed twice more – once by the Arameans in the 9th century BCE, and then again by the Neo-Assyrians in the 8th century BCE.\nThe site commands the narrow passageway from the Lebanese Beq’a to the north towards the Huleh Valley to the south, as well as the road to the east towards Damascus – via nearby Tel Dan – and Mesopotamia. This strategic border location has determined much of its occupation history until modern times.\nCuriously, despite its biblical and topographic prominence, the site has never been excavated before. Perhaps this is because of its border location, where Lebanese farmers, UN personnel and local kibbutzniks are all in pretty close eye contact. Short surveys were conducted and plans were made; Yigael Yadin was going to dig there, but turned his sights to nearby Hazor; but excavations never materialized.\nIn 2012, a team from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem – in partnership with Azusa Pacific University in Los Angeles (who provided the critical funding and support for the project) and Cornell University in Ithaca, New York – took up the initiative. A preliminary survey took place in 2012, and a full-blown month-long season was conducted in 2013. The second season is set to begin in July and will also last a month.\nFour weeks of digging with a team of volunteers, mostly from America and Canada, have already yielded exciting and promising results. Two excavation areas were opened, revealing well-built structures dating mostly to the Iron Age I, the 12th and 11th centuries BCE, the time of Joshua and the Judges.\nIn one area, a rather uncommon ring flask was found, indicating possible commercial connections with the Phoenician (modern Lebanon) coast. The area on the southern end of the mound, dramatically overlooking the expanse of the Huleh Valley, has an imposing structure that might have been a tower.\nA special find in that area was a small jug that contained a silver hoard, possibly stashed away by a woman or family who viewed it as a “nest egg” for a rainy day. This is one of the earliest Iron Age hoards found in the entire country and indicates that hacksilver, which was used for exchange in pre-coinage days, existed at that time and in that region, which has been traditionally understood as one of the centers of the settlement of the Israelite tribes.\nThe potential of this border site to shed light on relations between Israelites, Canaanites, Arameans and Phoenicians during the second and first millennia BCE is great, and the Institute of Archaeology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem is committed to continue uncovering the long-awaited secrets of this important tell, the last remaining major biblical tell in the country that has yet to be excavated."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:8146e825-4531-448e-814c-2677195f48c6>","<urn:uuid:7017e19e-82ae-440e-97ba-897de00436e6>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do Apex London Wall Hotel and Dubai International Airport compare in their approaches to reducing water consumption?","answer":"Both facilities implement water conservation measures, but in different ways. Apex London Wall Hotel uses flow regulators on taps and showers, dual flush toilets, and encourages shower use over baths. They also installed a 'green' roof system to regulate storm water outflow. Dubai International Airport's water conservation efforts are part of their Siemens smart building technology project, which aims to save 21 million gallons of water through intelligent controls and water fixtures integrated into their water systems.","context":["Environmental Features at Apex London Wall Hotel Apex Hotels are seen as leaders within the industry on their environmental initiatives and as a result have won numerous environmental awards. It has been reported that their sister Hotel in London produces less carbon emissions than a comparative hotel of its size and many of these environmental initiatives were developed further for implementation into the new Apex London Wall Hotel in London. As part of Apex Hotels continued environmental efforts of reduce, reuse and recycle. A number of actions were carried out at the design stage of this hotel to reduce its carbon emissions: The building has been fully refurbished into an 89 bed 4 star luxury hotel with restaurant, bar, lounge and gym facilities. It is an existing building structure thus conserving resources and energy and reducing drastically the quantity of demolition waste to landfill. It is located in the heart of London City on a brown field site with exceptionally good access to public transport links reducing the need for cars. A Guest & Staff Travel Plan was commissioned to conclude that the development would have no impact on existing traffic and to encourage the use of sustainable transport to and from the hotel. The building was thermally modelled using an environmental toolkit software to explore the optimum upgrade of building fabric and services. An air tightness test was commissioned to double check the buildings performance. The failing single glazed steel cladding system was removed and replaced with efficient double-glazed windows and Portland stone cladding. This results in a 90% smaller carbon footprint than facing bricks and 75% smaller than prefabricated concrete. The stone panels were cut and formed at an English quarry with no additional stop offs or processes. Two additional bedroom storeys have been added to the top of the building to increase the useable floor area without encroaching on the building footprint. These new floors are wrapped in full height, glass panels with patterned enamel coatings to reduce unwanted solar gains. Highly insulated panels behind the glass reduce heat loss and provide privacy. The original white glazed brick lightwell has been sympathetically restored to bounce natural daylight into the courtyard rooms. New energy efficient boilers and heating system have been installed linked to a Building Management System (BMS) which enables Apex Hotels to have full control of energy consumption and by monitoring daily can implement measures to further reduce the carbon emissions. Market leading heat pump technology has been installed incorporating heat recovery and compensating room set point control with outside temperature. Card readers have been fitted in all bedrooms to switch off lights, electrical appliances, heating and air coolers when the room is not in use. Low energy kettles are provided in bedrooms to reduce energy consumption. Low energy LED lamps have been fitted throughout the property and motion detectors fitted to low traffic areas to switch lights off. Energy efficient lifts have been installed.

Ross Davies reports\ns operator of Dubai International Airport – the largest airport in the world in terms of passenger traffic – Dubai Airports has been conspicuous for a while now in its efforts to project a clean image.\nGiven that most operators today are eager to burnish their green credentials, this makes Dubai’s recent achievements in reducing its carbon foot print particularly impressive.\nLast year it was reported that the group achieved total energy savings of 5.17 million kWh in 2016 across Dubai International and its sister hub Dubai World Central – the equivalent of powering 235 households for an entire year.\nOn 25 March last year, the two airports also participated in the Earth Hour event, during which landmarks across the world switched off their lights to draw attention to climate change.\nThe aforementioned energy savings were achieved through a range of initiatives, including the addition of solar panels on Dubai International’s Concourse D building, which opened in 2016. Over the last couple of years, the operator has also made progress in replacing traditional lighting with more energy-efficient LEDs.\nImage courtesy of Sorbis / Shutterstock.com\nGetting smart: Dubai partners with Siemens for seven-year project\nThe operator doesn’t appear to be resting on its laurels either. In May, Dubai Airports announced that it would be introducing smart building technology and data analytics to further cut its energy consumption – and in turn reduce its environmental footprint.\nThe technology, developed by Siemens, is set to ensure energy savings of close to 20% a year, according to the operator. The project, which is expected to last seven years, will see the solution installed across Dubai International’s Terminals 1,2 and 3, as well as Concourse B.\nThe focus will primarily be on the facilities’ air and water systems, with the goal to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 25,000 tonnes, as well as saving roughly 50 gigawatt hours of electricity and 21 million gallons of water.\nMade up of multi-components, including sensors, intelligent controls and water fixtures, the technology will be integrated into the airport’s air and water systems to optimise air-handling units, as well as the chilled water system, fresh air plant, and supply and exhaust fan systems.\nLED lights at Concourse D. Image courtesy of Dubai Airports\n“Sustainability underpins our facility management strategy and these energy and water savings have the double benefit of limiting our environmental footprint and improving our bottom line,” said Michael Ibbitson, executive vice president of infrastructure and technology at Dubai Airports.\n“As longstanding partners, Siemens understands our business, our systems and has the expertise and technology needed to help us deliver our vision.”\nOver the next seven years, the project’s design, supply, installation and commissioning will be carried out by Siemens.\n“By optimising technical infrastructure at Dubai International and providing enhanced control and data analytics, we are able to guarantee significant resource savings with sustainable environmental and financial benefits,” said Markus Strohmeier, senior executive vice president of building technologies, Siemens Middle East.\n“We recognise that Dubai Airports operates mission-critical infrastructure and we are committed to using technology and expertise to ensure it is functioning at its most efficient.”\nThe technology, developed by Siemens, is set to ensure energy savings of close to 20% a year\nState example: Dubai’s wider environmental commitments\nAs a state-run entity, Dubai Airport’s ongoing green commitments also tie into the emirate’s wider goals to reduce its energy consumption by 30% by 2030, as set out by the government.\nIn truth, the strategy, launched in 2016 by ruler Sheikh Mohammed, could have come earlier, given that the region emitted roughly 199.65 million tonnes of CO2 and greenhouse gases in 2013.\nAccording to a United Arab Emirates energy report from around the same period, 22% of carbon emissions in Dubai were attributable to its transportation industry. While no official figures exist, it’s highly likely that the city’s international airport was a fairly sizable contributor to this percentage.\nAirside operations at Dubai International. Image courtesy of Dubai Airports\nPrior to the Siemens announcement in February, Dubai Airports also announced that going forward it will only be purchasing green vehicles, in a pledge co-signed by the Dubai Civil Aviation Authority and Emirates Group.\nThis again is linked to a wider governmental initiative, known as the ‘Green Mobility Initiative’, which encourages the use of hybrid and electric vehicles as part of the city-state’s vision to be become a ‘smart city’.\nDubai is aiming for the share of hybrid and electric vehicles to be around 2% of the entirety of registered vehicles by 2020, rising to 10% by 2030. If this percentage is achieved, the government estimates fuel savings in the region of three billion litres – 5% of total consumption – by 2030.\nDubai is aiming for the share of hybrid and electric vehicles to be around 2% of the entirety of registered vehicles by 2020\nGreen fleet: hybrid and electric vehicles to be arriving soon\nRun by airlines, control authorities and ground handling services provider dnata, Dubai International currently has a fleet of 6,345 ground service vehicles operating on its premises. These vehicles include water tankers, tow tractors and forklifts – as well as a number of already-green automobiles, including BMW hybrid limousines for VIP services and a fleet of Tesla taxis operated by Dubai Road and Transport Authority.\nThe goal is to convert Dubai International’s portion of the airport fleet, consisting of 352 vehicles, to “green options” by 2023, according to Ibbitson in a statement at the time.\nThis, however, won’t include tow tractors, scissor lift trucks and ground power units, as “there are no hybrid or electric options” – although “we are calling on manufacturers to address these gaps and come up with cost effective, environmentally friendly alternatives”.\nImage courtesy of Kazzazm / Shutterstock.com\n“Our goal is to get greener faster. Together we have pledged to buy green going forward with a goal to replace the entire fleet with environmentally friendly options by the end of the next decade,” said Ibbitson.\n“As a provider of infrastructure, Dubai Airports will also do its part by providing charging and fuelling stations to power the fleets operated by our stakeholders. All other members of the aviation community are equally behind this effort.”\nDubai International currently has a fleet of 6,345 ground service vehicles operating on its premises"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:3b4bb936-f781-45e9-8e5c-10b27d1f6634>","<urn:uuid:82966d51-58b4-43a5-8964-90b568821ab8>"],"error":null}
{"question":"As a marine biologist studying shell hardening processes, I'm curious how do the mineral reabsorption mechanisms during molting compare between American lobsters affected by shell disease and healthy European lobsters?","answer":"Both species reabsorb minerals during molting, but the process is described differently for each. For American lobsters, they reabsorb calcium carbonate and minerals from their endocuticle through the epidermal cell layer before molting. They then eat their old shell to reclaim remaining minerals and must consume additional minerals from their diet to establish the new shell, taking about 7 days to feel hard and several weeks to reach maximum hardness. If they can't obtain enough minerals, particularly with ocean acidification, their shells may become vulnerable to shell disease. For European lobsters, after molting they absorb water to swell and rupture the old exoskeleton, then consume it to obtain calcium for the new shell. The hardening process takes hours to weeks depending on the animal's size and calcium availability. Both species are vulnerable during this period, with European lobsters typically hiding until the new shell hardens.","context":["While out here on the Bigelow at the southern edge of the Northeast Channel, we’ve caught some lobsters, and just in time. Sailing with us is Joe Kunkel, a former professor and now professor emeritus at UMass Amherst, who is investigating a shell disease found on some lobsters.\nShell disease is an epizootic, or temporarily prevalent and widespread, disease found on lobsters. Unofficially, it’s suggested to be caused by a bacterium called Aquamarina. It’s denoted by circular lesions on the top part of the carapace. The lesions start out microscopic, but once visible, hundreds of organisms, such as other bacteria, protozoans and nematodes, can be found living in the infected area. During the 1980s, about 1 in 10,000 lobsters may have been seen with shell disease. By the late 1990s, hot spots with up to 70% of the population showing signs of lesions were seen in the Narragansett and Buzzards Bay areas.\nJoe suggests that the prevalence of the disease increases as the lobsters’ vulnerability to it increases. This means the shell’s protective ability plays an important role. Minerals composing the shell include calcium, phosphate and magnesium. The chemical reactions between these minerals dissolving in the surrounding sea water create a basic (high pH), ‘unstirred layer’. Think of it as a barrier between the lobster and seawater where a lot of mineral mixing is happening. Have you ever noticed that a lobster feels a little slippery? The slippery feeling is that protective barrier.\nIn order to grow, lobsters molt their hard, exterior shell. Leading up to molting, a reserve of calcium carbonate and minerals in the endocuticle, or inner shell layer, are reabsorbed through the epidermal cell layer. A new, soft shell matrix is formed underneath the old shell. Once molted, they eat their old shell, bringing all the rest of the minerals back into their body. They use the reabsorbed and eaten minerals to establish their new shell. It takes about seven days for the shell to feel hard, and it’ll be several more weeks until the shell reaches its maximum hardness. But their new shell has to be bigger so they also need to consume more minerals from their diet. This time of shell establishment is the vulnerable phase when shell disease may sneak in.\nIf a lobster isn’t able to consume enough added minerals, the new shell could be thinner or weaker in some areas. As global warming changes the temperature and chemistry of the ocean, lobsters may find it increasingly difficult to obtain the necessary amount of minerals, added to what they already have stored, and regrow a shell to its maximum thickness and hardness as well as building reserves for its yet bigger shell next year. Possibly, those areas of mineral thinness, or shell weakness, are spots of vulnerability to shell disease. If the protective barrier isn’t as effective, the lobsters are rendered more vulnerable, giving the bacteria a chance to establish a lesion.\nThe mineralization is a process that spans multiple years, and the lobsters need an adequate mineral supply to achieve a healthy cuticle that is not vulnerable to infection. We are making it harder for the lobsters by feeding them low-calcium bait. We could possibly have a healthier lobster population in the face of ocean acidification if we feed them a higher calcium carbonate bait. – Joe Kunkel\nBut if a lobster has shell disease, not all is lost! If they are able to shed their shell, the disease goes with it, and they are safe. Unfortunately, it’s not that simple. First, younger lobsters benefit from multiple molts a year as they are growing very fast. They are rarely killed because shell disease does not have the time to develop to advanced stages. For older lobsters, molting is reduced to once a year in the summer. This means that if the lobster is vulnerable to shell disease due to a compromised shell, it may develop lesions at some point during the year. As a result, the most severe cases are expected right before molting. As long as the infection hasn’t made its way through the epidermal cell layer, the lobster has a chance to molt the shell and have a new beginning, disease free with a new shell. Otherwise, the infection enters the blood stream and kills the lobster.\nFemales have an added hurdle to overcome because they don’t molt while carrying eggs. Molting for these females may be delayed for up to six months! This means any lesions on the shell have six more months to reach the blood stream. Large, healthy and reproductively successful females are extremely important for sustaining a population, so it’s disconcerting to see this condition having an exaggerated effect on females.\nBut where there are problems, there are people seeking solutions. One idea is to supplement their diets by feeding lobsters in their traps with bait that contains more minerals needed for shell growth. Another idea is to harvest them sooner after they molt. This may decrease the amount of lobsters caught with shell disease as it hasn’t had time to establish itself. Lobsters with shell disease are usually either discarded or if abundant they are sent to the cannery. Since the lesions are only on the cuticle, the meat is perfectly fine. Lobsters with shell disease are not desirable for boiling in the shell because the lovely cherry red color is replaced with a rusted-metal look.\nAboard the NOAA Ship Henry B. Bigelow\nSBTS HB18-02 Leg 4","Biology of the European lobster, Homarus gammarus\nTAXONOMY, DISTRIBUTION AND ANATOMY\nAll lobsters belong to the invertebrate Subphylum called the Crustacea, which also includes marine animals like crabs, krill and barnacles, as well as terrestrial families like woodlice. The Order Decapoda (meaning ‘10-limbed’) contains most of the commercially important species including the European lobster, Homarus gammarus. H. gammarus populations inhabit sub-tidal eastern North Atlantic waters from the Lofoten Islands in arctic Norway to the Azores and Morocco, including the Mediterranean and western Black Sea, but not in the Baltic. H. gammarus is rarely found deeper than 50m, but can occur anywhere from the low tide mark to 150m, usually on hard substrates made of rock or compressed mud. The two foremost limbs of Homarid lobsters are specialised into two large claws; one is large and blunt and designed for crushing whilst the other is sharper and slightly less bulky and used for slicing. The internal soft tissues of the body are protected by a rigid exoskeleton, the foremost part of which is the solid carapace and the hind portion is the articulating abdomen and tail, which can be contracted quickly to allow thrusting reverse swimming.\nFigure 1) The external (top) and internal anatomy of a mature H. gammarus\nLobsters grow in length by shedding their hard exoskeleton, a process known as moulting. As they moult, water is absorbed by the body tissues and this causes the lobster to swell and rupture the outer exoskeleton. After it has freed itself, further swelling occurs and a new exoskeleton begins to harden. Newly moulted individuals are vulnerable to predation and tend to remain hidden until the new exoskeleton has hardened; a process that is completed within a period of a few hours to several weeks, depending on the size of the animal and the availability of calcium and the rapidity with which it is deposited. In the period between moults, new body tissue is generated to replace the water absorbed at moulting. During each moult, the carapace length typically increases by 10-15% and the total weight by up to 50%. Once the lobster has moulted it consumes its old exoskeleton, providing the lobster with much of the calcium needed to solidify its fresh shell. Young lobsters moult up to 25 times in their first five years, and about once a week in their first month. Adults moult less frequently; with old, large adults, this may be as little as once every two years, but they keep growing throughout their lives. The largest specimen on record measured 1.26m and weighed 9.3kg (20lb 8oz). Caught in 1931 in Fowey, England, the exoskeletal shell of its crushing claw alone weighed 1.2kg. Appendages and limbs lost through injury can be regenerated, but this usually has a negative affect on both the intermoult period and the growth increment.\nThank you to Guppy Michel Bruno who has very kindly let us share this incredible footage of a moulting crayfish\nThe female lobster reaches sexual maturity in 5 to 7 years of age, at a carapace length of 75-80mm, and the male at a slightly smaller size. Mating usually occurs between a hard-shelled male and a soft, newly-moulted female. The sperm is transferred from the male via ducts situated at the base of the last pair of walking legs, to the sperm receptacle on the female. The female can retain the sperm whilst the eggs are being laid. Spawning usually occurs in the summer when the female is said to be ‘berried’, the eggs are fertilized as they are extruded through the small ducts and are carried underneath the abdomen for 9-12 months. The eggs change colour as they develop, at first they are dark green, then black and finally they begin to turn red as the embryo develops and consumes the yolk to reveal itself though the transparent outer layer. Hatching occurs over several nights in batches of a couple of thousand at a time, when the stage 1 larvae are released into the water column by a shake of the female’s tail and pleopods, to begin their planktonic stage.\nThe larvae float at the mercy of the ocean currents in the surface layers of the water column where they are omnivorous, opportunistic feeders, eating phytoplankton and other zooplankton such as copepods. Larval life lasts approximately 5-10 weeks during which natural mortality, mostly from predation, is highest. H. gammarus larvae are also very susceptible to anthropogenic toxins during this phase, such as surface accumulations of hydrocarbons. Like other planktonic creatures, the larvae are often pushed together in dense clusters by converging water masses and it is at this stage when they are most vulnerable to predation by schooling fish like herring and cod and filter feeders like basking sharks. After the third moult there is a distinct change in body-structure, with the claws and tail moving from their lowly, dangled positions to jut out straight from the thorax and abdomen respectively. This alteration towards the post-larval form of an adult allows the lobster to swim forwards using the pleopods and seek a suitable substrate for benthic existence, like gravel or coarse sand. This larval to post-larval phase is a critical period in the development of H. gammarus; it has been estimated that only 0.005% of the hatchling lobsters survive the planktonic phase to reach the benthic phase.\nPost-larval juveniles experience a much higher survival rate from Stage IV, as they are now out of reach and view of many of the abundant pelagic predators. Despite significant and widespread investigations, comprehensive information is unavailable on the early benthic phase of the post-larvae. Little is known about the habits of the lobster in the first few years that follow settlement as they are rarely observed in the wild, unlike related species such as Homarus Americanus, the European lobster’s western Atlantic relative. What has been ascertained, in the laboratory environment at least, is that once settled, the juveniles burrow into the seabed where they spend approximately 2 years, seldom moving. Gravels ranging from coarse sand to fine shingle appear to be the preferred habitat, though juveniles have also been known to form burrows in cohesive mud. At this stage they will eat marine worms and other post-larval animals like small crabs, urchins and gastropods, as well as retaining the ability to filter-feed on plankton. At a carapace length of about 15mm they leave their burrows for crevices in rocky substrate to begin life as an adult.\nThe diet of adult European lobsters, who hunt mainly nocturnaly, comprises mostly of benthic invertebrates such as crabs, molluscs, urchins, starfish and polychaete worms, but may also include some fish, algae and zooplankton. Feeding is reduced in the winter as the metabolic rate slows because of the lower sea temperatures. Though typically sedentary animals, the lobster will roam to find food and has a typical home range of 2km, while some individuals have been known to stray 10km or more from their burrows. The typical colouration of a mature H. gammarus is dorsally blue/navy and ventrally lighter, with an orange or yellowy tinge. This colouration is caused by a pigment in the exoskeleton called astaxanthin, which turns bright red when significantly heated; hence the lobster’s colour after cooking. The exoskeletal colour is determined by the presence of several different astaxanthins that each colour the shell blue, red, or yellow. Occasionally, one or more of these astaxanthins can be missing or suppressed, causing an unusual colouration in the host lobster. Although extremely rare, lobsters have been observed to be bright blue, red, orange, calico or entirely albino.\nWhile genetic data from wild populations suggests that a female mates with only one male, the male lobster can fertilise multiple females, producing a polygynous breeding system. Molecular markers such as microsatellite, mtDNA and allozymes have allowed extensive sampling of over 5,000 animals from 46 European locations that deduced a low level of overall genetic divergence among populations. No evidence was provided for major genetic differentiation between Atlantic and Mediterranean populations, unlike those seen in many other marine species. Overall, 4 distinct genetic populations have been identified in northern Norway, Netherlands, Atlantic Europe and Mediterranean. The Norwegian, Dutch and Mediterranean populations differ from the remaining Atlantic Europe group because all have reduced gene diversity. A large number of discrete populations of H. gammarus have limited gene flow between them, conducive of an island model of population structure. Though the overall level of genetic divergence remains low, the populations living at the extreme ranges of the species’ distribution are likely to be genetically adapted to tolerate what are extreme environmental conditions for the species.\nLarva to Juvenile\nThe three larval stages (I, II and III,) of the lobster H.

However, when incorporating festival elements into business settings, several safety considerations must be addressed. These include preventing decorating mishaps, which cause nearly 15,000 ER-treated injuries each holiday season, with over 40% involving falls. Safety measures should include proper ladder usage following National Safety Council guidelines, appropriate protective clothing, and having spotters present during decoration installation. Additionally, businesses must ensure adequate commercial umbrella insurance coverage for potential accidents.","context":["Festivals are perhaps the easiest way to sample Europe’s immense variety of cultures and histories. For the time poor, this guide represents a cross-section of the continent’s most popular gatherings.

It’s a slow-burner of an event, beginning between January and February and ending at the beginning of Lent, forty days before Easter.\nThe carnival opens at St Mark’s Square to exuberant fanfare: you’ve got dress-up contests, musical and theatrical performances, balls, and feasts. The carnival celebrations are probably most famously punctuated by the elaborate white masks you’ll see everyone wearing.\nMardi Gras is the world’s derivation of Carnival di Venezia, and shares the original spirit of frivolity and exaltation of culture for culture’s own sake.\nLa Tomatina, Spain\nWhen: 30 August\nThe immortal (and, depending on who you ask, unverified) tale of La Tomatina’s inception is nonetheless close to its present-day reality. Back in 1945, a group of young people at the Los Gigantes Carnaval in Bunol started throwing tomatoes at each other; unsurprisingly, the participants and onlookers loved the novelty, and it became an institution. Spain made it an official annual fixture in 1957, and now, you can join the battle. It happens on 30 August this year so book your flights accordingly.\nCannes International Film Festival, France\nWhen: 17 to 28 May\nEvery year a near-tangible buzz overwhelms the bucolic streets and alleyways of Cannes, as the who’s-who of the international film industry fly into the Cote d’Azur to celebrate the film festival of film festivals. While much of the Cannes Film Festival is locked down tight, the public can participate in select screenings and huddle beside press photo-stops in hopes of seeing world-famous celebrities in the flesh. Anyone who’s been we’ll tell you the magic of Cannes Film Festival has little to do with the films, or even the coveted Palme d’Or; the place becomes an effervescent hub of comingling cultures. Eat at a restaurant by the beach, catch a screening under the stars at Cine ma de la Plage; whatever you do, your very existence will justify the festival’s purpose.\nWhen:16 September to 3 October\nDon’t like beer? No matter. Oktoberfest is a people festival, a social gathering elevated by song, dance, and brilliantly hearty food. The event is a convivial, open-air, open-plan affair held on the Theresienwiese, which is the official space set aside for the festivities. Munich is a boisterous place during Oktoberfest: you’ll go on rides, wave at männer und frauen passing by your table on gigantic stein-shaped floats, and listen to traditional German music performed live. Whatever you do, make sure you spring for a litre-sized stein and toast your fellow human in singular style.\nCooper’s Hill Cheese-Rolling and Wake, England\nWhen: 29 May 2017\nDuring what may be Europe’s most bizarrely entertaining festival, the citizens of Gloucester – plus whoever else is fortunate enough to be present – roll a seven-pound wheel of cheese down a series of hills varying in steepness.

Now’s the time to make your list and check it twice to ensure that your business liability insurance is up to date for some common potential hazards that can occur during the holiday season.\nHoliday Hazard 1: Fires\nMost statistics about holiday fires revolve around home fires, but that’s not to say that the risks aren’t equally real in a business setting—and involve many of the same behaviors that put your house at risk. Whether you want to enjoy the fresh smell and ambiance of a live tree, or your employees are plugging in multiple extension cords as they decorate their workspace, you’re playing with fire if you’re not extra attentive to fire risks.\nTalk to your landlord about precautions for safe decorating, which typically involves keeping live trees out of the workplace and insisting on “fake” candles only. And, check your fire insurance to make sure you’re covered for full replacement value for all your costly equipment. It’s also a smart idea to double-check your back-up storage to ensure that important files aren’t lost should a fire occur.\nHoliday Hazard 2: Holiday parties\nIt’s hard to believe that festive merriment can be a hazard, but in the era of #MeToo, firms are warier than ever of socializing—especially when alcohol is involved. In fact, fewer companies are holding holiday parties, with one survey finding the lowest number since the recession of 2009. Those that do need to be wary of potential risks and do what they can to mitigate them.\nConsider holding your event in the day for more control over revelry. If you do decide to host an evening soiree, limit the amount of alcohol that is offered to each guest (if any). Trained servers can help make sure imbibers are legally supposed to drink and that no one is being overserved, to the best of their knowledge. You might want to look into liquor liability insurance, although a one-time event is likely to fall under the umbrella of “social host liquor liability,” which means that your general business liability insurance policy should cover an alcohol-related incident. Of course, that protection won’t extend to any negligence. And note that social host liquor liability laws vary by state.\nHoliday Hazard 3: Icy conditions\nSometimes you’ll find that the weather outside is “frightful,” this time of year, as the beloved song says. When ice and snow accumulate, your business could be at risk from clients, patrons or employees slipping in the parking lot or on icy stairs or front walks or even sliding as they enter, as the floors become soggy from people tracking in rain or mush.\nMake sure that you routinely check parking lots and front areas and keep walks and steps clear. Use moisture-wicking, non-slip mats inside your doors and try to keep up on drying the floors. Post hazard signs to warn visitors of wet, potentially slippery conditions. And, of course, make sure you have adequate commercial umbrella insurance in place.\nHoliday Hazard 4: Decorating mishaps\nDecking the halls is fun and festive, but can also be the cause of accidents, from falling off ladders while hanging lights to cuts, bruises or scrapes from sharp decor. In fact, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) reports an average of nearly 15,000 ER-treated injuries related to decorating each holiday season. Of those, more than 40% involve falls, and about three of the falls per season are fatal.\nWhen using a ladder, follow guidelines offered by the National Safety Council (NCS) which offers suggestions on choosing the right ladder for the job and making sure you have safe surroundings before climbing. It’s also smart to have a spotter or other bystander helping you out. And in general, make sure that you take care when decorating, including wearing appropriate clothing, such as pants and shirts that cover your skin, gloves, eye covering if needed and closed-toe, slip-proof shoes.

In contrast, credit card processing fees for restaurants typically range between 1.5% and 3% of the total transaction amount, which includes interchange fees, assessment fees, and markup fees charged by payment processors.","context":["In this month’s Trend Watch roundup, we are looking at how the rise of sober curiosity gave way to a curious comeback for the soda industry. Also, we’re taking a look at how breakfast has evolved to become a more convenient and efficient meal to match today’s consumer and a bird’s eye view of what today’s average American independent restaurant looks like.\nOne of the biggest challenges facing the ever-growing food delivery industry? Communication. Whether it’s about missing orders, late or cold food, or complete order mix-ups, third-party delivery is clearly still facing growing pains.\nIn fact, consumers experience problems with third-party food delivery websites nearly one-quarter (24.4%) of the time, according to a study of 1,084 customers from Zion & Zion. Here are their biggest complaints:\nAnd customers aren’t just taking these errors in stride. According to the study 51% of respondents are “very frustrated” when their order is wrong. And when issues do happen, non-Millennials (aka older generations) are 56.3% likely to complain to the restaurant, while Millennials are only 34.2% likely to complain to the restaurant. Neither age group is likely to complain to the delivery platform directly.\n“As the study shows, when there is a delivery problem, customers often blame both parties because they don’t know who to blame,” Zion & Zion CEO Aric Zion said. “To fix this, delivery app companies need to provide more transparency into the process of how an order gets processed. If consumers know which party performed each function, then they would be more likely to blame the responsible party.”\nSoda drinking spikes as sober curiosity trend continues\nNielsen says that more than one in five U.S. consumers participated in Dry January last year. As sober curiosity continues to take off, one industry is taking advantage of the spiritless trend: soft drinks.\nAccording to Nielsen, soft drinks were consumed by nearly half (46%) of all Dry January participants, more so than water (43%). The growth in popularity of beverage alternatives has led to a 2.9% surge in soft drink sales in 2019. The comeback of sugary drinks is juxtaposed with increasing interest in healthy habits and wellness-based eating.\n“Soft drinks are a reliable alternative in social gatherings for abstainers who are looking for more than water,” Matt Crompton, Client Solutions Director for Nielsen CGA said in a statement. “And as soft drink manufacturers and brands continue to evolve meet healthier lifestyles (with reduced-sugar, healthier and premium options), the opportunity to effectively and strategically engage both the regular and occasional abstainers will continue to grow.”\nWorth the splurge?\nWhen it comes to treating themselves, consumers are more likely to spend their money on restaurant meals than any other category.\nIn fact, according to a study by public relations agency 5WPR, dining out is the number-one splurge-worthy category and 43% of consumers find themselves spending more of their paycheck on restaurant meals, followed by travel and experiences (41%) and snacks (39%), and well ahead of material possessions like electronics (35%) and clothing (27%).\nThis is what the average independent restaurant looks like\nDatassential recently curated data on 500 single-unit operators to find out what they’re serving, how they’re running their business, and how they’re growing. Here’s a snapshot of the average American independent restaurant:\nGood-old reliable breakfast is changing: Here’s how\nBreakfast has always been one of the most important meals of the day in American diets and while that’s not changing — Americans consumed 102 billion breakfasts in 2019 — but it’s starting to evolve.\nAccording to NPD Group, the usual eggs and bacon may not cut it for the convenience-obsessed American of today. Americans are looking for functional, convenient and functional morning meals: whether that comes from a quick-service breakfast or an on-the-go snack.\n“Solutions would be the foods and beverages that meet those needs or mechanisms, like mobile ordering, that are convenient and save them time,” an analyst with NPD group said.\nBut just because non-traditional breakfast, like burgers, is on the rise, don’t go changing your breakfast menu just yet:\n“In terms of servings volume, the top breakfast foods are traditional, like breakfast sandwiches and wraps, bacon/sausage/ham, sweet breads, potatoes, savory breads, eggs/omelets, and pancakes/waffles/French toast,” the NPD Group representative said.\nEffective digital marketing starts with more deals and coupons, study says\nDigital marketing is a must for any restaurant today looking to reach or expand their customer base. But what’s the best strategy? According to marketing and advertising firm AdTheorent’s Dining Trends Report, consumers are not as loyal as they once were: About one in four customers will go to their preferred restaurant’s competitor if they receive a mobile device ad on the way to a quick-service or fast-casual restaurant.\nWith all of the noise from native advertisements on social media to popup ads and email marketing campaigns, the best digital advertising strategy is to offer a personalized deal. According to AdTheorent, the top ads that attract attention are the ones that provide a special offer (38% of consumers) that is specially tailored to their interests and consumer habits (71% of consumers).\n“Restaurants can improve their advertising experience for consumers through a combination of proper targeting and messaging,” Jim Lawson, CEO of AdTheorent said. \"Our research shows that relevant and tailored ads are more well received and drive superior results for marketers.\"\nTo further emphasize the importance of personalized digital coupons, the AdTheorent study shows that 70% of consumers use their mobile devices when selecting and ordering from a restaurant, and nearly half (42%) are looking for coupons and deals. In comparison, only 32% are placing a food order.","What Is a Good Effective Rate for Credit Card Processing?\nCredit card processing is an essential service for businesses of all sizes. Whether you operate a small retail store or an e-commerce website, the ability to accept credit card payments is crucial for attracting customers and increasing sales. However, credit card processing comes with fees, and one of the most important factors to consider is the effective rate.\nThe effective rate is the total cost of accepting credit card payments, expressed as a percentage of the total transaction amount. It includes all the fees associated with credit card processing, such as interchange fees, assessment fees, and markup fees charged by the payment processor.\nDetermining what is considered a good effective rate can be challenging, as it depends on various factors, including your industry, average transaction size, and sales volume. However, a general guideline is to aim for an effective rate between 1.5% and 3% for most businesses. Let’s delve deeper into understanding the components of the effective rate and how to achieve a favorable one.\nComponents of the Effective Rate\n1. Interchange Fees: Interchange fees are charged by the credit card networks (Visa, Mastercard, etc.) and vary depending on factors like card type (debit, credit, rewards), transaction method (swiped, keyed), and industry. These fees are non-negotiable and typically represent the largest portion of the effective rate.\n2. Assessment Fees: Assessment fees are levied by the credit card networks to cover their operational costs and range from 0.1% to 0.25% of the transaction amount.\n3. Markup Fees: Markup fees are charged by the payment processor or merchant service provider (MSP) for their services. These fees are negotiable and can include a combination of fixed transaction fees, percentage fees, monthly fees, and other add-ons.\nAchieving a Favorable Effective Rate\n1. Compare Multiple Providers: To obtain a good effective rate, it’s crucial to compare offerings from different payment processors. Look for providers that offer transparent pricing, competitive rates, and excellent customer service.\n2. Negotiate Fees: Don’t be afraid to negotiate with payment processors. Many providers are willing to adjust their rates and fees, especially if you have a high sales volume or operate in a low-risk industry.\n3. Optimize Processing Methods: Utilize payment methods that result in lower interchange fees. For example, swiping physical cards typically incurs lower fees than manually keying in card details.\n4. Review Statements Regularly: Always review your monthly statements to ensure you’re not being charged for unnecessary fees or services. Look for any hidden costs or unexpected rate increases.\n5. Monitor Industry Changes: Stay up to date with changes in the credit card processing industry. Networks periodically revise their interchange fee structures, and being aware of these changes can help you make informed decisions and negotiate better rates.\nQ: Is a lower effective rate always better?\nA: Not necessarily. While a lower effective rate is generally desirable, it’s important to consider other factors like the quality of service, customer support, and additional features offered by the payment processor.\nQ: Why are interchange fees non-negotiable?\nA: Interchange fees are set by the credit card networks and apply to all businesses equally. They are intended to cover the costs associated with processing transactions and maintaining the payment infrastructure.\nQ: Are there any additional fees I should be aware of?\nA: In addition to the three main components of the effective rate, some payment processors may charge additional fees for services like chargebacks, PCI compliance, or early termination. Always review the terms and conditions and inquire about any potential additional fees.\nQ: What if my effective rate is higher than the recommended range?\nA: If your effective rate is higher than expected, it may be worth reassessing your payment processor and exploring other options. Contact different providers to see if they can offer a better rate based on your business’s specific needs.\nIn conclusion, a good effective rate for credit card processing is typically between 1.5% and 3%. Achieving a favorable rate involves comparing providers, negotiating fees, optimizing processing methods, and staying informed about industry changes. By following these steps, businesses can ensure they are getting the best value for their credit card processing needs."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:155fd5fa-4a01-47f7-938e-d5d58d9508d8>","<urn:uuid:cf182bbe-13b8-436a-abae-0e9200db3e96>"],"error":null}
{"question":"请问🤔 temple里的 Holy Place和 inner sanctuary有什么区别呢？Can you explain the differences between these two sections in detail?","answer":"The Holy Place and inner sanctuary (Holy of Holies) were distinct sections of the sacred space. The Holy Place was the outer court or first part of the tabernacle, containing the lampstand, table, and showbread. The inner sanctuary (Holy of Holies) was located behind the second veil and was the most sacred space, containing the ark of the covenant. The inner sanctuary measured twenty cubits in length, width, and height, and was overlaid with pure gold. A key difference was accessibility - while priests could enter the Holy Place regularly, only the high priest could enter the Holy of Holies once per year on the Day of Atonement.","context":["1 Then indeed, even the first covenant had ordinances of divine service and the earthly sanctuary. 2 For a tabernacle was prepared: the first part, in which was the lampstand, the table, and the showbread, which is called the sanctuary; 3 and behind the second veil, the part of the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of All,\nChapter 8 shows the discontinuity between the Old and New Covenants. Chapter 9 reveals that there is some continuity between the two, represented in the types of the tabernacle. However, there is clear superiority in that which Christ ministers. The main argument of Hebrews 9 is to show the superiority of the sacrifice of Christ for our sins.\nHaving presented Christ as our High Priest who ministers in the new tabernacle, which is heaven itself (He 8:1–5), Hebrews now shows the work of the Aaronic priest in the ancient tabernacle (He 9:1–5). In that tabernacle the veil shut people out. There is a contrast in this chapter between materiality of the old tabernacle and the reality of our heavenly tabernacle. The New Covenant has superior features to the old economy.\nThe first five verses show the objects in the tabernacle, whereas verses 6–10 describe regulations of religious life.\nThese words resume Hebrews 8:5. The “then” refers to the time when the Old Covenant was in force.\neven the first covenant had ordinances of divine service and the earthly [mundane] sanctuary [entire tabernacle].\nAll rituals and objects of the earthly sanctuary had typological value under the Mosaic Covenant. The Old Testament uses 50 chapters to describe this typological picture of Christ.\nFor a tabernacle was prepared:\nThe reference here is to the construction of the original tent-like structure called the tabernacle.\nthe first part,\nThis is the outer court of the tabernacle or the Holy Place.\nin which was the lampstand,\nThe “lampstand,” which was crafted of gold, had three branches on each side and one in the middle (Ex 25:31, 33). The priests were to burn oil in this lamp perpetually (Lev 24:2–3). Christ is the light of the world.\nthe table, and the showbread [rows of loaves of bread on the table],\n“Showbread” refers to loaves arranged in two rows on a table on each Sabbath (Le 24:6, 29). The “table” and “showbread” form a hendiadys indicating that both should be viewed together.\nwhich is called the sanctuary;\nThe reference is to the entire earthly tabernacle symbolism.\nand behind the second veil,\nThe tabernacle complex had three curtains. The “second veil” separated the Holy Place from the Holy of Holies. The high priest was allowed beyond the “second veil” into the Holy of Holies once a year on the Day of Atonement (Lev 16:2).\nthe part of the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of All,\nThe Holy of Holies was the place of God’s presence.\nAll believers have free access to God’s presence because of our High Priest in heaven.\nOld Testament worship excluded all from the immediate presence of God save the high priest once a year. Christians have direct access to God because we have forever been declared righteous before God in Christ (Ro 5:2).","World Wide Study Bible\na Bible passage\nSolomon Builds the Temple\nIn the four hundred eightieth year after the Israelites came out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon’s reign over Israel, in the month of Ziv, which is the second month, he began to build the house of the Lord. 2The house that King Solomon built for the Lord was sixty cubits long, twenty cubits wide, and thirty cubits high. 3The vestibule in front of the nave of the house was twenty cubits wide, across the width of the house. Its depth was ten cubits in front of the house. 4For the house he made windows with recessed frames. 5He also built a structure against the wall of the house, running around the walls of the house, both the nave and the inner sanctuary; and he made side chambers all around. 6The lowest story was five cubits wide, the middle one was six cubits wide, and the third was seven cubits wide; for around the outside of the house he made offsets on the wall in order that the supporting beams should not be inserted into the walls of the house.\n7 The house was built with stone finished at the quarry, so that neither hammer nor ax nor any tool of iron was heard in the temple while it was being built.\n8 The entrance for the middle story was on the south side of the house: one went up by winding stairs to the middle story, and from the middle story to the third. 9So he built the house, and finished it; he roofed the house with beams and planks of cedar. 10He built the structure against the whole house, each story five cubits high, and it was joined to the house with timbers of cedar.\n11 Now the word of the Lord came to Solomon, 12“Concerning this house that you are building, if you will walk in my statutes, obey my ordinances, and keep all my commandments by walking in them, then I will establish my promise with you, which I made to your father David. 13I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not forsake my people Israel.”\n14 So Solomon built the house, and finished it. 15He lined the walls of the house on the inside with boards of cedar; from the floor of the house to the rafters of the ceiling, he covered them on the inside with wood; and he covered the floor of the house with boards of cypress. 16He built twenty cubits of the rear of the house with boards of cedar from the floor to the rafters, and he built this within as an inner sanctuary, as the most holy place. 17The house, that is, the nave in front of the inner sanctuary, was forty cubits long. 18The cedar within the house had carvings of gourds and open flowers; all was cedar, no stone was seen. 19The inner sanctuary he prepared in the innermost part of the house, to set there the ark of the covenant of the Lord. 20The interior of the inner sanctuary was twenty cubits long, twenty cubits wide, and twenty cubits high; he overlaid it with pure gold. He also overlaid the altar with cedar. 21Solomon overlaid the inside of the house with pure gold, then he drew chains of gold across, in front of the inner sanctuary, and overlaid it with gold. 22Next he overlaid the whole house with gold, in order that the whole house might be perfect; even the whole altar that belonged to the inner sanctuary he overlaid with gold.\nThe Furnishings of the Temple\n23 In the inner sanctuary he made two cherubim of olivewood, each ten cubits high. 24Five cubits was the length of one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the length of the other wing of the cherub; it was ten cubits from the tip of one wing to the tip of the other. 25The other cherub also measured ten cubits; both cherubim had the same measure and the same form. 26The height of one cherub was ten cubits, and so was that of the other cherub. 27He put the cherubim in the innermost part of the house; the wings of the cherubim were spread out so that a wing of one was touching the one wall, and a wing of the other cherub was touching the other wall; their other wings toward the center of the house were touching wing to wing. 28He also overlaid the cherubim with gold.\n29 He carved the walls of the house all around about with carved engravings of cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers, in the inner and outer rooms. 30The floor of the house he overlaid with gold, in the inner and outer rooms.\n31 For the entrance to the inner sanctuary he made doors of olivewood; the lintel and the doorposts were five-sided. 32He covered the two doors of olivewood with carvings of cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers; he overlaid them with gold, and spread gold on the cherubim and on the palm trees.\n33 So also he made for the entrance to the nave doorposts of olivewood, four-sided each, 34and two doors of cypress wood; the two leaves of the one door were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding. 35He carved cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers, overlaying them with gold evenly applied upon the carved work. 36He built the inner court with three courses of dressed stone to one course of cedar beams.\n37 In the fourth year the foundation of the house of the Lord was laid, in the month of Ziv. 38In the eleventh year, in the month of Bul, which is the eighth month, the house was finished in all its parts, and according to all its specifications.

{"question":"What wildlife can tourists potentially encounter on both the Lemosho Route of Kilimanjaro and in the Hindu Kush mountains?","answer":"Both regions have notable wildlife, though with different species. On the Lemosho Route, tourists might encounter buffalo and elephants during the first day of trekking through the forest. In the Hindu Kush mountains, visitors might see wild goats (Siberian ibex and Markhor), wild sheep (marco sheep and urial), black and brown bears, snow leopards, vultures, and eagles.","context":["Afghanistan, officially referred to as the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, is a landlocked country in Central Asia. The country borders China, Pakistan, Iran, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and Tajikistan. Much of the country - around two-thirds - is mountainous, and a large part of the country is sparsely populated. The northern and the western part of the country have plains and valleys. The Afghani valleys are the most populated areas in the country, and most of the agriculture takes place in the region and the high plains. The climate in Afghanistan is arid to semi-arid and usually, experiences hot summer and cold winter. The highest point in the country is Noshaq with an elevation of 24,580 feet (7,492 meters) while the lowest point is Amu Darya with an elevation of 846 feet (258 meters).\nNoshaq is in the second highest point in the whole of the Hindu Kush Ranges, and has an elevation of 24,580 feet (7,492 meters). The highest peak in the Kush range does not lie wholly in Afghanistan. Noshaq lies at the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan, the northern and western sides of the mountain lie in Afghanistan while the southern and the eastern parts of the mountain are in Pakistan. The first people to summit the mountain were two Japanese climbers named Toshiaki Sakai and Goro Iwatsubo who did so in 1960, while the first Afghani to climb the mountain achieved the feat in 2009.\nKohe Shakhawr is the second highest peak after Noshaq with an elevation of 23,346 feet, and it is also within the Kush Ranges. Shar Dhar is the third highest mountain in the Hindu Kush Mountains and has an elevation of 23,091 feet (7,038 meters). The mountain sits on the boundary between Pakistan and Afghanistan\nFlora and Fauna in the Hindu Kush Mountains\nMuch of the tree cover in the middle mountains of the Hindu Kush are dominated by juniper and birch,while there are also large stands of blue pines and deodar ciders. Some of the cultivated plants include the mulberry, jujube, and walnut. Along the slopes, depending on their respective levels of shade exposure and sunny periods, are numerous pastures occasionally cultivated during the summertime by the local humans who migrate according the seasons. There is a wide variety of animal life well adapted to the mountains in the Hindus Kush, and they include the wild goats such as the Siberian ibex and the Markhor. There are also the wild sheep of the region, including the marco sheep and the urial. The black and brown bears are also found roaming the valleys and mountain sides. In the lower valleys are the snow leopard, vultures, and eagles.\nHuman development activities, especially irresponsible logging, poor farming techniques, and livestock overgrazing, have affected much of the region and have adversely affected the wildlife distribution. Still, there are efforts to foster wildlife preservation in areas that are not populated, and these have shown some success. In most of the Muslim and pagan religious sites, there are ibex horns indicating the importance of these wild goats among the communities living in the region.\nOther Major Afghan Mountains and the Durand Line\nOther exceptionally tall mountains in Afghanistan, and their respective heights in feet, include the Lunkho e Dosare (22,642), Kohe Hevad (22,470), Lugnuts-e-Barfi (22,398), Ku-e Bandaka(22,349), Gumbaza-e-Safed (22,310), and Koh-e Keshni Khan (22,162). The border between Pakistan and Afghanistan along the Hindus Kush mountain ranges is the Durand Line that has been the center of controversy and conflict between the two countries.The Durand Line is an erratic border line drawn by the British and the Afghan ruler in the 19th Century, and it has been inherited by the two countries.","|Safari Name||Lemosho (Shira) Glades Route:7-Days/6-Nights on the Mountain|\nThe Lemosho Glades route is perhaps the least used initial ascent route on Kilimanjaro, partly because of its remote location and likewise the difficult roads leading to the trailhead. The trailhead is at relatively high elevation, and thus we start slow and easy on this route. Buffalo and elephant sightings are possible on the first day trekking through the forest, and the trail is often overgrown from lack of use. The route leads up to the western edge of the Shira Plateau, and the hike across the plateau is said to be one of the most stunningly beautiful hikes in Africa. The trail merges on day three of the trek with the Shira Route (which begins near this point, at the end of the 4×4 track at the Morum Barrier Gate), and on day four merges with the Machame Route. From this point all three trails continue to Lava Tower, and then down into the Great Barranco Valley, where the Umbwe route joins steeply from the south. From here, the trail circumvents counter-clockwise around the upper slopes of the Kibo massif, over the high-desert ridges to the Karanga Valley, then to an exposed campsite set on a high ridge; Barafu (meaning literally “ice” in Kiswahili). From Barafu Camp we make our overnight attempt at Africa’s highest peak…an experience that few ever forget.\nThe route as per this itinerary is the longest distance to trek up Kilimanjaro, so fitness certainly plays a role in the enjoyment and success of this trek. We start slow, and gain altitude slowly for the first four days, then the physical and mental demands increase. The trek from Barranco to Barafu and then the overnight trek to the summit is a serious challenge due to the short amount of time to rest before the overnight summit attempt. Overall, the distance covered and the intensity of the final few days make this trek a good choice only for the experienced hiker. The many changes of scenery and spectacular hike across the Shira Plateau make this trek truly special. There are no huts on this route; the accommodation is in mountain tents and dining is in our mess tents.\nDay 1: Arusha to Moshi Town\nPick up from Arusha town or Kilimanjaro International Airport and transfer to Moshi town, which is commonly known as the gateway to Mount Kilimanjaro. Half Board accommodation at a Base Hotel in Moshi.\nDay 2: Moshi Town to Forest Camp (Mtee Mkubwa Camp):- (9,500 Ft./ 2,895 M)\n- Lemosho Trailhead (7,800 Ft./ 2,375 M) ~ Forest Camp (9,500 Ft./ 2,895 M)\nDeparture from the base hotel for Londorossi gate, where you will complete entry formalities. Then drive to the Lemosho trailhead (another hour to reach the trailhead). Upon arrival at trailhead, eat lunch, then commence through undisturbed forest which winds to the first camp, only about 3-4 hours of trekking. Overnight at Forest Camp (Mtee Mkubwa Camp)\nDay 3: Forest Camp to Shira 1 Camp:- (12,200 Ft./ 3,720M)\n- Forest Camp to Shira 1 Camp (12,200 Ft./ 3,720 M)\nOnce out of the forest, take a steep track into a Savannah of tall grasses, heather, and volcanic rock draped with lichen beards. Ascend through the lush rolling hills below the Shira plateau, finally reaching camp at the edge of the plateau, a day of 5-6 hours trekking. The view of Kibo from across the plateau is amazing.\nDay 4: Shira 1 Camp to Shira 2Camp:- (12,600Ft./ 3,950M)\n- Shira 1 Camp to Shira 2 Camp (12,600 Ft./ 3,950 M)\nFull day exploration of the Shira plateau; Trek east toward Kibo’s glaciered peak, with the option to visit the ancient collapsed Shira cone, the oldest of Kilimanjaro’s three volcanoes. Arrive at Shira 2 camp at 12,600 ft. Shira is one of the highest plateaus on earth, averaging 12,500 feet. Trekking time without the optional excursions is about 3 hours.\nDay 5: Shira 2Camp to Barranco Camp:- (12,950Ft./3,950M)\n- Shira 2 Camp to Barranco Camp (12,950 Ft./ 3,950 M)\nProceed steadily upward over expansive ridgelines of high desert to Lava Tower, for lunch. The trek is about 4 hours. Lava Tower, a 300 foot volcanic plug, marks an exposed pass at 15,000 feet. In the afternoon, descend the steep track into the Great Barranco Valley. Barranco Camp is set in a valley enclosed on three sides with the massive valley walls and the Kibo massif itself. Hanging glaciers glint in the sunshine above, amidst the eerie landscape of plants such as the giant groundsels (Senecio Kilimanjari), and the uniquely endemic Giant Lobelia. Trekking time is 6-7 hours.\nDAY 6: Barranco Camp to Barafu Camp:- (15,200Ft./4,630M)\n- Barranco Camp to Barafu Camp (15,200 Ft./ 4,630 M)\nThe day begins with a scramble up the steep ‘Barranco Wall’, then traversing up and down the slopes of valleys which have carved their way into the mountain’s southern face. Kibo’s glaciers loom above to your left and the jagged peaks of Mawenzi jut into the African sky at just under 17,000 feet straight ahead. We reach the Karanga Valley after 3-4 hours of trekking to find a hot lunch served. In the afternoon the trail turns steadily uphill. The temperature will grow colder and the landscape more sparse as we near Barafu Camp. Barafu Camp is set on a small, exposed flat area on a ridge, acting a base camp from which you will make your summit attempt at midnight tonight. Eat and drink as much as possible before retiring to your tent for rest and sleep.\nDAY 7: Barafu Camp to Uhuru Peak then Descend to Mweka Camp\n- Barafu Camp to Uhuru Peak (19,340 Ft./ 5,895 M)\n- Then descend to Mweka Camp (10,200 Ft./ 3,110 M)\nThe steaming hot drink will arrive very early on this momentous day. A midnight wake-up call is the start of a juggernaut (12-17 hours of trekking). You begin trekking at 1am. The temperatures range from just below freezing at midnight, to between 10 deg. F (-12 deg. C) to –10 F. (-23 deg. C) just before dawn at the summit. The winding path of endless switchbacks will take form and shape in the shadows of the Ratzel and Rebman glaciers at early dawn, and behind you the spires of Mawenzi will be silhouetted against the red glow of the sun from beneath the clouds.

{"question":"What are the optimal temperature conditions when comparing air drying herbs versus using a dehydrator for the drying process?","answer":"For dehydrators, the optimal temperature range is between 95 to 115 degrees Fahrenheit, or up to 125 degrees in high humidity areas. In contrast, for air drying, the temperature should remain below 105°F (40°C) for best results. Both methods require good air circulation, but dehydrators offer more precise temperature control while air drying relies on natural airflow and ambient conditions.","context":["Introduction to How To Dry Herbs:\nIf you are an avid herb grower, the best way to preserve your herbs by far is to dry them. Drying herbs is a common question that surprisingly few people can answer outright. There are several methods you can use for drying herbs that are fairly easy to do, and we will discuss a few of those drying methods here.\nHarvesting: Before we discuss drying herbs, you first need to know when the right time is to harvest them. It is believed that the very best harvesting time for most of the herbs one might grow, is during the bud stage, right before the flowers are ready to open. It is said most herbs are at their most flavorful at this point. The best time of the day to harvest is in the morning when the dew has had a chance to evaporate. This will give you the best chance to avoid having the leaves wilt. You will also want to be very careful that you don’t handle the leaves too roughly and risk bruising them.\nRinse all the herbs you have harvested in cool water and make sure to give them a gentle shake so that any excess water will be removed. We are drying herbs after all, we don’t want to start off with them soaking wet. During this step, you can take the time to remove and of the leaves that have been damaged or are otherwise imperfect. Be sure not to let the harvested herbs sit in direct sunlight or they could be ruined. Once this step is complete, you are ready to start learning how to dry herbs.\nHow To Dry Herbs with a Dehydrator:\nDrying Methods: There are several different methods you could choose from when learning how to dry herbs, all of which will get the job done if performed properly. The real decision you have is how much work you want to do and if you are willing to invest any money in equipment to do the job for you. At its simplest level, drying herbs is just a matter of putting the herbs into an area that is well ventilated with dry, warm air, until all the moisture in the leaves has evaporated.\nIf you live in a dry climate like the southwestern United States, then you have a much easier time of this process. If you live in a humid area, you have to do a little more work to get the same results. The process on drying herbs is roughly the same either way.\nDehydrator: When many people think about how to dry herbs, they think of dehydrators. Dehydrators are a fast and extremely easy method of drying herbs because they give you the ability to accurately control the temperature and also the air circulation. As a general rule of thumb, you will want to pre-heat your dehydrator to a temperature between 95 to 115 degrees, or as much as 125 degrees if you are in an area with high humidity levels.\nLay the herbs out, taking care not to overlap them as much as possible for efficient drying. Drying times will vary significantly depending on humidity and moisture level of the herbs, but you can figure roughly 1-4 hours for most leaves. When the leaves turn crumbly, they are sufficiently dried. For most specific instructions, you can try looking in the user manual for your dehydrator. Many models come with instruction on drying herbs.\nHow To Dry Herbs Through Hanging:\nHanging: Before technology became predominant, early peoples learned how to dry herbs for centuries simply by hanging them in a warm and dry location until the moisture evaporated from the leaves. While this is not as controlled of a process, it is no less an effective way of drying herbs. You can tie the herbs in small groupings and hang them, or you can “bag” them to catch any falling leaves or seed.\nJust use a plain brown paper bag and punch a few holes in the sides to allow air to circulate through it, then close off the open part of the bag with a rubber band. Hang the bags in a location that get plenty of air moving through it. The purpose of the bag is to catch any seeds or leaves that might fall off during the drying process.\nHow To Dry Herbs by the Leaf:\nLeaf Drying: Sometimes drying the leaves by themselves is better than trying to dry out entire stems, especially in high humidity locations. This is especially true with herbs such as sage, mint, or bay leaves. When drying herbs this way, it is best to choose the best leaves from the herb bunches for optimum results. Paper towels work great for this process. Lay out your leaves on the first paper towel, making sure none of the leaves are touching each other.\nCover the first layer of leaves with another paper towel, and lay out another layer of leaves. You can repeat this process several times, but you shouldn't do more than five layers of leaves or else they may not dry properly. You can use your oven for drying, but do not turn it on. With electric ranges, the light inside the oven provides enough heat to dry your herbs overnight. If you have a gas oven, the pilot light will be sufficient.\nHow To Dry Herbs with Microwaves:\nMicrowaves: Yet another interesting method on how to dry herbs is using your microwave oven. While microwaves are only good for small amounts of herbs, many models actually have specific instructions for this process in the user manual. Consult yours to see if your microwave has the capability too!\nYour herbs will be properly dried when the leaves turn crumbly when rubbed between your fingers. At this point you will want to seal up your herbs in airtight containers and store them in a cool, dark area for prolonged storage.

It is also very simple to do, in this post we will take a look at some of the ways we can dry herbs, what herbs are good for drying and what you need to be able to do it.\nIn many cases if you grown your own herbs it can make sense to dry a certain portion of them. Some herbs can get a little unruly in the garden and need cutting back fairly frequently. Drying these herbs means that whilst maintaining the plants you can preserve them for use later on when the seasons change.\nDried herbs have many uses in the kitchen and make although some of the aromatics are lost in the drying process they still add plenty of flavour to dishes. Herbs have always been dried as a means of preservation and you will still find many kitchens throughout the world where herbs are hanging in order to dry them so that they can be stored for use in the future.\nPreserving Herbs By Drying\nOut of all the ways in which we like to preserve food drying herbs has to be one of the easiest, most beginner friendly ways to start preserving food.\nThe key to this is that most herbs contain very little water, that makes drying them out very easy even if conditions are perfectly suited. Herbs will dry in most homes as long at the area where you are drying them is well ventilated. This is what makes drying herbs so simple.\nWhich Herbs Dry Well?\nIt must be said that some herbs dry better than others. Freshly picked herbs have a vibrancy that can be lost during the drying process so choosing the best herbs to dry is the key to maintaining quality.\nIn general the woodier herbs tend to dry well, herbs such as;\nHerbs that can be dried but lose some of their aromatic qualities tend to be greener leafier herbs such as;\nIf you happen to have a large harvest of herbs that you feel might not dry well then you have other options for preserving them. Herb butters, vinegar’s, oils or simply freezing will also preserve them whilst maintaining their fresh qualities.\nHarvesting And Preparing Herbs For Drying\nWhen you cut herbs or buy them you will want them to contain the maximum amount of essential oils as possible, this makes the herbs taste and smell better.\nThis point occurs in most leafy herbs just prior to blossoming. woody herbs can be cut up to 4 times in during the growing season.\nIf you are cutting your own herbs it is best to wait until a sunny morning, wait until any moisture or dew that formed overnight has evaporated and then snip the herbs. In most cases you will not need to wash your herbs, washing will actually remove some of the flavourful oils. If they are dusty or dirty though wash the herbs briefly, shake off the excess moisture and then hang them in small bunches to dry off in a warm spot.\nHerb Drying Tools\nYou really do not need a lot to dry herbs, in fact you only really need a piece of string and somewhere suitable to hang the herbs as they dry. You can make herb dry easier with a few tools of the trade and make drying a little more efficient, so take a look at some of these options.\nHerb Drying Rack\nAs I mentioned, you don’t really need a herb drying rack to dry your own herbs but it does look great, I have one hanging in my kitchen permanently and it does a good job of saving space and ensuring free flow of air around the herbs as they dry.\nHerb Drying Net\nIf you have a lot of herbs harvested and ready for drying then these collapsible nets enable you to dry herbs in bulk. At the same time the mesh construction keeps away dust and insects. It also provides a little shade from the sun if you wish to dry the herbs outside.\nAir Drying Herbs – The Best Way To Dry Herbs\nWe recommend air drying as the best way to dry your herbs as we feel it preserves the flavour and colour of the herbs the best out of all the methods.\nMost herbs contain very little water so air drying them doesn’t require much heat, it is more of a case of air flow. Water will evaporate from the leaves of the herbs at room temperature as long as the herbs have free flowing air circulate around them.\nHanging the herbs from herb drying hanger is perfect for this.\nTie the herbs into bundles with string or rubber bands and hang them upside down from a hanger. Hanging them upside down ensures the essential oils remain in the leaves making the dried herbs more flavourful.\nTraditionally air dried herbs were hung on the mantelpiece of kitchen fireplaces where the air was warm but not hot. Hanging your own herbs above a radiator will have a similar effect and ensure there is good airflow as the heat creates air current.\nFor best results make sure the air temperature remains below 105°F / 40°C, this is of course unlikely to happen in most homes.\nIf you are using a mesh hanging bag then lay the herbs out sparsely to ensure there is plenty of space around the leaves for air to dry the herbs.\nHow Long Do Herbs Take To Air Dry?\nThis method of drying herbs should not take too long at all, just a few days and the leaves will be noticeably dry and crisp.\nTo ensure you retain the best flavour it is a good practice to leave the dried herbs whole until you are ready to use them. Just before you are ready to use your herbs you can break them up into whatever dish you are preparing. Crushing the leaves before storing them will release oils that are full of flavour.\nStoring Dried Herbs\nYou will want to store dried herbs in a sealed container, away from moisture and ideally in a dark place such as a cupboard. Jars make a good container as they are clear and can be easily labelled so you know what herbs are inside.\nThere are dedicated containers for dried herbs available online with lids that have holes in so you can sprinkle the dried herbs straight from the jar."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:a43ef4d7-8732-4175-b8cf-c0605e35f141>","<urn:uuid:3d8393c1-0bb9-4636-bb8d-c3fc3133e284>"],"error":null}

Homan Avenue, North Lawndale, Chicago, Illinois|\n|Area||16 acres (6.5 ha)|\n|Built by||Thompson-Starrett Co.|\n|Architect||Nimmons & Fellows|\n|NRHP reference #||78001129|\n|Added to NRHP||June 2, 1978|\n|Designated NHL||June 2, 1978|\nThe Sears, Roebuck and Company Complex on the west side of Chicago, Illinois is where Sears, Roebuck conducted the bulk of its mail order operations between 1906 and 1993. It also served as the corporate headquarters until 1973, when the Sears Tower was completed. Of its original 40-acre (16 ha) complex, only three buildings now survive, and have been adaptively rehabilitated to other uses. The complex was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1978, at which time it still included the 3-million square foot mail order plant, the world's largest commercial building when it was completed. That building has been demolished, its site taken up by the Homan Square redevelopment project.\nThese core buildings occupy an area bounded on the north by West Arthington Street, the west by Central Park Avenue, the east by Spaulding Avenue, and the south by West Fillmore Street. The surviving buildings can be seen from Homan and West Arthington.\nSears, Roebuck was founded in 1893, and was originally headquartered in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Experiencing rapid growth, the retailer in 1895 moved its headquarters to a building on West Adams Street in Chicago, and again the following year to Fulton and Desplaines Streets. The company's rapid growth created problems with the fulfillment of orders, because it had to lease space all over the city to warehouse its products.\nIn 1904 the company purchased over 40 acres (16 ha) of land on Chicago's West Side, and embarked on one of the largest retail development projects to date. The centerpiece of the company-owned \"city within a city\" were its central administration building, a merchandise development house, and a mail order processing facility, along with a power plant to provide electricity and heat to the entire complex. Designed by Nimmons and Fellows, a local architectural firm, the complex was so large the company required city permission to build over some city streets.\nIn the 1920s extensive athletic facilities were added to the complex, as an encouragement for after-work socialization to keep employee morale high. Included were a clubhouse and tennis courts, and the Sears Department of the YMCA. Events included an annual track and field competitions, and company baseball teams.\nBy 1926, the first ground level parking lots replaced the athletic fields. This happened at the same time that a strategic shift from catalog sales to retail stores had started with easy auto travel making travel to a store more practical. By 1943 the complex had become a city within itself. Sears created their own services for effective use, much advanced beyond what was required at the time, including:\n- a company fire department, with volunteer firemen, and early use of fire sprinklers.\n- a 200,000-gallon water tank, water use and fire prevention purposes.\n- a newspaper publicity office.\n- a cafeteria – originally men and women were separated, and multiple levels of service for all employee lunch and breakfast.\n- a private bank offering services for employees on site.\nThe company's growth continued through the 20th century, and by the 1960s it was the largest retailer in the world. Changing trends in retail sales and methods led to a decline, and the company's mail order business was scaled back in 1987, moving out of these premises. The corporate headquarters had been moved in 1973 to the Sears Tower, so the complex then stood vacant. Its closure of the complex presented the city with a redevelopment problem.\nIn 1992 a non-profit partnership organized by former Sears management began to redevelop the site, now dubbed Homan Square. The mail order merchandise building was demolished (except for its main tower), and the land it occupies has been redeveloped to include new residences, retail, and a community center. Homan Square is used as an example of the gradual turn around of North Lawndale. Included in this reconstruction effort is the massive rehabilitation of the former Sears Power House, into the Charles H. Shaw Technology and Learning Center—a LEED Platinum historic renovation designed by Farr Associates.\nThe elements that survive from the early period of the Sears complex development are organized around South Homan Avenue, between West Arthington Street and the railroad tracks to the south. The merchandise tower, the only surviving element of the 3-million-square-foot Merchandise Building, is to the west, and the Power House and Administration Building are to the east. Beyond those two, fronting on West Arthington and Spaulding Avenue, is the former Merchandise Laboratory.\nSears Merchandise Building Tower\n|Sears Merchandise Building Tower|\n|Location||925 South Homan Avenue, Lawndale, Chicago, Illinois 60624|\n|Roof||76 m (249 ft)|\n|Design and construction|\n|Architect||George G. Nimmons – William K. Fellows|\nThe Sears Merchandise Building Tower is a fourteen-story structure, with a limestone base and brick walls. It is crowned by a Classical Revival top floor with round-arch windows and a modillioned cornice. It housed water tanks for firefighting on the upper levels, as well as offices and secretarial training facilities. It also housed the early broadcast facilities for WLS-AM. In 2015, it was refurbished and reopened to the public as the \"John D. and Alexandra C. Nichols Tower\". It now houses non-profit groups and offices, including a classroom on the 12th floor for the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. The Sears Roebuck plaque is still visible on top of the building.\nThe Sears, Roebuck and Company Administration Building is a broad five-story masonry building, occupying about 3/4 of the block facing West Arthington between South Homan and Spaulding. It has ornate Classical Revival detailing applied to an otherwise fairly typical Chicago School design.\nThe Power Station is a rectangular, nominally single-story, brick structure measuring 114 by 230 feet (35 m × 70 m). Its front facade is characterized by tall and large round-arch windows, with a stepped parapet above.\nMerchandise Development Laboratory\nThis building, which is an L-shaped structure six stories in height and finished in brick, housed the company's catalog printing operation from 1905 to 1926.

{"question":"What are the key differences between ITM and OTM binary options, and how do market holidays affect their trading availability?","answer":"ITM (In The Money) and OTM (Out of The Money) binary options have distinct characteristics. ITM options are more expensive (>$50), have higher probability of being in the money at expiration, high liquidity, lower potential payoff, lower potential loss, and slower price fluctuations. OTM options are cheaper (<$50), have lower probability of success, lower liquidity, higher potential payoff, higher potential loss, and rapid price appreciation. Regarding market holidays, binary options trading is affected by major U.S. market holidays in both Metals and Forex markets, including Good Friday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Day, and New Year's Day. These holidays can impact trading positions as markets either close entirely or reduce trading hours.","context":["Technical analysis is traditionally used to analyze and predict the price direction of stocks, commodities, forex pairs, indexes and other “underlying” assets. But technical analysis can be combined with binary options to develop several unique trading strategies that generate unique profit curves.\nWhich Binary Options Are We Talking About?\nFirst off, in this article we will only discuss NADEX binary options. NADEX options trade between $0 and $100 in value and allow you to select a strike price. They’re also legal and regulated in the USA. Finally, you trade directly on the exchange, as opposed to having a broker (or two) in the middle. This makes trading somewhat faster and less susceptible to front-running and broker failure. NOTE: The CBOE also has binaries on the VIX (BVZ) and S&P 500 (BSZ).\nHow To Use Technical Analysis With Binary Options\nThe first step is to decide which binary option frequency to trade. Daily and Weekly NADEX binary options are much more suited to technical analysis-based trading strategies than the hourly maturities. Technical analysis-based trading systems are designed to predict price direction, which is much easier on longer time frames. Intraday binary option models are essentially statistical gambling systems relying on time and implied volatility inputs for theoretical pricing.\nThe second step is to decide whether you want to trade Out of the Money (OTM), At the Money (ATM) or In the Money (ITM) binary options. Let’s look at these approaches:\n- OTM: Option prices are cheaper (< $50 usually), lower probability of being in the money at expiration, lower liquidity, higher potential payoff, higher potential loss, rapid price appreciation in a short period of time as underlying price approaches strike price, high sensitivity to volatility change and time to expiration. All value of the option is time value, with no intrinsic value.\n- ATM: Option prices hover around $50, roughly 50/50 chance of being in the money at expiration, high liquidity, medium potential payoff, medium potential loss, rapid price appreciation in a short period of time as underlying price approaches strike price, high sensitivity to volatility change and time to expiration. All value of the option is time value, with no intrinsic value.\n- ITM: Option prices are more expensive ( > $50, higher probability of being in the money at expiration, high liquidity, lower potential payoff, lower potential loss, price does not fluctuate much unless the underlying price comes close to the strike price. 50% of the value of the option is time value, the rest is intrinsic value.\nIf you’re new to binary options, it’s best to stick with ATM or ITM options. ITM options in particular give you much more leeway to make minor mistakes and still generate a profit or small loss. Their prices move much slower so they tend to be more forgiving to trade. They’re also pretty liquid compared to OTM options.\nThe next step is to select your underlying asset:\n- Stock Index\n- Forex pair\nNext, you need an effective technical analysis trading strategy to trigger your binary option trade decisions.\nThe main feature you want in your technical analysis trading strategy is a high win rate. Ideally, 65%+ of your trades should be winners across a large sample of historical price data, including in- and out-of-sample and walk forward testing. This high win rate is required to offset the bid-ask spreads in binary options, which can be 10% at times, plus the $0.90 trade fee from NADEX.\nThe reason we’re looking for a high trade win rate is because binary options have a fixed payout.A high trade win rate means you can accumulate many small profits and generate a solid equity curve using technical analysis to trade binary options.\nHere’s why you need a high win rate: If you pay $50 and your binary option ends in the money you get $100 – $50 = $50 in profit. You will get $50 in profit regardless of how far past the strike price the underlying price has gone. Compare that to a long vanilla option position where you can earn theoretically unlimited profits if the underlying price blows through the strike price by a wide margin. These 2 payoff charts show the fundamental difference between a binary option payoff and vanilla option payoff. Basically, the binary option will have a much lower payout, so you need a higher frequency of winning trades.\nThe next feature you want in your trading strategy is a fairly high trade frequency (3-5 trade signals per week ideally). If your system looks for patterns that appear only once a month, you won’t generate enough trades for binary options to be profitable without scaling up the size of your trades. Long term trend and breakout trading strategies (which typically have low win rates but high profit per winning trade) are not suited to binary option trading unless you are an option seller looking to profit from the loss of time value.\nExamples of high win rate trading systems include:\n- Mean Reversion\n- Gap Filler\n- Pivot Point\n- Daily Range\n- Chart Patterns (candlesticks, etc.)\n- Fibonacci Reversals\nWithout getting deeply into programming custom trading systems in Java or C#, you can use a trading model built in Excel, combined with a manual selection and trading process for the binary option. If you trade In-the-Money (ITM) options it gets easier because they don’t move as quickly.\nThe great thing about binaries is their limited loss. This reduces the need for stop loss management, because you know exactly how much you can lose at the moment you trade the option. You may choose to exit losing trades early, or let them run to expiration.\nLet’s say you trade the EURUSD binaries and use a Daily Range strategy, buying near the daily low and selling near the daily high throughout the day. Let’s assume you trade daily contracts that have a strike near the middle of the day’s range.\nLet’s say you were able to buy 2 daily options with a strike price of 1.5150 when the price dipped to 1.51 (OTM). You were also able to sell 2 daily options with a strike price of 1.5150 when the price rose to 1.5225 (OTM).\nAssuming you held the 4 options to expiration at 4:15 PM that day, you would earn something like this:\n- Buy Option #1 @ 1.51 for $32\n- Sell Option #2 @ 1.5225 for $41.50\n- Buy Option #3 @ 1.51 for $37\n- Sell Option #4 @ 1.5225 for $28.50\nDaily P&L for these trades:\n- Option #1: $100 – $32 = $68\n- Option #2: $100 – $41.50 = $58.50\n- Option #3: $100 – $37 = $63\n- Option #4: $100 – $28.50 = $71.50\nThe total risk was $139 to earn $261, for a reward-to-risk ratio of 1.88.\nBinary options can offer some interesting and potentially lucrative trading opportunities when combined with technical analysis-based trading models.","Unlike trading just individual shares of stock where investors may only execute orders during certain days and hours of the week, those who trade in the binary options arena have a much more extensive ability to trade at nearly all hours of the day or night, as well as on the weekend. When trading these financial vehicles, binary options traders may choose from a wide variety of different underlying assets on open markets worldwide – which can also help them in trading a number of assets simultaneously.\nHoliday Trading Times for Binary Option Markets\nWhile not all holidays are celebrated worldwide, there are certain markets that observe specific days by either closing entirely or by reducing their trading hours on specific dates. For example, the major holidays that are observed by both the Metals and the Forex markets in the U.S. include:\n- Good Friday\n- Memorial Day\n- Independence Day\n- Labor Day\n- Thanksgiving Day\n- Christmas Day\n- New Year’s Day\nWith this in mind – and because there are traders worldwide that access these markets on a regular basis – it is a good idea to be mindful of which holidays are celebrated by the various binary options markets, as this could have an effect on certain trading positions.\nOrganising your binary options trading schedule\nDepending on where you live and the work schedule that you have will determine when you want to trade binary options. Some markets are, however, better traded at certain times and it is good to have an idea of this before setting out your trading day. Binary options in the traditional sense simply look for opportunties where the markets will be higher or lower after a given period of time. For this reason alone it is important to know which markets are likely to be the most active and effective for your trading needs. For those traders keen on trading individual stocks or indices, this is obviously going to be during market hours. Those who already work during these hours, however, may want to consider trading a non-local market before or after work, effectively utilising the 24 hour nature of global trading. Alternatively, currencies can be traded 24 hours per day although many of these have quiet periods during the non-market hours where they have large spreads which makes them difficult to trade in the traditional way. By using binary options, however, there is still sufficient volatility to make considerable profits during these periods.\nBinary options are one of the easiest ways to trade in that they actually require no maintenance of the trade once a position has been taken. This is because the potential profit and loss has already been ascertained prior to the trade and the expiry time set. Few traders will benefit from watching the trade close unless there is the opportunity to close the position early, therefore binary options can offer an ideal “set and forget” trading system. The provision of mobile trading by many platforms also makes this increasingly possible and may significantly reduce the time required in front of the screen.\nTiming Binary Options Trades\nFor those investors who opt to specialize in certain types of underlying assets, profits may be boosted by choosing assets that overlap in terms of their available market trading hours. For example, traders who invest in just one asset may essentially be limited to only the hours of that particular asset’s market. However, in order to open up more profit potential, choosing a second asset that trades on a different exchange can allow that trader additional market trading hours – essentially leaving no dead trading periods. And, because investors are able to trade binary options on nearly any type of underlying asset, they are able to read more broad market signs, easily giving them the ability to profit 24 hours per day.\nThe Best Times to Trade Different Binary Options\nAlthough different underlying assets may trade at various times throughout the day – some even trading on 24-hour markets – there are certain periods where activity may be more or less advantageous for particular traders. For example, in many cases, trading works better when the market is ripe with activity from traders across the globe. This is because a high amount of trader activity will typically signal that there is both volatility and liquidity that is required for the underlying assets to hit their target prior to the options expiry.\nAssets that trade on various stock indices will have particular periods of high activity. Markets that are located in the United States, for instance, generally trade between 9:30 am to 4:00 pm EST. However, there are stock markets in Europe such as the Xetra Dax and the FTSE in UK that are equally important. These markets typically trade from 7:00 or 8:00 am to 3:30 or 4:30 pm GMT. Therefore, traders should be well aware of the most active market times for the particular underlying stock shares that they are trading in. This also holds true for those who are trading in the futures indices.\nLikewise, timing the currency and commodities markets is also essential for those who trade in these areas. Here, the Forex market tends to be the most active when there is an overlap in the London/New York and the London/Asian time zones.\nIn any case, once traders have mastered the available trading hours for each of the underlying assets in their focus, it is much easier to move towards potentially profitable trades in these different yet related areas."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:828b21c3-9c1a-4ff5-a494-5cee85e2caa5>","<urn:uuid:38a8aeaa-451e-4ccb-bcef-177c99c44ccb>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I'm coaching a youth basketball team. What are the differences between the 'defending the dribble drill' and the '1-on-1 full court drill' in terms of their main focus and execution?","answer":"The defending the dribble drill focuses on containing an offensive player for 8 seconds within a specific area, with the offensive player repeatedly attacking if they get through. The emphasis is on tenacious defense and preventing direct penetration to the basket. In contrast, the 1-on-1 full court drill spans the entire court length and emphasizes both offensive and defensive strategies. It specifically focuses on footwork drills for offensive agility and quickness, while defensively requiring strong defensive slides with quick and controlled lateral movements.","context":["This post is ideal for you to read if you’re planning on doing some defensive drills during your next basketball practice. And if you’re not–well, print it out for a rainy day!\nDefending the Dribble Drill\nThis drill is called the defending the dribble for eight seconds drill. The offensive player’s goals here is to take the ball as hard as he can to the basket.\nWe don’t give any fool’s gold. Fool’s gold means is if we’re working at the defensive end and the offense just goes half-speed making the defense look good, that’s fool’s gold. We don’t want to get a false sense of security of doing something right if our teammates aren’t pushing as hard.\nYou’ll see the offense win some of these battles, but what we’re trying to do is defend the dribble for eight seconds.\nIf the offensive player gets through there, instead of shooting it, he takes it back out again and comes back and attacks him again. So for about a period of eight seconds, we’re playing pretty tenacious at the defensive end.\nYou want to see a great battle of offensive talent and defensive talent.\nWith this drill and others like it, we put an emphasis on is defense. If we play defense, then we’re going to be in every game. But defense has to be played by all five that are on the court – five or six or eight more, depending on your team’s size – ready to come in and pick up the same effort.\nBasically if you’ve got heart and if you’re being taught technique, then you should be able to do a good job.\nAnd the old rule still applies: Stay between your man and the basket. We tell our players that’s why old slogans stay around, because they’re very true.\nOur goals again:“ stop penetration, challenge the shot, and screen out so that we give up no second shots. Those are our three components at the defensive end.\nHalf-Court Half-Court Drill\nOur next defensive segment starts with the ball and going hard, like the eight-second drill–except we’re going to stay in the four quadrants.\nThis drill is called half court-half court because we have to stay within the half-court setting and half of the half-court width-wise so that we’re not running into one another.\nIt’s an old drill that usually is done half-court, full court. We like the intensity that it puts in by going 47 feet.\nBoth sides will be going at the same time, partnered up. On the way back, they’ll just change assignments; one will be the offensive player, the other one’ll be the defensive player.\nYou’ll see in this drill that they have to get out of their shuffle step. They’ll need to run from time to time to regain that position of staying between them and where they’re going to.\nOne of the things we try to do in these drills is always get back to a stance where we have our shoulders square.\nWhether it’s being picked up at the wing position or initiating the offense from the point guard position, we just don’t want them to take penetration. We want them to go southeast, southwest, but not directly south to the basket.\nWing Deny One-on-One Drill\nThis drill is one-on-one from the wing position.\nThis type of drill is where we teach a lot of technique, again, keeping them between our man and the basket as well as when the offensive player goes to shoot the shot, challenging the shot. And then once the shot has been taken, to screen him out the correct way.\nThere’s a correct hand for challenging the shot. That same hand will be the correct hand for shooting it through to screen the person out.\nAnd every person does this all the way through. So there’s a thread that runs through as our theme, through each person–that they all play defense the same way, with the same intensity, and with the same technique that’s taught.\nUsually in this, we would have both sides going at the same time.\nThe reason we challenge with either hand is because it’s the closest hand to the ball.\nSo once again now, we’re preparing ourselves to guard a person with the ball in a game situation. And it’s one-on-one, where you’re just completely open to get beat by the offensive player. But if you just stick to technique, the cushion from which you distance yourself on the offensive player, then you should always be able to stay between him and the basket.\nDo you think your team will benefit from running these defensive drills during your next basketball practice?

{"question":"What is the recommended protocol for artificially rearing surplus lambs, and what steps should be taken to prevent hypothermia in these vulnerable newborns?","answer":"For artificial rearing of surplus lambs, you need to feed high-quality colostrum within the first 6 hours (210ml/kg bodyweight in 24 hours), remove lambs from mothers at 24 hours, and provide ad-lib milk replacer. Lambs should be kept in groups of maximum 25 in well-ventilated, draught-free spaces with clean bedding. To prevent hypothermia, newborns must maintain body heat production using fat reserves laid down during pregnancy. The trigger for this process comes from colostrum components. Lambs are especially vulnerable in two periods: within the first five hours after birth and after twelve hours when energy reserves deplete. Treatment varies based on rectal temperature - for temperatures between 37-39°C, provide shelter and colostrum; below 37°C, warm the lamb using a warming box with 37-40°C moving air and administer glucose solution before feeding colostrum.","context":["Managing surplus lambs\nYour scanning results will provide the first indication of how many lambs are likely to need fostering or artificially rearing. Preparing a carefully planned rearing protocol before lambing starts will be time well invested since well grown artificially reared lambs will leave an acceptable margin that can be considered a worthwhile additional income stream.\n“However, like all successful youngstock systems, surplus lamb rearing requires attention to detail, from daily cleaning of the feeding equipment to providing light airy well drained accommodation. Unless you literally have a handful of surplus lambs, then ad lib bucket or automatic machine systems will prove cost effective; both will save labour, encourage improved growth and reduce the risk of digestive upsets. These systems offer the best alternative to the ewe\", says Jackie Bradley, Volac Regional Product Manager.\nTo successfully rear surplus lambs you will need to consider a number of things. In this article, independent sheep consultant, Kate Philips outlines essential preparation, discusses which lamb to foster and offers a 10 point rearing plan.\nPrepare a suitable building or space - free from draughts, with good ventilation above lamb height and free drainage. A dark, poorly ventilated, outdated building is not acceptable. Heat lamps may be required.\n- Limit each group to 25 lambs maximum.\n- Organise feeding equipment, either bucket or machine.\n- Prepare a clean dry area for milk powder storage; check scales, mixing and cleaning equipment are all in working order.\nWhich lamb to foster?\nWhen a ewe has three lambs then the preferred option for most farmers would be wet fostering of one lamb onto a single rearing ewe. Choose the odd lamb – the small one or the largeone so that the ewe is left with a balanced pair.\nChoose the lamb by gender?\n- Consider your lamb target market; if you are selling breeding stock then think which animals have priority – ewe lambs or tup lambs. Leave the highest priority lambs with their mother\n- Gender doesn’t matter if selling all lambs finished or as stores.\n- Remember, entire ram lambs grow approximately 10% faster than castrated or ewe lambs, consequently entire males may be better suited for artificial rearing and reaching slaughter weight fastest.\nArtificial rearing guidelines\n- Every single foster lamb must be fed high quality colostrum – fuel for life, within the first six hours, and a minimum 210ml/kg bodyweight within the first 24 hours. If the ewe does not have enough colostrum then use artificial colostrum or defrosted ewe or cow colostrum.\n- Remove lambs from their mother at 24 hours and leave for a few hours to get hungry.Keep the lambs warm, draught-free and dry. Introduce gently to the teat. Machine or ad lib bucket lambs will need to be helped to suckle a few times in their first day; they learn quickly.\n- Provide ad-lib milk replacer fed cold or warm - maximum 18 - 20 C. Clean out the teats, tubes and mixing bowl and bucket daily. For ad lib bucket feeders, introduce accurately mixed milk replacer, as recommended for machines, check the calibration at least weekly and between batches of milk powder. When feeding ad-lib, it is important to make sure the milk does not run out, as this will gorging when the milk is refilled.\n- Provide quality clean straw regularly to keep bedding clean and dry throughout the rearing phase.\n- Introduce high quality creep feed ad-lib from approximately one week of age. Refreshcreep daily and never let it go stale. Clean out feeders once a week or more frequently if necessary. Never let creep feed run out.\n- Provide clean fresh straw in racks initially to provide sharp fibre to encourage rumen development. If desired, change gradually from straw to good quality hay after six weeks.\n- Provide clean fresh water daily.\n- Keep lambs inside throughout the rearing and finishing phases to avoid a growth check associated with a change in diet and facing a significant worm challenge at grass.\n- Vaccinate lambs against clostridial diseases and pasteurella as you would for the rest of the flock. Don’t cut corners and make compromises. This is a necessary measure to avert risk.\n- Wean abruptly to avoid potential digestive upsets at approximately five weeks. Weaning guidelines: minimum 2.5 times birth weight (9 - 10kg); minimum 35 days old and eating approximately 250g solid feed daily.\nSign up to our enewsletter\nWas this article useful?

They should be read together.\nTable of Contents\nMany newborn lambs die, not from disease, but from hypothermia (chilling). This is especially true in Ontario, where many ewes produce in the coldest months of the year to have lambs ready for the Easter market. Even a newborn lamb at grass in May can be vulnerable (Figure 1). By careful shepherding of the ewe from conception to delivery, and the perinatal care of the new born lamb, many deaths can be avoided.\nFigure 1. Straw bales can provide good shelter for lambs at grass.\nTo maintain its body temperature, the newborn lamb must produce as much heat as it is losing to the environment. If the lamb cannot do this, its body temperature will start to fall, and, if not remedied, lead to death. The rate of heat loss is influenced by several external factors:\nFigure 2. The effect of wind, environmental temperature and wetness on heat loss in newborn lambs. [From Alexander, G. (1962), Australian Journal of Agricultural Research, 13, 82-99.]\nThe heat production mechanism uses the fat reserves, mainly brown fat, laid down during pregnancy and oxygen to produce energy and heat. The starter for these processes is a component of the colostrum. The lamb must nurse the ewe within a few minutes of birth.\nThe producer can influence many of these factors by:\nThis may mean using some form of oestrus synchronization at the breeding season to concentrate lambings into a short time period and to reduce the labour requirements.\nLamb birth weight is influenced by placental size early in pregnancy. By ensuring correct nutrition in the early stages of pregnancy, good placental development can be assured.\nTo maintain body heat after birth, the lamb must use its' own energy reserves to generate heat. This energy reserve is mainly brown fat stores laid down in pregnancy. With oxygen these are converted to energy plus heat. The trigger to start this process is a component of the ewe's colostrum. The fat reserves are limited, and must be complimented by a steady supply of milk from the ewe; the lamb must be suckling regularly in the critical first days after birth to maintain its energy reserves.\nAdequate fat reserves at birth for the lamb are derived from the ewe via the placenta during the last half of pregnancy. Ewe nutrition in this period is critical. Not only are the reserves being laid down, but the lamb is rapidly developing. Poor nutrition will result in a small, weak lamb at birth with little internal body fat. This lamb is already at risk, but being weak it will not nurse quickly and may be slow to start breathing. Being oxygen deficient and lacking the \"kick start\" from colostrum, heat and energy production will be low; the lamb will rapidly become hypothermic. This occurs within the first five hours after birth.\nTwelve hours or more into life, a lamb is again vulnerable. Soon after birth the heat mechanism was working but now the energy reserves are used up. The lamb is not able to replace these reserves from the ewe; heat production slows and again the lamb becomes hypothermic. This time the cause is starvation; inadequate milk from a ewe that is feeding another lamb, has chronic mastitis with little milk, or was inadequately fed during late pregnancy.\nThe only accurate way to recognize hypothermia is by taking the lambs rectal temperature (Table 1). Use a thermometer that measures subnormal body temperatures (many clinical thermometers do not go low enough). Many of the electronic thermometers do and are more robust for the barn than the traditional mercury/glass versions. The lower the rectal temperature, the more severe the hypothermia.\nThe rectal temperature of a dull weak lamb, that seems unable or unwilling to suckle, should be checked immediately. The sooner remedial action can be taken, the better are the lamb's chances of survival. The normal rectal temperature for a new born lamb is between 39°C and 40°C.\nThe basis of treatment of the hypothermic lamb is to warm it up and provide a source of energy to start heat production again. Treatment varies with the degree of hypothermia as indicated by the rectal temperature (Figure 3).\nThe lamb's rectal temperature is between 37°C and 39°C. The lamb is weak but may be able to stand. It should be moved into shelter, dried off if wet, and fed colostrum by stomach tube.\nTable 1. The appearance and behaviour\nof hypothermic newborn lambs.\nUsing a stomach tube is comparatively simple. The operator sits with the lamb restrained on the lap. The tube is passed into the side of the mouth in the space between the front and side teeth (Figure 4). Using gentle pressure, the tube is slid into the oesophagus and down to the stomach (Figure 5). The tube will move easily, any resistance or coughing indicates that the tube has entered the windpipe. It should be removed immediately. The accidental passing of colostrum into the lungs will result in the death of the lamb with an aspiration pneumonia.\nFigure 4. Using the stomach tube.\nFigure 5. Lamb with stomach tube into stomach.\nFigure 6. Stomach tube in place before attaching syringe with colostrum.\nSmall lambs, under 1.5 kg (3 lbs) at birth, may not have sufficient fat reserves to initiate heat production, even with colostrum. These can be fed an equivalent amount of 20% dextrose solution by stomach tube as an energy source (Figure 6).\nThe lamb can stay with the ewe provided she is in a sheltered area. The lamb should be watched to ensure that it is suckling. Once the rectal temperature has returned to normal, it and the ewe can be returned to the flock.\nOnce the rectal temperature falls below 37°C more radical treatment is required. There are two parts to this treatment:\nThe lamb should not be given colostrum until it has been revived; the rectal temperature must be above 37°C.\n1. Reversing The Hypoglycaemia\nThe blood glucose of this lamb will be low. A 20% dextrose solution at a dose rate of 10 mL/kg body weight is injected into the abdominal cavity (intra peritoneally). The site for the injection is about 2 cm (1 in.) below the navel and 2 cm (1 in.) lateral to the midline (Figure 7). Use a large (60 cc) syringe and a 20 or smaller gauge 1 inch needle, inserted at 90° to the body wall. This is the injection site. Ask your veterinarian to show you how to do it. The internal organs will be pushed away by the needle and not damaged. Both the conscious and comatose lamb can be injected in this manner. Only the lamb able to swallow should be fed by stomach tube.\nFigure 7. The site of intra peritoneal injection of glucose solution as indicated by the syringe.\nHow to make up 20% dextrose solution\nCalculate total amount needed and multiply this by 0.4 to determine how much 50% solution to use. Example: 5 kg x 10 mL/kg = 50 mL of 20% solution needed. 50 mL x 0.4 = 20 mL of 50% solution. Draw this amount into syringe. Then draw up the difference as boiling water. This solution will be close to body temperature.\nThe lamb also needs to be slowly warmed to restore body temperature. The best method is to use a \"warming box\" where the lamb is placed in a container heated by warm (37°C-40°C) moving air (Figure 8). Always use a warm air heater rather than the more severe heat lamp at this stage. The rectal temperature should be checked every 30 minutes to avoid overheating above the normal rectal temperature (hyperthermia). Once the lamb's rectal temperature has reached 37°C, it should be removed from the warmer, given a feed of colostrum by stomach tube, then returned to the ewe, or, if it is still weak, placed in an \"aftercare\" unit (Figure 9). Do not return the lamb to the ewe unless it is strong enough to nurse unaided. The aftercare unit has individual compartments for each lamb, with a heat lamp overhead.\nFigure 8. Warming box.\nFigure 9. Aftercare unit.\nOnce the lamb's rectal temperature has reached 37°C, its heat production system should be restarted with colostrum. Give colostrum by stomach tube at 50 mL/kg body weight. Usually there is little problem with the ewe refusing the lamb after treatment.\nEwe's colostrum is obviously the best, but cow colostrum can be used. Collect and freeze the colostrum in 500 mL batches. Thaw it in a water bath at 35°C, never in a microwave as this will denature the complex proteins in the colostrum.\nAs in all conditions, prevention is the best cure for hypothermia. Good nutrition during gestation, good lambing quarters, observation of the ewe and lamb at lambing and assisting where necessary, will go a long way to preventing lamb losses from hypothermia.\nFigure 3.

{"question":"What are the most effective carbohydrate strategies for endurance sports, and how should nutrition timing be adjusted during multi-game tournaments?","answer":"For endurance sports, carbohydrate needs range from 3-5 grams per pound of body weight, comprising 45-55% of daily caloric intake. This can increase to 70% during carbo-loading three days before a long race. For multi-game tournaments, nutrition timing is crucial: eat a low-fiber, high-carb breakfast with some protein 1.5 hours before the first game, use sports drinks during games for hydration and energy, and consume easily digestible carb-rich foods between games if there's a 2-hour break. In both scenarios, post-activity nutrition is critical within 20-30 minutes - chocolate milk or recovery drinks work well, followed by a balanced meal combining carbohydrates, protein, and fat.","context":["I'm preparing to start training for my first half and I'm concerned about getting the right amount of carbs during training. I'm hoping maybe you could give me a few tips on how to better satisfy my carbohydrate needs.\nYou are wise to consider and plan ahead for your nutritional needs when ramping up your running schedule. While it’s usually pretty easy to acquire adequate carbohydrates in one's diet, in order to ensure high-quality nutrition for running, planning is best. Carbohydrates receive a lot of press within the running community because they are the primary fuel source for energy production, which is what allows us to move. When carbohydrates are stored in our muscles and liver, it is referred to as glycogen. Distance training enlarges glycogen stores and increases their storage capacity allowing glycogen to provide much of the energy necessary for running long distances, hence the importance of carbohydrates to a runner. On average, runners can store enough glycogen to supply about 1800 to 2000 calories and, on average, one mile burns about 100 calories. Therefore, glycogen stores can become depleted about mile 18 or 20, which is good news for half-marathoners! When these glycogen stores are depleted, it means there is no immediate fuel source for our muscles. Without a fuel source, we hit the dreaded \"wall.\" Typically, half-marathoners do not have to worry about hitting the wall since 13.1 miles is well within the glycogen storage capacity of most runners; however, it can happen. Therefore, it's always best to go into even a half-marathon well fueled.\nCalculating your carbohydrate needs depends primarily upon your body weight and activity level, so the first thing you need to do is weigh yourself. Next, decide whether you have a high or more moderate activity level- your activity level may change as you increase your long runs to the half-marathon distance. Then, the general rule of thumb formula is about 3 to 5 grams of carbohydrate per pound of body weight. Use the lower end of this range if you have a small frame and are running minimal mileage, and use the upper end of this range if you have a larger frame and/or are running higher mileage. For example, a small person running short weekly mileage would need about 3 to 4 grams of carbohydrate per pound of body weight; a large person running high mileage would need about 4 to 5 grams. Bagels, breads, rice, and pastas are popular runner carbohydrate foods. However, keep in mind that fruits, vegetables, beans, legumes, and dairy products are also good carbohydrate sources. A half-cup of rice or pasta contains about 15 grams of carbohydrates, one serving of a dairy product has about 12 grams, and one serving of vegetables provides about 5 grams of carbohydrates.\nCarbohydrates should comprise about 45 to 55 percent of your total daily caloric intake. If your average daily caloric intake is 2000 calories, then about 900 to 1100 of those calories should come from carbohydrates. Eating high quality complex carbohydrates, like 100 percent whole wheat bread, will provide many other nutrients and fiber too as opposed to eating highly processed carbohydrate foods, like white bread. For three days leading up to a long distance race, you can increase your carbohydrate intake to as much as 70 percent of your daily caloric intake. This is referred to as carbohydrate loading, or carbo-loading for short. The carbo-loading phase helps to replenish muscle glycogen for increased energy during the race. Your daily total caloric intake stays about the same because protein and fat intake are decreased slightly to accommodate for the increased amount of carbohydrates.\nIt is important to feed your tired muscles as soon as you can after a run, ideally within 20 to 30 minutes. Research indicates that some running injuries, like tendonitis, may be the result of inadequate post-run nutrition. Picture your fatigued muscles at the end of a strenuous workout resembling a dried up sponge. As you re-hydrate and re-fuel, muscles soak up nutrients and fluids and soon become more like a new, soft, and pliable sponge. The hard part about re-fueling is that runners often don’t feel like eating for several hours after a strenuous workout. This is where recovery drinks can be especially helpful because they are properly formulated for refueling fatigued muscles and they are easy to get down. A simple, low-tech alternative drink for replenishing after a run is low-fat chocolate milk. Recovery drinks or low-fat chocolate milk provide the right blend of protein, carbohydrate and fat for depleted muscles. Ingest one of these drinks within the 20 to 30 minute post-run time frame and then eat a meal as soon as you can. For your post-run meals, always blend carbohydrate, protein and fat. Options like a turkey or tuna sandwich on whole wheat bread or eggs and pancakes fit this combination.\nAs you focus on consuming enough carbohydrates to fuel your running, don't neglect your protein intake. Your body also needs adequate protein for repairing and rebuilding muscle tissue too, so be certain to include a protein source at each meal along with your carbohydrates.\nAll the best,\nSusan S.

NOTE: Due to the volume of mail, we regret that we cannot answer every email.\nHalf-marathon training plans","By: Heather R Mangieri, MS, RD, LDN, Sports Dietitian\nFinish First Sports Performance Nutrition Advisor\nOne of the most important times to be at the very top of your game, both physically and mentally is during the final period of a game or during the final game of an all-day tournament. Not having the right nutritional game plan in place leads to both mental and physical fatigue and can ultimately lead to decreased performance or injury.\nWhen you are faced with multiple competitions in the same day, it is important to meal plan so that optimal energy needs are met. To do this, it is imperative that you start the day with a full tank of gas and use your breaks between games to refuel and rehydrate. Use the following tips to help you to be prepared on your competition day:\n- Practice how you will fuel on game day prior to your tournament day. Training is not only a time to work on strength and conditioning your muscles but also a time to train your muscles how to use fuels. You do not want to try a new food on the day of your competition only to find out that it does not agree with you. If a food gives you an upset stomach, it is much better to find that out ahead of time.\n- If you do not already have one, invest in a small insulated cooler and a few ice packs so that all of your foods and beverages can be packed and taken with you. This way you can be sure that you will have adequate foods and drinks to keep yourself well-fed and well hydrated if no other source of energy is available.\n- Pay attention to your pre-competition meal! Make sure to eat a real breakfast no later than 1 ½ hours before your first game. This meal should be low fiber, low fat, and high carbohydrate with a little protein. Some examples include:\n◘ English muffin with 1 TBSP peanut butter, jelly or jam and 1 banana.\n◘ 2 slices raisin toast with jelly, 2 egg whites and 1 whole egg, ½ cup orange juice\n◘ 1 ½ cup cereal (lower fiber is typically better tolerated, corn flakes, rice krispies, cheerios) with 1 cup skim or 1% milk, 1 nectarine\n◘ Bagel with 1 Tbsp peanut butter, 1 cup skim or 1% milk\nRemember, everyone’s GI tract is different. Practice is an important part of food selection for game day.\n- Before your first game and during the game, stick to liquids to stay hydrated and keep from feeling too full. Drink water initially, and then switch to a sports drink like Gatorade about 20 minutes before the game. Continue drinking sports drinks when possible during the game. If you know when your breaks will be, it is a great idea to schedule drink breaks. This helps you to remember to rehydrate. Staying hydrated not only keeps you energized but also keeps you mentally focused.\n- Between games it is vital that you refuel and rehydrate. The quicker you can take in some carbohydrates after your first game, the more energized and recovered you will be for the upcoming events. If you only have ½ hour prior to your next event or competition, be sure to utilize sports drinks to obtain adequate carbohydrates. The last thing you want to do is start your next game with a stomach full of undigested food. If your next game is 2 hours away, than start eating solids. A carbohydrate rich meal will be your best success at obtaining more energy. You will want to switch back to liquids (Gatorade) as you get closer to the start of the game. Some examples of easily digested between meal foods are:\n◘ 2 slices of bread with 2 slices turkey, banana\n◘ Dried fruit\n◘ Cereal with milk\n◘ Yogurt with fruit\n◘ Fig Newton with low-fat chocolate milk\n- After the tournament, refuel your muscles and rehydrate your body! Eat a high carbohydrate snack that includes a little protein within 30 minutes of finishing your tournament. Even if you plan on going out to eat after your game, it is important to get carbohydrates and a little protein into your body within 30 minutes so that you can start the recovery process immediately. Some examples of easy snacks or beverages to meet this immediate need are:\n◘ 1 cup chocolate milk\n◘ Sports drink with a 4:1 ratio carbohydrate to protein\n- Within the next 1 ½ -2 hours, eat a full meal that including carbohydrates, protein and a little fat. If you have practice, games or a continuation of the competition on the following day, you may need to include an additional evening meal to assure adequate glycogen (stored carbohydrate) for the next day’s events."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:8100be08-2f76-483f-931c-3beac1b83da4>","<urn:uuid:963a0b91-6fe0-4eb4-8472-65dd56e8d581>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What similarities exist between Texas and Utah's evidence-based substance abuse prevention strategies in terms of their program evaluation and reporting systems?","answer":"Both states emphasize data-driven, evidence-based approaches to substance abuse prevention. The Texas School Survey provides detailed data analysis through three types of reports: an Executive Summary with comparative graphics, Local Survey Results with substance use details, and State Results for comparison. Similarly, Utah relies on systematic evaluation through the National Registry of Evidence-Based Programs and Practices (NREPP) and requires programs to meet strict scientific standards of effectiveness. Both states use their survey results to inform policy-making and measure the effectiveness of current prevention programs, with findings being used to guide resource allocation and program implementation.","context":["Participate in the Texas School Survey\nFor Schools & School District Staff, School Boards, PTAs\nKnowing trends and attitudes in your district helps define the prevention strategies and helps prevention and treatment organizations have up-to-date information for grant applications and target most effective strategies, as well as measure the effectiveness of current investments in prevention programs, tools and resources.\nThe Texas School Survey of Drug and Alcohol Use has been conducted in Texas school districts since 1988. The survey is conducted by the Public Policy Research Institute (PPRI) at Texas A&M University on behalf of the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS).\nA statewide survey is conducted every two years. These statewide assessments generate current data to inform state level policy-making. In addition, they can provide a standard of comparison for districts conducting local surveys.\nTexas School Survey FAQs\nWhat formats are available for the Texas School Survey?\nThe Texas School Survey is offered in two formats: (1) the traditional paper-pencil version where a student darkens an oval for a corresponding answer and (2) an online web version. Both versions are identical in the number and types of questions. The two versions are offered in English and Spanish.\nWhy give the Texas School Survey?\n- The Texas School Survey provides state and local agencies with data to quantify local drug and alcohol use, as well as provide guidance on the best means to address the problem. Questions assess where the students get most of their information on drug and alcohol use and where they say they would turn for help with a substance problem. These data help identify which sectors of the community can most effectively unite to combat student substance use.\n- It produces factual data to replace speculative and sensational information.\n- At the community level, the survey helps estimate the extent to which student substance use is primarily a “school problem.” Some research indicates that much drug and alcohol use is centered not in the schools, but instead takes place after school hours and away from school grounds.\n- Administered over an extended period of time, the survey is an effective tool to evaluate the impact of special substance abuse prevention and education programs.\nWhat do you get when you use the Texas School Survey?\nCompensation. Schools selected to participate in the statewide sample will receive monetary compensation for time and effort involved in survey administration. This payment will be made when survey administration is complete and all materials are returned.\nSurvey Administration Materials. All materials needed for survey administration will be shipped to your campus or district.\nState Report. Participating schools will receive a copy of the State Report.\nData Analysis. PPRI produces three types of reports:\n- Executive Summary and Comparative Graphics. A brief Executive Summary of local results, contrasted to statewide data, is presented. The report includes figures and graphics comparing local and state results that can easily be converted into overheads for use in press releases or presentation to school boards or community groups.\n- Local Survey Results. Includes a series of General Substance Tables detailing the use of tobacco, alcohol, illicit drugs, and inhalants among the local student population, and ones that illustrate environmental and behavioral factors related to substance use. Also includes Prevalence Tables that compare substance use by gender, ethnicity, academic performance, and other student characteristics.\n- State Results. Up-to-date comparative data from the most recent assessment of substance use among the public school-age population in Texas. The results are presented in a format identical to that found in the local report.\n*Schools selected in the statewide sample will receive a copy of the statewide report as part of their contribution to the study. District level reports and Executive Summary reports with comparative graphics are also available for an additional cost. School districts participating in their own local level assessment will receive these three reports as part of their paid participation in the study. Please contact the PPRI Survey Coordinators if you would like to receive more information about this option.\nWhat kinds of questions does the Texas School Survey answer?\nThe Texas School Survey begins by asking for demographic information such as age, gender, race, grade, and so forth. The remaining questions address three basic issues.\nDrug and Alcohol Use Patterns:\n- What types of drugs and alcohol are students using?\n- How much do they typically consume, and how often?\n- How old are the students when they first use drugs and alcohol?\n- How easy is it to get drugs and alcohol?\n- Where do the students usually get alcoholic beverages?\n- What substances do students say their close friends use?\nDrug and Alcohol Related Behaviors:\n- How often do students drive after using drugs or alcohol?\n- How often are drugs and alcohol used at parties?\n- How often do students attend class high?\n- How often do students report “skipping” or “cutting” school?\n- Where do the students get most of their information about drugs and alcohol?\n- Who would students turn to if they needed help?\n- How many students in your district have actually sought help for a substance use problem?\n- What do parents think about their children drinking beer or using marijuana?\nWhat grades can take the Texas School Survey?\nThe Texas School Survey is designed for students in grades 6 through 12.\nHow long does the survey take?\nThe survey takes about 30 minutes to complete. An additional 10 to 15 minutes should be allowed for handing out and taking up the instruments (or online survey tokens) and for reviewing instructions. It can easily be completed in a single class period.\nIs Parental Notification required?\nSchools/Districts taking part in The Texas School Survey of Drug and Alcohol Use are required to notify parents of the survey and its general contents prior to survey administration. This notification MUST include the “Information Sheet” that has been provided. Ideally, these forms should be mailed to parents to ensure proper dissemination, but it is up to each school/district to decide how such matters are to be handled.\nThe Institutional Review Board for Human Subjects at Texas A&M University has waived the requirement to document parental assent/consent, but does require that the “Information Sheet” be distributed to parents and that the students are read the information in the classroom informing them that participation is completely voluntary.\nEither the parents of students or the students themselves have every right to NOT participate in the Texas School Survey. Each participating school/district is responsible for having a mechanism in place to accommodate those students who will not be participating in the survey. Either the Campus Coordinator or the teacher will need to keep track of students for whom either the parents or the students themselves choose not to participate in the survey.\nIf your school/district is making use of US Department of Education funds (e.g., Safe and Drug Free School programs) to pay for the Texas School Survey, the school/district may be required to obtain informed consent from parents/guardians. In addition, there may be other circumstances that require your school/district to use informed consent and, if so, it is up to the district to obtain and document such consent.\nIf you have any questions, or are unclear as to these requirements, please call 979-845-1922 or send an email to firstname.lastname@example.org.\nAre surveys and parent consent forms available in Spanish?\nYes, Spanish surveys are available upon request. Each school will be provided with an “Information Sheet” (Parental Notification Letters) in English and Spanish to notify parents of the survey and its general contents prior to survey administration.\nIs it necessary to survey all students in every grade level, or are sampling services available?\nParticipating campuses are requested to survey 8 classrooms per grade level. If your campus has fewer than 8 classrooms per grade level, then you are requested to sample all students.\nWhat is required from a campus in order to select a representative sample of 8 classrooms per grade level?\nFor the Texas School Survey to be administered in your school/district, PPRI will need to randomly select classes for participation in the study. The random selection process will allow us to generate survey results that are representative of the student population within your school/district. Detailed instructions for completing this master list are noted below.\n- If you are surveying students at an individual school only, you will need to provide a master list of classes for the specific grade levels contained at your school (only grades 6-12 are eligible to participate).\n- If you are surveying students at the district level, you will need to provide a master list of classes at each district campus with grades 6-12.\n- For schools conducting the survey via paper pencil, choose either a class period (i.e. 1st, 3rd) in which all students are present or a subject (i.e. English, Science) in which all students must be enrolled; for schools conducting the survey online, choose only a subject (i.e. English, Science) in which all students must be enrolled.\n- List all teachers for that class period or that subject.\n- List the number of students per grade level in each of those classes.\n- List the class period, regardless of whether class period or subject was selected.\nNote: The Survey Coordinator will receive a guide (Sampling Guide for Survey Administration) and a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet titled Sampling Template. Please refer to this guide when completing the template.\nOnce the spreadsheet is complete, a district will submit it electronically to: email@example.com. PPRI will randomly pick entire classes until we reach the target numbers per grade level for the sample. Then, we’ll send a Master List of those classes randomly selected to be surveyed in order for the Parental Notification Letters to be sent home to the parents of students in the selected classes.\nWhen will survey results be available?\nPPRI expects the report to be distributed to schools in the fall following the survey administration year.\nWhat other optional services are available?\nThe Texas School Survey has a number of other optional services available for a fee.\nCustomized Survey Questions. Additional items can be added to the survey to address questions of specific interest to individual schools. These additional questions can be cross-analyzed with existing survey items. Initial cost for this service is $300 with an additional cost of $10 per supplemental question. (Note: supplemental questions should not stray too far from the subject of substance use and related behaviors, and must be approved by the Principal Investigator for the project.)\nSupplemental questions are limited to a total of 30. A grid will appear on the last page of the survey instrument for such questions. Each question can have up to ten responses (a.-j.).\nExtra copies.

The overall goal of substance abuse prevention and intervention is to promote healthy brain, body and social development by preventing the onset of illegal substance use and limiting the problematic behaviors associated with substance abuse.\nUtah Substance Abuse Prevention Guiding Principles are criteria established by the Utah Division of Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) to be used in selecting or developing substance abuse prevention programming. Utah promotes proactive, evidence-based prevention education which is designed to eliminate any illegal use of controlled substances.\nThere is a multitude of effective substance abuse prevention interventions that may have different areas of focus and can be implemented in a variety of settings. Interventions can involve the family, school, and community and may provide substance abuse prevention for an individual or a population of youth by focusing on environmental and community factors and policies, developmental factors, or skill development. The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) has identified 16 key principles for prevention programs based on risk and protective factors, the type of program, and the delivery of the program.\nStructure, content, and delivery are the core elements of effective research-based programs that NIDA suggests can help to address the key principles, and should be considered when determining what kind of prevention program is best for individuals and your community.\nPrevention programs have proven to be effective, but families and influential adults continue to play the most important role in determining how youth handle the lure of alcohol, cigarettes, misuse of prescription drugs, and illegal drugs. More recent studies have shown that parents and guardians (and adults influential in a youth's life) who speak to their children about the issues and have dinner with them on a regular basis, have children with a lower rate of use and abuse. Prevention programs can help to support family/mentoring relationships by providing parenting/mentoring skills and communication strategies.\nIntervening early-before high school-is critical. The data suggest that patterns of substance abuse become worse in the high school years. Individuals who begin using alcohol or tobacco when they are very young are more likely to abuse them later in life, when it becomes much more difficult to quit.\nIdentifies youth violence, delinquency, and drug prevention and intervention programs that meet a strict scientific standard of program effectiveness.\nNational Registry of Evidence-Based Programs and Practices (NREPP)\nSubstance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA)\nA searchable database of more than 330 interventions for the prevention and treatment of mental and substance use disorders.

{"question":"What role do professional specialists play in business valuations and cyber risk analysis?","answer":"Professional specialists are crucial in both areas. For business valuations, certified appraisers affiliated with organizations like the American Society of Appraisers assess business value for a fixed fee, as most business owners lack the expertise to do it themselves. In cyber risk analysis, establishing a relationship with a cybersecurity firm is advantageous as they can provide unbiased third-party security assessments of a target company's cyber risk profile, rather than relying solely on target-provided data.","context":["Small business valuations: What you need to know\nEducate yourself on appraisals before you sell your company.\nYou may think you know the value of your business after years of paying bills and tracking bank statements, but even the savviest entrepreneurs should get a professional appraisal before selling.\n\"Most business owners don't have the expertise to do it on their own,\" says Teresa Hoffman, ASA1 and Senior Business Appraiser at Wells Fargo. \"It's easy to measure hard assets, but an appraiser can understand the intangible assets: the value of your workforce, patents, customer lists, and procedures.\"\nBefore you put your small business on the market, enlist a reputable appraiser and learn about valuation methods.\nUse an experienced specialist for a business valuation\nCertified appraisers, such as professionals affiliated with the American Society of Appraisers, will assess a business' value for a fixed fee, the amount of which depends on the complexity of the engagement. Ask appraisers for references and check certifications to ensure the candidate has the appropriate experience.\n\"How long have they been doing valuations? If the appraiser does not perform business valuations on a regular basis, he or she may not be up-to-date on current valuation approaches and methods,\" says Hoffman.\nStart your business valuation early on\nDon't be afraid of getting valuations too early. Typically, the business is the owner's most significant financial asset, and understanding its value is critical for proper planning. \"There could be a disconnect between what the owner thinks the business is worth and how the market values it,\" says Hoffman. \"If [the owner] know[s] there's a disconnect earlier, that will help with the owner's retirement and estate planning.\" An appraiser can always update his or her valuation later. If the value isn't what you expect, you'll want time to adjust, especially if the sale of your business is intended to help fund your retirement. The cost for an updated valuation is typically a fraction of the original cost. By hiring the same appraiser to do annual valuations — often at a discount because of the frequency — business owners can track over time how much their business may be worth.\nUnderstand business valuation methods\nThe three approaches to business valuations are:\nAsset approach. This approach is based upon the concept that the value of the company is equal to the value of its tangible assets — including receivables, inventory, machinery, equipment, and real estate — and subtracts liabilities. It is generally appropriate if the value of the business is closely tied to the value of the assets – such as a real estate holding company. However, this approach could undervalue a company with significant intangible assets, such as trade name, customer lists, internally developed technology and processes, and workforce in place. The intangible assets are generally captured under the two remaining valuation approaches.\nMarket approach. This approach values a company by applying observable market data to metrics of the subject company. Typically, market data will consist of valuation multiples, such as a price-to-earnings multiple, for publicly traded firms in the same industry as the company being valued. In another method, the appraiser may obtain data on transactions for companies in the same industry. These multiples are then applied to the metrics of the subject company to determine the value. The market approach is best-suited for situations in which the company operates in an industry with several publicly traded firms or where transactions involving similar companies can be identified.\nIncome approach. For any investment, the ultimate question is what is the return on the investment? The income approach works well for helping to determine the return on investment since it relies upon the expected net cash flow – gross cash flow minus expenses – that a company is expected to generate. \"Because of this 'cash is king' maxim,\" says Hoffman, \"the income approach is almost always an appropriate valuation method.\"\nYour appraiser should consider all of these methods when doing your valuation, but he or she may not use every one. \"A tech company, for example, probably wouldn't use the asset approach because that type of business doesn't have a lot of tangible assets,\" Hoffman says. \"And with the market method, sometimes you just can't find companies that are comparable to the one you are valuing. But a good appraiser will tell you why he or she didn't use a certain approach.\"\n1 Teresa Hoffman has Accredited Senior Appraiser (ASA) designation.\nWells Fargo Private Bank and Wells Fargo Wealth Management provide products and services through Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and its various affiliates and subsidiaries.\nWells Fargo & Company and its affiliates do not provide legal advice.

Data breaches and cyber vulnerabilities can certainly be a deal breaker in today’s M&A environment. It is essential for acquirers to gain a clear understanding of their target’s cyber risk profile. A holistic analysis of the target company’s cyber environment will help firms uncover cyber vulnerabilities, evaluate how cyber activity impacts value and mitigate risks to close the deal with peace of mind.\nA cyber vulnerability assessment can help acquirers uncover risks they could inherit from an acquisition. It’s important to understand the threats your target is facing and the risk controls they currently have in place to determine areas of vulnerability.\n- External Threats – Cybercriminals are becoming more adept at their craft each day. It’s vital to understand how external parties can infiltrate the target company’s cyber network. The most common tactic is social engineering. Through savvy email tricks, like impersonating executive leaders or financial personnel, cybercriminals can manipulate employees into granting them access to company networks. After the network has been compromised, cybercriminals can spread malware, ransomware and other malicious viruses to shut down a network or extract sensitive data to sell on the black market.\n- Internal Threats – Current and former employees represent the top source of security incidents, over hackers and competitors. Taking a look at the company’s culture, employee engagement and turnover can give the acquirer a keen insight into potential internal threats.\n- Existing Relationships – Let’s not disregard vendors, contractors and organizations the target currently does business with. These relationships may present significant cyber liability to a firm’s fund if not assessed and treated properly. Third parties that handle sensitive data, personally identifiable information, protected health information, or payment/credit card information should be examined under the same scrutiny as the target company.\n- Risk Controls – Once the threats have been assessed, an analysis of the target company’s current cyber risk controls will determine their security strengths, weaknesses and vulnerability gaps. Understanding how a company protects its data and intellectual property on the front end is mission critical. Some key questions to ask include, but certainly are not limited to:\n- Are they utilizing enterprise awareness training to control social engineering?\n- What kind of data are they storing and how?\n- Does the company handle Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or Protected Health Information (PHI)? If so, what safeguards are in place to protect it?\n- On what basis does the company grant access to its users? Are they using multifactor authentication?\nEvaluating a target’s true value is an essential part of any M&A transaction. As cyber events and integration issues come into focus, the costs associated with each can lead to drastic changes in a target’s true value. A cyber assessment may uncover an existing breach that requires significant costs to adequately recover. In addition, you may realize deal value should be less because of the necessary investment in cybersecurity resources.\n- Breach History – It is paramount to obtain and understand the details of any historical data breaches or significant cyber events that have impacted your target. On average, US companies identify they’ve been hacked 200 days after a breach. It’s not uncommon for a significant threat to surface only after the deal has concluded. Thus, it’s critical to verify the target company’s contractual obligations before closing!\n- Synergy and Implementation – Confidence in prevailing controls is key. However, determining how these controls will integrate into the target company’s systems and protocols should not be overlooked. Aligning cyber capabilities can be extremely costly which could significantly decrease the value of a deal. Navigating cyber integration through a transition service agreement (TSA) is ideal, as it would contractually obligate the target to provide infrastructure support after the transaction closes.\nMitigating risks and gaining confidence in the target’s systems will allow you to close the deal with peace of mind.\n- Partnership – Establishing a relationship with a cybersecurity firm can be advantageous for frequent acquirers. Rather than relying on target-provided data, obtaining a third-party security assessment will equip you with an unbiased analysis of the target’s cyber risk profile.\n- Identify, Quantify, and Indemnify – Once the issues are identified, your solutions must be quantified and worked back into the deal. This presents a grand opportunity for the acquirer to shift responsibility back to the seller or request that a portion of the seller’s proceeds is dedicated to remediation efforts.\nThe frequency and extent of high-profile cyberattacks reported by the media demonstrates the inherent cyber risks all organizations face. Implementing a cyber risk analysis in the due diligence phase of an acquisition is critical for understanding a target company’s cyber risk profile. Consult a BKS commercial risk advisor to help you identify, analyze and treat the risks associated with your next M&A transaction."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:45e0fd64-6cc5-4dc5-a6ba-05c6a9c97c89>","<urn:uuid:79714cbe-d4d1-4b72-8f98-ef3c7fbb1cfb>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How does social engineering exploit human psychology, and what tactics do hackers use during onsite attacks? 🤔","answer":"Social engineering exploits basic human psychology by taking advantage of people's trusting and helpful nature. It preys on individuals' cooperative inclinations and their desire to be liked, using techniques like flattery, intimidation, and authority assertion. For onsite attacks, hackers typically use tactics such as sending spoof emails that appear to be from managers to gain facility access, keeping props minimal, and focusing on making employees comfortable through specific mannerisms. They often impersonate service vendors like IT consultants to gain access to critical systems and sensitive information.","context":["What Is Social Engineering?\nSocial engineering is typically defined as the gentle means of getting people to follow or comply with the wishes of another to gain access to information or computer systems. The ultimate goal of any individual using social engineering is to acquire information. Typically this acquired information is used to gain unauthorized access into an online system or company server in an effort to steal an identity, commit fraud, or compromise the company’s confidential information or as a way to commit some form of espionage.\nWhy Social Engineering Works\nMost individuals are extremely trusting and helpful. Nearly all of us want to be a good friend, neighbor, associate or confidant. Social engineering takes advantage of basic human behavior through clever manipulation. It preys on the cooperative and helpful inclinations of human beings for an illicit use. Individuals that utilize social engineering are very good at exploiting the vulnerabilities of basic human behavior. They work on the naïveté of individuals that simply want to be liked along with the fear of doing something wrong.\nIn spite of all the advancements in technology there is not a single system that has been created that can overcome basic human nature. Social engineers recognize that it is humans that will create passwords, utilize the computers, bank online, and enter their confidential credit card numbers when purchasing items over the Internet.\nThe Psychology of Social Engineering\nAny bad individual that has skilled themselves in the techniques of social engineering has the ability to lie convincingly to obtain the information they desire. Successful social engineers generally do a significant amount of groundwork before they make the initial launch of their attack. They will typically research the enterprise or organization that has been targeted for a cyber-attack.\nThey may gain all the names of every employee in the company along with their email accounts and phone numbers. They may incorporate various techniques utilized by most conmen that include eavesdropping, name dropping, impersonation, and flattery. They may go the other way, and pressure individuals through intimidation or by asserting “their” authority.\nThere are specific well used techniques that have been proven successful in gaining results through social engineering. While not every technique works on every individual, it only requires one to make the cyber-thief successful. Although these techniques are only a small sample, they include:\n- Exploiting Familiarity – Utilizing familiarity is the easiest way to get others to follow. When the online hacker becomes familiar with an individual, nearly anyone will lower their guard. People often act and react in a different way to individuals than to strangers. The social engineer will take their time in developing a friendship, or impersonate an individual or business through emails as a way to phish for information.\n- Developing a Hostile Situation – Developing some type of hostile situation is nothing more than a diversionary tactic. It is no different than a magician making the audience look in one hand while he or she does something in the other. Some individuals might believe that one specific action is happening when it actually is something else entirely different.\n- Gather and Use the Information – Many social engineers use the ability to go “dumpster diving” seeking information that appears to not be valuable, but really is. They may impersonate a manager or supervisor from another branch or office to ask important or specific questions about the company, other employees or associates. They might also mimic other websites such as Google, Facebook or even a banking institution to gather information from an unsuspecting online user.\n- Getting the Job – This tactic is built on making the individual another member of the team. The social engineer builds trust by offering the online user something they likely desire. Offering a piece of candy or reward in return for valuable information is a simple solution to gather information. Of course, the victim never really receives the reward.\n- Reading Specific Body Language – While it is not always possible to read body language online, social engineers are very good at reading people. By using phishing scams and other baiting tools they can watch the response of individuals that are reacting to their emails or other tactics. In time, they can direct the user down a pathway where they are more likely to give up pertinent information such as passwords or critical confidential information.\nSocial engineering works. The process has been around a lot longer than computers. For centuries, conmen have figured out ways of obtaining information from the most unsuspecting individuals. Only by becoming aware can humans avoid the tricks of social engineers and safeguard themselves from compromising confidential information that could hurt them or their company.\nNeed a way to help defend against social engineering? With some kind of multi-factor authentication in place, a con artist would have to not only obtain a password, but also a second factor of identity.

In a recent interview, he answered seven questions organizations typically have about social engineering and how they can protect their company from cyber attacks.\n1. What is social engineering and why should organizations be concerned about it?\nSocial engineering is a term used to describe social attack methods used by malicious individuals to gain access to sensitive company or personal information. The attacker may also want to gain access to an organization’s critical systems to cause interruption or destruction.\nOften, social engineering involves what appear to be harmless personal interactions between an individual and an attacker. During these interactions, the attacker gains the trust of the victim, who in return provides the attacker (sometimes unknowingly) with access to sensitive information, critical systems, or critical areas. Sensitive information can include personally identifiable information (PII), private organization information, or user credentials. Critical systems can include servers and network infrastructure devices while critical areas include the spaces that house the information, servers, and network infrastructure devices, as well as electronic/mechanical rooms that house critical facility equipment such as electronic control boxes and breaker boxes. Social engineering attacks can be performed in person or remotely.\nAn example of a remote social engineering attack involves an attacker sending an email to an unsuspecting victim in order to convince the victim to visit a malicious website. By visiting the malicious website, a virus or other form of malware could be downloaded unknowingly to the victim’s system. The malware could then provide the attacker access to sensitive information on the victim’s system or within the organization’s network.\nAn “in person” or onsite attack can occur when an attacker visits an organization’s facility and impersonates a service vendor such as an IT consultant or network administrator. The attacker may convince the organization’s employee(s) that system or network device updates are required and therefore gain access to personal computers. However, the attacker’s true intent may be to install a backdoor component that will enable them to access the system and/or the organization’s network at a later time. The attacker could also simply be looking for opportunities to gain unmonitored access to sensitive information or critical systems during the visit.\nIt has been stated that an organization’s greatest resource is its personnel. This would appear to be true since personnel play a key role in keeping sensitive information and critical areas secure. However, studies have shown that personnel can also be an organization’s greatest liability when it comes to data security. This is exactly why organizations should be concerned about social engineering. The human element has to be considered when attempting to keep information or critical areas secure. Social engineering attacks focus on taking advantage of human errors and/or lack of employee awareness. A quick Google search and review of one’s inbox indicates social engineering attacks, especially remote attacks, are happening all the time.\n2. Why is social engineering so widely used among hackers?\nSocial engineering attacks do not typically require a lot of sophisticated technology and often take little effort to perform. Additionally, social engineering attacks can prove fruitful to an attacker in more than one way. In some cases, a social engineering attack may fail to provide the attacker with access to the information or systems originally targeted, but the attack may still furnish them with some critical information which could be used in a second attempt or perhaps as part of a more sophisticated attack.\n3. Why do so many people fall victim to social engineering attacks?\nLack of awareness, which is typically due to inadequate security awareness training, makes staff members prime targets for social engineering attacks. Without security awareness training, human elements become a vulnerability. Attackers will attempt to use methods such as flattery, sympathy, intimidation, and distraction to con the victim into providing them access. A person susceptible to any of these tactics could potentially fall victim to an attack.\nAlso, weaknesses in the organization’s visitor authorization, escorting, and monitoring procedures may cause a successful compromise by a social engineering attack.\n4. When performing onsite social engineering engagements, what are some of the tactics you use that are most likely to result in a compromise?\nI’ve found the most successful tactic is to send spoof emails to personnel of a location that I am testing which appear to be from a manager or administrator of that organization. The purpose of the email is to request authorization of my fake vendor visit and access into non-public areas of the facilities.\nTruthfully, it is easy to locate and find email addresses and titles for an organization’s personnel. Once the key personnel titles and email address are identified, I can send emails which appear to originate from proper authorizing personnel to the necessary employees of a location. With the sent spoofed emails, an organization’s employees often allow me to access the non-public areas of the facility and are often unconcerned about my presence around critical systems or information.\nIn addition to the spoof emails, I also like to keep things simple. While a lot of props may be fun and very useful for onsite social engineering testing, I’ve found keeping it simple and using only the necessary props is more effective. I focus more on my mannerisms and trying to make the employees comfortable with me. So yes, I utilize the human elements. If the situation calls for it, I will also use flattery and distraction techniques.\n5. When performing remote social engineering engagements, what are some of the tactics you use that are most likely to result in a compromise?\nTraceSecurity’s remote social engineering service includes testing by phone calls (a.k.a. vishing) and/or spoof emails which appear to originate from vendors and other common services (a.k.a. phishing).\nWhen testing with phone calls, the tactics I use are pretty much the same as when I am performing an onsite test. The goal is to get personnel to provide sensitive information or take actions which could provide instant or delayed access to the organization’s network and critical systems. I have experienced the most success by focusing on my mannerisms to make the person comfortable while pretending to be a vendor of the organization’s computer systems or critical applications. I will usually drop a name from the organization’s IT personnel as the person who authorized the call. I will say that I am performing a critical security update and need the client to browse to a website and/or run a command on their system. During the testing, the websites are actually safe or don’t exist. The requested command to execute is also harmless. During a real attack, an attacker’s request would not be harmless. The website would be malicious, and the command requested to run could help further compromise the personnel’s system or the organization’s network.\n6. What are the top five things you suggest an organization do or implement to protect themselves from social engineering threats?\nImplement an effective security awareness training course which thoroughly covers social engineering attacking and mitigation methods. Training should not be a one-time-only activity but instead should be conducted on an ongoing basis.\nIn addition to training, social engineering testing should be performed periodically to help determine whether the training is effective.\nSpoof emails are easy to create and can often be difficult to identify. Therefore, organizations should not rely on emails as a method to authorize facility visits. Verbal approval should be the preferred method to authorize visits or vendor interaction with staff.\nImplement and constantly re-evaluate the organization’s visitor authorizing, escorting, and monitoring procedures. Re-evaluations will help the organization identify and address vulnerabilities within their protocol.\nImplement effective physical and technical security protocols as a supplement to the actions which are expected to be performed by personnel. For example, as a physical control, doors to critical areas should remain locked at all times to prevent unauthorized access.\n7. What is the most effective strategy an organization can use to educate employees on social engineering threats and are there any tools available to help?\nThe most effective strategy an organization can implement is to provide ongoing training and testing scenarios for employees. I recommend both being done at least once a year. If done once a year, I recommend providing the training first and then performing the testing and review about midway through the year. However, training and testing, especially testing, should not be performed around the same time every year. If so, employees will begin to learn the testing pattern and will be prepared for the test but may become relaxed and unprepared for a real attack during the remainder of the year.\nOrganizations can create their own training courses and materials, but there are a number of third-party vendors who provide security awareness training and testing scenarios. The organization should evaluate which option is most feasible for their environment."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:5f337565-b8aa-438e-aa21-1e2bd9d02d60>","<urn:uuid:d58f5d4c-79c6-42bc-bab7-4a7d94cae693>"],"error":null}

The testicles are removed via two surgical incisions into the scrotum. The blood vessels and other tissues running from the testicle into the abdomen are crushed and cut. The vaginal tunic and scrotum are left ‘open’ for drainage.\nThe closed technique\nThis procedure takes longer and requires a clean operating theatre environment because the tissue layers are sutured closed after the testicles have been removed so the wounds cannot drain. This technique is more costly and is recommended for older or very large stallions, especially if they have been used for breeding. The closed technique is also recommended for colts that have had a scrotal hernia.\nComplications and risk\nCastration is a routine procedure, however, as with any surgery, it is not without risk. In the vast majority of cases castration is straightforward and uncomplicated, but around 1 in 5 cases may develop complications.\nThere is an element of risk with general anaesthesia of any healthy horse, however every attempt is made to minimise the risk, and the vast majority of our castrations are done standing with sedation and without any complications.\nBleeding from the surgical site is common post-operatively and a small amount of blood dripping for the first 24 hours is normal. If more than a fast drip, or a constant stream of blood lasts for over 2 minutes, veterinary attention should be urgently sought.\nPost-operative infection of the surgical site is the second most common complication. Swelling becomes apparent and the colt may appear lame behind due to the swelling, or be depressed and inappetant. Rarely, infection can develop in the abdomen and the horse may additionally appear unwilling to move and very unwell. Veterinary attention should be sort.\nIf anything is seen hanging down from the surgical incision, veterinary attention should be sought. Usually, this is just a small piece of the vaginal tunic (fibrous sac that the testicle would have been surrounded by), which can be trimmed off by the vet.\nVery rarely, a serious complication can occur when intestines prolapse through the castration site. This is an emergency that requires immediate veterinary attention.\nCRYPTORCHIDS / ‘RIGS’\nOccasionally, one or both testicle/s may not descend into the scrotum. The retained testicle/s can be lying anywhere from the inguinal ring (groin) to near the kidneys in the abdomen, and often they are very small.\nIf one or both testicles have not descended by one year of age, it becomes increasingly unlikely that they will do so, although occasionally inguinally retained testicles can drop up to the age of 4.\nRetained testicles will still produce testosterone so masculine and aggressive behaviour can be expected, and some rigs are still fertile. For these reasons, and because retained testicles may be prone to developing cancer, it is advisable to refer rigs for surgical removal of the testicles in a hospital facility.\nSometimes older horses with an unknown history are presented to us as possible rigs because of masculine behaviour. To determine if the animal is a gelding or a rig, examination, ultrasonography and endocrinology (blood tests) can be used.","The dangers of overtraining\nWhilst regular exercise is encouraged for all its many health benefits, it is important to be aware that training too hard or for too long can have a negative impact on your body. This is what is known as overtraining. So how do we know if we are overtraining and what are the dangers associated with it?\nBelow are some of the most common signs to look out for. They can also be related to many other things, so need to be considered holistically in order to recognize whether they are in fact a possible result of overtraining.\n- Regular injuries. It is essential to get enough rest between training sessions as this allows your body to recover properly and can enhance performance and muscle growth. If you are struggling with frequent injuries, it could be a sign that you are not giving your body enough rest.\n- Low immune system. If you are generally feeling run down and finding you are getting sick more often this could be pointing to the fact that your body may benefit from more rest periods.\n- Muscle pain. Although a certain amount of muscle soreness and stiffness after training is to be expected, this should usually only last 1-2 days.\n- Struggling to focus and sleep and experiencing feelings of stress, anxiety and fatigue.\nWhat can we do to help prevent overtraining?\n- Cross-training is a great way of ensuring we do different types of exercise that benefit us in different ways and avoid putting too much strain on any one part of the body. Balance your training by doing a combination of cardiovascular workouts, lifting weights and exercises like yoga and pilates.\n- Keeping a training diary can be very useful. Note how you feel after a workout and how long it takes to recover.\n- Schedule regular rest days.\n- Alternate training between different muscle groups when lifting weights. For example, focus on your upper body on one day followed by a rest day and then a lower body workout followed by another rest day.\n- Ensure you are resting adequately within your workouts. For example, when lifting weights, leave some rest time between each set.\n- Make sure you are eating enough calories and the right type of food to complement your training regime. Focus on having a balanced nutritious meal 2-3 hours before a workout and refuelling around 45 minutes after.\n- Adequate sleep is essential – 8 hours is the ideal amount for an active adult.\n- Make relaxation part of your training plan – meditation, yoga, and massages are some great ways to help you unwind.\nPushing your body to the point where it is not able to recover well enough between exercise sessions can be detrimental to your physical and mental health.\nEnsuring you get enough rest can go a long way towards enhancing muscle gains, improving your overall performance and ultimately helping you reach your fitness goals.\nListen to your body."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:059401f8-02fb-44e7-b1d5-6bd2470f8eca>","<urn:uuid:1b46256b-39d4-42f9-9af9-1393b21d4490>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I follow German post-war history and would like to know about the different development paths of East and West Germany after World War II. What were the key differences in their political systems and economic development, and how did East Germany's dual role as both a Soviet-aligned state and a supporter of African liberation movements evolve?","answer":"West and East Germany developed very differently after WWII. West Germany became a stable western democracy with safeguards against extremism, including a 5% minimum vote requirement for political parties to enter the Bundestag. In contrast, East Germany was established as a Stalin-style Socialist state with a centralized, dictatorial regime where the Stasi police controlled free speech and intellectual activities. While East Germany achieved one of the most advanced economies among Soviet-bloc states, it still lagged behind West Germany. Simultaneously, East Germany developed strong ties with African liberation movements, particularly SWAPO in Namibia, which began with Sam Nujoma's visit to the GDR in 1962. The GDR provided military and medical aid to SWAPO, educated over 400 Namibian 'GDR Kids', and maintained diplomatic relations, ultimately opening its last embassy worldwide in Windhoek in March 1990, just before German reunification.","context":["By: Daniel Lange (University of Potsdam)\nOriginal Published 8 July 2016 [LINK TO ORIGINAL]\nAs the Winds of Change were finally blowing through Namibia in 1989-1990, the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) was given the difficult task to organise free and fair elections. These elections would result in a constituent assembly, and independence shortly thereafter. This was one of the largest UN peace projects ever conducted; UNTAG had over 8000 military officers, many election observers, and their own civil police unit.\nOften forgotten within this history, however, is a special moment in German-Namibian relations. The UNTAG mission to Namibia was not only the first UN peace project supported by West Germany; it was also the first and only time East Germany, the former German Democratic Republic (GDR), was involved. In October 1989, the same month when the revolutions in the GDR hit their peak, resulting in the collapse of General Secretary Erich Honecker and the Socialist Unity Party (SUP), 30 East German police observers put their boots on Namibian ground. They would later be stationed in Ombalantu, Oshakati, Bethanie, Mariental, Gibeon, and Ongandjera until Namibia’s independence in March 1990.\nLooking back from today, this seems surreal and strange that the GDR was active in Namibia’s peace process after socialist rule broke down in East Germany in autumn 1989, months earlier. To understand the roots of this special chapter in German-Namibian relations, we must look back to 1962.\nIn January 1962, Sam Nujoma (who was SWAPO’s president at the time) visited the GDR, beginning the tight connections which SWAPO would maintain with the Socialist Unity Party (SUP) until independence. During the Cold War, in which Germany was divided into two republics, East Berlin had several reasons for this alliance. The West German Hallstein-Doktrin put pressure on many Third World states and forbade them to enter into formal diplomatic relations with the GDR. However, the SUP was looking for global diplomatic acceptance and new bilateral partners. Therefore, from 1960, the SUP developed its own East German strategy for their foreign affairs in Africa, where more and more countries were obtaining independence.\nThe GDR focused particularly on national liberation movements with socialist or communist character, and tried to win them as political and ideological “comrades”. It was in Southern Africa, where these movements were fighting against apartheid and colonialism (particularly in Namibia, South Africa, Zimbabwe, Angola, and Mozambique) where these efforts grew in intensity from the 1970s.\nIn the meantime, the East Germans had reached international and diplomatic recognition on the global stage by 1972/3, resulting in UN membership and formal contacts between the SUP and SWAPO in 1977. By 1978, SWAPO had officially established a diplomatic mission in East Berlin. In 1979, during his first official diplomatic tour of Africa, the SUP’s General Secretary Erich Honecker met Sam Nujoma in Luanda. And after the 1978 Cassinga attacks, they began to take care of and educate over 400 SWAPO ‘GDR Kids’ in East German kindergartens and schools.\nResolution 435 and Peace Building\nIn September 1978, the United Nations Security Council decided to pass resolution 435, which laid the framework for Namibia’s independence under a peace process supervised by UNTAG. The GDR’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs hoped to be involved in that process and envisioned the implementation of SCR 435 already in 1979, even before the elections in Zimbabwe (another African nation which the East Germans sought relations with).\nUNTAG and the Namibian situation was supposed to be a Southern African pilot programme in the GDR’s efforts to take on a more active role in the United Nations. However, when SCR 435 was finally implemented in April 1989, after a long international diplomatic process, times had already changed. Cold War tensions and confrontations between East and West weren’t as rough anymore, and while the Namibia question was still significant, it was no longer top priority in East German foreign policy.\nDespite this, East Germany’s goals in Namibia and in the UN were still alive, as was their good partnership with SWAPO. After all, the GDR did support SWAPO’s liberation struggle, providing military and medical aid, SWAPO was one of the major recipients of financial support under the GDR’s Africa Strategy. Also, the SUP supported the electoral campaign of SWAPO in 1989 with money and promotional film-spots. Also in August 1989, the first Interflug flight from East Germany brought the first 250 GDR kids back to Namibia, many seeing their home country for the first time. The rest returned in July 1990.\nBesides this, the GDR was serving its own interests by participating in the implementation on SCR 435: a more active role in the UN, a better strategic position in the region after Namibia’s independence (especially regarding South Africa), as well as maintaining good relations with SWAPO to reach economic goals. In October 1989, a GDR trade delegation, which was the first such mission in Namibia from a socialist state, met with representatives in Windhoek, Tsumeb, Grootfontein and Swakopmund to discuss commercial trade relations in agriculture, fisheries, and industry.\nAnd what of the 30 East German police observers working under UNTAG? In March 1990, they came home to Germany, but to a very different sort of land. The former head of state Erich Honecker was forced to give up his political office during the revolution, only weeks after he decided to send the police to Namibia. The Berlin Wall had fallen just as Namibia elected its first free parliament (7-11 November 1989).\nThe reunification of Germany was on the agenda. Three days before Namibia became independent, the people in the former GDR experienced democratic elections for the first time on 18 March 1990. What a big contrast to the Socialist Unity Party’s official position to support free and fair elections on the other end of the world in Namibia! And on 21 March 1990, the GDR’s long alliance with SWAPO was visible for the last time, when the last East German embassy worldwide was opened in Windhoek. The UNTAG endeavours, the first and only time that the GDR was actively involved in an international peace mission, were now over.","the Cold War\nTable O' Contents\nGeneral Overview of the Cold War\nMarshall Plan and the Truman Doctrine\nBerlin Crisis and the Berlin Airlift\nBetween the Superpowers Rises\nA General Overview of the Cold War\nThe Cold War was an ideological war between the two\nworld superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union, beginning after\nWorld War Two. After the war, Germany was left defeated, and Britain\nand France were left drained and exhausted. The United States and\nthe Soviet Union, though also drained, held considerable power, and both\nsoon rose to superpower status. The two became rivals through \"conflicting\nideologies and mutual distrust\"1, and constantly competed for\nThe Soviet Union wanted to spread Communism in Eastern\nEurope and create a \"buffer zone\" of friendly governments as defense against\nGermany. In 1946, with Eastern Europe under Soviet control and influence,\nEurope was divided into a West (western democracies and the United States)\nbloc and East (Soviet Union and Soviet occupied territory) bloc.\nAn \"iron curtain\" separated Europe.\nThe aftereffects of World War Two were what shaped Cold\nWar Germany. The post-war state of Germany was grim: about 1/4 of\nhousing had been destroyed, the economic infrastructure had largely collapsed,\ninflation was rampant, there was a shortage of food, and millions of homeless\nGermans from the east were returning. After its unconditional surrender,\nGermany was divided into four zones of Allied military occupation: American,\nFrench, British, and Soviet. The old capital of Berlin was also divided\ninto four zones, but Berlin itself remained inside of the Soviet zone.\nIn 1949, the French, British, and American zones merged and formed the\nFederal Republic of Germany (Bundesrepublic Deutschland), with its capital\ncity Bonn. Also in 1949, the Soviet zone became the German Democratic\nRepublic (Deutsche Demokratische Republik) with the Soviet sector of Berlin\nas the capital.\nWest Germany became a suprisingly stable western\ndemocracy. A new policy required a 5% vote for a political party\nto be represented in the Bundestag (the upper legislative house), in order\nto prevent any small extremist parties from gaining representation too\neasily. This was what brought the downfall of the Weimar Republic\nand the rise of the Nazi Party, after all.\nEast Germany was established as a Stalin-style Socialist\nstate. It became a member of the Warsaw Pact and came to have one\nof the most advanced economies and standard of living of the Soviet-bloc\nstates (though that's not saying much, as it still lagged behind West Germany).\nThe East German government was formed into a centralized and dictatorial\nregime. The State Security Police (Stasi) maintained the Soviet expectation\nof the people. Free speech and opinions against the regime were not\ntolerated, and artistic and intellectual programs were strongly controlled.\nThe partition and division of Germany drove a block\nin between both United States to Russia relations and West German to East\nGerman relations. The Allies were at the same time trying to be forgiving\nto the Germans for World War Two while also insuring that the Germans could\nnever again begin the expansionism that had led to the two previous wars.\nDuring the Cold War, Germany became the center for\nall the tensions between Democracy and Communism. The location of\nGermany as the gateway between East and West Europe made it the ideal place\nfor these political struggles to occur. When Russia had tried to\nexpand in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, they were\nchecked by the rising power of the German state. Therefore, after\nGermany fell in World War Two, Russia attempted to begin its expansion\nacross a now weakened Europe.\nThe end of World War Two left Russia in possession\nof all of Germany up to 300 miles west of Berlin. This new annexation\ncaused the powers in Europe to become unbalanced and Russia replaced Germany\nas the country that was getting too big. Contrary to their actions against\nrising powers in the past, England did not try to stop the Russian expansion.\nThey did this because they thought it preferable to give Russia parts of\nGermany over giving them other territories that would allow Russia access\nto the Mediterranean.\nThe Allies had many reasons for partitioning Germany.\nOverall, the purpose of dividing land up was to control Germany until a\nnew government could be instated. France, America, England and Russia\nall had parts of Germany that were put temporarily under their control.\nWhile the Allies were still in occupation of the country, decisions were\nmade by a council of the four powers. The representatives were then\nresponsible for carrying out the decisions of the council in their allotted\nterritory. There was a catch that the Russians exploited to thwart\nthe other powers. According to the treaty, proposals to the council\nwere only put into effect if there was a unanimous vote. The Russians\ncould use this just like they used the U.N. Security Council. The\nRussians had annoyed the other powers by using their veto power in the\nSecurity Council to veto every proposition that came before them.\nBy exercising their right to arbitrarily veto any decision made regarding\nGermany, they could prevent any actions that were against their best interest.\nThe Soviets then would be able to run Eastern Germany as they wished, because\nno proposition stopping them from doing so could be passed.\nThe Marshall Plan and the Truman Doctrine\nIn June 1947, the Marshall Plan was put into effect\nin order to stop the Russians from influencing any of the weakened western\npowers. During the time the United States sent massive economic aid\nto Europe democracies to help rebuild. Billions of dollars were spent\nto help countries recover quickly and to reduce the influence of Communism.\nThis plan helped to restore West Germany and rebuild it as a new ally in\nAmerica's fight against Russia. Russia refused the aid of the Marshall\nPlan and, as a result, East Germany was not completely rebuilt. This\nlack of reconstruction showed through even after the reunification. The\nGerman economy after reunification took a big hit, because it had to pay\nfor all the reconstruction that the Communists never did.\nThe Truman Doctrine, a plan to help states going\nthrough a struggle for freedom against their oppressors, was instituted\nin 1948. President Truman said, \"I believe it must be the policy\nof the United States to support free peoples who are resisting attempted\nsubjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures.\" The Truman\nDoctrine instituted a policy of containment; Communism would be limited\nonly to areas already under Soviet control, and Americans would resist\nSoviet expansion everywhere else.\nThe Truman Doctrine could not have been more clearly\ndirected towards East Germany and, technically, West Germany. Germany\nwas both under subjugation by an outside force and also under the power\nof the armed minority that the Russians would soon put into power in the\nform of the DDR (Deutsches Demokratische Republik). In 1949 the Allies\nmade good on what they promised in the Truman Doctrine and unified West\nGermany into the BDR (Federal Republic of Germany). At the same time\nthe Russians instituted the DDR, which turned out to be more of a regime\nthan a government.\nThe Berlin Crisis and the Berlin Airlift\nDue to horrible conditions in East Germany, its citizens\nhad begun to cross over to West Germany and were allowed to proclaim themselves\nrefugees. 2.6 million out of 17.5 million residents of East Germany\nhad crossed over by 1961. This caused labor shortages in East Germany\nand also the further degradation of an already failing East German economy.\nAs East Germany got worse and worse, Russia became willing to take offensive\nmeasures to reclaim West Berlin.\nIn December of 1947, Russia and the United States\nfinally parted ways and the Western Powers began to meet about German business\nwithout the Russian ambassador present. On March 20, 1948, Russia\ndeclared that the Allied Control Council of Berlin no longer existed and\nvoluntarily withdrew from all of their meetings. As a result, there\nwere no government relations existing between Russia and the other Allies.\nThe problems worsened when the Russians decided\nthat they wanted all of Berlin under their control. There had been\nno previous treaties giving the Allies free access to West Berlin through\nRussian territory, so Russia exploited this situation and isolated Berlin\nfrom American soldiers and supplies. The Berlin Blockade began in\nmid 1948 as Russian forces surrounded West Berlin in an effort to make\nAllied soldiers there surrender from starvation. The Soviets sealed\noff railroads and highways to the Western sector of Berlin, effectively\ncutting it off from the Western Allied sector of Germany. In response\nto this, the Allies instituted the Berlin Airlift on June 21, 1948, in\norder to provide West Berlin with food and fuel. Cargo planes dropped\nfood, fuel, and other supplies into West Germany 24 hours a day.\nRussia rationalized the blockade by saying that\nthey were doing extensive roadwork (this didn't fool anyone). Russia\nthen went on to claim that Berlin was rightfully theirs and that the Western\npowers had control only of West Berlin because they had more votes when\nthe partition was being made. Marshall answered this by declaring\nto the Russian government that all Allies had a right to be in Berlin and\nthat the United States intended to stay. He then went on to\ncut off all passage of trains between East and West Germany.\nThe conflict intensified when America secretly moved\n60 long-range bombers into the British Isles. Russia saw that the\nAllies did not intend to surrender so they offered the citizens of West\nBerlin food on the condition that they came over to the Russian side.\nThe West Berliners decided that they would rather starve than be under\nRussian authority. In May, 1949, Russia called off the failed blockade.\nThey lost this confrontation for two reasons. First, the Russians\nhad not yet acquired nuclear capabilities and therefore could not stage\na larger offensive. Second, the Russians were in an extremely bad\nposition in regard to foreign relations; \"...before the eyes of the world,\nit appeared to be trying to starve over 2 million men, women, and children\nin West Berlin. While the Berlin Airlift continuing month after month\nprovided a tangible demonstration of western determination and competence.\"2\nSo basically, through this whole conflict, Russia was making themselves\nlook like murderers and the Allies looked like saviors. The Western\npowers' unflinching support of Berlin gave other parts of Germany more\nconfidence in their commitment to Germany's well-being.\nWest Germany began their first big step toward making\namends with France in March of 1950. They made a peace treaty with\nthe French that ended the conflict that had been going on since the early\n1800s. The peace treaty was a step toward assuring the Allies that\nthere was no possibility of German expansion and the outbreak of another\nwar, the only things the Allies required to guarantee Germany its autonomy.\nOn May 9, 1950, France and Germany made a treaty that gave joint control\nof the steel and coal industry in Germany and France making it \"not merely\nunthinkable, but materially impossible\"3 to have a war between\nthe two countries. This treaty was called the Schuman Plan and was\na large step toward France's approval of West Germany's autonomy.\nSoon after, the European Coal and Steel Community was established consisting\nof six European powers. As a result of these actions, West Germany\nbecame accepted again in European affairs.\nAt about the same time as the treaty (May 1950),\nthe Korean War broke out, and Europe tensed for a Russian invasion into\nthe West. West Germany was allowed to contribute soldiers under the\npower of NATO. This showed that some of the Allies were beginning\nto trust the Germans again. The only obstacle was France, who greatly\nopposed any German army, even under the authority of NATO. They thought\nif German got an army of any kind, they would immediately make an alliance\nwith Russia and attack the French. On May 26, 1952, the occupation\nof West German was officially over according to the treaty, and West Germany\nwas supposed to have its own government. The Allies would not let\ngo of the country until they were absolutely sure that Germany would not\nreturn as a threat. On May 27, 1952, a defensive treaty against Russia\ncalled the European Defense Treaty was proposed between France, Italy,\nHolland, Germany, Luxembourg, and Belgium. This was to create an\narmy that was composed of all these countries under the command of NATO.\nThe French Assembly rejected this treaty for fear of the German army, and\nas a result, attempts to unify West Germany under its own authority were\nvery temporarily dropped. The English, on October 3, 1952, made the\nlast step that France needed to be assured that Germany was not a threat\nby declaring that they would maintain a military presence on mainland Europe.\nThis gave France the security they wanted against a German invasion.\nFrance then consisted to end the occupation of West Germany and to admit\nit into the 1948 Brussels Treaty. West Germany was now a wholly independent\nstate except for West Berlin.\nTension Between the Superpowers Rises\nDuring the time elapsed between the first blockade and\n1958, Russia had developed nuclear capabilities and they were ready to\ngo after West Berlin again. In 1958, East Germany began to again\nblock immigration to West Germany by establishing barbed wire fences and\npatrols along the whole border between East and West Germany. Berlin\nwas the only spot open to immigration between the two countries.\nAt the time of Russia's second offensive, the Western powers had 11,000\ntroops in Berlin compared to the 550,000 that Russia had. The Russians\nrestricted access to West Berlin, except through two routes. The\nfirst route consisted of heavily guarded roads where Russian soldiers harassed\ntravelers. The second consisted of three airlines; Russian fighter\nplanes \"buzzed\" flights. Basically, these tactics were adopted to\ndemonstrate to the Allies that they were helpless to stop any Russian movement.\nRussia at that time had the technology to prevent another airlift, so the\nAllies had no option of peacefully supplying West Berlin with food.\n\"We are certainly not going to fight a ground war in Europe.\nWhat good would it do to send a few more thousand or indeed a few divisions\ninto Europe with something like 175 Soviet divisions in the area?\" -President\nRussia intensified the conflict when it declared\nit would hand over all power in East Berlin to the DDR regime effective\non May 27, 1952. The Allies had no alliances with the DDR in terms\nof established passages into Berlin, and so the Allies had no way to hold\nBerlin, but still refused to let it go. Russia and the Allies entered\na stalemate. But, as May 27 got closer, Russia began to look for\na way to back down and get out of the situation. Russia launched\na flurry of new deadlines. On March 5, they declared that they were\nwilling to delay the transition of power to the DDR. On March 9,\nthey declared that they wanted to have all countries involved in the conflict\nwithdraw their troops. They finally backed down completely on March\n11, when they declared that they would allow free access to West Berlin\nfor all travelers. And so, again, the Communists lost the cosmic\ngame of chicken.\nThe Berlin Wall\nIn 1961, Berlin, the last place through which immigrants\ncould leave East Germany, was blocked off by the \"infamous\" Berlin Wall,\nat which more than 80 persons were shot while trying to escape East Germany\non non-consecutive occasions. This state of affairs continued until\nthe the summer of 1989, when the reforming Hungarian government opened\nHungary's borders and allowed passage of East Germans through that country.\nFrom Hungary, East Germans could go directly into West Germany. The\nBerlin Wall was then rendered useless (except to keep the neighbors' dog\nout, and even it could go through Hungary). By November 9, 1989,\nthe people had begun to openly destroy the Wall and so Russia decided to\ntake it down, allowing free immigration between the countries and also\ninstigating the first of the movements to unify Germany.\nDuring the Cold War, Germany became the\ncenter for the conflict between Communism and Democracy. Germany\nwas the site where all the tensions between the two ideals was played out.\nBecause of its location as the farthest western city to the east, Berlin\nwas torn in half by the struggling parties. The repercussions of\nthis are what is shaping the problems in modern day Germany. The\nneglect that East Germany suffered through at the hands of the Communists\nwould cause not only economic problems but also social problems as the\nWestern and Eastern Germans grew apart as a people. The scars that\nthe Communist Party left on the East Germans are still being repaired.\nThe reconstruction of East Germany would almost bankrupt the West.\nNot only had much of East Germany not been rebuilt, most of what was produced\nhad been shipped back to the Soviet Union as \"war reparations\".\nDivided Germany had also caused a social split to\noccur between the Eastern and Western Germans. The Western German's\nlives had greatly improved since the end of World War Two but the Eastern\nGerman's lives were still mired in the destruction wrought by the war that\ncould not be fixed under the Communist regime. These differences\ncaused East Germans to view their western relatives as pampered and privileged.\nThese social end economic issues are still being repaired in Germany and\nthe end of the social schism does not appear yet to be in sight.\n1.

{"question":"What role does cognitive bias play in shaping people's beliefs about truth and facts, and how do lifecycle assessment metrics help evaluate the true impact of technological solutions?","answer":"Cognitive bias is wired into humans as part of our evolutionary inheritance, affecting how we process information regardless of political affiliation. The most common form is confirmation bias, where people seek evidence supporting their existing beliefs. Studies have shown that political partisans maintain incorrect beliefs even when presented with correcting information, and conservatives may even double down on false beliefs when confronted with facts. As for lifecycle assessment metrics, they help evaluate impacts through different frameworks - midpoint impacts (like greenhouse gas emissions) which lead to endpoint impacts (such as human life loss). These metrics consider multiple dimensions including resource depletion, supply chain risks, and environmental/social impacts. However, single-number metrics can be misleading as they don't capture uncertainty, and assessments should separate energy-related impacts from other activities for more accurate evaluation.","context":["Did you ever wonder how we arrived in a post-truth era, where “alternative facts” are substituted for actual facts and feelings are given more weight than evidence?

Historically speaking, when did the idea first arise?\nA: The word “post-truth” first started to be used in the 1990s, in a political story in a magazine. But the real interest here is that in 2016 the Oxford Dictionaries named post-truth their word of the year. This was due to a 2,000% increase in usage from 2015! So the word post-truth is of fairly recent origin. But the roots behind it, as I explore in my book, go back to science denial in the 1950s and cognitive bias that has been with us since the dawn of human civilization.\nQ: As you note, the idea of a single objective truth has never been free from controversy. If this is true, can it be argued that post-truth is really just an alternative view of the truth? Can there be such a thing, in your opinion?\nA: An alternative view of truth—or the claim that there is no such thing as objective truth—is the bread and butter of epistemology. Philosophers debate the meaning of truth all the time: what is the appropriate concept of it, what its relationship is to knowledge, belief, certainty, etc. In the political context, though, things are different. Post-truth arose not from some philosophical quarrel, but from politicians who wanted to impose their reality on others. Here I draw a distinction with something like “spin doctoring” where everyone really knows that the person is lying and shading the truth, e.g., “my candidate obviously won the debate last night,” versus claiming that obviously false things are true, e.g., “the murder rate went up in the USA last year.” I see post-truth as the first step toward authoritarian rule.\nQ: You argue that when we set forth a statement as fact with the intent to manipulate someone into believing something that we know is untrue, we have crossed the line from interpretation to deliberate falsification. Is this, for you, where post-truth begins?\nA: Like lying, post-truth is intentional. It is a strategy. There are many different tactics that one might use in post-truth (lying, propaganda, selective exposure to information, etc.), but the intent is what matters. The analogy with lying is telling: A lie has to be made on purpose. One cannot accidentally lie. Similarly, post-truth is the deliberate attempt to see information through a political lens before it is shared with the public. That is when post-truth begins. When political expediency is more important than telling the truth about reality, we have crossed over into post-truth.\nQ: We talk about political spin and how its intent is to influence others. But you see post-truth in its purest form to be when one thinks the audience’s reaction to the lie told actually changes the lie to truth. Can you give an example, from both sides of the political aisle, of this phenomenon of a lie “becoming” truth?\nA: I think that in the purest cases the goal of post-truth is to get the audience not even to doubt what one is telling them. One doesn’t want to convince them . . . one wants to tell them what is true so that they automatically believe it. In such a case, one might raise a very scary metaphysical question: “Is the truth even true if no one knows it or believes it?” A good example was when President Trump said that there had been a riot in Sweden over immigration. There wasn’t one. But then the next night, perhaps as a result of his remarks, there was one. He took credit for that. By telling the lie he made it the truth. Not literally of course. But in his own mind I think he feels that if enough people believe something he says it doesn’t really matter if it is true or not, because the reaction is the same.\nQ: While post-truth is not a new phenomenon, you draw a distinction between historic and contemporary notions of it. You say, “one gets the sense that post-truth is not so much a claim that truth does not exist as that facts are subordinate to our political point of view.” You say this can be seen as a form of ideological supremacy. How so?\nA: The best answer to this is to quote the eminent Holocaust historian Hannah Arendt, who said: “The ideal subject of totalitarian rule is not the convinced Nazi or the convinced Communist, but people for whom the distinction between fact and fiction . . . between true and false . . . no longer exist.”\nQ: The first step in fighting post-truth is to understand its history. You cite its emergence in the evolution of cognitive irrationalities that are shared by liberals and conservatives alike. Can you explain the concept of cognitive irrationalities and how they’re shared across the political spectrum?\nA: Cognitive bias is wired into us, as part of our evolutionary inheritance. No one is precisely sure why. Some scholars have conjectured that it is because there is survival value in being able to convince others that something is true, even when it’s not. I’m not sure I buy this because one could make an equally compelling case that believing untrue things could get us killed. In any case, whatever our political stripe, we all have cognitive biases. The most familiar one is “confirmation bias” where we are prone to search for evidence that backs up what we already think is true. There has been some experimental work on cognitive bias across the political spectrum that is quite interesting. In one study, done by Brendan Nyhan and Jason Reifler, they found something called the “backfire effect,” which is that political partisans were unmoved in their mistaken beliefs about factual topics (that they were motivated to believe) even when they were presented with correcting information! That is a troubling result, and it was bipartisan. The second part of the story, though, that rarely gets told in the media is that with conservatives (and only with conservatives) that was a “doubling down” effect too, where the correcting information could sometimes make them more prone to hold onto their mistaken beliefs. Think about that for a minute. The correcting information had an effect, just in the opposite direction! No such effect was noted for liberals.\nQ: Today’s post-truth challenges are different from those in the past because of the rise of new media and our 24/7 media culture. Can you explain how that change in the media has exacerbated the problem?\nA: Fake news and propaganda have been around for a long time. What happened recently is that the decline of traditional media, and the rise of social media, have allowed false information to be weaponized. What I mean here is that it can be spread faster, targeted, and applied as a kind of disinformation campaign in real time so that its effect can be multiplied. This is new. The old joke is that a lie gets halfway around the world before the truth can get its pants on. These days, the liars are given megaphones. When you click on a fake news story, then forward it to a friend, that is the source of the problem. Add this to the problem of confirmation bias, and you have people who live in news silos where they only hear what they want to hear, and spread those stories—true or not—without ever bothering to see if they are true. The fact that things can “go viral” on the internet is the source of the problem. Fake news is like a disease. In the old days, an epidemic might have been isolated to one community or spread slowly. These days we can have a pandemic.\nQ: To end where we began, at Brexit and the 2016 election. You say in your book that although these two events may seem “inextricably tied up with post-truth, neither was the cause of it—they were the result.” How so?\nA: Brexit and the 2016 election were made possible because of forces that had been building for more than 50 years. I think that the main root of post-truth is science denial. This started in the 1950s with cigarette companies going into panic mode when scientists were about to publish a study that showed a link between cigarette smoking and cancer. They decided to “fight the science.” They hired their own experts, did bogus studies, bought full-page ads in newspapers, and got the word out that “no conclusive link between cigarette smoking and cancer has been established.” Well that’s actually true because—due to the problems with inductive reasoning—no conclusive causal relationship has ever been shown between ANY two things. What this did, though, was create doubt in the mind of the general public, and that was the point. The cigarette companies rode this wave of doubt for the next 40 years as they sold cigarettes. And the blueprint for this sort of science denial was then used for other science denial campaigns against acid rain, the ozone hole, evolution by natural selection, the Strategic Defense Initiative, and climate change. Without all that, I don’t think post-truth would have been successful. People learned to doubt facts and truth in general because they started with doubting scientific facts and truth about science. Add to this cognitive bias, the decline of traditional media, the rise of social media, and a dash of postmodernism, and you had a perfect environment for post-truth.\nQ: In your opinion, can we move past this post-truth era? And what needs to happen now in order for us to do so?\nA: Lies need to be challenged. Always. And truths needs to be repeated. There is experimental evidence that shows that people who have mistaken views can be convinced by facts, if the facts are repeated often enough. There is something called the “repetition effect,” which allows people to believe something when they hear it often enough, whether it is true or not. This has been used by dictators to great effect throughout human history. But this also works for facts and truth. People who believe in truth cannot just say “those guys are idiots” and leave the field. If they do, then only liars will have a voice. We need to challenge lies so that the audience for the lies can hear another point of view.\nQ: Any predictions you care to share?\nA: Human beings have a deep-seated need to know the truth. We can deny it, spin it, ignore it, and find every way in the world to avoid it, but ultimately there is a desire to know the truth, even when it hurts us. Look at the people of Ukraine. After they deposed their leader, they stormed his palaces and summer houses not to loot the riches that were stolen from them, but to gather information to find out what had happened to all of their money. They took ashes out of the fireplace and re-created documents. And people sometimes do this sort of thing even against their own interests. Why do killers keep souvenirs of crimes that can be used against them? Why did Nixon keep the tapes? Why do we have such a visceral reaction to the destruction of things that can PROVE the truth, even when it’s a truth we hope no one finds out? I think it’s because we care about truth.","Life-Cycle Assessment Considerations for Batteries and Battery Materials\nThis is a summary (plus, a few of my own thoughts) of the review article “Life-Cycle Assessment Considerations for Batteries and Battery Materials” (2021) by J. Porzio and C. D. Scown.\nTypes of battery life-cycle assessment\nThere are two main types of battery life-cycle assessment (LCA): “cradle-to-gate” and “cradle-to-grave”.\nCradle-to-gate (factory gate is assumed here). The example metric is CO2e/kWh of battery capacity produced. In a truly use-agnostic LCA, the system boundary may need to be set at the module assembly stage, since the assembly of the pack or rack (including such components as thermal management and electrical control) will differ substantially depending on how the battery will be used.\n“Cradle-to-gate and use” is a variation that incorporates battery manufacturing and lifetime of usage, but not end-of-life recycling.\nCradle-to-grave LCAs consider how batteries will be used and treated at their end of life including collection, recycling and/or disposal.\nThe term cradle-to-cradle has been used to refer to systems that include recycling, but is generally meant to suggest a zero-waste process and thus is not commonly used to refer to battery life cycles, even if they include recycling.\nMidpoint and endpoint metrics in life-cycle impact assessment\nMidpoint and endpoint impact categories (or metrics, but not all impact categories can be converted into metrics) are the concepts in the area of life-cycle assessment studies.\nMidpoint impacts are precursors to some endpoint impacts that we care about. For example, greenhouse gas emissions are a midpoint impact that leads to climate change and, ultimately, to human loss of life due to food shortage, flooding, wildfires, and other catastrophic events, as well as loss of animal life and entire animal and plant species (endpoint impacts). For another example, ozone depletion is midpoint impact and increased cancer rates (because less UV radiation from the sun is blocked) is an endpoint impact.\nSome impacts could be considered both midpoint and endpoint, e. g. loss of ecosystems is both an endpoint impact in itself, but also decreases the quality of life, prosperity, or even leads to famine among people who lived off these ecosystems.\nThe impact categories of raw material production for batteries\nThere are three aspects of raw material assessment of batteries that can’t be reduced to each other and therefore should not be integrated into a single metric: resource depletion, supply chain risk, and environmental and social impacts of mining.\nOlivetti et al. synthesized the available data on consumption rates relative to available reserves for nickel (Ni), manganese (Mn), cobalt (Co), lithium, (Li), and natural graphite. They found that the ratio of known reserves to primary mine production (also known as the static depletion index) has increased for Co, Li, and natural graphite, suggesting that continued demand has resulted in additional exploration and extraction. Mn and Ni did not show an upward or downward trend, indicating that the ratio of production to known reserves has remained relatively constant.\nInterestingly, lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries are often praised to be better than batteries with Nickel-based cathodes because they only require “earth-abundant” materials. However, if we are to produce 2 TWh of LFP batteries per year by 2030, with 500 Wh/kg of cathode energy density of LFP, and Phosphorous being 19.6% of LFP cathode by mass, 784,000 metric tonnes of phosphorous will go yearly into batteries alone. This is comparable to 910,000 tonnes produced presently. Could this contribute to the problem of peak phosphorous? I didn’t find any discussion of this whatsoever. Phosphorous is abundant in the rocks all over the Earth but is not economical to extract to produce fertilisers. Maybe this is not a problem for batteries, because they can easily withstand become several times more expensive without affecting the total cost of batteries much? Even if so, there could be a market-driven risk here: LFP manufacturers will use cheaper phosphates in the short term, making the future phosphate shortage problem for fertiliser production more acute.\nSupply chain risk is a geopolitical risk associated with highly concentrated production, which can lead to conflict, price instability, and artificial shortages. Cobalt reserves and mining production are concentrated in DR Congo, but 95% of cobalt refining happens in China. China also produces 64% of the world’s graphite and 55% of aluminium. Morocco has 70% of the world’s phosphate reserves.\nEnvironmental and social impacts of mining\nIn DR Congo, there have been serious environmental and social consequences of copper and cobalt mining, ranging from child labour to human exposure to heavy metals, particularly from unregulated artisanal and small-scale mining operations.\nCell manufacturing is about two times more energy-intensive than mining and production of the raw materials for the cells\nIn other words, cell manufacturing accounts for two-thirds of energy consumption in cradle-to-gate LCA assessment for cells (source).\nEvaporating the NMP solvent (after coating cathode slurry on the current collector foil) and maintaining the facility’s dry room conditioning together consume about 80% of energy spent during cell manufacturing. However, the energy usage estimates for dry room conditioning were obtained on small-scale facilities and can drop by an order of magnitude on a very high-throughput cell production line.\nNickel-Manganese-Cobalt (NMC) cathode production can be two to three times more energy-intensive than the production of other cathode materials (LMO and LFP), and therefore also become a major contributor to the total energy spent during cell manufacturing.\nEnergy stored on energy invested (ESOI)\nEnergy stored on energy invested is a metric that has been proposed by Barnhart and Benson for “cradle-to-gate and use” and “cradle-to-grave” life cycle assessments of energy storage technologies:\nFor recyclable batteries, I think that a metric like cradle-to-grave energy efficiency would be more convenient because it could be directly used in downstream calculations such as assessing energy efficiency or EROI (energy return on investment) of renewable or nuclear power installations with accompanying energy storage for daily power balancing and manoeuvring, as well as in lifecycle greenhouse gas emission comparisons between internal combustion, hybrid, and fully electric vehicles for different carbon intensities of the grids in different countries.\nThere are several factors that make it difficult to estimate battery’s ESOI or cradle-to-grave efficiency:\n- The fact that different batteries are used differently (e. g., charged and discharged slower or faster, different number of hours per day, with different shelf life before they begin operation, at different ambient temperatures, etc.) directly affect the expected lifetime and the round-trip efficiency of the battery.\n- Most batteries originally manufactured for electric vehicles are expected to enter a second-life phase in energy storage with a very different usage pattern, but the exact moment when it happens is uncertain.\n- Battery’s capacity and internal resistance change during its lifetime. The internal resistance affects the round-trip efficiency directly, and the capacity can affect the usage pattern.\nAs of 2021, there are many things to improve in lifecycle assessments of batteries, both in literature and industry\nLCAs should start using country-specific raw material production impacts rather than the industry averages (or, even worse, the current industry’s state-of-the-art or best-practice impacts). They should also consider the differences between average, marginal, and incremental sources of key material inputs, in conjunction with projections of the global demands for these materials, as the global Li-ion battery production quickly rumps up. We should also create and use methods for capturing the effect of outliers and “superemitters”/”superimpactors” in mining and material processing.\nThe assessments should correctly present the uncertainty. A single-number metric value conveys false precision. (Steve McConnell advises for exactly the same in his book about software estimations.)\nWe strongly recommend that future LCAs make an attempt to separate impacts tied to energy use with those tied to other activities. If facilities shifting their fuel use to lower-emission alternatives (e.g., from coal to natural gas, or natural gas to renewable fuels), making this distinction in published LCAs will make it easier to adjust the results accordingly.\nWater consumption and withdrawals associated with battery production can be substantial, yet it is often overlooked in LCAs. Battery electric vehicles are associated with over 50% more water use relative to internal combustion engine vehicles over the course of their lifetime. This is mostly associated with the electricity use associated with vehicle charging, but a large contribution of water consumption is attributable to the LIB itself, consisting of 5–10% of the total water consumption depending on the battery chemistry.\nAs long as underlying assumptions about cycle life are clearly documented, the authors suggest that life cycle assessments would be well served to report results normalised both per kWh of battery capacity and per kWh of lifetime throughput.\nOn including a few most important impact metrics in lifecycle assessments vs. categorising all metrics\nIf a particular assessment doesn’t cover some impact (aspect, dimension), it should still mention this explicitly. Omitting an impact category may lead readers to believe it is not important.\nOn the other hand, comprehensiveness comes at a cost. Selecting life-cycle inventory, midpoint, and/or endpoint metrics that are likely to yield the greatest insights (and have sufficiently high-quality data to support those conclusions) will make LCAs more interpretable and impactful.\nCounterfactual life-cycle assessment of batteries and electric vehicles vs. internal combustion engine vehicles and fossil fuel power generation\nExhaustive, overly-pedantic categorisation of all the impacts of battery production and use can also confuse the public towards thinking that batteries are actually very “dirty” in production and recycling compared to the lifetime of fossil fuel combustion in ICE cars. Fossil fuel advocates could also refer to these comprehensive battery assessments to spread FUD instead of comparing them counterfactually with the effects of keeping internal combustion vehicles and gas power generation running.\nSo, I think it’s valuable to include counterfactual comparisons with fossil fuel alternatives in battery and other clean energy LCAs as a protection against such abuse.\nThis summary was originally posted on Substack."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:8ec515e9-340d-45be-b6d5-24d5e5c2a780>","<urn:uuid:696a38d0-8b90-4f1d-8afb-8f2b095542c8>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I'm learning about aviation airspace classification, but I'm having trouble visualizing how it's organized. How does the whole system work from ground level up to high altitudes? 🤔","answer":"The airspace system is organized in layers and 'cans'. From ground level up, it starts with Class G (uncontrolled airspace) from the ground to 1,200 feet above ground level. Above that is Class E airspace, which acts as 'filler' airspace. At 18,000 feet, Class A airspace begins and extends up to 60,000 feet - this is where airliners typically fly. Around airports, there are cylinder-shaped areas of Class B, C, or D airspace, depending on how busy the airport is. Class B surrounds the busiest airports like Atlanta, Class C is for moderately busy airports like Nashville, and Class D is for less busy airports like Athens, Georgia. These cylinders start at the ground and extend up to specific heights marked on aviation charts.","context":["It’s easy to look up to the sky and see a bunch of nothing. I’m always in wonder when there are lots of unusual clouds because it gives great dimension to an otherwise endless blue void. On the ground, we draw imaginary lines all over the land, making states, counties, cities, and a multitude of other borders. In the air, similar lines are drawn, creating different segments of airspace, but it’s a lot more challenging to put signs up in the air showing the boundaries – they keep falling every time one is put up. As a result, we must rely on maps to tell us where the airspace is, but visualizing the airspace makes it a lot easier to understand. Whether you fly airplanes or drones, understanding where the different airspace is and what it means is critical. There are lots of nuances and exceptions to basic airspace rules, but let’s break down the basics for a good overview of the concept.\nAirspace is generally classified by how busy the traffic through it is. The busier the airspace, the more rules exist about flying in it. Rules such as whether two way radio communication or special equipment like a transponder is needed to enter. There are also various rules about the visibility and distance from clouds that pilots flying visually must follow. Controlled airspace is labeled as Class A, B, C, D, or E. Think of airspace as being laid out either in layers or cans. Some airspace is a layer, from one altitude up to another altitude, anywhere on the map. Other airspace is like a can – a cylinder of air with a radius around an airport and a certain height up from the ground. A note about altitudes: As we look at charts, keep in mind that altitudes printed on the chart are Mean Sea Level (MSL) altitudes. This is the height above sea level – basically, what the altimeter will show. You’ll find the altitudes printed in hundreds of feet (3300 feet is printed as 33). The only altitude discussed in this that is not in MSL is Class G, which is Above Ground Level (AGL). Let’s look at each class of airspace.\nThis airspace is a layer that exists from 18,000 feet up to 60,000 feet and is not charted on maps. For Class A, I think “A for airliners,” because it’s the layer containing many airline flights, and only higher performance airplanes with cabin pressurization or oxygen can get there. It’s the highway of the sky and requires an instrument flight plan and Air Traffic Control (ATC) clearance to fly there.\nClass B, C, and D\nThese three types of airspace look like a cylinder and surround airports. Class B is around the nations busiest airports, like Atlanta. Class C is slightly less busy, like Nashville. Class D is less busy and are usually mostly general aviation airports, like Athens, Georgia. All of these start at the surface of the earth and extend up to a height marked on the sectional chart. Class D is a single cylinder of airspace, but you’ll see multiple cylinders of airspace stacked in class B and C – like a can on top of a smaller can, or an upside down wedding cake. How do you know the airspace on the map? By the color of the lines. Solid blue rings are the Class B boundaries, solid magenta for the Class C, and a dashed blue for Class D. Drone pilots can’t fly in any of this airspace without Air Traffic Control authorization.\nClass G – Uncontrolled Airspace\nWoah, uncontrolled and out of control! Well, not really. For Class G, I think “G for ground.” This is a layer that starts at the ground and generally goes up to 1200 feet above the ground (AGL). There are a few charted areas of class G that goes up beyond that, usually in mountainous regions, but don’t sweat that for now – just know it’s the airspace near the ground. It’s called “uncontrolled” because it’s not serviced by air traffic control. You’re on your own, kid. This is the only airspace that drones are allowed to fly in without special Air Traffic Control permission or an FAA waiver. Really, the key to staying IN class G airspace as a drone operator is knowing the other airspace to stay OUT of.\nWhy did I go out of order? Because I like to think of “E for everywhere else,” because that’s what Class E essentially is. You’ll find it everywhere else we didn’t just define. It’s the filler airspace that start above the G near the ground and outside of the B, C and D airspace cylinders that surround airports. One thing that you’ll see commonly on the map is magenta bands around some airports. The outside of the band has a hard edge, and the inside of the band faded. In this ring, the class E airspace begins at 700 feet AGL instead of the usual 1200 feet AGL. I think of these rings like little bowls of class E airspace that pull the floor of Class E from 1200 down to 700 feet above the ground. In some cases, a dashed magenta area will be an area of Class E that is pulled from its usual 1200 foot start all the way to the surface.\nPut It All Together\nThink of airspace like this. From the ground up to the first 1200 feet is class G. Once you get above that, you are in Class E all the way up, except the layer of class A from 18,000 to 60,000 feet. Once you get near an airport, you will likely find either class B, C, or D surrounding it like a can up to a certain height, shown on the map. It’s really that simple. Sure, there are some exceptions. There are no fly zones for airplanes and drones alike. Some airports are surrounded by class E to the surface. There are places where Class G goes from the surface all the way up to 14,500, military operation areas, and the like, but those are outside the scope of this airspace primer and they can best be found by spending a little time with a sectional chart and its legend. Apps like Foreflight for airplane pilots and Kitty Hawk for drone pilots can help to stay in the airspace you want – or more importantly out of the airspace you don’t want to be in. You can have a look at a sectional chart here and begin looking for areas of airspace. Remember, before you get into the nuances, exceptions and random unusual areas of airspace, you must start by having a good working visualization of how the basic airspace works. Then, if you can figure out how to mark the sky with the various airspace boundaries, we could make a comfortable living pitching it to the FAA.\nSubscribe to our mailing list for great content each week!

{"question":"Could you explain how depression and anxiety disorders differ in their co-occurrence patterns with other mental health conditions, particularly comparing their relationship with substance use disorders and social impairments?","answer":"Depression and anxiety disorders show distinct yet overlapping patterns in their co-occurrence with other conditions. Depression commonly co-occurs with anxiety disorders, substance use disorders, and eating disorders. People with depression who develop substance use disorders often use substances like alcohol or drugs as a coping mechanism, which can worsen depression symptoms. As for anxiety disorders, they frequently present alongside other mood disorders, particularly depression, with this co-occurrence being very common. Both conditions can significantly impact social functioning, with depression causing difficulties in work, school, or personal relationships, while anxiety disorders, especially social anxiety disorder, specifically cause people to fear or avoid social situations due to concerns about humiliation or embarrassment.","context":["Understanding Depression: An Overview\nDepression, is a term we often hear but may not fully understand. It's more than just feeling sad or down on occasion. Depression is a complex mental health disorder that affects every aspect of a person's life, from their emotions and thoughts to their physical health and relationships with others.\nDepression goes beyond the occasional blues or feeling low. It's a persistent feeling of sadness, hopelessness, or a lack of interest or pleasure in things that once brought joy. It's often accompanied by physical symptoms, such as changes in appetite, sleep disturbances, and a lack of energy.\nUnderstanding depression is the first step towards helping ourselves or a loved one who may be struggling. It's crucial to learn about the causes, symptoms, and types of depression, as well as the treatment options available. This article aims to provide a comprehensive guide to understanding depression, its impact on mental health, and the journey towards recovery.\nThe Impact of Mental Disorders on Mental Health\nMental disorders, including depression, have a significant impact on mental health. They can affect how we think, feel, and behave, leading to difficulties in daily life, such as work, school, or relationships. Mental disorders can cause distress, impair function, and increase the risk of physical health problems, such as heart disease and diabetes.\nDepression, in particular, is one of the most common mental disorders and a leading cause of disability worldwide. It can lead to severe mental distress and impair a person's ability to function at work, school, or in their personal life. Depression can also increase the risk of other mental and physical health problems, such as anxiety disorders, substance use disorders, and suicide.\nDespite the significant impact of mental disorders on mental health, they are often misunderstood and stigmatised. This can lead to delays in seeking help and treatment, worsening the impact on mental health. Therefore, it's crucial to increase awareness and understanding of mental disorders, including depression, to promote mental health and wellbeing.\nNavigating the Mental Disorders List: Key Disorders to Be Aware Of\nThe list of mental disorders is long and varied, with each disorder having its own unique set of symptoms, causes, and treatment options. Some of the key disorders to be aware of include depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and substance use disorders.\nDepressive disorders, which include major depressive disorder and persistent depressive disorder, are characterised by persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and a lack of interest or pleasure in activities. Anxiety disorders, which include generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and social anxiety disorder, are characterised by excessive and persistent worry and fear.\nBipolar disorder is characterised by periods of depression and periods of mania, which is a state of elevated or irritable mood. Schizophrenia is characterised by disturbances in thinking, perception, and behaviour. Substance use disorders involve the misuse of substances such as alcohol, prescription medications, and illegal drugs.\nUnderstanding these key mental disorders can help us recognise the signs and symptoms in ourselves or others and seek help early. It can also help us support those who may be struggling and promote mental health and wellbeing in our communities.\nSymptoms, Causes, and Types\nDepression is a complex disorder with a wide range of symptoms, causes, and types. The symptoms of depression can vary from person to person, but they often include persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or a lack of interest or pleasure in activities. Other symptoms can include changes in appetite or weight, sleep disturbances, a lack of energy, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, difficulty concentrating, and thoughts of death or suicide.\nThe causes of depression are often a combination of genetic, biological, environmental, and psychological factors. Some people may be genetically predisposed to depression, while others may develop depression in response to a significant life event or stressor. Depression can also be linked to certain medical conditions or medications.\nThere are several types of depression, including major depressive disorder, persistent depressive disorder, and bipolar disorder. Major depressive disorder involves a severe depressive episode that lasts for at least two weeks. Persistent depressive disorder involves a chronic form of depression that lasts for at least two years. Bipolar disorder involves periods of depression and periods of mania.\nUnderstanding the symptoms, causes, and types of depression can help us recognise the signs and symptoms in ourselves or others, seek help early, and support those who may be struggling.\nThe Connection Between Depression and Other Mental Disorders\nDepression often doesn't occur in isolation. It's often co-occurring with other mental disorders, such as anxiety disorders, substance use disorders, and eating disorders. This can complicate the diagnosis and treatment of depression and increase the impact on mental health.\nPeople with depression are more likely to have an anxiety disorder. The symptoms of depression and anxiety can often overlap, such as feelings of sadness, worry, and physical symptoms like changes in sleep and appetite. The presence of both depression and anxiety can worsen the severity of both disorders and increase the risk of suicide.\nSubstance use disorders are also common among people with depression. Some people may use substances like alcohol or drugs to cope with the symptoms of depression. However, substance use can worsen the symptoms of depression and increase the risk of other health problems.\nUnderstanding the connection between depression and other mental disorders can help us recognise the signs and symptoms, seek help early, and support those who may be struggling.\nTreatment Options for Depression and Other Mental Disorders\nFortunately, depression and other mental disorders are treatable. The treatment options for depression often involve a combination of medication, psychotherapy, and self-care. The specific treatment plan will depend on the severity of the depression, the presence of other mental or physical health problems, and the individual's personal preferences and needs.\nMedication, such as antidepressants, can help manage the symptoms of depression. Psychotherapy, or talk therapy, can help people with depression understand and manage their thoughts, feelings, and behaviours. Cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT), interpersonal therapy (IPT), and problem-solving therapy are some of the most effective forms of psychotherapy for depression.\nSelf-care is also an essential part of treatment for depression. This can include lifestyle changes, such as regular exercise, a healthy diet, adequate sleep, and reducing alcohol and caffeine. Mindfulness and relaxation techniques, such as meditation, yoga, and deep breathing, can also help manage the symptoms of depression.\nSelf-Care and Managing Mental Health\nSelf-care is not just about treating depression but also about maintaining mental health and preventing the onset or recurrence of depression. It involves taking care of our physical, mental, and emotional health, which can improve our mood, reduce stress, and enhance our overall wellbeing.\nPhysical self-care includes activities like regular exercise, a healthy diet, adequate sleep, and regular medical check-ups. Exercise can boost our mood and energy levels, while a healthy diet can provide the nutrients our brain needs to function properly. Adequate sleep is essential for our mental health, as lack of sleep can worsen the symptoms of depression.\nMental and emotional self-care includes activities like mindfulness and relaxation techniques, socialising with friends and family, engaging in hobbies and interests, and seeking help when needed. Mindfulness and relaxation techniques can help reduce stress and improve our mood.\nSocialising with friends and family can provide emotional support while engaging in hobbies and interests can provide a sense of enjoyment and achievement.\nResources and Support Systems for Dealing with Depression\nLiving with depression can be challenging, but you don't have to do it alone. There are many resources and support systems available to help you deal with depression and other mental disorders.\nProfessional help is often the first step in dealing with depression. This can include a general practitioner, psychiatrist, psychologist, or other mental health professional. They can provide a diagnosis, treatment plan, and ongoing support and monitoring.\nSupport groups can also be a valuable resource. They provide a safe and supportive environment where you can share your experiences, learn from others, and receive emotional support. Online resources, such as websites and apps, can provide information, tools, and strategies to manage depression.\nFamily and friends can also be a crucial support system. They can provide emotional support, help with daily tasks, and encourage you to seek help and stick to your treatment plan. However, it's important for them to also take care of their own mental health and seek support if needed.\nThe Role of Mental Health Advocacy in Addressing Depression\nMental health advocacy plays a crucial role in addressing depression and promoting mental health. It involves raising awareness of mental disorders, fighting stigma, and advocating for policies and services that support mental health.\nRaising awareness of depression and other mental disorders can help increase understanding and compassion, reduce stigma, and encourage people to seek help early. Fighting stigma is crucial, as it can prevent people from seeking help and worsen the impact of mental disorders on mental health.\nAdvocating for policies and services that support mental health can help ensure that people with depression and other mental disorders have access to the care and support they need. This can include advocating for mental health to be included in public health policies, for increased funding for mental health research and services, and for the rights of people with mental disorders to be respected and protected.\nConclusion: The Journey Towards Mental Health Recovery\nUnderstanding depression is the first step towards the journey towards mental health recovery. It's a complex disorder, but with the right knowledge, treatment, and support, recovery is possible.\nThe journey towards recovery can be challenging and long, but it's important to remember that you are not alone. There are many resources and support systems available to help you along the way.\nIt's also important to remember that it's okay to ask for help, and it's okay to take care of yourself.\nRemember, mental health is just as important as physical health. By understanding depression, we can promote mental health and wellbeing in ourselves and our communities. So let's continue the conversation, fight the stigma, and support each other on the journey towards mental health recovery.","Anxiety is a normal response to stress, worry or threat – but when it is very severe, long-lasting, or out of proportion to the circumstances, it becomes known as an anxiety disorder.\nThere are several different types of anxiety disorder: for example, generalised anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, panic disorder and obsessive–compulsive disorder. By affecting a person’s mood, thoughts and behaviour, an anxiety disorder can make it difficult to cope with daily life at home, at work or school, and when socialising.\nThe cause of anxiety disorders it not known. However, certain alterations in brain functions have been shown to be implicated in various anxiety disorders. In addition, social conditions and stresses may contribute to the risk of developing an anxiety disorder.\nAlthough they vary between individuals, typical symptoms of anxiety disorders include fear, inner tension, irritability and poor concentration, and physical signs such as dry mouth, dizziness, tense muscles, sweating and palpitations – all of which interfere with daily life. A person may suffer from more than one anxiety disorder at the same time, and sometimes alongside other mood disorders such as depression (so-called ‘co-morbidity’). The co-occurrence of anxiety and depression is very common.\nGeneralised anxiety disorder (GAD) involves a non-specific anxiety that something undesirable could happen. Excessive and uncontrollable worry, anxiety and tension are typical symptoms, together with physical symptoms such as dry mouth, clammy hands, sweating or dizziness.\n¨ Social anxiety disorder (SAD) causes people to fear or avoid social situations. The person fears that he or she will act in a way that will be humiliating or embarrassing.\n¨ Panic disorder is typified by sudden panic attacks associated with marked fear or nervousness. Panic disorder can also include physical symptoms such as sweating, pain, headache, nausea, a pounding heart or a dry mouth.\n¨ Obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) causes repetitive, obtrusive and unwanted thoughts, which result in unreasonable fears (obsessions) associated with cleanliness, body secretions or health, for example. In response to these fears, patients may also carry out special rituals (compulsions), including persistent washing, cleaning, bathing, constant checking and rechecking, or maintaining a rigid diet.\nIt has been estimated that anxiety disorders affect between 5 and 7% of the general population, and that up to 29% of people will suffer from an anxiety disorder at least once during their lifetime.1 In 2004, over 28 million people worldwide had obsessive–compulsive disorder, and over 30 million experienced panic disorder.2\nAnxiety disorders affect both men and women across the world, but the burden of the disease is greater in women than in men.3\nSeeking diagnosis and care\nMany treatments are available to effectively manage anxiety disorders, and personal support from family and friends is valuable at all stages.\nDuring a medical appointment, a doctor will diagnose anxiety disorders by asking questions about symptoms, daily life and family history. There may also be a physical examination to exclude other conditions. If an anxiety disorder is confirmed, treatment options will then be considered, including medications, counselling, social support, exercise, relaxation and self-help techniques.\nIn all cases, it is important that professional advice is sought.\n1.

{"question":"When & where are Peak District well dressings held? Can't miss this! Which town starts first?","answer":"Well dressings in the Peak District take place between the end of May and early September, primarily in the limestone villages of the central and southern peak. Tissington traditionally holds the earliest festival in late May, while Eyam hosts the last major festival in late August. Other locations outside the Peak District that participate include Chesterfield, Etwall, Endon, and Penistone.","context":["Ashford well 2005\nThe blessing of the watersupply, in the form of the well, is an ancient custom which is unique to the Peak District and the surrounding areas such as South Yorkshire and East Staffordshire. The custom had almost died out in the 1950s, but since then it has been revived with great vigour, primarily for the tourist industry.\nSome sources attribute the practice to the period of the Black Death in 1348-9, when probably a third of the population of England died of the disease, but some villages such as Tissington were untouched.\nThe local people attributed this to their clean water supply and gave thanks by 'dressing' the village wells. However, it seems very likely that the practice goes back much further than this - probably to pagan times - and the fact that many well dressings have a 'well queen' suggests echoes of ancient spring fertility rites.\nThe practice is continued mainly in the limestone villages of the central and southern peak with a succession of different villages dressing their wells between the end of May and early September. Traditionally, Tissington is the earliest in late May, and Eyam is the last of the large festivals at the end of August. Outside the Peak District, places which 'dress' their wells include Chesterfield, Etwall (near Derby), Endon (near Stoke on Trent) and Penistone (South Yorkshire).\nThe construction of the well dressings is a skilful art in which frequently almost the whole population of the village is involved, and usually takes about ten days to perform. Wet clay is spread to a depth of a couple of inches across a wooden backing board, a design is 'pricked out' using a paper pattern and then petals and other items are placed in the areas laid out by the design. This is a laborious and time-consuming process, and the clay has to be kept damp or it will crack and the petalls will fall off.\nPetalling the welldressing\nAfter the well dressing is erected next to the well it is blessed in a short outdoor service, and usually a brass band will be hired for the occasion. Since many of the towns and villages have several wells, there will then be a procession around the town to bless each one in turn.\nBand at Eyam welldressing\nThe well blessing ceremony is usually the signal for the start of a week of celebrations (or 'wakes') with a range of events often culminating in a carnival at the end of the week.\nSee also the article on Well Dressing Art\nand the current well dressing list\n- Click Here\nfor a slide show\n0 - Tideswell well dressing 2019\n1 - Litton welldressing 2019\n2 - Cressbrook welldressing 2019\n3 - Bradwell Town end welldressing 2019\n4 - Bradwell welldressing 2019\n5 - Hucklow welldressing 2019\n6 - Welldressing at Ashford, 2001\n7 - Welldressing at Ashford, 2001\n8 - Welldressing at Ashford, 2003\n9 - Welldressing at Ashford, 2005\n10 - Welldressing at Ashford, 2005\n11 - Ashford Welldressing\n12 - Ashford Welldressing\n13 - Bradwell welldressing\n14 - Welldressing at Cressbrook, 2000\n15 - Welldressing at Cressbrook, 2005\n16 - Eyam Town Head welldressing, 1996\n17 - Eyam childrens' welldressing, 1996\n18 - Eyam main welldressing, 1996\n19 - Eyam - brass band in welldressing parade\n20 - Litton childrens' welldressing, 2001\n21 - Litton welldressing, 2001\n22 - Litton childrens' welldressing, 2004\n23 - Litton welldressing, 2004\n24 - Litton - traditional dancing in Wakes week\n25 - Monyash well dressing, 2004\n26 - Tideswell welldressing, 2004\n27 - Tissington Well Dressing\n28 - Wardlow welldressing, 1996\n29 - Wormhill welldressing, 1996"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:879907e5-68cb-478c-871e-9f0a583c4d21>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Hello! Research on infectious causes make me curious - how infection in pregnancy relates to brain chemistry in schizophrenia patients?","answer":"Infections during pregnancy can affect brain chemistry in schizophrenia through multiple mechanisms. Maternal infections, particularly with viruses like HSV and CMV, can impact fetal neurodevelopment and alter important neurotransmitter systems. These changes affect dopamine (where overload causes positive symptoms like hallucinations and delusions), glutamate (with significantly low NMDA receptors in schizophrenia patients), and other neurotransmitters like serotonin, γ-aminobutyric acid, and acetylcholine. This is supported by animal models showing how exposure to specific infectious agents during neurodevelopment leads to later behavioral alterations, affecting neural circuitry particularly in the mesolimbic pathway.","context":["Infectious Agents in Schizophrenia and Bipolar Disorder\nInfectious Agents in Schizophrenia and Bipolar Disorder\nThe idea that schizophrenia and bipolar disorder might be caused by infection is not new. This was a prominent hypothesis in the early years of the last century. For example, an article entitled, Is insanity due to a microbe? was published in Scientific American as early as 1896. Research to test this hypothesis by identifying causative viruses was already being conducted by the 1930s, when data were reported from experiments in which cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from patients with schizophrenia was injected into rabbit brains.1\nNew research in the field continues, aided increasingly by impressive technologic advances in microbiology and virology. As recently as the past decade, reports documented the presence of influenza virus, rubella virus, bovine disease virus, and other infectious agents in patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, as well as the presence of other infectious agents in childhood pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS) and obsessive-compulsive disorder.\nIn this article, we briefly highlight the background of such research; discuss our own research on Toxoplasma gondii, herpes simplex virus (HSV), Cytomegalovirus (CMV), and endogenous retroviruses; and consider the future implications of such research for psychiatric clinicians.\nBackground and rationale\nWhy should we look for infectious agents in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder? Such a hypothesis is consistent with the known genetic contributions to these disorders. Indeed, a genetic predisposition is well established for most chronic infectious diseases, including tuberculosis, malaria, polio, AIDS, and peptic ulcers caused by Helicobacter pylori.2 The hypothesis is consistent with the role of neurotransmitter abnormalities in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, because specific infectious agents have been shown to alter dopamine, serotonin, glutamate, γ-aminobutyric acid, and acetylcholine in animal models. The hypothesis is also consistent with neurodevelopmental models of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Pearce3 and others developed animal models that show how exposure to specific infectious agents during neurodevelopment correlates with later behavioral alterations in animals.\nAn additional important reason to look for infectious agents in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder is that CNS infection by specific pathogens frequently mimics the clinical symptoms of primary psychiatric diseases. For example, Caroff and colleagues4 reviewed 108 cases of psychiatric disorders resulting from suspected or confirmed CNS viral infections; in 62 cases, a specific virus was implicated, including HIV, HSV-1, HSV-2, Epstein-Barr, and CMV; and measles, mumps, coxsackie, and influenza viruses. Among bacteria, the fact that the spirochete of syphilis can cause the symptoms of schizophrenia was well known to psychiatric clinicians of an earlier era. More recently, infection with the spirochetal organism Borrelia burgdorferi has also been associated with schizophrenia-like symptoms in some persons.5\nAnother reason to look for infectious agents in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder is the well-established association between the risk of these disorders and winter-spring seasonal birth.6 There have been more than 200 studies of this phenomenon, and it remains one of the most highly replicated findings of these diseases. Because many infectious diseases occur seasonally, with a peak in the winter or spring, it is reasonable to postulate that fetal or newborn infection could contribute to subsequent mental illness.7\nAt the present time, we are focusing our research on 4 infectious agents as possible causes of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. These are T gondii, HSV-1 and HSV-2, CMV, and endogenous retroviruses.\nT gondii is a protozoan parasite whose definitive host is the cat family. Humans become infected by ingesting oocysts shed in the feces of infected cats or by eating undercooked meat from an animal that came into contact with infected cat feces. T gondii is one of the most widespread human parasites; 10% to 20% of Americans test seropositive by adulthood. Exposure to T gondii during early pregnancy can cause severe fetal CNS abnormalities. Exposure during late pregnancy was never considered a problem until recently, when animal data showed that late exposure to the organism causes behavioral changes, neurologic symptoms, and stillbirths.8,9\nSince 1956, more than 20 studies have compared antibodies to T gondii in adults with and without schizophrenia.10 An overall analysis of the studies indicates that serologic evidence of Toxoplasma infection is almost 3 times more common in persons with schizophrenia than in controls living in the same geographic region.Two additional studies reported an increased level of T gondii antibodies in the late-pregnancy serum of women giving birth to infants in whom schizophrenia later developed. 11,12 Other studies have reported greater childhood exposure to cats among persons with schizophrenia than among controls.13,14 Our research is focusing on the timing of Toxoplasma infections in relation to development, as well as on possible differences in T gondii strains and human genetic susceptibility.\nHerpes simplex viruses\nLike Toxoplasma, HSV-1 and HSV-2 are common causes of infection in humans. HSV-1 may be spread by either sexual or nonsexual contact with infected persons, while HSV-2 is primarily spread through sexual contact. Both of these viruses are known to cause encephalitis and to be highly neurotropic. Traditionally, however, these viruses have been regarded as relatively benign in the majority of asymptomatic patients who carry them. Recent data suggest that this may not be true. One study evaluated the mothers of patients in whom schizophrenia or bipolar disorder developed. These women had increased levels of HSV-2 serum antibodies just before parturition.15\nComparison studies of persons with and without schizophrenia or bipolar disorder show that HSV-1 infection significantly increases cognitive dysfunction—especially recent memory deficits—in persons with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.16,17 This did not occur in persons infected with other viruses in the herpes family and also did not occur in persons without schizophrenia or bipolar disorder who were infected with HSV-1.\nIn a follow-up study, Dickerson and associates18 showed that a polymorphism on the COMT gene (COMT Val 158 Met polymorphism) also increases cognitive dysfunction; this suggests a synergistic effect between HSV infection and the gene. This kind of interaction may be a model for future research that integrates multiple factors in the development of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.","Schizophrenia is a severe disease in which individuals are plagued with hallucinations, delusions, disorganized speech, as well as social dysfunction. Although an exact cause of the disease has not yet been discovered, researchers are aware that a number of factors may contribute to its development. Genetics, environment, brain structure, and brain chemistry can each be analyzed and broken down separately.\nWhat Causes Schizophrenia?\nThere are a number of possible causes, but scientists have not been able to pinpoint an “exact” cause. There may be a number of contributing factors that play role in the development of this debilitating disorder. These contributing factors include: genetics, environment, brain chemistry, and brain structure.\nAlthough scientists have associated specific things as being linked to schizophrenia, the causes remain a mystery. As research advances and we look at this disease from all angles, it is hoped that better treatment options and ultimately cure will be discovered.\nThe fact is that if a person has one or more parents with schizophrenia, the likelihood of that individual developing schizophrenia increases drastically. When looking at severe disorders like schizophrenia, there is typically a strong genetic link.\n- 10% risk – If you have a first-degree relative with the disease.\n- 40% risk – If you have an identical twin with the disease.\nNote: 60% of individuals that develop schizophrenia have no close relative with the illness.\nThis risk is lower than I would’ve suspected. I find that 10% risk is pretty low for having a first degree relative with the disease; my estimations would’ve been greater.\nIn regards to a genetic link to schizophrenia, it is nearly impossible to pin down an exact DNA sequence or gene for causing the disease. There are certain mutations and genes that we know are implicated. Scientists have developed hypotheses linking variations such as the:\n- Histone H3\n- Zinc finger protein 804A\nInterestingly enough, there appears to be an overlap in the genetics of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. I’m a huge advocate for genetic research because I believe that if we are going to get serious about curing this disease, we are going to need to permanently normalize / fix the genetics that are causing the symptoms.\nGeneticists and researchers have questioned how schizophrenia developed and evolved in the first place. Some think that as language continued to evolve, certain genes also evolved and individuals actually started hearing voices. Obviously this is a maladaptive evolution in the eyes of many – including those coping with the disease.\nAs you should know, genetics are only part of the equation. If a person grows up in impoverished living conditions, the likelihood of mental health problems increases. In my mind, genetics are the trickiest and single most influential factor in diseases like schizophrenia. Although environment should still be analyzed, I feel as though if you have favorable genetics, the likelihood of developing this disease drops drastically.\nKey environmental factors in schizophrenia\n- Parenting styles: No major link\nParenting styles have been analyzed in individuals with schizophrenia and they had no major influence on the development of this disease. Individuals with supportive parents generally cope better with their disease in comparison to those with neglectful or hostile parents. Similar findings have been made in an array of mental illnesses.\n- Urban environment: Increased risk (2x)\nGrowing up as a child in an urban environment has a significant link between increasing risk of schizophrenia by 2x. I’m wondering if this could be as a result of the increased stress associated with urban living in comparison to a more relaxed suburban or rural lifestyle. Maybe the stress activates or deactivates certain genes which would otherwise be dormant in adult life? I can only hypothesize.\n- Drug abuse: Possible increased risk\nThe drug that is most linked to increased risk of schizophrenia is cannabis (marijuana). There is evidence that use of marijuana contributes to earlier onset of the disease in those that are susceptible. Some argue that it there is actually a causal link between cannabis and schizophrenia. For further reading, check out the article “Can Smoking Marijuana Cause Schizophrenia?”\nAmphetamines and uppers like cocaine that release high amounts of dopamine into the brain can trigger a psychotic episode – but this is not the same thing as schizophrenia. This is called amphetamine induced psychosis – and is similar, but will eventually subside when the individual goes through a full blown amphetamine withdrawal. Perhaps the most interesting fact is that individuals with schizophrenia tend to use nicotine at significantly greater rates than the general population. Many famous people with schizophrenia have a history of drug abuse prior to onset of the illness.\n- Social isolation: May increase risk\nOne factor that has been investigated regarding schizophrenia is that of “social isolation.” Researchers have wondered whether the isolation can be a direct contributing cause of the disease developing or whether it is merely a side effect of the disease. There’s a chicken vs. egg type argument here in regards to social isolation and schizophrenia.\n- Infection in womb: Increased risk\nMothers that are infected with viruses in the womb may put their offspring at greater risk for development of schizophrenia. Thus far scientists have discovered that in 30% of people with acute schizophrenia, a virus in the HERV-W retrovirus family was found.\n- Birth Season (Winter / Spring): Increased risk\nThere is an increased risk of 5% to 8% of developing schizophrenia as a baby born in a winter or spring season in the northern hemisphere. Some hypothesize this may be due to the likelihood of developing a virus in utero increases during these times of the year.\n- Big families: Slightly increased risk\nIn bigger families that have short gaps between births of their children (<2 years), there seems to be slightly greater risk of developing infections, which could lead to the development of schizophrenia.\n- Parasite: Possible increased risk\nCertain studies have linked toxoplasmosis to schizophrenia. The interesting aspect of this is the fact that this parasite can go undetected in the nervous system for years. This parasite is primarily transferred to humans by cats. It can take many years for its effects to fully reach the brain.\n- Other factors: May increase risk\nSeveral other factors including: immigration, viruses, malnutrition, hypoxia, racial discrimination, familial dysfunction, unemployment, poor housing conditions, and high amounts of stressors have all been hypothesized to be contributing factors.\n3. Brain chemistry\nDifferences in brain chemistry have been studied comparing those affected with schizophrenia to normal test subjects. In most studies comparing those with schizophrenia to those without, fMRI and PET were used to compare brains.\nDopamine hypothesis – This suggests that psychosis is a result of dopaminergic neurons that are misfiring or dysfunctional. This is one of the most popular hypotheses in regards to brain chemistry causing schizophrenia. Generally it is widely accepted that an overload of dopamine is what causes positive symptoms such as: hallucinations and delusions.\nGlutamate – Significantly low amounts of glutamate receptors (NMDA receptors) have been found in those diagnosed with schizophrenia. Due to the fact that an array of cognitive problems are linked to reductions in glutamate function, many have suggested these receptors may play an important role in the condition.\nLack of hemispheric synchrony – There is some evidence that points to the fact that the left and right hemispheres of the brain are unable to communicate with each other for the transfer of information and general functioning.\nNeural circuitry – Is altered in those with schizophrenia – particularly in the mesolimbic pathway. Most think that excess activation of the D2 receptors lead to causing the positive symptoms of schizophrenia. PET scans have provided evidence supporting overactivation of the D2 receptors.\n4. Brain structure\nAltered brain connectivity – Individuals with this disease experience altered brain connectivity compared to normal subjects. The dysfunctional interaction between brain regions has been proposed to be a central feature of the illness.\nAmygdala & limbic dysfunction – Deficits in amygdala reactivity and connectivity between amygdala and subgenual cingulated have also been implicated.\n- Frontal lobes\n- Temporal lobes\nNote: Most differences in people with schizophrenia tend to have significant functioning differences in the frontal lobes, hippocampus, as well as temporal lobe regions of the brain.\nBrain volume – Those with schizophrenia tend to have significant reductions in overall brain volume. In fact, they tend to be even more severe than individuals affected with Alzehimer’s disease in the frontal cortex and temporal lobes. Studies have been done comparing the brains of identical twins – one with schizophrenia and the other disease free. These comparisons have been able to show that smaller brain volume is a factor in those with schizophrenia. This smaller volume reduces ability to think, memorize, and concentrate on tasks.\nGray matter – Decreased gray matter has been found in several brain regions of those with this illness including: middle temporal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, and anterior cingulated. Interestingly enough is the fact that there is a negative correlation between positive symptoms and gray matter volume.\nWhite matter – Reduced amounts of white matter have been discovered in brain regions of those with schizophrenia compared to others. If you want to get more in depth, you can look up the specific regional differences and percentages."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"language-ambiguous"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:91febd72-1b36-4a02-9d17-7ddc1fc0e452>","<urn:uuid:9de48f53-c09c-4bf1-89eb-2729b2a86a43>"],"error":null}
{"question":"As a medical physics student, I'm interested in radiation safety. How do the radiation protection measures differ between traditional extremity angiography procedures and NOMAD Pro 2 Veterinary system? Which one provides better operator protection?","answer":"In traditional extremity angiography, operators protect themselves by operating the x-ray remotely and using lead aprons/thyroid shields. In contrast, the NOMAD Pro 2 Veterinary system uses an external backscatter shield and internal radiation shielding that creates a cone-shaped protection zone with a 6-foot diameter, protecting the operator's entire body while standing near the device. The NOMAD Pro 2 Veterinary system appears to provide better operator protection, as it results in exposure less than 1% of allowed occupational doses, while still protecting against both direct and backscatter radiation.","context":["Extremity angiographyAngiography of the extremity; Peripheral angiography; Lower extremity angiogram; Peripheral angiogram; Arteriography of the extremity; PAD - angiography; Peripheral artery disease - angiography\nExtremity angiography is a test used to see the arteries in the hands, arms, feet, or legs. It is also called peripheral angiography.\nAngiography uses x-rays and a special dye to see inside the arteries. Arteries are blood vessels that carry blood away from the heart.\nHow the Test is Performed\nThis test is done in a hospital. You will lie on an x-ray table. You may ask for some medicine to make you sleep and relax (sedative).\n- The health care provider will shave and clean an area, most often in the groin.\n- A numbing medicine (anesthetic) is injected into the skin over an artery.\n- A needle is placed into that artery.\n- A thin plastic tube called a catheter is passed through the needle into the artery. The doctor moves it into the area of the body being studied. The doctor can see live images of the area on a TV-like monitor, and uses them as a guide.\n- Dye flows through the catheter and into the arteries.\n- X-ray images are taken of the arteries.\nCertain treatments can be done during this procedure. These treatments include:\n- Dissolving a blood clot with medicine\n- Opening a partially blocked artery with a balloon\n- Placing a small tube called a stent into an artery to help hold it open\nThe health care team will check your pulse (heart rate), blood pressure, and breathing during the procedure.\nThe catheter is removed when the test is done. Pressure is placed on the area for 10 to 15 minutes to stop any bleeding. A bandage is then put on the wound.\nThe arm or leg where the needle was placed should be kept straight for 6 hours after the procedure. You should avoid strenuous activity, such as heavy lifting, for 24 to 48 hours.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou should not eat or drink anything for 6 to 8 hours before the test.\nYou may be told to stop taking certain medicines, such as aspirin or other blood thinners for a short while before the test. Never stop taking any medicines unless told to do so by your provider.\nMake sure your provider knows about all the medicines you take, including those you bought without a prescription. This includes herbs and supplements.\nTell your provider if you:\n- Are pregnant\n- Are allergic to any medicines\n- Have ever had an allergic reaction to x-ray contrast material, shellfish, or iodine substances\n- Have ever had any bleeding problems\nHow the Test will Feel\nThe x-ray table is hard and cold. You may want to ask for a blanket or pillow. You may feel some stinging when the numbing medicine is injected. You may also feel some pressure as the catheter is moved.\nThe dye can cause a feeling of warmth and flushing. This is normal and most often goes away in a few seconds.\nYou may have tenderness and bruising at the site of the catheter insertion after the test. Seek immediate medical help if you have:\n- Bleeding that doesn't go away\n- Severe pain in an arm or leg\nWhy the Test is Performed\nYou may need this test if you have symptoms of a narrowed or blocked blood vessel in the arms, hands, legs, or feet.\nThe test may also be done to diagnose:\n- Swelling or inflammation of the blood vessels (vasculitis)\nThe x-ray shows normal structures for your age.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAn abnormal result is commonly due to narrowing and hardening of the arteries in the arms or legs from plaque buildup (hardening of the arteries) in the artery walls.\nThe x-ray may show a blockage in the vessels caused by:\n- Aneurysms (abnormal widening or ballooning of part of an artery)\n- Blood clots\n- Other diseases of the arteries\nAbnormal results may also be due to:\n- Inflammation of the blood vessels\n- Injury to the blood vessels\n- Thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger disease)\n- Takayasu disease\nComplications may include:\n- Allergic reaction to the contrast dye\n- Blood clot that travels to the lungs\n- Damage to the blood vessel as the needle and catheter are inserted\n- Excessive bleeding or a blood clot where the catheter is inserted, which can reduce blood flow to the leg\n- Heart attack or stroke\n- Hematoma, a collection of blood at the site of the needle puncture\n- Injury to the nerves at the needle puncture site\n- Kidney damage from the dye\n- Injury to the blood vessels being tested\nThere is low-level radiation exposure. However, most experts feel that the risk of most x-rays low compared with benefits. Pregnant women and children are more sensitive to the risks of the x-ray.\nAmerican Heart Association.

Backscatter radiation from a patient’s jaw can reflect back at the operator or to other parts of the patient. Because of this, lead aprons and/or thyroid shields are usually used to protect the patient, and conventional X-ray generators are operated remotely, in order to protect the operator.\nHowever, NOMAD Pro 2 Veterinary is designed with safety in mind. The external backscatter shield and internal radiation shielding are specially designed to protect the operator from radiation exposure. In fact, the exposure from using NOMAD Pro 2 Veterinary is less than 1% of allowed occupational doses. NOMAD Pro 2 Veterinary is safe!\n- Standards for Protection Against Radiation, 10 CFR 20 (US Federal Standards), 1994 (see also NCRP Report No. 116)\n- NCRP Report No. 145 (National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements), p7-9\n- “Estimated Cosmic Radiation Doses for Flight Personnel”, Feng YJ et al, Space Medicine and Medical Engineering, 15(4) 2002, p265-9\n- Normalized average assumes 7,200 exposures per year, and the average length of exposure for D-speed=0.50 seconds, F-speed=0.25 seconds, digital sensor=0.20 seconds\nAdditional references: Occupational Dose Limit: Suggested State Regulations for Control of Radiation (SSRCR), Section D.1201; Occupational Dose Limit Requiring Dosimetry: SSRCR, Section D.1502; General Public Dose Limit: SSRCR, Section D.1301\nStudies and Reports\nCommentary: ‘Not all handheld x-ray systems are created equal’\nJoel E.

This shield produces a cone-shaped protection zone extending behind it. At the position where the operator stands, the zone has a diameter of over 6 feet, enough to protect the operator’s entire body.\nIn addition, radiation shielding inside NOMAD Pro 2 Veterinary ensures that leakage from the X-ray source itself is virtually eliminated, protecting the operator’s hands and other areas close to the device.\nHow much exposure is too much?\nRadiation is all around us, all the time. It varies with your lifestyle and where you live. Click here to find out how much exposure you receive in everyday living.\nThe average dose per person from all sources is about 360 mrems per year. International Standards allow exposure to as much as 5,000 mrems a year for those who work with and around radioactive material.

{"question":"What are the two main mechanisms through which butyrate and other fermentation products affect colon cells, and how do prebiotics support this process?","answer":"Butyrate affects colon cells through two distinct mechanisms: 1) In normal cells, it induces proliferation at the crypt base while inhibiting proliferation at the crypt surface; 2) In neoplastic cells, it inhibits DNA synthesis and arrests cell growth in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. These beneficial effects are supported by prebiotics, as they provide the indigestible fiber that probiotic bacteria ferment to produce butyrate. This prebiotic fiber must be able to resist small-intestinal absorption and be fermented by probiotic bacteria to stimulate their growth, ultimately leading to the production of beneficial postbiotic compounds like butyrate.","context":["|« Gluten reaction more common||Toxic chemicals common in body »|\nStudy: Inhibition of histone-deacetylase activity by short-chain fatty acids and some polyphenol metabolites formed in the colon.\nAuthors: Waldecker M, Kautenburger T, Daumann H, Busch C, Schrenk D.\nJournal: Food Chemistry and Environmental Toxicology, University of Kaiserslautern, D-67663 Kaiserslautern, Germany.\nColorectal cancer is the most abundant cause of cancer mortality in the Western world. Nutrition and the microbial flora are considered to have a marked influence on the risk of colorectal cancer, the formation of butyrate and other short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) possibly playing a major role as chemopreventive products of microbial fermentation in the colon.\nAbstract: This study investigated the effects of a number of short chain fatty acids, to include butyrate, as well as a number of phenolic SCFA and trans-cinnamic acid derivatives formed during the intestinal degradation of polyphenolic constituents of fruits and vegetables on global histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity in nuclear extracts from colon carcinoma cell cultures. Inhibition of HDAC activity, e.g., by butyrate, is related to a suppression of malignant transformation and a stimulation of apoptosis of precancerous colonic cells. In nuclear extracts from HT-29 human colon carcinoma cells, butyrate was found to be the most potent HDAC inhibitor (IC(50)=0.09 mM), while other SCFAs such as propionate were less potent. In the same assay, p-coumaric acid (IC(50)=0.19 mM), 3-(4-OH-phenyl)-propionate (IC(50)=0.62 mM) and caffeic acid (IC(50)=0.85 mM) were the most potent HDAC inhibitors among the polyphenol metabolites tested.\nButyrate was also the most potent HDAC inhibitor in a whole-cell HeLa Mad 38-based reporter gene assay, while all polyphenol metabolites and all other SCFAs tested were much less potent; some were completely inactive. The findings suggest that butyrate plays an outstanding role as endogenous HDAC inhibitor in the colon, and that other SCFAs and HDAC-inhibitory polyphenol metabolites present in the colon seem to play a much smaller role, probably because of their limited levels, their marked cytotoxicity and/or their limited intracellular availability.\nCommentary: Butyric acid is notably found in rancid butter, aged cheeses, and has an unpleasant odor and acrid taste, with a sweetish aftertaste. The glyceride of butyric acid makes up 3% to 4% of butter. When butter goes rancid, butyric acid is liberated from the glyceride by hydrolysis leading to the unpleasant odor. It is an important member of the fatty acid sub-group called short chain fatty acids.\nButyric acid supports the health and healing of cells in the small and large intestine. Many research studies, like the one above, have demonstrated that butyric acid impedes the ability of cancer cells to proliferate in the colon, and therefore is protective of colon cancer. Butyric acid changes the structure of chromatin through its effects on posttranslational modifications, key modifications being acetylation and phosphorylation of the nuclear histones. These enzymes remove an acetyl group from histones, which allows histones to bind DNA and inhibit gene transcription. HDAC inhibitors disrupt the cell cycle and/or induce apoptosis via de-repression of genes such as P21 and BAX, and cancer cells appear to be more sensitive than non-transformed cells HDAC inhibitory compounds.\nButyric acid can also modify the differentiation state of cells, and in the case of cancerous colonic cells overcomes their resistance to normal programmed death. Thus, the activities of this fermentation product of dietary fiber may contribute substantially to the decreased incidence of bowel cancer that has been associated with fiber intake. Adverse butyrate effects occur in normal and neoplastic colonic cells. In normal cells, butyrate induces proliferation at the crypt base, while inhibiting proliferation at the crypt surface. In neoplastic cells, butyrate inhibits DNA synthesis and arrests cell growth in the G1 phase of the cell cycle.\nButyric Acid is a key ingredient in Intrinsa. This product is designed to support stomach, small intestine, and colon health using three well-researched ingredients. Usable by all ABO blood types and GenoTypes.","Prebiotics are forms of dietary fiber you can obtain from a variety of different foods and from supplements.\nThis type of fiber plays an important role in good health by supporting and enhancing the activity of the probiotic bacteria living in the guts.\nIn order to understand why prebiotics are important, it’s necessary to first realize the important role probiotics play within the intestinal tract and how their activity benefits the overall health.\nWhat Is Probiotic Bacteria and Why Does It Need Prebiotics?\nProbiotic bacteria is a term that encompasses certain bacteria that lives in the intestines. The intestines contain a lot of different strains of bacteria.\nSome types can harm the health, others are beneficial. The “good” type of bacteria is known as probiotic bacteria. It’s also sometimes referred to as flora.\nThe good and bad bacteria in the guts are like two opposing forces in a war. When the bad bacteria starts to gain ground it can impact the health in many negative ways.\nDiarrhea, weight gain, fatigue, and skin problems are just a few of the problems that may result from a build-up of bad bacteria in the gut.\nWhen the intestines contain more good bacteria than bad bacteria it improves gut health, enforces the immune system and provides other health benefits that contribute to a sense of greater well-being.\nAlthough probiotic bacteria occurs naturally within the digestive tract, certain foods, such as feta cheese and sauerkraut, contain it too. Eating such food increases the amount of good bacteria present in the intestines by adding more.\nConsuming probiotic food, drinks, and supplements is a good way to top up your levels of good bacteria. Doing so has become an increasingly popular practice in recent years.\nConsuming prebiotic food and supplements is another way to increase the amount of probiotic bacteria present in the guts. Like any other organism, bacteria has to be fed. Prebiotics feed probiotic bacteria, thereby helping it to multiply.\nWhat’s So Special about Prebiotic Fiber?\nAlthough all forms of dietary fiber are good for the health, not all fiber is prebiotic.\nThe body cannot digest prebiotic fiber. What the body cannot use, the probiotic bacteria can. When it enters the intestines the bacteria feasts on it and multiplies.\nIn order to be classed as a prebiotic, fiber has to be able to resist small-intestinal absorption, be fermented by probiotic bacteria, and stimulate its growth.\nIf your diet lacks enough of this type of important fiber, the amount of good bacteria present in the intestines may dwindle and your health will suffer.\nAlthough probiotic bacteria gets all the glory, prebiotics are the important silent partner that helps make everything possible.\nBy enhancing probiotic activity in the way that they do, prebiotics can support good health in numerous ways.\nSome examples include:\n- Improves nutrient absorption\n- Reduces levels of potentially pathogenic bacteria\n- Increases the metabolism\n- Promotes fat loss\n- Increases energy\n- Improves immune function\n- Reduces inflammation\n- Supports healthy bowel action\nThe fact that prebiotics are a form of fiber also gives them value in other areas. For instance, food that is high in fiber helps fill the stomach, satiate the appetite, and prevent hunger cravings. [SOURCE 1, SOURCE 2]\nIt’s also important to remember the foods that provide prebiotics are generally a good source of vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and other nutrients. They are not solely prebiotic fiber. The fiber is what is left when all the other nutrients have been digested. Prebiotic food also tends to be very low in fat.\nIn short, the foods that provide prebiotic fiber tend to be healthy options that can support good health in many ways. They do much more than feed probiotic bacteria so it’s important not to underestimate their value or sell them short.\nPrebiotics + Probiotics = Postbiotics\nAs far as the pecking order goes, probiotics have always been the big star when it comes to gut health. Then prebiotics gradually nudged their way into the scene. More recently, researchers have discovered a new name in gut health—postbiotics.\nPostbiotics are the metabolic byproducts probiotic bacteria produces while feeding on prebiotic fiber.\nIt appears some of these byproducts such as butryate (a major energy source for the colon), may actually be responsible for some of the benefits that have previously been directly attributed to probiotics.\nHydrogen peroxide is another postbiotic compound that appears to offer value to the health. It’s produced by the Lactobacillus johnsonii strain of bacteria and research suggests it kills salmonella.\nSo, it appears the way probiotics work may not be as clear-cut as it appears. It’s also apparent there’s a need for a lot more research into the complex subject of gut bacteria and how it affects the overall health. [SOURCE 3, SOURCE 4, SOURCE 5]\nExamples of Prebiotics – Natural Sources\nPrebiotic foods are plant-based. So vegans and vegetarians are likely to already be getting enough of this valuable form of natural fiber.\nSome good prebiotic foods include:\n- Apple cider vinegar\n- Jerusalem artichokes\n- Whole wheat products\nSo, when your mother told you it was important you eat all your greens it was good advice.\nA Closer Look at Inulin and FOS\nThere’s more than one type of prebiotic fiber. That’s why you may encounter a lot of talk about inulin and FOS.\nInulin is a water-soluble fiber that’s low in calories. Chicory and Jerusalem artichoke are particularly good sources of inulin.\n|Inulin / 100g|\nFOS (fructooligosaccharides) is also known as oligofructose and oligofructan. So, if you encounter any of these names they refer to the same thing. Due to its sweet-tasting nature, FOS has value as an artificial sweetener and is slightly different from inulin on a molecular level.\nMost of the FOS and inulin manufacturers add to supplements is extracted from chicory roots or manufactured from sucrose.\nIn recent years, a high performance (HP) form of inulin has become available. It’s a synthetic ingredient that’s less sweet but has more power.\nHowever, although many pill type supplements may use synthetic ingredients, most of the better shake-type supplements and health drinks contain natural ingredients. For this reason, they offer higher nutritional value and are arguably a better option.\nPrebiotic Suitability and Side Effects\nPrebiotic foods and supplements are extremely healthy and good for the body. However, a certain amount of discretion is necessary. Going overboard and overdoing it with prebiotics can cause excess build-ups of intestinal gas. Bloating and some degree of stomach discomfort may also be possible.\nPeople who suffer from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or other intestinal conditions will need to use prebiotics with extra care.\nBefore making major changes to the diet or using supplements for the first time it’s always a good idea to consult a doctor first. This is especially important for anyone who has existing health problems or concerns.\nIn some ways, consuming more prebiotic food and/or using prebiotic products could be seen as being a more natural option than probiotic products. Instead of adding extra bacteria to the gut, they help the intestines to produce more of their own.\nHowever, it’s important not to lose sight of the fact that many foods, such as feta cheese and sauerkraut contains probiotic bacteria.\nPeople were eating probiotic food long before it became trendy to do so. Although eating too much high-fat cheese too often may not be a healthy thing to do, eating either option is not generally frowned upon. So there is nothing wrong with the idea of consuming probiotic bacteria.\nConsuming prebiotic food and supplements is one way to boost good bacteria levels in the gut. Probiotics is another. It’s also possible to consume the prebiotics and probiotics together and many people do so. Of course, it’s important to remember there is no substitute for a healthy, well-balanced diet.\nWhat are prebiotics?\nA prebiotic is any food or supplement that provides indigestible fiber that feeds the probiotic bacteria in the gut.\nAre prebiotics the same as probiotics?\nNo. “Probiotics” is an umbrella term for the various different types of beneficial bacteria present in the gut. “Prebiotics” refers to the natural fiber that feeds the bacteria and helps it to multiply.\nCan you take prebiotics and probiotics together?\nYes. In fact, there is a lot to be said for doing so. That’s why some supplements contain both. When you take probiotics you are increasing the amount of good bacteria present in your gut. By taking prebiotics at the same time you are providing the bacteria with the food it needs to multiply quickly, thereby enhancing the overall benefits.\nWhy do people take prebiotic supplements?\nPeople take prebiotic supplements to boost the activity of gut-friendly bacteria. Research suggests increasing probiotic bacteria may offer numerous health benefits. This “probiotic” bacteria thrives best when it has an ample supply of food. Prebiotic supplements provide the special type of fiber the bacteria feeds upon.\nIs it safe to take prebiotics during pregnancy?\nUnless you have a gut-related health problem, such as IBS, there is no reason why you should not add more prebiotic foods to your diet. However, it would be wise to consult a doctor before using any brand of prebiotic supplement. Some supplements may contain additional ingredients, such as colorants, that may make them a poor choice for use during pregnancy.\nAre there any reasons to take prebiotics during pregnancy?\nApart from nourishing the good bacteria in the gut, prebiotic foods are also rich in vitamins and minerals that can support the good health of mother and child. Prebiotic supplements may offer benefit too, but should not be used without a doctor’s approval.\nDue to the fact that they increase levels of good bacteria, prebiotics may offer additional benefits. Probiotic bacteria are also active in other areas of the body, including the vagina. Babies who are born via vaginal delivery gain exposure to this bacteria. This exposure may give the child’s immune system a head start.\nDoes breast milk contain prebiotics?\nYes. As well as providing prebiotics, breast milk is also a source of probiotic bacteria called Human Milk Oligosaccharides (HMOs).\nHow do I prevent flatulence while using prebiotics?\nAny intestinal gas that builds up is likely to be due to the increase in probiotic bacteria. The best way to prevent flatulence from becoming a problem is to gradually increase extra fiber to the diet over a period of days. This gives the intestines the extra time they need to adapt.\nShould I use prebiotics after a colon cleanse?\nCleansing the colon purges the body of a lot of the bacteria prebiotics increase, so getting more prebiotics into your body is a very good idea. However, unless your doctor has recommended otherwise, a better idea is not to cleanse your colon at all.\nWhat is gut microbiota?\nGut microbiota is a term that encompasses all the bacteria and other microbes that live within the digestive tract. Some of the bacteria are good, others are bad. Prebiotics help increase the presence of the good kind."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:d1c5e015-ec1e-4cc4-b4fa-0a579f27bf64>","<urn:uuid:4b62cb33-f81c-40c7-9301-cd69787a37a8>"],"error":null}

{"question":"What are the main reporting requirements for communicable diseases, and what financial challenges do healthcare institutions face in implementing these reporting systems?","answer":"Healthcare providers must report specific information including the patient's full name, residential address, telephone number, date of birth, sex, disease details, laboratory test results, and facility information. For outbreaks, they must also report the nature of the disease, approximate number of cases, onset dates, and outbreak location. Regarding financial challenges, healthcare institutions face significant costs related to treatment development, fees paid to medical practitioners, and general operational costs. These financial burdens can impact the implementation of healthcare policies and procedures, potentially affecting the institutions' ability to provide accessible treatment while maintaining their operational viability.","context":["Communicable disease investigations are important in preventing spread of disease in our community. Public Health Nurses at the Grand Traverse County Health Department provide the following services:\n- Investigate cases of reportable communicable diseases including hepatitis, meningitis, pertussis, salmonellosis, and tuberculosis\n- Investigate communicable disease outbreaks in our community\n- Provide follow-up to communicable disease cases and contacts including education, testing, prophylaxis and immunization\n- Provide follow-up to victims of animal bites including rabies prevention\n- Provide for collection and transport of specimens for diagnosis, when appropriate\n- Collect communicable disease data and conduct ongoing disease surveillance\n- Receive, review, and monitor weekly school illness reports\n- Provide consultation and education related to communicable diseases to clients, health care providers, and the public\nIf you have a question about or wish to report a communicable disease, please contact the Communicable Disease Nursing Desk:\n- Phone: 231-995-6125\n- Secure Fax: 231-995-6126\nWho Needs to Report?\nPhysicians (PDF), clinical laboratories (PDF), primary and secondary schools (PDF), childcare centers, and camps are required to report the occurrence or suspected occurrence of any disease, condition or infection as identified in the Health Care Professional's Guide to the Michigan Communicable Disease Rules (PDF). In addition, other health care providers including dentists, nurses, pharmacists, and veterinarians are authorized to report the same to their local health department. Together, they play a key role in state and local efforts to control communicable diseases. The public health system depends upon these reports of diseases to monitor the health of the community and to provide the basis for preventive action.\nHealth care providers are required to report communicable diseases for several reasons. The most common reasons are listed as follows:\n- To identify outbreaks and epidemics, and if an unusual number of cases occur, local health authorities must investigate to control the spread of the disease\n- To enable preventive treatment and/or education to be provided\n- To help target prevention programs, identify care needs, and use prevention resources efficiently\n- To evaluate the success of long term control efforts\n- To facilitate epidemiologic research to uncover a preventable cause\n- To assist with national and international disease surveillance efforts - for some diseases that are unusual in Michigan, we are part of a national network that the federal government depends on to determine whether national or international investigations are needed.\nWhat to Report?\nTo assist health care providers and other institutions in reporting, the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services has prepared separate reporting lists for physicians, clinical laboratories, schools, childcare centers, and camps to provide a quick reference guide of reportable conditions, disease or infections. In addition, Michigan health care professionals and laboratories are also authorized to report any condition, disease, or infection judged by them to indicate that the health of the public is threatened.\nA report must contain the following information:\n- The patient's full name\n- The patient's residential address, including street, city, village or township, county, and zip code\n- The patient's telephone number\n- The patient's date of birth (or age) and sex\n- The name of the disease, infection, or condition reported and date of onset if known\n- The specific laboratory test (if tested), date performed, where performed, and results\n- The name and address of the reporting facility\n- To the extent that the information is readily available, a report of an unusual occurrence, outbreak, or epidemic of a disease, infection, or other condition shall include all of the following information:\n- The nature of the confirmed or suspected disease, infection, or condition\n- The approximate number of cases\n- The approximate illness onset dates\n- The location of the outbreak\nHow & Where to Report?\nThe presence or suspected presence of all reportable diseases, infections, and conditions are required to be reported to the appropriate local health department.

This is due to the numerous legal, ethical, and financial management challenges associated with the implementation of various types of health policies. In addition to these challenges, conflicting ideas concerning what constitutes best management practices for successfully resolving those challenges can also complicate matters. Legal challenges include licensure portability, information disclosure, and mandated testing (Rutkow, Gable, & Links, 2011); ethical challenges include right of treatment, availability/accessibility of treatment, disclosure of knowledge concerning side effects, and ramifications of treatment (Mansour, 2011); and financial challenges include cost of treatment to patients and cost incurred by medical institutions (Richard, Witter, & Brouwere, 2010). This brief analysis will describe these eight legal, ethical, and financial challenges associated with the successful implementation of new policies regarding the delivery of healthcare as well as management practices that can help smooth the transition during the integration of the new policies into functioning practices.\nLegal challenges like licensure portability, information disclosure, and mandated testing (Rutkow, Gable, & Links, 2011) are all complex issues that arise through the instigation of new healthcare policies and procedures. Licensure portability involves the right of medical practitioners to practice in states that they are not licensed in, especially in the event of an emergency (Rutkow, Gable, & Links, 2011). Information disclosure pertains to the patient’s right to privacy in regards to the details of their health status, especially when regarding the particulars of their mental health (Rutkow, Gable, & Links, 2011). Mandated testing includes institutional regulations necessitating regular practices like mental health screening or mandatory vaccinations for first response workers or healthcare workers. Best management practices for the implementation of procedural regulations without the threat of obstructions due to legalities can be achieved through programs designed to afford medical practitioners the opportunity to participate in emergency licensure portability programs, ensuring patient’s have a right to privacy and that their information remains secure, and that mandated testing is not invasive and does not violate the worker’s rights or that their results are not disclosed.\nEthical challenges pertaining to the patient’s right of treatment, the availability and accessibility of treatment, disclosure of knowledge concerning side effects, and the ramifications of treatment (Mansour, 2011) are all details pertaining to the safety of the patient. The patient’s right to treatment pertains to the obligatory aspects of pharmaceutical production and whether companies have a moral duty to make vital medications available to all people. This ethical dilemma also directly correlates to the availability and accessibility of treatments to patients and whether medical practitioners have an obligation to make sure the benefits of life-saving treatments are available to all that need it. Informing patients about the true nature of any side effects or ramifications that may follow treatment is also an issue of grave ethical concern within the medical community due to the many complications that can arise from the adverse effects of numerous pharmaceutical products. Organizational issues can either enhance or jeopardize the safe administration of patient treatment, which is why it is important for administration to enforce stringent procedural practices that stipulate full patient disclosure regarding the benefits and detriments of all medications prescribed and also enforce practices that include programs that makes vital medications or treatments available to all that may need it.\nThe financial challenges associated with cost of treatment to patients and cost incurred by medical institutions (Richard, Witter, & Brouwere, 2010) is a huge challenge facing many institutions. The cost of treatment to patients includes the fees patients pay to insurance companies as well as fees required by the medical facility providing the treatments. The cost incurred by the medical institution relates to costs of treatment development or obtaining the treatment from the companies that have developed it, fees paid to medical practitioners, and general costs of operation. The significant costs associated with medicinal practice makes the establishment of regulations intended to make treatment available to all a difficult process since such policies could mean billions of dollars in lost revenues resulting from the research and development of medical treatments. This would impose a substantial stumbling block in the path of the future development of effective treatment.\nHowever, to augment the cost of life-saving medications and treatments to patients, many institutions have established policies that allow them to reduce the cost of treatment to patients that cannot afford it and medical practitioners have the option to practice in areas where the people do not have easy access to medical care. Fully resolving the legal, ethical, and financial challenges related to the implementation of policies and procedures in the healthcare industry is not something that can be achieved in a one solution fits all method and many institutions have to reevaluate methods and procedures to find strategies that work best with their employees and procedures."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:93107622-5a12-4402-9684-11a82556846c>","<urn:uuid:74dbd240-df97-46fb-9da2-b91100cb95ae>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What is the percentage increase in energy density achieved by Sila's battery technology in the Whoop 4.0 fitness tracker?","answer":"Sila's materials, along with other advances, increased the energy density in the fitness tracker's battery by around 17%. This is equivalent to about four years of standard progress achieved in one big jump.","context":["A materials company in Alameda, California, has spent the last decade working to boost the energy stored in lithium-ion batteries, an advance that could enable smaller gadgets and electric vehicles with far greater range.\nSila has developed silicon-based particles that can replace the graphite in anodes and hold more of the lithium ions that carry the current in a battery.\nNow the company is delivering its product to the market for the first time, providing a portion of the anode powder in the battery of the forthcoming Whoop 4.0, a fitness wearable. It’s a small device but potentially a big step forward for the battery field, where promising lab results often fail to translate to commercial success.\n“Think of the Whoop 4.0 as our Tesla Roadster,” says Gene Berdichevsky, Sila’s CEO, who as Tesla’s seventh employee helped solve some of the critical battery challenges for the company’s first electric vehicle. “It’s really the first device on the market that’s proving this breakthrough.”\nThe company’s materials, with a light assist from other advances, increased the energy density in the fitness tracker’s battery by around 17%. That’s a significant gain in a field that generally inches forward by a few percentage points a year.\nIt’s equivalent to about four years of standard progress, “but in one big jump,” says Venkat Viswanathan, an associate professor of mechanical engineering at Carnegie Mellon University.\nSila still faces some real technical challenges, but the advance is a promising sign for the potential of increasingly capable batteries to help the world shift away from fossil fuels as the dangers of climate change accelerate. Boosting the amount of energy that batteries can store makes it easier for increasingly clean electricity sources to power more of our buildings, vehicles, factories, and businesses.\nFor the transportation sector, a more energy-dense battery can reduce the costs or extend the range of electric vehicles, addressing two of the biggest issues that have discouraged consumers from giving up their gas guzzlers. It also promises to deliver grid batteries that can save up more energy from solar and wind farms, or consumer gadgets that last longer between charges.\nEnergy density is the key to the “electrification of everything,” says Berdichevsky, an Innovator Under 35 in 2017.\nIn the case of the new fitness wearable, the novel battery materials and other improvements made it possible for Boston-based Whoop to shrink the device by 33% while maintaining five days of battery life. The product is now thin enough to be inserted into “smart apparel” as well as being worn like a watch. It goes on sale September 8.\nSila, which announced $590 million in funding in January, also has partnerships in place to develop battery materials for automakers including BMW and Daimler. The company has said its technology could eventually pack as much as 40% more energy into lithium-ion batteries.\nBerdichevsky interviewed for and landed his job at Tesla before his senior year at Stanford University, where he was working toward a degree in mechanical engineering. He ended up playing a key role in addressing a potentially existential risk for the company: that a fire in any one of the thousands of batteries packed into a vehicle would ignite the whole pack.\nHe set up a program to systematically evaluate a series of battery pack designs. After hundreds of tests, the company developed a combination of battery arrangements, heat transfer materials, and cooling channels that largely prevented runaway fires.\nAfter Tesla launched the Roadster, Berdichevsky felt he had to either commit to another five years to see the company through development of the next vehicle, the Model S—or take the opportunity to try something new.\nIn the end, he decided he wanted to build something of his own.\nBerdichevsky went back to Stanford for a master’s program studying materials, thermodynamics, and physics, in the hope of finding ways to improve storage at the fundamental level. After graduating, he spent a year as an entrepreneur in residence at Sutter Hill Ventures, looking for ideas that could form the basis of his own business.\nDuring that time, he came across a scientific paper identifying a method to produce silicon-based particles for lithium-ion battery anodes.\nResearchers have long seen silicon as a promising way to increase the energy in batteries, because its atoms can bond with 10 times more lithium ions by weight than graphite can. That means they hold far more of the charged molecules that produce the electric current in a battery. But silicon anodes tended to crumble during charging, as they swelled to accommodate the ions that shuttle back and forth between the electrodes.\nThe paper, coauthored by Georgia Institute of Technology professor Gleb Yushin, highlighted the possibility of developing rigid silicon materials with a porous core that could more easily accept and release the lithium ions.\nThe next year, Berdichevsky cofounded Sila with Yushin and Alex Jacobs, another former Tesla engineer.\nHurdles and delays\nThe company spent the next decade tweaking its methods and materials, working through more than 50,000 iterations of the chemistry while scaling up its manufacturing capacity. Early on, it decided to develop drop-in materials that manufacturers of lithium-ion batteries could swap in, rather than pursuing the more expensive and riskier route of producing complete batteries itself.\nSila is not as far along as it had initially hoped to be, however.\nAfter securing several million dollars from the US Department of Energy’s ARPA-E division, the company at one point told the research agency its materials could be in products by 2017 and in vehicles by 2020. In 2018, when Sila announced its deal with BMW, it said its particles could help power the German automaker’s EVs by 2023.\nBerdichevsky says the company now expects to be in vehicles by “more like 2025.” He says that solving the “last mile” problems was simply harder than they expected. Challenges included working with battery manufacturers to get the best performance out of the novel materials.\n“We were naïvely optimistic about the challenges of scaling and bringing products to market,” he said in an email.\nThe Whoop news signals that Sila was able to engineer the particles in a way that offers safety, life cycles, and other battery performance benchmarks similar to those achieved in existing products.\nBut it’s notable that Sila’s particles will provide only about 25% of the capacity in the battery’s anode, with standard graphite materials providing the rest.\nViswanathan says that the bigger test will be going from partially to fully replacing the graphite. That requires a greater level of precision and performance, which he describes as the difference between hitting a double and a home run.\nIn addition, he says, the company still faces significant challenges going from consumer devices to the more rigorous demands of electric vehicles. Cars, trucks, and buses need energy-dense, extremely safe batteries that charge rapidly and last for many life cycles, among other things. The problem with battery chemistry is that improving the materials and processes involved in one performance standard can often come at the cost of others, Viswanathan says.\nBerdichevsky says that Sila’s battery materials will fully replace graphite in its next commercial product, which he says is “locked and loaded” with a partner that he can’t yet announce. And unlike other promising battery materials earning press and investor attention these days, like lithium metal, Sila’s silicon materials are already in products.\n“We’re big believers that hope and hype doesn’t change the world—shipping does,” he says.\nA startup says it’s begun releasing particles into the atmosphere, in an effort to tweak the climate\nMake Sunsets is already attempting to earn revenue for geoengineering, a move likely to provoke widespread criticism.\nRadar and laser breakthroughs serve humanitarian ends\nInnovations in directed-energy systems could save lives and aid disaster recovery.\nThis is where Tesla’s former CTO thinks battery recycling is headed\nJB Straubel speaks about his company, Redwood Materials, and what challenges loom for batteries.\nWhy EVs won’t replace hybrid cars anytime soon\nPlug-in hybrids won’t get the world to zero emissions, but they can help cut climate impacts somewhat.
