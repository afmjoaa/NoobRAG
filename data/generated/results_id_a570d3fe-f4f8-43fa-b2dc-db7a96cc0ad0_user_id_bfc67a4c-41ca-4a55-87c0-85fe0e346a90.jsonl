{"question":"What are the power source options for circular saws and how does blade positioning affect cut quality?","answer":"Circular saws come in both corded and cordless models. Corded saws offer unlimited power, faster cutting rates, and typically use larger 7¼\" blades, while cordless models provide greater portability but require battery management and usually use smaller 6½\" blades. Regarding blade positioning, it's crucial for cut quality that the blade is properly positioned on the wheels - overhanging the pulley wheels causes back edge extension and makes the blade unstable during cutting. The blade guide arm must run parallel to the bed rail along its full movement to ensure even roller pressure and parallel cuts. Additionally, proper blade tensioning is essential, as incorrect tension can lead to unstable cutting performance.","context":["When starting on a woodworking project, one of the most important tools that is an absolute necessity is a circular saw. There are a variety of types – and uses – for these circular saws which are appropriate for the material that is going to be cut. Whether it’s wood, ceramic tile, steel, or stonework (such as granite or marble) the right type of saw is a must in order to do the job right and not waste expensive materials. The most important aspect is to find the best circular saw for the money for handling the materials needed for the project.\nHow to use a Circular Saw\nEveryone has been told a thousand times – measure twice and cut once. That’s the first thing the shop teacher says in Junior High School shop class. Take a look at some of the best tips on using a circular saw.\nPositioning for Easy and Accurate Cut\nSince there is no real “rule” stating which direction the circular saw is positioned when making various cuts, it’s generally determined by the space available and the user’s dominant hand. However, there is one helpful hint that will help in the long run – place the saw where motor is seated on the supported section of the material being cut so that the saw doesn’t fall away when the material is sliced. This allows for the shoe of the saw to be completely supported for the duration of the cut and the bulk of the weight lays on the supporting workbench or table.\nProper Support and Guidance is Essential\nOne very important rule is to make sure that before the rip cut or crosscut is made that the workbench, or table, is secure and stable. In addition, the metal guide must be properly attached to the base of the circular saw, however, if the rip or crosscut is larger, clamp a long board in place to use as a guide for the cut.\nQuick Comparison of Top 5 Circular Saws\n|Product||Dimensions||Item Weight||Power Source||Customer Rating|\n|DeWalt DWE575SB||16.2\"x10.1\"x10.5”||8.8 pounds||Corded||(4.7 / 5)|\n|Hitachi C7ST Circular Saw||14.4\"x12.4\"x9.6\"||15.1 pounds||Corded||(4.6 / 5)|\n|Bosch CS5 Circular Saw||18.2\"x11.4\"x11.4”||13.3 pounds||Cordless||(4 / 5)|\n|Skilsaw SPT67WM-22 Circular Saw||9.9\"x7.6\"x14.5”||12 pounds||Corded||(4.4 / 5)|\n|Porter Cable PC15TCS Circular Saw||11\"x14.88\"x7.88”||11.3 pounds||Corded||(4.5 / 5)|\nCircular Saw Reviews\nBest Circular Saw for the Money – Editor’s Pick\nOne of the best rated circular saws on the market is the DeWalt DWE575SB.\nThis DeWalt DWE575SB circular saw weighs at 8.8 pounds and measures at 16.2×10.1×10.5”.

Some of the circular saws include the following:\n- Abrasive Saw – also called a chop or cut-off type of power saw. It’s generally used to cut concrete, tile, and assorted metals.\n- Biscuit Joiner Saw – also known as a plate joiner. It uses a smaller blade to cut the mouth (the oval-shaped hole) in the opposite edges of the material being cut.\n- Carbide Saws – these are available in both vertical and horizontal models and are generally mounted on a spindle, or used as layer saws where multiple materials can be cut simultaneously.\n- Cold Saw – this type is designed to cut metals with a heavy toothed blade that more efficiently transfers the heat produced by the cutting to the expelled chips. Generally, these are made with a tungsten carbide-tipped or high speed steel circular blade.\n- Concrete saw – this type is also called a consaw, and is used to cut brick, tile, and various types of stone, marble, or granite. These generally use diamond saw blades for cutting this denser material, and because cutting these materials produces a lot of heat, the blades must be allowed to cool at regular intervals.\n- Pendulum Saw – this type of saw is used predominantly for make cross cuts in the materials, and is fixed on a swinging arm that is often equipped with a weight for counterbalance.\n- Pivot Saws – these are generally used for larger, heavier materials (such as heavier metals/steel) are cut\n- Radial Arm Saws – these are circular saws which are attached on some type of horizontal arm and is often use for making longer cuts.\n- Table or Panel Saw – this type of saw is mounted on a bench or platform.\nA Preference of Corded or Cordless\nThere are many pros and cons for choosing a circular saw with either a power cord or one that is cordless and runs on batteries. Of course there is no substitute for quality and performance and for many people, it as personal choice. Take a look at some of the pros and cons:\n|Runs as long as there is sufficient electricity.||When traditional power is not available, there must be a generator, or it does not work.||Perfect where there is no electrical power available.||The battery has to be charged for it to work.|\nMust have spare batteries handy when the battery dies.\n|No batteries to recharge||Batteries must be recharged frequently.|\nBoth power cords and extension cords get in the way – which can be a safety hazard.\n|There is no cord to untangle and that saves time.|\nAlso safer because there is no tripping on the cords.\n|Unlimited amount of power.||Limited amount of power.|\n|Cuts at a faster rate for longer periods.||Tends to slow down on extended cutting projects.|\n|No batteries to replace.||Need to replace the batteries.|\n|Generally comes with a 7¼” diameter blade which produces more cutting power because the larger blade moves faster.||Generally comes with a smaller blade at 6½’ diameter and has slightly less cutting power because the smaller blade doesn’t move as fast.|\n|Not highly portable because they are tethered to an electrical outlet – thus less convenient.||More portability to jobs that are not near a power source – thus more convenient.|\n|Tend to last longer than the cordless variety.||Doesn’t always have as long a life as the corded models.|\n|More suited for harder materials such as granite, marble, or steel, but can still easily cut wood.||More suited for easier cutting projects such as wood.||Not as good on harder materials such as granite or marble.|\n|More expensive||Less expensive|\nThe most important aspect is to make sure that the right type of corded or cordless circular saw – and blade – is used for the job!\n- ALWAYS wear eye protection!\n- Before turning it on, make sure that the lower blade guard moves smoothly when retracting and releasing.\n- Check the teeth on the blade to ensure none of them are broken, chipped, rusted, dull, or damaged in any way and make sure to replace the blade if there is any damage. NEVER use the circular saw if the blade is damaged!\n- Check the power cord to verify that there are no cracks or tears in the cord, and if it’s a battery-powered circular saw, confirm that the battery is completely charged.\nThere’s nothing worse than wasted time and material when saw is faulty and cuts are not done correctly. Most beginners feel quite comfortable using the more basic tools – a jigsaw, a drill, or a lathe; however, many are intimidated when the circular saw is introduced. There are some excellent circular saws available on the market that are perfect from the novice level to the seasoned professional, and are equipped with excellent safety features and are easy to use.","How to Avoid \"Wavy\" Cuts\nBy Wood-Mizer, Europe\nMany operators know this problem: during sawing \"wavy\" cuts appear. The problem is really serious, but you can solve it. Let us examine, step by step, all the factors affecting the sawing process. There are four of them: the operator, the sawmill, the blade and the wood.\nThe first point on our list sometimes can become the last one. Because correct sawmill alignment, cutting rate and blade choice depend on the operator. The cutting rate should be very close to the maximum for the given wood type. If the cutting rate is not enough the surface looks like goose bumps. If the cutting rate is too high then the blade has no time to make a cut and therefore \"wavy\" cuts appear.\nSpecial attention should be paid to sawmill alignment. Very often, even experienced operators don't pay due attention to the sawmill condition. They say that this procedure takes too much time. So they service the equipment only once a week or even less. Of course the adjustments and repair of the sawmill take time because during a week there can be accidents. We recommend you to check the alignment of the sawmill every day and without fail after the blade guide rollers hit a log. To check does not mean to align, and this procedure does not take much time at all. The operator should also monitor the condition of the blade.\nLet us view what components of the sawmill can affect the appearance of \"wavy\" cuts.\nBlade guide rollers. They define the blade positioning in respect to the sawmill bed. Proper positioning of the blade guide arm gives added blade stability in the cut. Correct blade guide positioning is checked with the alignment tool provided with the sawmill. This tool should be kept separately from other equipment. If this tool is damaged we recommend you buy a new one.\nSo, let us examine the rollers. They should not have any “flats”, which may cause blade vibration. There should not be any scoring on the flanges. Moreover you should check the bearing condition. Only a little movement is allowed.\nThen you should check the tightness of the roller pin in the mount. If there is any movement you should replace the body. It is not worth trying to repair any damage to the roller mounting – it is cheaper and safer to replace it. Broken pins and lock nuts should be replaced at once, then we recommend using only high-quality alignment tools.\nAfter all defect parts are replaced you should perform the full guide roller adjustment process. To provide evenness of roller pressure and parallel cuts, you should check that the blade guide arm is running parallel to the bed rail along its full movement. This procedure is often missed or performed wrongly. This can result in wavy cuts. Check also for any slackness in the blade guide arm - there should be no movement at all.\nB57 Belts. Use Wood-Mizer supplied belts only, as these are specially designed for sawmilling. Check them often. If they are worn too much, replace them immediately, as the edge of the wheel can begin touching the blade and cause breakage.\nBlade Lubrication. Use it. It keeps your blades cleaner. It’s something simple that many sawmillers don’t do.\nBlade positioning on the wheels. Having the blade overhanging the pulley wheels causes back edge extension. The blade becomes unstable in the cut. In this case defect often does not appear at once, sometimes after 2nd-3rd sharpenings. So an operator thinks that the blade is defective. But a blade, even after several sharpenings, will cut the same way as a new blade. Ensure good blade alignment on the wheels.\nSawmill setup. It is especially important that support legs are secured with anchor bolts. All support legs should touch the ground with no clearance. If there is clearance you should eliminate it with the help of a shims.\nSawmills manufactured before 2000 have no middle support legs, which are now mounted in place of the trailer and prevent the bed from bending while the cutting head is moving. If your sawmill has no such legs we recommend you to mount them (you can make them by yourselves or order at your local Wood-Mizer representative).\nHaving made sure that all adjustments have been made, we proceed to the main key to \"wavy\" cuts - the blade. First of all you should remember that it is very important to sharpen and set blades correctly. Very often \"wavy\" cuts appear when you try to saw with a blunt blade. Too little set also significantly decreases the cutting rate. Moreover even a very sharp blade warms while sawing and you should often check its tension.\nHook angle affects \"wavy\" cuts the same way. If this angle is more than the optimum, the blade is overloaded, if the hook angle is less than the optimum then the cutting rate decreases.\nYou should pay special attention to irregular tooth set. If it differs too much from tooth to tooth, \"wavy\" looking cuts will appear, often in relation to density changes within the timber. If tooth set differs on each side of the blade, \"wavy\" cuts will appear because the blade will try to cut towards the side with the larger set and will then try to straighten itself.\nIf the tooth height differs from tooth to tooth then the blade will cut jerkily and with a lot of vibration. You should never forget about the harm, which can be caused by burrs being left on the blade. Burrs cause the cutting rate to decrease, the blade warms up, and \"wavy\" cuts appear.\nVery often the blade is damaged if it slips off the blade wheels or it is incorrectly removed and jammed. Many people try to straighten such blades and try to use them further, but it is impossible to get quality cuts with such blades.\nLet us review wood characteristics, which affect the appearance of \"wavy\" cuts. First of all we should mention irregularity within the log. Usually the log core has less density than the outer layers (especially in softwood species). That is why there is more sawdust while sawing the core. The blade in these layers does not cope with sawdust removal. As a result the back of the blade warms and expands. The blade bends and we get \"wavy\" cuts. It is difficult to select blade parameters so that it cuts equally well in the inner and outer layers of a log. In normal circumstances the correct profile for the wood to be cut will give you good average performance.\nThe majority of operators know the problem of \"wavy\" cuts when cutting frozen wood. While cutting completely frozen wood is normally no problem, cutting partially frozen wood is very difficult. Again, the choice of the right blade profile for frozen wood will alleviate most problems.\nIf you saw wood with many knots, then the risk of \"wavy\" cuts increases many times. In this case you should be very careful. It is important to decrease and then smoothly increase the cutting rate when passing through every knot. Special problems occur when cutting extremely pitchy wood. The problem is that sawdust and pitch stick on the blade; this is just like the blade thickness increasing. As long as the kerf is not changed, the blade sides start rubbing on the timber in the cut, warming up, and with a decrease in tension \"wavy\" cuts will occur. We recommend you to brush or spray a chemical agent on the blade. Dish washing detergent and Pine Sol are popular and can be used in waterlube.\nWood-Mizer designed the LubeMizer system, which delivers the lubrication and cleaning agents onto both sides of the blade in a precisely controlled manner. We advise you to buy this system and use it when cutting extremely pitchy wood."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:9a83415f-a102-4fa7-96f8-8f4b2c3bb0ff>","<urn:uuid:41de8de1-1a76-49be-a901-5f59ec90e845>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I'm researching longevity diets and environmental sustainability. What do we know about the macronutrient ratios in the long-lived Okinawan population's diet, and how does their plant-based approach compare to beef consumption's environmental impact?","answer":"The Okinawans, who are among the longest-living people in the world, follow a dietary pattern that is approximately 85% carbohydrates and 9% protein. Unlike many North Americans, they consume abundant vegetables and high-fiber foods as their main carbohydrate sources. This plant-based approach aligns well with environmental sustainability, especially when compared to beef consumption. According to research, beef is more than 100 times as emissions-intensive as legumes. The animal agriculture industry is the largest contributor to emissions among all food supply chains, with animal food processing making up 72-78% of total agricultural emissions.","context":["Counting macronutrients, which involves counting the amount of carbohydrate, fat, and protein that you are consuming, has become a popular method to monitor nutritional intake, reach desired health outcomes, and maintain a healthy and balanced diet.\nFoods are essentially made up of different ratios of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. We need to eat a combination of all three of these macronutrients to meet our nutritional needs and support bodily functions. But sometimes depending on our health goals, we may want to focus on certain macronutrients over others, or ensure we have the right type of a macronutrient in the diet. Counting macronutrients, ‘macros’ for short, can help you reach your health goals. Whether you’re looking to improve your diet, gain muscle, manage your weight, or improve your cardiometabolic health, counting macros may be the solution. (7)(9)(10)\nBenefits of counting macros\nThough studies have traditionally focused on how the overall intake of calories affects our health, other recent research demonstrates that the ratio of macronutrients (carbohydrates:fats:proteins) can influence cardiometabolic health, body composition, and longevity. (9)(17)\nCertain macronutrient ratios may improve cardiovascular and metabolic health. For example, the DASH diet (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension), which was developed as a method to lower blood pressure and improve cardiovascular health, recommends a low to moderate-fat approach, with an emphasis on lean proteins and fiber-rich carbohydrates (e.g., fruits, vegetables, whole grains). (3)\nModerate to low-carbohydrate diets are commonly recommended for individuals with diabetes or prediabetes as they may help regulate blood glucose (sugar) and blood lipid levels, as well as prevent or mitigate the risk of diabetic complications. (6)\nBody composition and weight management\nCounting macros is a popular method for weight loss and weight management. Research has shown that certain dietary patterns and macronutrient distributions can help individuals reach their goals. For example, low-fat diets may be beneficial for modest, sustained weight loss, whereas high-fat, low-carbohydrate diets may produce faster, more significant weight loss results. (7)(10) High-protein foods and diets are generally more satiating, helping you feel fuller for longer after a meal and thus preventing overeating. (16)\nMacro counting is also used by many athletes and individuals attempting to gain muscle mass or boost athletic performance. This may include adjusting macronutrient ratios to increase protein or carbohydrates, depending on their fitness and body composition goals. (11)(21)\nSome research suggests that macronutrient distribution plays a more significant role in longevity than does total caloric intake, suggesting that what you eat may be more important than how much you eat. (18)\nAlthough extensive evidence exists to suggest the importance of high protein intake in aging adults, (1) conflicting research proposes that a low-protein, high-carbohydrate diet may promote longevity. Residents of the Japanese island of Okinawa, who are among the longest-living people in the world, follow this type of dietary pattern, consuming approximately 85% and 9% of their total calories from carbohydrates and protein, respectively. (12) Unlike many North Americans, Okinawans and other Asian populations eat an abundance of vegetables and other high-fiber foods as their main carbohydrate sources. (19)(20) Diets high in fiber have been shown to contribute to lower risk of certain chronic conditions, including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and cancer. (5)\nHow to count macros\nThe steps to calculating your macronutrient intake are outlined below.\nStep 1: Determine your caloric needs\nYour age, sex, weight, height, and activity level all play a role in determining optimal macronutrient ratios to maintain a healthy and balanced diet. Your optimal macronutrient intake also depends on your desired outcome. To simplify the process, there are a number of diet tracking wellness apps and online calculators that allow you to easily record and understand your daily macronutrient ratio and overall calorie intake. However, this should be used in conjunction with proper consultation with a healthcare practitioner who has nutritional expertise. Examples of highly-rated apps currently available on the App Store and Google Play Store include:\n- Lose It!\nIf you choose to manually calculate your macronutrient intake, the first step in determining the number of macros you need is to calculate your caloric needs. The simplest way to do this is to use an online calorie calculator that calculates your resting energy expenditure (REE) or basal metabolic rate (BMR). (15) These online calculators are available for free on many websites and mobile apps and help you calculate the number of calories that you would need to meet your daily intake per day based on your age, sex, weight, height, and perceived activity level.\nIt is important to note that these calorie calculators are based on statistical calculations that apply to the average population. While they may be useful for estimating caloric needs, your healthcare practitioners can provide more accurate caloric assessments. (4)\nStep 2: Consider the appropriate macronutrient ratio for you\nThe Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Ranges (AMDR) represents the recommended macronutrient ratios for the average population according to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans outlined by The Food and Nutrition Board of the Institutes of Medicine (IOM). The recommended macronutrient ratios according to the AMDR is as follows:\n- Carbohydrates: 45 to 65% of caloric intake\n- Protein: 10 to 35% of caloric intake\n- Fat: 20 to 35% of caloric intake (19)\nAs an example of demonstrating how to count your macros using the Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommendations, assuming that you were ingesting 2000 calories per day with a macronutrient breakdown of 55% carbohydrates, 15% proteins, and 30% fats, you could determine the following:\n- 2000 cals * 0.55 = 1100 calories; 1100 kcal/4 calories per gram = ~275 g of carbohydrates\n- 2000 cals * 0.15 = 300 calories; 300 kcal/4 calories per gram = ~75 g of protein\n- 2000 calories * 0.30 = 600 calories; 600 kcal/9 calories per gram = ~66 g of fats\nThe amounts of each macronutrient outlined above represent the amount of each macro that you will need to ingest on a daily basis to meet your optimal ratio. Note that each gram of carbohydrate and protein contains approximately 4 calories and each gram of fat contains 9 calories. (19)\nConsiderations for special populations and diets\nKeep in mind, different populations may need to adjust their macronutrient ratios to meet their specific needs. For instance, athletes have different macronutrient needs than sedentary populations as they often expend more energy and have greater nutrient requirements for proper recovery. (13) It has been recommended that athletes primarily consume 5 to 12 grams of carbohydrates per kilogram of body weight and 1.2 to 1.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight, depending on the level of physical activity. (13) In general, athletes are recommended to break down their macros into the following ratios:\n- Carbohydrates: 45 to 65% of caloric intake\n- Protein: 10-35% of caloric intake\n- Fat: 20-35% of caloric intake (13)\nNotice that athletes are often advised to increase protein intake, reducing carbohydrates and fats, though this can also depend on the nature of their sport (e.g., endurance vs. sprint sports). Ingesting a higher ratio of protein can be challenging for certain individuals, such as vegetarians or vegans, since many protein sources are animal-based. However, there are many plant-based protein options that can be incorporated into a properly planned diet, which will assist in meeting protein requirements.\nOther diets may suggest varying macronutrient distributions depending on desired outcomes. For example, the ketogenic diet, which emphasizes a high-fat, moderate-protein, and low-carbohydrate approach for weight loss, may have a macronutrient distribution similar to the example below:\n- Carbohydrates: 5 to 10% of caloric intake\n- Protein: 30 to 35% of caloric intake\n- Fat: 55 to 60% of caloric intake (14)\nIn a high-fat, low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet, glucose stores are depleted, which results in the body utilizing fat stores for energy instead. This dietary pattern has been shown to promote weight loss, however long-term effects and likelihood of adherence to the diet are not well understood. (14)\nStep 3: Measure and track your macros\nThe final step to counting your macros is to track the weight of each food and beverage that you consume, using a food scale. You can also use the nutrient labels that appear on most food products to calculate the number of grams and calories of each macronutrient you are consuming. The mobile apps mentioned previously can be especially helpful for tracking foods that don’t have food labels, such as fruits, vegetables, meat, and poultry. These apps also make it easy to track multiple ingredients used in homemade meals and recipes. For help understanding a nutrition facts label, refer to the diagram below:\nIf you had a ⅔ cup serving of the food (55 g), you would have ingested 8 g of fat, 3 g of protein and 37 g of carbs (33 g apply when calculating calories as you can subtract the dietary fibers). For simple calculation, keeping the calorie estimates for each macronutrient can be done as follows:\n- Fat: 8 g * 9 kcal/g = 72 calories\n- Protein: 3 g * 4 kcal/g = 12 calories\n- Carbs: 33 g * 4 kcal/g = 132 calories\n- Total = 216 calories\nRemember, these calorie counts per gram are approximations and can vary by a few decimal points from food source to food source, so your final caloric calculations may slightly differ from the amount displayed on the nutrition label.\nIf you don’t want to do these calculations, you can always find an online food macro calculator or food journal which can tell you the amount of each macro in specific foods and beverages based on weight as well. You just need to make sure that the overall proportion of the macros that you ingest aligns with your caloric intake and your goals. Also, keep in mind that there’s a lot more to nutrition than the ratio or simply counting macronutrients; it’s just as important to consider the type and quality of protein, carbs, and fats you’re consuming.\nFor more information about macronutrients, visit the Fullscript blog.\nThe bottom line\nAll in all, the healthy way to go about counting your macros requires determining your caloric needs based on your physiological characteristics and goals. You then determine the amount of carbs, fats, and proteins in each food and liquid that you ingest using nutrition labels and weights and match these ratios with your predetermined macro goals. If you’re a patient, speak to your integrative healthcare provider to determine if counting macros is right for you and your health goals.\n- Baum, J., Kim, I.-Y., & Wolfe, R. (2016).

But do consumers understand the real price of global consumption? And if they did, would they change their buying patterns? The manufacturing processes involved in food production are often complex with any given product seeing many stages before it makes its way to our grocery store shelves.\nResearchers from the University of Technology Sydney and Duke University claim in their study published in Nature Climate Change that shoppers are largely unaware of the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the food they purchase.\nIt’s easy for us to satisfy our hunger through cooking technologies like microwaves, ovens, and toasters or even though delivery. While these technologies heighten short-term convenience for us, they can have long-term negative effects on the environment.\nThe study finds that if food retailers label their products indicating the amount of carbon emissions each food item generates, consumers would be willing to purchase meals and ingredients that are more environmentally friendly.\nAccording to the study, the proportion of greenhouse gas emissions that can be attributed to food production and consuming habits is between 19 to 29 percent globally. This estimate includes all steps in the entire supply chain of a product such as fertilizing, farming, processing, exporting goods through transportation, household management, and waste.\nFurthermore, the Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security institution (CCAFS) states that livestock contributes to 14.5 percent of total greenhouse gas emissions globally. This makes the animal agriculture industry the largest contributor to emissions out of all food supply chains.\nBeef and dairy cattle create the most damaging greenhouse gasses, resulting in 65 percent of the total 14.5 percent of emissions generated from livestock, according to the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization. This is due to cattle being fed grain which is produced using fossil fuels. Another issue is the methane that cows produce in their digestive system which is released from their manure and further contributes to the accumulation of greenhouse gasses.\nFurthermore, another food report called “Options for keeping the food system within environmental limits” also published by Nature claims that animal food processing makes up 72 to 78 percent of total agricultural emissions.\n“Beef is more than 100 times as emissions-intensive as legumes,” said Marco Springmann from the University of Oxford, a co-author of the report.\n“In today’s agricultural system, we grow plants to feed animals, which require all of those resources and inputs: land, water, fossil fuels, pesticides, herbicides and fertilizer to grow,” said Sharon Palmer, a registered dietitian nutritionist and plant-based food and sustainability expert. “And then we feed plants to animals and care for them over their lifetime, while they produce methane and manure.”\nThe University of Technology Sydney, and Duke University study further tested the knowledge of more than 1,000 consumers on 19 different food items and 18 different electrical food appliances. They asked consumers what level of carbon emissions each product was responsible for producing, and found that participants’ highly underestimated how much the two categories contributed to global warming.\n“If you ask people to guess the difference between items such as beef and vegetable soup on the environment, they assume there is not much difference, but beef soup creates more than 10 times the amount of greenhouse gases than vegetable soup,” said Dr. Adrian Camilleri, lead author on the report.\nCamilleri explains that consumers are often unaware of how the production of certain food items is causing negative effects on global warming, creating confusion with consumers as to what steps they should take in order to help create a more sustainable environment.\n“This is a bit of a blind spot because if someone wants to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, they might think to turn off the heater, drive less or fly less,” said Camilleri. “Very few people think to eat less beef.”\nThe university study further indicates that food retailers or manufacturers could create a mandate to implement logos on food items modeled after the EnerGuide labeling used on mechanical equipment.\nThe purpose of this would be to measure the carbon footprint the food item generates, and expose that carbon footprint to consumers, giving shoppers better insight and opportunity to eat food products with less detrimental effects on the environment.\nIn testing an example of these labels on 120 participants, the researchers found the results were positive. According to the study, more consumers bought vegetable soup as opposed to beef when the carbon footprint labeling was included on the packaging.\nIn order to limit climate change in 2019, studies are showing that consumers can help by substituting some of their meat protein with a diet that contains plant and nut-based alternatives as well as buying food produced locally.\n“Research consistently shows that drastically reducing animal food intake and mostly eating plant foods is one of the most powerful things you can do to reduce your impact on the planet over your lifetime, in terms of energy required, land used, greenhouse gas emissions, water use and pollutants produced,” Springmann states.\nAlthough completely cutting out meats is not an ideal option for everyone, food experts are saying that a flexitarian diet makes for a healthy alternative that has less of a drastic impact on your body. Opting for animal protein that results in fewer carbon emissions, like eggs, fish, and poultry, followed by an abundant amount of fruits, vegetables and plant-based protein, could be a feasible alternative. According to Springmann, this option “is the least stringent that is both healthy and would reduce greenhouse gas emissions enough for us to stay within environmental limits.”\nSpringmann’s environmental food study further states, daily consumption of processed food and red meats could result to negative environmental effects increasing by 50 to 90 percent in the food industry by the year 2050. With plant-based protein being a prominent food trend, it could be possible for consumers to help prevent climate change by choosing products which create fewer carbon emissions."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:a4357236-4bb3-4fa8-986c-9e13336bd6a9>","<urn:uuid:d8718ba1-dba2-45c7-8348-0c8ad4dfa024>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the key distinctions between cold therapy using traditional ice packs versus specialized cold compresses, and what therapeutic benefits do they provide for inflammation and injury?","answer":"Traditional ice packs and gel packs withdraw warmth very quickly, are not temperature controlled, and can cause frost pain and burns within minutes. In contrast, specialized cold compresses using patented paraffin-oil emulsion withdraw warmth slowly and are temperature controlled, preventing dermatological damage even at temperatures down to -22 degrees Celsius. Cold therapy in general reduces inflammation by decreasing blood flow and oxygen demands to injured tissue, inhibiting nerve-muscle units and reducing muscle spasms. The controlled application of cold causes a 'frozen sleep' in the affected area, allowing joints, muscles, or tendons hours to regenerate while effectively eliminating pain and inflammation.","context":["Product STÜBBEN KRYO KOMPAKT HORSE\nHow is the cold compress\nIn analogy to experience with fango-paraffin, an\nalmost ideal emulsion could be patented after years of research and\nMicrocrystalline ice is worked into a soft, almost creamy mass which is\nmalleable and “doughy” even when chilled.

Cool for at least 3 hours without interruption, then change the\ncompress (if required) for another 3 hours. In case of pain episodes, 3\nhours of cooling a day for up to 5 days.\nChronic inflammatory processes which are not immune\nfor 6 to 10 days alternate as follows: cool for 6\nhours, warm for 12 hours, cool for 6 hours.\nPre- and post-operative application to prevent pain and swelling after\noperations: if possible, cool the area for 30 minutes before the operation (but\nonly if the operation will not last longer than 30 minutes, since there\nwould otherwise be a danger of hyperaemia).\nDermatological indications such as burns, skin irritations, eczema, injury\nto the coronet and the like: pain treatment as quickly as possible by\ncooling with low temperatures for 3 hours, then conservative dressing.\nReduction of fever, transport fever and tying-up\nsyndrome in racing and trotting horses:\nwhen applied to all four of the horse's extremities,\nthe cryotherapy compress reduces fever by 3 to 4 degrees Celsius.

In acutely painful cases,\nchanging the compress every hour is recommended (for the first three to four\nhours). For further hints, see the table: Recommendations on use of\ncryotherapy compresses in practice.\nWhy does long application of cold not result in frost injury?\nThe patented paraffin-oil emulsion contained in the compresses is designed\nso that the poor physical conductivity of paraffin can be exploited. This\nmeans that the warmth of the part of the body being treated is only\nwithdrawn very slowly, whereas natural ice, gel packs, chemical cooling\nbandages and the like withdraw it very quickly. The chemical process\ninhibits the transmission of the body's transmitters: bradykinin, serotonin\nHow do horses react when \"icy bandages\" are applied to them?\nThe horses are completely quiet and relaxed. Consider by comparison the\neffect that an ice bag has when placed on a person's neck. The headache\ndissipates in a few seconds, and there is an agreeable, free feeling in the\nhead. And now the cold can take effect at an easy pace.\nWhy does this not happen with gel packs, chemical cold compresses and the\nThese cooling measures are not temperature controlled so that the cold takes\ndirect - and painful - effect on the area concerned. It only takes a few\nminutes for burns to appear on the skin. It is easy to understand that the\nhorse does not find that very pleasant.\nWhy is cold so advantageous and irreplaceable for regeneration processes?\nThe high degree of cold causes a sort of \"frozen sleep\" in the affected area.\nThis means that the joint, the muscles or the tendons have hours to\nregenerate. Pain and inflammation are effectively eliminated. Ideal recovery\nWhat do water and the standard gel pads on the market have in common?\nThey have no effect in normal application. Water is not cold enough, and\nwill not have the desired effect even if it is applied for a long period. It\nis only as cold or as warm as it is when it comes out of the tap. Gel packs\nas well as natural ice are ill suited for long-term therapy. They are not\ntemperature controlled and therefore cause frost pain and burns. Short-term\napplication activates the inflammation and increases the sense of pain.\nHow is a gel pad constructed?\nIt normally consists of an alcohol fluid. Due to very cheap production\nmethods (far East), only very brief application is possible.\nWhy do inflammations react to cold so positively?\nInflammation always involves the development of warmth. If a sufficient cold\nsource is applied to the inflammation focus, the source of warmth is cooled,\nthe inflammation mediators (transmitters) are inhibited or at least\nconsiderably reduced due to decreasing body temperature or circulation. The\ninflammation breaks down.\nShould the cryotherapy compress be applied daily after riding?\nYes, definitely. It then protects against inflammations, oedema, swelling,\ntendon irritation, haematoma or enlarged tendons, and the like. It is the\nideal preventive measure. There is no prospect of habituation. Habituation\ncould just as well happen with water, which we use daily for cleaning\npurposes. Work with the horse can sometimes be harder and therefore more\nstrenuous for the horse. With good prevention and follow-up, negative\nresults can often be prevented.\nIs there any point to applying the compress after the injury (2 to 3 days\nYes, definitely. The inflammation may otherwise get worse, that is, it may\nexpand to a larger area (phlegmon and the like). This can be effectively\nHow cold does the compress have to be to take full effect?\nNormal deepfreezes have a temperature of about minus 20 degrees Celsius.\nThis is the right temperature for the compress. Higher temperatures ( -15 /\n-18 ) are only of limited acceptability.\nDoes an under-pad have to be laid on the skin before the cold compress is\nNo, that is not necessary. There will definitely be no dermatological (skin)\ndamage at all. The effectiveness is increased by direct contact with the\nskin. This has a positive effect.\nIf liquid leaks out, is it poisonous?\nNo, the liquid is absolutely non-poisonous.\nDoes it make sense to use cold treatment for every injury?\nAs a matter of principle, the veterinary should be consulted in case of\nserious injuries. Appropriate measures should be discussed with him. For\nsmaller injuries which do not require veterinary attention, cold is at any\nrate the correct treatment.\nCan the compress be left on over night?\nYes - but please ensure that the cold compress remains securely on the skin\nby applying additional bandages or leg pads.\nDoes it make sense to hose the legs with water in addition to applying\nNever bring water into contact with the leg when the cold compress is\napplied to it. The water will freeze and the ice will cause frost injury.\nCan cold also be used for open wounds?\nYes, the considerable degree of cold immediately stops the blood flow.\nHow long does the compress have to be cooled before application?\nIt should always be in the deepfreeze so that it is ready for use. After use,\nit should be stored in the deepfreeze for at least 4 hours.\nCan the compress also be used for humans?\nYes, that is the field from which it is derived. Nowadays, it is in\nworldwide use for sports injuries, rheumatic episodes, arthrosis and the\nWhat guarantees the described mechanism of the cold compress?\nThe effectiveness of this special emulsion has been subjected to scientific\nand clinical study by the manufacturer, and the results obtained in various\napplications confirm its effectiveness.\nWhat is the ideal profile of a cold compress?\nIt must have a demonstrable capacity to accelerate regeneration after\ntraining and competition, and represent a reliable supplement to the healing\nprocess. In addition to scientific evidence of its effectiveness,\ninternational testing and veterinary recommendation are required. Even when\ndeep frozen (minus 22 degrees Celsius), it should be malleable to ensure\ndirect, even contact with the part of the body concerned. It must not be a\ndoping substance. Clean application of the compresses must be simple, and\nthey must be easy to clean.\nWhat should I do if I need the cold compress at a tournament?\nFor tournaments a small deepfreeze (20 to 30 litres) is recommended. Such\narticles are available inexpensively in wholesale trade or at discounters.\nElectricity is available at every tournament site.\nWhen does cold have to be applied after the injury?\nThe general rule is: The earlier STÜBBEN KRYO KOMPAKT HORSE is applied after\ninjuries of any kind, the better. Always think of how you react - after\nsports injuries, you immediately apply cold to the areas concerned, the pain\nrecedes, and swelling and bruising is prevented.\nIt is advisable to use the compresses in case of ulceration of the haunch\nor inflammation of the haunch skin?\nYes, definitely - this effectively eliminates the inflammation. Water or\ndamp compresses do not in any way have the same effect. In any case, consult\nHow long do cold compresses last?\nIf they are properly treated, very long. But at some point, the textile is\nnot up to the wear.\nCan I freeze the cold compresses immediately after use?\nThe compresses have to be completely thawed. They are then warm to the touch.\nThey have to be thoroughly kneaded and can then be frozen again. This\nensures that no pieces of sharp ice will develop.\nCan cold compresses be disinfected?\nYes, with any normal disinfectant.","Cold therapy or cryotherapy is an effective means of reducing inflammation/swelling following an accident or injury. Cold therapy is applied in the form of ice, which will inhibit the firing of the nerve-muscle units and reduce muscle spasms. Cold therapy reduces blood flow and oxygen demands to injured tissue/muscles thus preserving the muscle cells and easing pain in the event of an acute injury. Ice packs are often applied with a compression wrap along with elevation to maximize the reduction of the swelling.\nHeat therapy is applied using hot packs layered in towels applied directly to the injured area. The heat provided by the hot packs has several important benefits. It relaxes tight muscles, decreases pain caused by muscle tension or spasms and also causes vasodilatation of the blood vessels which increases circulation to the injured area. Patients with muscle strains, spasms, or arthritis will benefit from this form of treatment.\nInterferential Current Therapy (IFC)\nInterferential current therapy is a treatment used to relieve pain and to promote soft-tissue healing. Tiny electrical impulses are induced into the tissues of the injured area. These waves intersect below the surface of the skin; the low-frequency stimulation induces the body to secrete endorphins, which are the body’s natural pain-killers. Most patients find interferential therapy to be very beneficial and describe the treatment as being relaxing as it reduces pain and inflammation. Ligament sprains, muscle strains and spasms often respond well to interferential current therapy.\nRussian Stimulation is a specific form of electrical stimulation with a symmetrical Biphasic Square waveform. It was originally developed by the Russian Olympic team intended for building muscle mass on their athletes. Russian stimulation is now more often used to re-build atrophied muscle mass and reduce edema of injured soft tissue. Russian Stimulation is designed to stimulate motor nerves at a frequency of 2500Hz allowing for deeper muscle penetration and a more complete/stronger contraction of the muscle fibers. This form of stimulation relieves muscle spasms and is beneficial for elderly patients and those suffering from scoliosis.\nUltrasound is a modality utilizing high or low frequency sound waves transmitted to the surrounding soft tissue and vasculature. These sound waves penetrate the injured muscles to cause deep tissue/muscle warming. Tissue warming promotes tissue relaxation and making it beneficial in the treatment of muscle tightness and spasms. The warming effect of the sound waves also causes vessel vasodilatation increasing circulation to the area that assists in healing of injured soft tissue.\nK Laser Beneficial Effects\n- Rapid Cell Growth – Laser light accelerates cellular reproduction and growth.\n- Faster Wound Healing – Laser light stimulates fibroblast development and accelerates collagen synthesis in damaged tissue.\n- Increased Metabolic Activity – Higher outputs of specific enzymes, greater oxygen and food particle loads for blood cells and thus greater production of the basic food source for cells, Adenosine Tri-Phosphate (ATP).\n- Reduced Fibrous Tissue Formation – Laser light reduces the formation of scar tissue following tissue damage from: cuts, scratches, burns or post surgery.\n- Anti-Inflammatory Action – Laser light reduces swelling caused by bruising or inflammation of joints to give enhanced joint mobility.\n- Increased Vascular Activity – Laser light induces temporary vasodilatation increasing blood flow to damaged areas.\n- Stimulated Nerve Function – Slow recovery of nerve function in damaged tissue can result in “dead” limbs or numb areas. Laser light speeds the process of nerve cell reconnection to bring the numb areas back to life.\nModern decompression is a non-surgical therapy option which is used to re-create lost intervertebral space, hopefully eliminating pain and associated neurological symptoms. Decompression works by gently stretching the spine, creating a vacuum effect. The vacuum will draw disc bulges or herniations back into the intended vertebral area reducing irritation of soft tissue surrounding the disc. Oxygen, water, nutrients and some other healing substances are drawn in through this vacuum as well. The final desired result with spinal decompression surgery is a stronger, healthier disc that functions properly."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:9f142ddf-aa1b-4486-b88d-326b7fb13ec9>","<urn:uuid:45fcdc56-7ddf-4be0-be70-bc98cee7c34d>"],"error":null}

The Complainants filed an amended Complaint on June 9, 2021.\nThe Center verified that the Complaint together with the amended Complaint satisfied the formal requirements of the Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (the “Policy” or “UDRP”), the Rules for Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (the “Rules”), and the WIPO Supplemental Rules for Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (the “Supplemental Rules”).\nIn accordance with the Rules, paragraphs 2 and 4, the Center formally notified the Respondent of the Complaint, and the proceedings commenced on June 15, 2021. In accordance with the Rules, paragraph 5, the due date for Response was July 5, 2021. The Respondent did not submit any response. Accordingly, the Center notified the Respondent’s default on July 7, 2021.\nThe Center appointed William F. Hamilton as the sole panelist in this matter on July 13, 2021. The Panel finds that it was properly constituted. The Panel has submitted the Statement of Acceptance and Declaration of Impartiality and Independence, as required by the Center to ensure compliance with the Rules, paragraph 7.\n4. Factual Background\nThe Complainants provide online social networking services and have rapidly developed considerable renown and goodwill worldwide, particularly in the United States. The Complainants’ websites at “www.facebook.com” and “www.instagram.com” are among the most visited websites in the world. The Complainants own numerous trademark registrations for the terms FACEBOOK and INSTAGRAM (collectively, the two “Marks’) in many jurisdictions throughout the world, including in the United States. The Complainants’ trademark registrations include but are not limited to the following:\n- United States Trademark No. 3041791, FACEBOOK, registered on January 10, 2006, (first use in commerce in 2004):\n- International Trademark No. 1075807, FACEBOOK, registered on 16 July 16, 2020:\n- United States Trademark No. 4146057, INSTAGRAM, registered on 22 May 22, 2012, (first use in commerce on 6 October 2010): and\n- International Trademark No. 1129314, INSTAGRAM, registered on 15 March 15, 2012.\nThe Complainants also own and utilize domain names around the world that incorporate the Marks, for example, with respect the United States <facebook.us> and <Instagram.us>.\nThe Complainants’ Marks are highly distinctive, well-known, and uniquely associated with the Complainants’ services and products.

As of this decision, the disputed domain names that previously resolved to parking websites do not appear to be active.\n5. Parties’ Contentions\nThe Complainants assert Respondent engaged in a pattern and practice over a five-year period of registering and using the sixty-nine disputed domain names which are confusingly similar to the Complainants’ Marks because each of the disputed domain names entirely incorporate one or other of the Marks and merely adds dictionary terms as a suffix. The Complainants assert that the Complainants never authorized the Respondent to use the disputed domain names, that the Respondent is not generally known by any of the disputed domain names, and that the Respondent has never engaged in any bona fide commercial activity in connection with and of the disputed domain names. The Complainants assert that the Respondent registered and used the disputed domain names in bad faith to attract unsuspecting internet users for commercial gain.\nThe Respondent did not reply to the Complainants’ contentions.\nThe Panel finds that the Complainants are related entities and the claims lodged against the Respondent by the Complainants are similar and show a common pattern and practice extending over a five-year period. Thus, the Panel finds that (i) the Respondent has engaged in common conduct that has affected the Complainants in a similar fashion, and (ii) that it would be equitable and procedurally efficient to permit the consolidation. WIPO Overview of WIPO Panel Views on Selected UDRP Questions, Third Edition, (“WIPO Overview 3.0”), section 4.11.1.\n7. Discussion and Findings\nUnder paragraph 4(a) of the Policy, to succeed the Complainants must satisfy the Panel that:\n(i) the disputed domain names are identical or confusingly similar to a trademark or service mark in which the Complainants have rights;\n(ii) the Respondent has no rights or legitimate interests in respect of the disputed domain names; and\n(iii) the disputed domain names were registered and are being used in bad faith.\nA. Identical or Confusingly Similar\nThe Panel finds that the disputed domain names are confusingly similar to the Complainants’ Marks.\nThe disputed domain names are all composed entirely of one of the other the Complainants’ Marks followed by the dictionary terms “advertising,” “corporation,” “angel,” “data base,” “product,” “social media,” “inc” (standing for “incorporation”), “corp” (standing for “corporation”), and “ind” (standing for “industry”), or combinations of these dictionary terms or abbreviations.\nA domain name which wholly incorporates a complainant’s registered mark is sufficient to establish confusingly similarity for the purposes of the Policy when, as here, the addition to the Mark is a generic or dictionary term. WIPO Overview 3.0, section 1.7; and Nomura International Plc / Nomura Holdings, Inc. contre Global Domain Privacy / Nicolas Decarli, WIPO Case No. D2016-1535 (transferring <nomura-bank.com>). See also WIPO Overview 3.0, section 1.8 (“where the relevant trademark is recognizable with the disputed domain name, the additions of other terms (whether descriptive, geographic, pejorative, meaningless, or otherwise) would not prevent a finding of confusing similarity under the first element”); Nomura International Plc and Nomura Holdings, Inc. v. Whois Privacy Protection Service, Inc. / PUK SERVICES, WIPO Case No. D2015‑2036 (transferring <nomuralabuan.com>); and Nomura International Plc. v. Name Redacted, WIPO Case No. D2021‑0654.\nThe generic Top-Level Domain of the disputed domain names, in this case “.com”, may be disregarded for the purposes of assessment under the first element, as it is viewed as a standard registration requirement. See WIPO Overview 3.0, section 1.11.1; and Monster Energy Company, a Delaware Corporation v. J.H.M. den Ouden, WIPO Case No. D2016-1759 (transferring <monsterenergy.world>).\nThe Complainants have met their burden under paragraph 4(a)(i) of the Policy.\nB. Rights or Legitimate Interests\nThe Panel finds that the Respondent has no rights or legitimate interests in the disputed domain names.\nThe Complainants have specifically disavowed providing the Respondent with permission to use the disputed domain names or either of the Marks. There is no evidence that the Respondent has conducted any bona fide business under the disputed domain names or is commonly known by the disputed domain names. The Complainants have established a prima facie case in their favor, which shifts the burden of production on this point to the Respondent. The Respondent, however, has failed to come forth with any evidence showing any rights or legitimate interests in the disputed domain names. Furthermore, the nature of the disputed domain names, being nearly identical to the Mark, carries a high risk of implied affiliation. See WIPO Overview 3.0, section 2.5.1. The disputed domain names either resolve to a parking website or are inactive which further supports the conclusion that the Respondent has no rights or legitimate interests in the disputed domain names. Facebook, Inc. v. Mirza Azim, WIPO Case No. D2016-0950; and Guinness World Records Limited v. Solution Studio, WIPO Case No. D2016-0186. The facts and circumstances presented to the Panel demonstrate that the Respondent does not have any rights or legitimate interests in the disputed domain names.\nThe Complainants have met their burden under paragraph 4(a)(ii) of the Policy.\nC. Registered and Used in Bad Faith\n1. Under paragraph 4(b) of the Policy, bad faith may be established by any one of the following scenarios:\n(i) circumstances indicating that the respondent has registered or acquired the domain name primarily for the purpose of selling, renting, or otherwise transferring the domain name to the complainant who is the owner of the trademark or service mark or to a competitor of that complainant, for valuable consideration in excess of the respondent’s documented out-of-pocket costs directly related to the domain name; or\n(ii) the respondent has registered the domain name in order to prevent the owner of the trademark or service mark from reflecting the mark in a corresponding domain name, provided that the respondent has engaged in a pattern of such conduct; or\n(iii) the respondent has registered the domain name primarily for the purpose of disrupting the business of a competitor; or\n(iv) by using the domain name, the respondent has intentionally attempted to attract, for commercial gain, Internet users to its website or other on-line location, by creating a likelihood of confusion with the complainant’s mark as to the source, sponsorship, affiliation, or endorsement of the respondent’s website or location or of a product or service on the respondent’s website or location.\n2. The Panel finds the disputed domain names were registered and are being used in bad faith.\nA simple Internet search, normally undertaken before registering the disputed domain names, would have disclosed the Complainants’ well-known Marks. The Marks are not common or descriptive terms. Common sense compels the conclusion that the Respondent was quite aware of the Complainants’ Marks when registering and deploying the sixty-nine disputed domain names all of which contain one of the other of the Complainants’ Marks followed by a variety of dictionary terms.\nEven if one were to accept the unbelievable proposition that the Respondent was unaware of the Marks, willful blindness is no excuse and does not avoid a finding of bad faith registration and use. Instagram LLC v. contact Privacy Inc. / Sercan Lider, WIPO Case No. D2019-0419. The registration by the Respondent of the disputed domain names that are currently inactive is an abusive threat hanging over the head of the Complainant. Conair Corp. v. Pan Pin, Hong Kong Shunda International Co. Limited, WIPO Case No. D2014-1564.\nAdditionally, the Respondent registered the disputed domain names under a privacy shield which in itself does not establish bad faith use and registration, but which is a factor the Panel may consider. See WIPO Overview 3.0, section 3.6. It further appears that the Respondent has exhibited a pattern and practice of registering and using domain names composed of other well-known trademarks owned by major corporations, for example <airbusincorporated.com>, <barclaysbankinc.com>, <ebayincorporated.com>, <fordmotorinc.com>, and <googlechrometechnology.com>.\nFinally, it is difficult to conceive of any use that the Respondent might make of the sixty-nine disputed domain names without the Complainants’ consent that would not involve bad faith. Telstra Corporation Limited v. Nuclear Marshmellows, WIPO Case No. D2000-0003; Verner Panton Design v. Fontana di Luce Corp, WIPO Case No. D2012-1909 (where the reputation of a complainant in a given mark is significant and the mark bears strong similarities to the disputed domain name, the likelihood of confusion is such that bad faith may be inferred); DPDgroup International Services GmbH & Co. KG v. Wise One, Wilson TECH, WIPO Case No. D2021-0109 (transferring <dpdcouriercompany.com>); and Monster Energy Company v. PrivacyDotLink Customer 116709 / Ferdinand Nikolaus Kronschnabl, WIPO Case No. D2016-1335 (transferring <monsterenergy.club>).\nThe Complainants have met their burden under paragraph 4(a)(iii) of the Policy.\nFor the foregoing reasons, in accordance with paragraphs 4(i) of the Policy and 15 of the Rules, the Panel orders that the disputed domain names:\nbe transferred to the Complainant Facebook, Inc., and that the disputed domain names:\nbe transferred to the Complainant Instagram LLC.\nWilliam F. Hamilton\nDate: July 20, 2021","Estimated difficulty: 💜🤍🤍🤍🤍\nNew year, new blog post… obviously!\nTo kick things of in 2023, today we’ll be talking about a commonly used social engineering technique called typo-squatting and how you can identify malicious domains/websites to protect yourself, or how to protect your organisation or brand if you own a website domain.\nTypo-squatting is by no means a new technique that attackers may use, but with a sharp increase in domain spoofing attempts since the COVID-19 pandemic (with over 150,000 new COVID-19 themed domains since December 2019) – it is an important technique to be aware of.\nWhat is typo-squatting?\nAlso known as URL hijacking, sting sites or fake URLs, typo-squatting is a form of social engineering which relies on users mistyping websites addresses when inputting them into a browser (the “typo” of typo-squatting). This could be down to rushed and imprecise typing, spelling errors, alternative spellings (e.g. American English v.s British English) or even using the incorrect domain ending.\nAttackers or threat actors will attempt to duplicate legitimate domains for fraudulent purposes, and will register domain names similar to their target so that unknowing users end up visiting the malicious domain instead when inputting a “typo’d” website address.\nThere are several ways attackers may try to abuse this, and may try to use one of the following to fool users into not knowing they are visiting an illegitimate site:\n- Mispelling the target site (e.g. securityyqueens.com instead of securityqueens.com)\n- Using a different top-level domain (e.g. .co rather than .com)\n- Adding similar words (e.g. cybersecurityqueens.com instead of securityqueens.com)\n- Adding extra full-stops (e.g. security.queens.com)\n- Using similar letters and characters to hide the illegitimate domain (e.g. séçurïtyqueéns.com)\nAttackers may register several variations of the target site at the same time to increase their chances in success, as well as duplicate the branding, content and layouts of their target site to try deceive the user.\nTypo-squatting may also be used in conjunction with phishing attacks to continue the narrative of the wider campaign.\nMore often than not, attackers will use this technique to try achieve another goal or exercise another motivation.\n- Extortion: Purchasing illegitamate domains to try to sell the typo domain back to the brand or organisation\n- Gaining a Competitive Edge: Redirecting users to a competitor site or brand\n- Advertising Revenue: Typo-domain owners may host advertisements on their sites to monetise traffic by using pop-ups or adverts\n- Affiliate Links: Users are redirected to the original website, via. an affiliate link so that the attacker can earn commission from all purchases on the brand’s website\n- Phishing: As mentioned above, directing users to an illegitimate site as part of a wider phishing campaign (to harvest credentials, install malware etc.)\n- Malware Installation: To install malware or adware into victim’s devices\n- Pranking: To cause irritation or annoyance to the target organisation by ridiculing the target organisation or brand on the typo-domain\n- Activism: Using the typo-domain to host negative content about the target organisation to ruin reputation or credence (popular with political domains)\nHow do we stop it?\nTypo-squatting itself can be tricky to prevent, as you are relying on the awareness of a user to identify illegitimate domains. Domain registries and registrars don’t necessarily have the ruling to prevent the malicious registrations of typo-domains, and often it is simple and cheap to purchase key domains that could severely impact or effect an organisation.\nYou can minimise the risk of falling victim to this technique by increasing awareness around the topic, such as:\n- Be aware of clicking links for unexpected emails or messages to unknown websites (such as verifying the sender email address, or contacting the sender through other means, e.g. calling them, to confirm it’s legitimate)\n- Ensuring that you have an up-to-date antivirus installed to detect threats and malware that may arise from illegitimate domains\n- Hovering over the links before clicking to check the URL for spelling, extra characters, hyphenation etc.\n- Navigate to websites using search engines and checking the results page\n- Bookmarking your favourite and frequented websites (such as social media, email, banking etc.)\nProtecting websites, organisations and brands\nTypo-squatting can happen to any of us, organisations or brands can consider purchasing similar domains to their website and implement redirects to ensure users are accessing the correct URL. This is typically a defensive stance organisations take, even Microsoft own over a dozen domains with variations of their own name to prevent such attacks!\nIn 2006 even the Google domain was typo-squatted when the domain name “goggle.com” was registered to take advantage of users that mistyped when trying to visit the search engine. Goggle.com downloaded viruses and malware to the victim’s computer whilst displaying a huge amount of spam and pop-ups on the victim’s screen. The website was active from 2004 to 2007 and was renowned for downloading a virus disguised as an antivirus, SpySheriff, onto victim’s computers. The combination of all the above forced victim’s to reinstall their operating systems to regain control, which meant an instant loss of all their files and data on their computer.\nIf you own a website and you are worried about being “typo-squatted” you can also use the following tools to detect what variations of your domain can be created, and if they have been registered (and by which country)\nDNSTwist is a website you can use that checks for typo-squat domains against a primary domain that you provide. It’s a really easy website to use, and by entering the domain you would like to check against DNSTwist provides you with a whole list of “twisted” domains and different permutations, including if they have been registered, which country they have been registered from, as well as other useful DNS information such as nameserver, mail server and IP addresses.\nDNSTwist also has a command line tool that you can use that you can install in different environments (including Linux, macOS and docker). You can find more information on the command line version from the DNSTwist Github.\nDNSRazzle is another tool that can be used to check for typo-squat domains and can also be installed via. Github.\nUsing some of DNSTwist’s functionality, the tool automates the fuzzing of typo-squat domains and provides information on registered domains (including screenshots!) as well as additional DNS information such as nameservers, mail servers and IP addresses.\nAnd that’s a wrap for the first blog post of 2023!

{"question":"How do birds manage their body temperature compared to other animals, and what specific environmental conditions are needed for their egg development in incubators?","answer":"Birds are warm-blooded animals like mammals, meaning they can regulate their body temperature. They lay only 4-5 hard-shelled eggs on land. For proper egg development in incubators, specific climate parameters must be maintained: temperature between 21-27°C and relative humidity between 50-60%. The incubation environment must be carefully controlled through ventilation systems that remove CO2 and excess moisture while maintaining stable conditions.","context":["Lesson Plan - Get It!\nCan you tell which animal below is the arthropod? Read on to get ready for your final project!\nDid you say the second picture is the arthropod?\nGreat job! The first picture of the lizard is a reptile, the second picture of the butterfly is an arthropod, the third picture of the puppy is a mammal, and the fourth picture of the salamander is an amphibian.\nIn this final lesson of the Animal Classification series, you will review everything you have learned about different types of animals. Tell a parent or teacher what you remember about mammals, reptiles, amphibians, fish, birds, and arthropods.\nThe first class of animal you learned about is mammals. There are many different types of mammals found around the world. Did you know you are a mammal? Mammals are warm-blooded creatures. This means they are able to regulate their body temperature and their body stays about the same temperature all their lives. Mammals are vertebrates. This means they have a backbone. Mammals have hair or fur on their body. Mammals have live babies. They don't have babies that hatch out of eggs.\nUnlike mammals, reptiles only have four types of animals. The four types of reptiles are: turtles, snakes, alligators and crocodiles, and lizards. Reptiles are different from mammals because they are cold-blooded. They have to warm their body in the sunlight and cool down in the shade. When reptiles are warm, they move much faster! Reptiles do not have fur or hair on their body like mammals do. They have rough, scaly skin. Reptiles are vertebrates just like mammals. They have a backbone, too! Mammals and reptiles are different because reptiles lay eggs instead of having live babies. They lay lots of hard-shelled eggs, and their babies hatch from these eggs. Reptiles have either four legs or no legs. Can you name the type of reptile that has no legs?\nAmphibians have a lot of things in common with reptiles. There are four types of amphibians: frogs, toads, newts, and salamanders. Just like reptiles, amphibians are cold-blooded, too. What do amphibians have to do to stay warm and cool down? Tell a parent or teacher. Unlike reptiles, amphibians have smooth, moist skin. If you touch an amphibian, it will feel wet and slimy! All amphibians have four legs. Amphibians lay eggs just like reptiles do. They usually lay their eggs in water, though! Just like mammals and reptiles, amphibians are vertebrates, too! They have a spine in their bodies.\nFish also share a lot of characteristics with reptiles and amphibians. Fish have gills instead of lungs. They use their gills to breathe underwater. Reptiles and fish both have scales covering their bodies. Their scales are hard and keep them safe from predators. Fish are cold-blooded just like reptiles and amphibians. Fish lay eggs like reptiles and amphibians do. Fish and amphibians both lay their eggs in the water.\nMammals, reptiles, amphibians, and fish are all vertebrates. What does it mean to be a vertebrate? Tell a parent or teacher.\nBirds share many common characteristics with mammals, reptiles, amphibians, and fish! Birds are warm-blooded just like mammals. What does it mean to be warm-blooded? Tell a parent or teacher. Instead of having fur, hair, scales, or smooth, moist skin, birds have feathers. They use their feathers to stay warm and help them fly! Birds lay eggs just like reptiles, amphibians, and fish do. Their eggs are laid on land and have hard shells. They don't lay nearly as many eggs as reptiles, amphibians, and fish do. They only lay four to five eggs. Birds are vertebrates. This means they have a spine. Tell a parent or teacher the other types of animals that are vertebrates. All birds have two legs. They use their two legs to catch prey, hold on to branches, and build their nest.\nThe last type of animal you learned about is called an arthropod. Arthropods have unique characteristics. Some examples of arthropods are: insects, spiders, crabs, shrimp, lobsters, and scorpions. They are cold-blooded. Tell a parent or teacher some other examples of cold-blooded animals. Arthropods have segmented bodies. This means their bodies are divided into multiple parts. For example, insects bodies usually have three parts: head, thorax, and abdomen. Arthropods have multiple limbs. Insects have six limbs and spiders always have eight limbs. All arthropods have an exoskeleton. Their exoskeleton is like a protective shield that keeps them safe. They lay eggs just like many of the other types of animals you learned about. Lastly, they are different from all the other animals you learned about because they are invertebrates. This means they have no backbone!\nExcellent job! You reviewed everything you have learned about mammals, reptiles, amphibians, fish, birds, and arthropods. Move on to the next section to continue reviewing what you have learned.","Tags: Climate control | Whitepaper\nApril 24 2019,\nThe optimum climate parameters for embryo development – temperature, humidity, and the balance between oxygen supply and carbon dioxide release from the incubator – are the same regardless of the climate zone in which a hatchery operates, up to an altitude of 1,200 metres.\nDeveloping embryos produce CO2 and heat, and moisture evaporates from the eggs. Much of the heat produced is collected by the water-cooling system and the rest is removed, together with the excess moisture and CO2, through ventilation. Used air is replaced by fresh air.\nThe purpose of ventilation is to provide fresh air and to remove waste products. In addition, fresh air, which is usually drier and cooler than the air inside the incubator, lowers the humidity and absorbs some of the heat produced by the embryos. Ideally, the air exchange is balanced so that the incubator's internal humidifiers, heaters and coolers simply have a corrective function and work only when necessary.\nModern incubators are technically able to fully control their internal microclimate. These systems are designed to maintain or restore the climate quickly after a machine has stopped or started, or if climate parameters deviate from the set points. It is preferable, however, not to have to activate the systems because intensive heating, cooling or humidifying destabilise the uniformity of the internal microclimate. It is a question of balancing the need for fresh air with the need to maintain a stable internal microclimate.\nIf fresh air were taken directly from outside the building, its parameters would reflect the local conditions: the season and daily fluctuations in temperature and humidity. Even in a moderate climate zone, temperatures can vary by up to 500C throughout the year, and daytime and night time temperatures can fluctuate by 20-300C. Likewise, humidity can vary substantially over 24 hours, depending on the weather conditions.\nThese fluctuations in the fresh air parameters represent a challenge for incubators. In order to achieve the desired set points, intensive heating, cooling and humidifying would have to take place, but this would reduce the uniformity of conditions inside the cabinet. To overcome this problem, air entering the incubator must be preconditioned. The optimum temperature range is 21-270C and RH range 50-60%. Creating these stable parameters requires an Air Handling Unit (AHU). Preconditioning is a costly process and therefore prepared air should be valued.\nIn practice, to lower the influence of the outside climate conditions, fresh air comes either from a room inside the hatchery building or a specialised air preparation room that can supply preconditioned air hygienically and economically. The air in either of these places should be seen as a precious resource, which must not be wasted.

{"question":"As someone interested in sustainable food choices, I'm curious how both nuts/seeds and community gardens contribute to environmental and social sustainability. Can you compare their impacts?","answer":"Both nuts/seeds and community gardens contribute to sustainability in different ways. Nuts and seeds help reduce greenhouse gas emissions - if each person ate one less pound of beef per week and replaced it with plant proteins like nuts, emissions would drop significantly. They also provide sustainable nutrition through protein, healthy fats, and other nutrients. Community gardens, while also providing local food, have a complex social impact - they can make neighborhoods more resilient and desirable, but this often leads to gentrification and rising real estate prices that can displace the original community members who helped create these 'resilient amenities.' So while both support environmental sustainability, community gardens raise important questions about social sustainability and who benefits from these improvements.","context":["By Jeanette Origel & Sarah Byrnes\nCommunity resilience is often thought of in concrete terms: growing local food, using sustainable energy, riding bikes and using alternative transit, and lowering carbon emissions.\nAll of this is tremendously important. But resilience is also a question of who, as well as what. It is possible to imagine a future full of gated neighborhoods that are highly resilient, where wealthy people live in carbon-neutral communities complete with bikes, electric cars, mini-farms, windmills, and solar panels.\nIt’s also clear that as communities build resilient “amenities,” such as community gardens, green space, walkable business districts, farmers markets, and bike paths, they become more desirable places to live – and real estate prices rise. Tragically, the folks who worked so hard to improve their communities, and make them resilient, get priced out.\nThis is how gentrification systematically undermines attempts to create resilience for all. It’s why the future scenario of “gated resilience” is one we must seriously consider and work to prevent. We must always ask: who is community resilience really for?\nÉl Platanero and Hi-Lo\nAccording to Jamaica Plain New Economy Transition (JP NET) organizer Carlos Espinoza-Toro, “Gentrification is a structural problem embedded into our financial and economic system.”\nBut despite its structural nature, people often approach gentrification as if it was a matter of individual choice. As a neighborhood changes and gentrifies, hurtful fights can break out. “New” and “old” neighbors often battle over potent symbols–such as murals and supermarkets. But it is possible to navigate these conflicts with skill and care, lessening the impact, and uniting the community rather than dividing it. (For an example, see this story about Beth Roy, a mediator who helped a community navigate gentrification in the San Francisco area.)\nTake, for example, Tropical Foods Supermarket–or “Él Platanero”–in Dudley Square, Boston. Jeanette’s father, a native of Mexico, has shopped at Él Platanero for many years. He found a sense of community there, where everyone understood one another. Él Platanero was a place where he could connect with people in his native language. In 2014 he learned of the supermarket’s upcoming renovation project. Although it would be under the same owners, he feared the new, remodeled location will mean more expensive groceries and a loss of its unique culture.\nLuckily, this story has a positive ending. The supermarket has now been open for business in its new space for a few months. It has brought in new customers, but it has also retained many old ones. Jeanette’s father still shops there and believes this change has had a positive outcome. The culture still remains and its appearance is more polished. Compared to other local supermarkets, her father believes Tropical Foods does a better job at respecting foreign and Latin American products. He can always count on finding his favorite products at reasonable prices.\nWe find a much more mixed story in neighboring Jamaica Plain, where a Whole Foods took over the “Hi-Lo” supermarket in 2011. Hi-Lo had served the Latino community for almost 50 years in JP. Very much like Tropical Foods in Dudley Square, it was a place to connect with friends.\nJeanette’s mother, of Puerto Rican descent, would visit Hi- Lo whenever she needed a product specifically from her home island. “At Hi-Lo, you almost felt as if you were shopping in a Latin American country,” she said.\nBut even though Hi-Lo often had great deals on groceries, a product she most searched for, “pana,” or breadfruit, was always over-priced. Growing up in Puerto Rico, Jeanette had a giant breadfruit tree in the backyard. What was once abundant and taken-for-granted now costs Jeanette’s mother almost $10 for just one piece of fruit.\nThis is the situation for many new Americans in search of a taste from home. Unable to find certain products for a good price, they have to settle for what is available.\nWhole Foods replaced Hi-Lo in 2011 after its long-time owners retired. This brought about both excitement and disappointment from Latino customers. Some were upset about losing a piece of home, while others were excited about change. Some worried there would be no place to find their products, and others–like Jeanette’s mother–worried that if Latin American products were sold at Whole Foods, the prices will increase even more.\nIn the end, Jeanette’s mother was right. Whole Foods does not carry breadfruit, and the prices for all its produce are high. While some Latino neighbors may occasionally get groceries at Whole Foods, it is certainly not the community center that Hi-Lo was.\nIn a gentrifying neighborhood, little “tastes of home” like breadfruit become hard–or even impossible–to find.\nFood is a powerful indicator of gentrification, and signifies who really belongs in a neighborhood. “If an institution like Whole Foods comes into a neighborhood and says it cares about the cultural well-being of neighbors, it should be able to provide food that enhances that well-being,” says Carlos. JP NET put together a “Meet your Neighbors’ Fruits” informational sheet so we can learn more about the fruits our neighbors know and love.\nClearly, fruit by itself does not address the structural causes of displacement. In fact, “It takes much more than one project or policy to address this issue,” says Carlos. “It takes a movement of people who understand it, structurally and systematically.”\nStrong movements are built on solidarity. That’s why JP NET hosts bilingual potlucks–on topics ranging from gardening to sports to climate change–in order to build trust across neighborhood divides. “We’ve learned that there is no quick fix to a structural problem,” says Carlos. “Only through conversations, education, and the slow work of relationship-building, can we spark a powerful movement of people who know, trust, and care about each other–and who are willing to fight for community resilience for all neighbors.”\nAbout the Authors\nJeanette Origel is a Community Leaders Fellow with the Jamaica Plain New Economy Transition (JP NET).

This trend can enhance the health of both our bodies and the planet. That is, by choosing more plant foods, we’ll end up eating less meat and animal protein. If each of us were to eat just one less pound of beef per week, greenhouse gas emissions would drop significantly.\nWhile seeds and grains are health-enhancing choices to include in your sports diet, their nutritional value can sometimes get exaggerated. The following information offers a perspective on some “trendy” foods that are getting mainstreamed.\nNuts and Seeds\nWant to add a nice crunch, along with vitamins and minerals, to your sports diet? Sprinkle some slivered almonds, chopped walnuts, pistachios, sunflower and sesame seeds into your yogurt, cereal, salad, and smoothie. Nuts and seeds offer protein, healthy fats, fiber, vitamin E, magnesium, and many other nutrients. The fact that a plant grows from a nut or seed indicates it is life sustaining.\nMany nuts and seeds offer alpha linoleic acid, aslod known as ALA, a type of health-protective omega-3 polyunsaturated fat. While ALA from plants is not as potent as the type of omega-3s found in fish, any omega-3 fat is better than none. But dieters beware! When you nonchalantly toss a few spoonfuls of nuts and seeds into your smoothies and salads to pump up their nutritional value, you can also easily toss in 100 to 400 calories. While vegans may need this protein and calorie boost, weight-conscious athletes who consume dairy and animal proteins might want to think twice.\nComparing Seeds and Nuts\nThis chart shows how 1/4 cup of nuts and seeds (two spoonfuls or a large handful) adds a lot of calories but minimal protein towards the daily target of about 60 to 90 grams of protein. Vegans still need additional plant proteins, like beans and tofu, to get enough protein.\n|Seed .25 Cup (30 g)||Calories||Protein g||Fiber g||Calcium mg||Iron mg mg|\n|Daily Target:||Daily Target:||Daily Target:||Daily Target:|\n|60-90 g||25-35 g||1,000 mg||8 mg men|\n|18 mg women|\nFlax seeds, commonly consumed for their ALA omega-3 fat benefits, need to be ground before being eaten. Otherwise, they pass through your intestines whole and undigested.\nChia seeds also offer ALA omega-3 fats—but you don’t need to grind them. Just sprinkle chia on yogurt and enjoy the crunch. When soaked in water for 10 minutes, chia seeds create a gel that can be used as a thickener for smoothies and as an alternative to eggs and oils in some recipes. The slimy consistency of soaked chia seeds can be tough to enjoy for some athletes. If you fall into the “no thank you camp,” worry not. You have many other options for enjoyably consuming similar nutrients in other seeds and nuts.\nSunflower seeds have a mild, pleasing taste when added to salads, trail mix, or cold cereals. For people with peanut allergies, sunflower butter is a popular alternative to peanut butter.\nPumpkin seeds, also known as pepitas, are slower to eat when you buy them in the shell. This can save unwanted calories.\nHemp seeds are touted as containing all the essential amino acids. Hemp adds a protein-boost to vegan diets, but at a high price. Hemp seeds costs about $15 per pound, as compared to soy nuts, that also have all the amino acids, about $3.50/lb.\nSesame seeds have a gentle flavor and make a nice addition to stir-fried tofu or chicken. Although sesame seeds are touted as being calcium-rich, their calcium is poorly absorbed.\nChopped nuts, such as walnuts or slivered almonds, add a protein boost—but not as much of a protein bonus as many athletes think. If you ate half a cup of walnuts (two man-sized handfuls), you’d get only 8 grams of protein. For the same calories, you could add 1.5 cups of cottage cheese to your salad and get five times more protein (40 grams).\nBoth whole and refined grain foods offer carbohydrates that easily fuel your muscles. Whole grains include whole wheat, brown rice, corn (including popcorn), oats, barley, millet, and quinoa. Unrefined grains offer trace minerals, such as magnesium and copper, that refined grains don’t offer because they are lost in processing.\nHowever, most refined grains are enriched with B-vitamins and iron, two important nutrinets for athletes. So, if you end up eating some white pasta or bread, there’s no need to fret! Dietary guidelines allow for half of the grains you consume to be refined.\nQuinoa is actually a seed, but we eat it as a grain, and it offers more protein than other grains. But take note (see the chart below): Quinoa is not a protein powerhouse, so eat it with tofu, beans or yogurt to reach the target of 20 to 30 grams protein per meal. Quinoa is also expensive: $6 per pound, as compared to brown rice at $1.50 per pound.\n|Grain / starch||1 cup cooked||Calories||Protein g||Fiber g||Iron mg|\n|Pasta, White||2 oz dry||200||7||2||2|\n|Pasta, Whole Wheat||2 oz dry||200||8||6||2|\n|Rice, White||1/3 c raw||225||4||1||2|\n|Rice, Brown||1/3 c raw||225||5||2||1|\n|Couscous||1/3 c raw||215||7||3||1|\n|Quinoa||1/3 c raw||200||8||5||3|\nThe bottom line:\nWhen you resolve to “eat healthier,” be sure to create a sustainable plan that will offer lifelong enjoyment. While you want to explore new foods, you don’t have to routinely choke down seeds and whole grains that do not really please your taste buds. By filling your meals with a variety of wholesome foods—including generous portions of colorful fruits and vegetables—you’ll be able to consume abundant nutrients that invest in both good health and top performance. Plus, you’ll also help save the planet by choosing more seeds and grains and fewer steaks and chops.\nNancy Clark, MS, RD, CSSD (Board Certified Specialist in Sports Dietetics) counsels both casual and competitive athletes at her office in Newton, MA (617-795-1875).

{"question":"As a furniture restorer working with antique pieces, I need to understand both historical woods and modern restoration. How did mahogany's popularity evolve in England during the 18th century, and what steps would I need to take today to restore a weathered mahogany outdoor piece?","answer":"Mahogany became popular in England around 1720 when import duties from 'The New World' were removed to address a trade deficit with Scandinavia. By the late 18th century, it became cheap enough to be used for both external work and carcass construction. To restore weathered mahogany outdoor furniture today, you would need to follow four specific steps: First, sand away the weathered or rotted wood using 80-grit followed by 120-grit sandpaper. Second, clean the furniture thoroughly using mineral spirits and a tack cloth. Third, apply stain or paint (using exterior-grade products). Finally, apply a finish/sealer - either oil-based polyurethane or varnish for maximum protection against moisture and UV rays.","context":["Dates of Accession of\nKings and Queens\nDate of Periods of\nWilliam and Mary\nWilliam III and Mary II\nOAK (to c. 1670)\nWALNUT (c. 1650–1730)\nMAHOGANY (c. 1730–1850)\nWalnut was introduced to England circa 1650 and was popular through the early 18th-century, when mahogany became the preferred choice of cabinetmakers. By the early 18th-century (circa 1720) England had a large trade deficit with Scandinavia mainly as a result of imported timbers for shipbuilding, particularly softwoods. The British government was obliged to address the situation and thus removed import duty from goods imported from “The New World.” This included mahogany from the Spanish West Indies as well as imports from Jamaica, an English island.\nAs a result of international trade - in particular the Far East trade - new and more exotic timbers arrived in England beginning in the mid-18th century. Satinwood came from the East and the West Indies, while rosewoods, kingwood, and tulipwood came from the East.\nBy the late 18th century mahogany became cheap enough to be used not only for the external work, but also for the carcass construction.\nBy the 1850s walnut returned as a popular cabinet timber both in solid and veneered form. Victorian walnut veneer is often much thinner than early-18th-century veneer, as it was cut by machine and not by hand.\nVeneering was first used in the second half of the 17th century (1650–1700).\nTypes of Veneer\nFeather or herringbone banding\nAntique Care Tips\nObjects should be used for the purpose for which they are intended.\nChairs should not be tilted back or stood on.\nDrawers should not be overloaded, and they should be opened with both handles simultaneously–otherwise the drawer becomes twisted in the carcass.\nWhen using a ballpoint pen, always protect the table or writing surface by placing some padding under the paper.\nOrnaments should not be placed directly on surfaces without a layer of protective covering; for example, felt pads.\nWaxed furniture should be dusted weekly. Alternatively, a light coat of beeswax polish may be applied two or three times a year and then buffed.\nPolished French furniture should be dusted regularly and given a firm rub with a clean soft rag every three months. No other polishing is necessary.\nChairs should be lifted by the seat rails, not by the crest rails or the arms.\nChests of drawers should be lifted from the base of the carcass, not from under the rim of the top.\nMarble tops should always be removed from furniture before the item is moved.\nThe marble should be carried in a vertical position, never horizontally.\nFor More Information\nFor more information on antiques on the Internet, visit these sites:\nPickwick always has the prettiest things and an incredible selection in the store. The staff is extremely well-versed on fine antiques, and they are always so helpful and friendly.\nBeth B. – Montgomery, Alabama\nCurate Your Home\nBachelor Chest - A small straight front chest of drawers with a fold-over top. The name derives from bachelors having small sets of rooms where limited space allowed the fold-over top to be used for writing.\nBlind Door - The doors of a bureau cabinet that has wooden panels and not mirror plates.\nBobbin Turned - Sections of turning, used on tables and chairs, that are ball- or bobbin-shaped.\nBole - A clay in liquid form that can be used over gesso before gilding. Bole can vary in color from red to yellow to gray.\nBonheur du Jour - A small late-18th-century ladies' writing table, often with a superstructure fitted with drawers.\nBoulle Work - A process of inlay that derives from a technique perfected by the Parisian cabinetmaker Andre Charles Boulle (1642-1732). This decoration is a form of marquetry in brass and tortoiseshell or horn. The patterns are cut out of the two materials previously joined together in one operation. Earliest examples date from around 1680 in France. Very little Boulle was made in England; however, many reproductions of this type of work were made in 19th-century France. Generally speaking, ormolu mounts are associated with Boulle work.\nBunfoot - As the name implies, a foot in the shape of a ball or bun. Originally of Dutch or German origin, its use spread to England in the late 17th century. Bunfeet are still used today as replacement feet, primarily on chests, either period or reproduction.\nCabriole Leg - A form of chair leg or table leg that appeared in England from France in the early 18th century. It is in the shape of a long slow “S”, the outward curve of the knee sometimes decorated. Many of the early examples ended in stylized goat feet, with later examples ending in pad feet, slipper feet, or claw and ball feet.\nCandleslides - Small rectangular wooden slides found below the mirror or blind doors of bureau cabinets. Candlesticks placed on these slides provided light for working and extra reflected light into the room.\nCanted - A right-angle corner that has been cut off. Canted corners are often fluted.\nCheval Mirror - A freestanding adjustable mirror standing on a four-legged frame. The mirrors, which were first known as “horse dressing glasses,” first became possible in the late 18th century when technical advances allowed the casting of single plates of glass six feet in length so that it was possible for a mirror to reflect the full height of a person standing close to the mirror. The French gave the name “cheval,” their word for horse, to this type mirror.\nCommode - A French term used to describe an important piece of cabinet furniture with drawers made to go against the wall. The commode was first seen in England during the reign of George II and illustrated in the Director in the mid-18th century. Commodes that were japanned, inlaid, and painted were a feature of late Georgian furniture.\nCrossbanding - A decorative treatment to the main veneer. The banding is laid with the grain, at right angles to the main veneer. Originally used to protect the expressive main veneer, it later became a decorative device.\nDrop-in Seat - A padded seat upholstered with horsehair (17th and 18th centuries) and overlaid with hessian and a final cover. The wooden framework that forms the base of the seat has webbing nailed across it. The seat pad then rests on strips of wood fitted to the inside seat rails of the chair.\nFeather Banding - A decorative edge on a plain veneer. Often used with a crossbanding, the narrow veneers are laid in the form of arrow feathers, or chevrons.\nFinial - Normally a turned tapered spire found on the top of bureau cabinets. Placed at the front corners, they are often made of the predominant timber and lathe-turned. Other examples can be found that are carved and gilded.\nGesso - A preparation of chalk worked into a paste with a binder and used as priming before gilding wood to be used in furniture or other decorative work.\nGiltwood - A soft wood, normally carved or decorated, that is covered with thin gold leaf.\nJapanning - The European imitation of oriental lacquer.

The arm supports and legs are in polished wood.\nLyre End - The support for a sofa or writing table of the Regency period in the form of a classical stringed instrument.\nMahogany - (Swietenia mahogani) A hard durable wood with a close straight grain, originally from the Spanish West Indies and later from Honduras. The color ranges from light red to dark brown and can be nearly black. It became popular circa 1720.\nMarquetry - The process of veneering with shapes, often scrolls, leaves, flowers, birds, and insects. This process was perfected by Dutch and German craftsmen and became popular in England in the middle of the 17th century, reaching its height during the reign of William and Mary throughout the 18th and 19th centuries.\nMortise and Tenon - A joint in which the projecting tongue (tenon) is inserted into a rectangular cavity (mortice) and held in place by pegs.\nMoulded-Front Chest - Influenced by the Dutch, these chests have sections of moulding applied to the front, often in geometric shapes.\nNeedlework or Needlepoint - Made with cotton, wool, or silk thread.

Wood furniture takes a beating from the elements when it sits outdoors, so it requires regular maintenance. If you’ve fallen behind on protecting your outdoor wood furniture, don’t despair! You can restore it to its original beauty and strength. We’ve done the research, and we can show you how!\nTo restore outdoor wood furniture, follow this sequence of steps:\n- Sand away the weathered or rotted wood.\n- Clean the furniture thoroughly.\n- Stain or paint the wood.\n- Apply finish/sealer.\nOf course, each of these steps requires some additional explanation. In the remainder of this article, we’ll describe each step in detail. We will also delve into the methods for restoring teak furniture, which differ somewhat from the steps you’d take with other types of wood. We’ll identify the best clear coat sealer for exterior wood and describe how best to protect your outdoor wood furniture from being damaged by the elements. Keep reading to learn more!\n4 Steps To Restore Outdoor Wood Furniture\nThe two major causes of outdoor wood furniture damage are excessive moisture and the sun’s UV rays. While it is no problem for wood furniture to get wet, it will begin to rot if it stays wet. So, make sure not to leave your wood furniture in the path of sprinklers, in a shady place where it cannot get dry, or on soil or grass where it will constantly absorb water from the ground. In addition to the danger of rotting due to moisture, wood furniture that sits in the sun will weather to a silver-gray hue as the sun’s UV rays break down the lignin in the wood. This process not only changes the color of the wood but also softens and weakens it.\nIf your outdoor wood furniture suffers damage from excess moisture or UV rays, follow these four steps to restore it to its original beauty:\n1. Sand Away Weathered Or Rotted Wood\nYour first step is to remove any rot or weathering on the surface of the wood. Paint, stain, and varnish will not adhere to weathered or rotted wood, so you must perform this step thoroughly and carefully. To get the best results, use a random orbit sander and, where necessary, sand by hand. Go over the entire surface with 80-grit sandpaper, then repeat with 120-grit paper to get a smooth surface. Pay special attention to inside corners, between slats, and other hard-to-reach areas.\nWhen the damaged surface is sanded away, you’ll have like-new wood ready for staining, clear-coating, or painting.\n2. Clean The Furniture Thoroughly\nOnce you’ve sanded your wood furniture, clean all the sanding dust off. First, blow it off using your own breath or, preferably, a hairdryer set on low heat. Vacuum up all the dust on the dropcloth and in the surrounding area so that it will not rise and adhere to the furniture after you’ve applied stain or clear finish. Next, dip a tack cloth in mineral spirits and wipe the furniture entirely clean. Allow it to dry until it returns to its original color.\n3. Stain Or Paint The Wood\nIf you choose to stain your furniture, use a high-quality brush made specifically for applying stain to the wood. You can select a stain with sealing agents included in its chemical formula or one that requires a separate sealer to be applied after staining. Stir the stain thoroughly until all the pigments in the can are fully mixed. Apply stain thickly to the wood, but not so thickly that it pools. After 10-15 minutes, wipe away the excess with a clean rag.\nIf you decide to paint rather than stain, select an exterior-grade paint and primer, which will protect the furniture from moisture. Using a high-quality brush, apply a coat of primer to the furniture.\nFollow this by two or three thin layers of paint, allowing each coat to dry completely before you apply the next. Make sure to cover all of the wood, including the bottom surfaces and between slats. Wipe away drips with a clean cloth.\n4. Apply Finish/Sealer\nIf you’ve applied a stain that does not include a sealer, your final step will be to make the furniture impervious to moisture by applying a clear coat of sealer. You may use polyurethane or varnish: each has its own unique set of advantages and disadvantages.\nPolyurethane is like liquid plastic, forming a hard protective coat as it dries. It is waterproof and protects the wood from scratching, cracking, and chipping. Although polyurethane comes in water-based and oil-based varieties, only the oil-based type is suitable for exterior wood. The major disadvantage of oil-based polyurethane is that it dries with an amber tint, altering the color of lighter woods. Its main advantage is convenience: it requires only one or two coats to fully protect your furniture.\nMost types of varnish also cure a light amber tint. Varnish is stronger and more durable than polyurethane; however, it requires at least six thin coats to reach maximum effectiveness with substantial drying time. It provides both waterproofing and protection from UV rays. In addition, it is more flexible than polyurethane, so it adapts better to shrinkage and expansion of the wood.\nCan Weathered Teak Be Restored?\nIt is not difficult to restore weathered teak furniture. You will follow a three-step process similar to restoring other outdoor wood furniture types: 1) sanding, 2) cleaning, and 3) protecting.\n1. Sand Your Teak Furniture\nUsing 80-grit sandpaper with an orbit sander and hand-sanding where necessary, remove the silvery-gray surface wood until you reach the underlying layer of healthy teak. Then go over the entire surface with 150-grit sandpaper to achieve a smooth finish, ready to accept stain. Make sure to thoroughly sand all surfaces, including hard-to-reach areas such as inside corners and between slats. After you’ve sanded, spray the furniture clean with a low-pressure setting on your garden hose sprayer.\n2. Clean Your Teak Furniture\nBefore your furniture is fully dry, apply teak cleaner to it, using a scrubbing pad or a soft-bristled scrub brush. Work the cleaner into the wood and let it sit for 5-10 minutes for a deep clean. Then respray the furniture with your garden hose sprayer on a low-pressure setting. Set your furniture in a sunny spot to allow it to dry completely.\n3. Protect Your Teak Furniture\nFinally, protect your teak furniture from drying out again by applying a finishing product to it. You may choose either a teak protector — which shields the wood from UV rays — or a teak sealer, which protects from both UV rays and moisture. In either case, use a sponge to apply an even coat of the product to all wood surfaces. Make sure to coat hard-to-reach surfaces such as those between slats. Allow your furniture to dry for at least 24 hours after sealing it before replacing cushions or using it.\nWhat Is The Best Finish For Teak Wood?\nThe three types of finishes used on teak wood are: 1) teak oil, 2) teak protector, and 3) teak sealer. We’ll discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each below.\nTeak oil is actually derived from other plants, usually linseed or tung. Its purpose is to restore the shiny luster of teak wood after the natural oils have dried up. It is formulated to be thinner than pure linseed or tung oils so that the wood’s dense grain absorbs it deeply. Rubbing teak oil on your furniture gives the wood a warm, homey glow. Teak oil is best used on indoor furniture because it restores the oiled look of teak wood; it does not protect against moisture or UV rays.\nLike teak oil, a teak protector restores the shine to your wood; it also protects from UV rays. Because its effects last up to four times as long as those of teak oil, teak protector is a highly popular choice for application to indoor furniture, especially pieces that sit in sunny areas.\nSome homeowners choose to apply teak protector to their outdoor furniture; however, it is not the ideal choice for teak furniture exposed to the elements because it does not provide a waterproof finish.\nThe best finish for outdoor teak furniture is, unquestionably, teak sealer. This product provides both a waterproofing finish and protection from UV rays. It is available in a clear-coat formula that highlights the natural luster and grain of the teak wood or in various brown shades that serve as both stain and sealer.\nWhat Is The Best Exterior Clear Coat For Wood?\nAlthough numerous types of exterior clear coats for wood all fall into two basic categories: those that penetrate deep into the wood’s pores and those that form a filmy shell on top of the wood. Penetrating clear coats include oils such as teak, tung, and linseed oil, which provide a natural luster and add strength and moisture resistance to the wood. Clear coating products that form a protective shell include polyurethanes and varnishes. Both of these products provide waterproofing and protection from UV rays.\nThe best clear coat for exterior wood is marine spar varnish, made from linseed oil and alkyd resin. Spar varnish is flexible enough to move with the wood’s expansions and contractions as the outside temperature and humidity fluctuate. It waterproofs the wood and protects it from UV rays.\nThe spar varnish’s initial application is time-consuming, as it should be applied in six to ten thin coats, with plenty of drying time between coats. However, after the first application, it requires only a light sanding and one fresh thin coat annually.\nShould I Cover My Patio Furniture Every Night?\nAs long as you have protected your wood patio furniture from moisture by oiling or sealing it, there is no need to cover it at night. Any dampness that might collect on the furniture overnight will evaporate during the following day. However, you should cover your furniture if you plan to leave it unused for a substantial period of time: several weeks or longer.\nRestoring your weathered outdoor wood furniture adds to its attractiveness and lengthens its lifespan. Whether you use oil, a product that provides UV protection without waterproofing, or a sealer that both waterproofs and protects your furniture from UV rays, you will have a variety of options to choose from. By following the steps outlined above, you can return your furniture to looking like new and keep it attractive and functional for years to come!\nYou may also enjoy:"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:e374b827-2cd5-488b-a7a9-94b670c4c74d>","<urn:uuid:c88f7f54-e81a-4f74-9b68-ae5f01c1de65>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do window treatments affect insulation in buildings compared to building fabric choices?","answer":"Both window treatments and building fabric play important roles in insulation, but in different ways. Building fabric, including walls, roofs, and floors, controls energy flow between interior and exterior through thermal mass and insulation properties. Materials like stone, concrete, and brick act as thermal storage, absorbing and slowly releasing heat. In contrast, window treatments like blackout curtains, shutters and wooden slat blinds provide adaptable insulation - they can block out sunlight and heat when closed, helping maintain indoor temperature. Window coverings also offer UV protection, with full draperies providing SPF 15 and blackout curtains offering maximum protection. The key difference is that building fabric provides permanent, structural insulation while window treatments offer flexible, adjustable control over heat and light.","context":["Winston Churchill said, “we shape our buildings and, in time, our buildings shape us.”\nThe relationship between People, Climate and Buildings is non- linear and complexly interdependent. Changes of temperature with time can cause discomfort if they are not under the control of building occupants. The building fabric is a critical component of any building, since it both protects the building occupants and plays a major role in regulating the indoor environment. Consisting of the building’s roof, floor slabs, walls, windows, and doors, the fabric controls the flow of energy between the interior and exterior of the building.\nIt is often difficult to anticipate indoor environmental quality problems since prevailing materials and construction practices change faster than scientists are able to evaluate their potential health impacts. Health and comfort can also be affected by physical factors, such as lighting and heat, and by the physical organization of the space. The air-handling systems can affect the amount of moisture in a building and thereby prevalence of upper respiratory tract symptoms. Building design, operation, and maintenance can all have critical impacts on worker health and well-being, and some interventions have been found to improve health.\nThe building fabric must balance requirements for ventilation and daylight while providing thermal and moisture protection appropriate to the climatic conditions of the site. Fabric design is a major factor in determining the amount of energy a building will use in its operation. Also, the overall environmental life-cycle impacts and energy costs associated with the production and transportation of different envelope materials vary greatly.\nThere is term called Thermal comfort is influenced by factors that affect the way the body loses and gains heat. Other than the critical component of temperature, these factors include:\n- Air movement (breezes or draughts)\n- Radiant heat sources (e.g. direct sunshine) heat sinks (e.g. cool surfaces)\nThermal comfort can be considered generally as a range of temperatures that is influence by these factors. For example, a higher temperature may still be comfortable.\nIf cross-ventilation is present, while high humidity will reduce evaporative cooling and lower the upper temperature limit.\nWhat we have discussed above is scientific reason behind what we face in our daily life. Generally what happens are maximum temperatures usually occurring after noon and minimum temperatures in the early morning. The range varies according to location, with high variation in continental areas, and low variation in maritime areas.\nDiurnal temperature variation\nA second important factor in fabric design is what occurs inside the building. If the activity and equipment inside the building generate a significant amount of heat, the thermal loads may be primarily internal (from people and equipment) rather than external (from the sun). This affects the rate at which a building gains or loses heat.\nBuilding Configuration also has significant impacts upon the efficiency and requirements of the building fabric. Careful study is required to arrive at a building footprint and orientation that work with the building fabric to maximize energy benefit.\nTransmission loss through ground floor\nIn keeping with the whole building approach, the entire design team must integrate design of the fabric with other design elements including material selection; daylighting and other passive solar design strategies; heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) and electrical strategies; and project performance goals. One of the most important factors affecting fabric design is climate. Hot/dry, hot/humid, temperate, or cold climates will suggest different design strategies. Specific designs and materials can take advantage of or provide solutions for the given climate.\nAs we have already discussed that building fabric Consists of the building’s roof, floor slabs, walls, windows, and doors, the fabric controls the flow of energy between the interior and exterior of the building. We have to seriously think of alternatives that can be more effectives yet environment friendly. We have been using glass in buildings, is glass the best option we have? Although the glass facade looks striking, glare remains a major problem. As most glass curtain walls cannot be opened, ventilation is another issue that needs special attention. Glass is also poor in terms of heat preservation, leading to higher costs in the operation of air-conditioners. I am not against using glass in building design; then what else below mentioned are examples\n“In a desert country like Qatar that is sunny all year round, it is not logical to build towers with glass facades that attract the heat of the sun to the inside of the building. The air conditioners will need to use more power to be able to cool the heat that was attracted to the building through the glass façade. There are alternatives to glass and aluminum facades. We can use stone for example in the facades, it will look good and it is in line with the desert environment. This doesn’t mean going back to the past, but to respect and develop elements of the past according to the changing needs and requirements of modern life. “We need to combine old and modern elements to come up with a new architectural style. It’s just an example of how people have already started thinking about using alternative building materials.\nA more sensible way of designing a building is to take the environment into consideration when designing the building in the first place. When we work with nature like this, the need for mechanical and artificial heating and cooling is reduced, with considerable savings in energy use. This saving is not just financial, but also environmental.\nOrientation of your property to maximize natural resources, and eliminate un-necessary heating & cooling. Understanding the path of the sun and it’s angle in the sky at various times of year is key to working with nature in order to reduce energy costs.\nSun Path Diagram\nThe sun rises daily in the east and sets in the west. In summer in North America, it will pass almost directly over-head at noon, whilst in winter its path will be low in the southern sky. This is true for any location north of the equator, and the further north you go, the lower the sun will be in the southern sky – south of the equator the sun follows a path that is low in the northern sky.\nTherefore, to let the sun inside the house in winter, most windows should be on the southern side. Windows on the east and west tend to lose more heat than they gain in winter and they can cause overheating in summer since they receive hot morning and afternoon sun. A roof overhang over southern windows shades the windows in summer while allowing sunshine in during winter, due to the lower position of the sun in the sky – the sun shines in under the overhang to heat the inside of the house\nIf the sun is allowed to stream in through a window, the room will warm up. If there is a concrete floor or thick walls, they too will warm up and stay warm for a long time and release heat slowly into the room after the sun has gone down. The walls and floor act as thermal mass to store the heat gained. Stone, concrete, brick, adobe and rock chips are all good thermal storage materials, which can be incorporated in walls, floors and a fireplace.\nCooling a Building\nBesides providing heat during winter, successful climate sensitive buildings are cool in summer. Sufficient overhang protects the south facing windows from the high summer sun while at night, the house must be well ventilated to cool the place down. Insulation and thermal storage that retain heat in winter will keep the building cool during hot days.\nIn very hot climates ventilation is important. For example, a front porch is used to cool the air before it circulates through the house via the windows, which open on the porch. Plants and trees are also cooling, preventing heat to be reflected off bare ground while deciduous creeper growing over a porch will shade it in summer and let the sun through in winter when the leaves fall.\nThe skin of a building is made up of various materials, which may reflect, absorb, store, transmit or resist heat. In winter, retarding heat loss is as important as admitting sunlight, so the roof needs insulation, normally in the form of a ceiling with additional bulk insulation on top.\nA wide variety of commercial insulation materials are available on the market, or in low-income houses, a layer of crumpled newspaper is better than no insulation at all, but fire risks should be considered. The curtains help to insulate windows while in very cold climates people use double-glazing (two sheets of glass with a gap between them) to reduce heat loss through windows. Similarly, a double wall (a double brick wall with an air gap in between) can be used to prevent losses and gains through walls.\nThe shape of a building is also important from an energy point of view. A tall, slender building has a high surface area to volume ratio. Ideally a building should be compact, with a low surface area to volume ratio, since the building’s surface is the element through which the heat transfer occurs.\nSome practical advice….\n- Ceiling / loft insulation will reduce the need for heating the home and could reduce energy costs by 50%\n- Plastering is an excellent method for insulating walls, as it improves the moisture resistance. Within walls, non conducting material such as polystyrene sheets can b used.\n- Traditional building materials such as mud bricks, thatch roofs, clay walls and floors are all also excellent sources of insulation\n- In North America, window and doorframes are now most often made of steel except in the coastal areas where rust is a problem and wood is the material of choice. Wood however, provides a better insulation than steel.\nClimate sensitive design principles can be incorporated to various degrees in office buildings, social housing, private homes as well as apartment buildings and townhouses. Incorporating energy efficient design principles, especially in the delivery of low cost housing, would have numerous benefits to the poor families living in these houses. Low-cost houses may be cheap to build, but their running costs are astronomical. Because of the use of energy-inefficient materials, it is sometimes warmer outside the house than inside. The costs of keeping these houses heated come out of the earnings of the people who can least afford to pay them – heating can cost poor people up to 60% of their income.\nNet Zero Building\nThere are tangible benefits through the use appropriate building fabric such as:\n- Reducing extremes of heat and cold within your home, improving quality of life\n- Working more with nature, the health of people working or living within buildings improves\n- Energy demand reduces due to less need for artificial heating , lighting and cooling\n- Savings on energy costs (electricity and heating bills), therefore releasing funds for other basic essentials such as food, clothing and education\n- Financial benefits through energy and subsequent monetary savings\n- Environmental benefits through reduced air pollution; which is a result of less ‘dirty’ fuels being used\n- Improved air quality reduces the cases of respiratory and associated illness\n- Benefit to power suppliers through reduced/eliminated peak electricity demand\nA house – your home, an office – any building, can be seen as a shelter, protecting an indoor space from the weather and external elements. Our shelters allow us to maintain a comfortable environment, free from the extremes of heat or cold outside. For achieving this we need to be careful while choosing the fabric of our buildings. That will not only serve the purpose but will also help us in achieving the maximum output. Good health results in maximum attendance of the employee.\nOrganisations always have concerns about employee health, so healthy employee means maximum output. Better concentration for student results in better academic performance. If we will start now then our future generations will also get benefit from it. Because building we make are not only for us but for our future. Therefore let us make our future bright.","Category: Interior Design and Decorating\nComments Off on Living Room Window Treatment Ideas\nYour living room is one of the most used rooms in the house and by all members of the family. That’s why getting the most out of your front room interior design project is crucial to having a space everyone can enjoy. While carpets, entertainment centers and color choices often help to make a living room stand out from the crowd, window treatments are an often neglected but important part of any living space. Use these ideas for your window treatments and get a design that’s perfect for anyone and everyone who enjoys this special room.\nPanels and Valance\nBasic and complete, a simple valance and two window panels can make any living room feel homey and welcoming. Use sheer panels to match all of your interior design ideas perfectly, and then use a set of heavy black out curtains cleverly disguised behind the sheer panels to block out light or dark easily.\nThese accordion like shades come in a huge variety of fabric options to please even the most discriminating fabric. Best of all, roman shades are very easy to install and can provide your front room with a completely enclosed window or a completely open one.\nWhen simple blinds aren’t enough of a look for your design, you can use swags to make a really big impact in a little way. Swags are often used to decorate double hung windows, to showcase the window sashes. Side by side windows can really benefit from the use of a swag in your living room design.\nTie Back Panels\nYou can easily dress up any window with a versatile yet elegant tie back panel. Using long and flowing curtains and fabrics, drape the materials over a lush curtain rod and tie back one or both of the panels to let your living room really feel elegant.\nSimilar to a roman shade, a pleated shade is set inside of the casement of a window and typically runs on a track inside the window seal. If you’re looking to match your living room design ideas with the perfect window treatment for your front room then a pleated shade is the best choice for you. These hefty window treatments work especially well when trying to get away and the living room is used more as a movie theater because pleated shades are very good for blocking out all sunlight.\nComments Off on Pelmet Designs and Curtain Pelmets For Window Treatments\nPelmets are in vogue and really change the whole appeal of the curtain and give the room and window a distinctive look. There are various pelmet designs that you can pick as curtain pelmets for window treatments. But if we look at the pelmet designs broadly then it can be categorized into stiff pelmet and pelmet valance. The stiff pelmet is made from the pelmet board on which the fabric is pasted so there is no frills or pleats here. But in case of valance pelmets the fabric has the pleats that flows downwards. Although there are now rollers and blinds but both the styles of pelmets are in and used by many.\nCurtain pelmets are chiefly used for window treatments but these are also used to stop the excess of light above the curtain head and the light that is coming from the top of the window. You can also dramatize the whole interior with the marvelous curtain pelmets designs.\nCurtain Pelmets Designs\nIn some cases of curtain pelmets for window treatments, the pelmet is used alone without curtains. Here stiff pelmets are used. The pelmet design can vary according to the window. Craftsman can show his or her creativity by giving different carves and angles to the wood.\nBut in other case the pelmet board is completely decorated with the curtain fabric and with swags and tails of the same fabric. The number of swags vary and depends upon the size of the window or where the pelmet curtain is being used. Even the frills and pleats are also given. To further decorate the curtain pelmets the lower end of the frills are then embellished with braids, beads or fringes.\nCurtain pelmet color can be similar to the color of other textile furnishings like bed covers, cushions, bed sheets etc. The coordinating colors look really good if used properly. More balance should be provided by combining dark and light colors. Even the dark color pelmet can be used to lower the roof if your room has high roof.\nWooden Pelmet Designs\nWooden pelmet designs are made from wood and the length is custom made. The color choice is also based on the selection of the customer. All types of contemporary and traditional wooden pelmet designs can be checked that look very elegant. These have the carving of wood so there is no need of fabric to decorate it further.\nContemporary Pelmet Designs\nContemporary pelmet designs are different from the traditional in prints, bulkiness and type of fabric used. In the contemporary styles the fabric used is generally very light and soft in color with small prints or plain. In this the pelmet is covered either by frills or swags. The swags of the pelmet curtains are mostly sewn so that whenever you need to wash these you can do it easily without damaging the pelmet curtain design and its style. Swags are mostly done for the tall windows to add style and touch of royalty. But there is no hard and fast rule of doing so. You can use swag on any window where you want to do it but make sure that room size should be considerable as with swags in pelmets the room tends to appear small.\nCurtain and pelmet designs compliment with each other so must be selected accordingly.\nCurtain pelmet design can be made from the carved wood which is the original style of the pelmet. You can use the curtain of different tone. Even the scalloped curtain pelmets are in vogue. You can also consider the molded ceiling cornice pelmet designs as well, which again is a traditional curtain pelmet design. This pelmet does not look individual and looks like a part of the ceiling.\nPelmet designs also involve the used of elaborated upholstery. In most of the formal dining room it is easy to see these pelmet designs having too many curtains, swags and tails. With this type of pelmet design generally the height of the roof is lowered to give room a balance look.\nSo in this way you can create a beautiful pelmet designs and carry curtain pelmets for window treatments.\nComments Off on Getting a Blackout From Window Coverings\nWindow coverings can effectively block out the sun or provide your home or office a total blackout when you need it. The type of material or fabric you use for the setup will determine how much black you can get. You have to consider the various elements that will help make your windows truly functional. You can successfully block out the sun and other external elements by following a few simple rules and guidelines when designing.\nKeeping UV Out\nUVA and UVB rays can be very dangerous if the skin is exposed to it frequently or for long periods. You can get the right SPF just by correctly designing your window covering. If you want to achieve SPF 15, you have to invest in full draperies, pulled fully to the side with a tie back or hung over straight panels located at the window side. These are very effective, since these do not interfere with the sunlight that filter through the windows. These can also cause the furnishings to be exposed to damage constantly every day.\nSPF 30 Protection\nIf you want to achieve SPF 30, you have to design a sheer draper panel or blind to the window treatment to get more sun protection and privacy. Hang the sheer on a sole top-mount track that can easily be pushed to the side or even hidden behind drapery panels when not needed. If you like to add the look of fabric blinds independently, sheer louvers are also very useful. These are flexible products that help manage light exposure and boost energy efficiency.\nYou can also get adhesive sun protection that can be applied by a professional to the interiors of windows, giving you 99% protection from UV rays and about 80% protection from solar heat. You will then get less energy use. Darker films will of course, give you added protection. Clear models of curtain ideas using good solid curtain fabrics created by some manufacturers can give you the same advantages without having to change the look of the windows.\nFor Very Hot Days\nSome areas or angles of the house or building may require additional sun protection. You can effectively block out the sun or get SPF 60 by hanging draperies or blackout curtains which are completely closable or fully functional. You can protect the interiors from damage when you are not in the house for an entire weekend, day or vacation. If you do not stay in your house very long, you can invest heavily in draperies and leave these closed once you exit daily.\nShutters and wooden slat blinds are also useful in giving almost complete sun block when closed. The louvers can be fixed upward to redirect or deflect sunshine away from your furnishings. When thinking about blackout blinds a blind factory that produces romans or soft fabric blinds and matchstick or bamboo blinds also offer complete protection.\nGetting the View\nYou can still achieve a complete blackout if you want to sleep in during the day and have the view you’ve always wanted if you have great windows and doors that feature beautiful backgrounds and landscapes. You can design honeycomb shades that can pull up very tightly. Wood blinds are very bulky and should be used strategically or you risk blocking your view together with the light. Bay windows are very easy to cover since these have no sheetrock in between. You can choose the covering over your choice for these.\nPitiably, uncontrolled and unregulated exploitation of forest tracts and felling of trees for commercial use has led to mass deforestation, which has resulted in the price of timber- and wood-based products multiplying many times over in the last decade. Moreover, the specter of global warming and climate change is hanging like a shadow over our senses, to which we have been a great contribution. Designers as well as home owners are on the constant look out for environment friendly, cheaper and viable alternatives to wood and wood based products, chiefly due to the price factor and also due to the frequent maintenance need of wood doors, frames, furniture and windows. With premier infrastructures that are high-rise in nature. Investing with Provident Plots Bommasandra, E-City can help you enjoy and witness stunning landscaped views from pristine vantage points.

Any discerning builder and home owner is sure to think about the materials he would use in building the home or building, due to a multiplicity of reasons – mainly the cost, security and the estimated life span of the material. Designers choose UPVC over other materials like aluminum, cast iron, wood and other available options for the window and door designs primarily due to its weather resistant properties as much as it offers strength and aids ease of use and maintenance. The frames of windows and doors are also made of UPVC due to its sturdy nature in addition to its properties of withstanding diverse and extreme weather conditions.\nUPVC is the low cost, low maintenance solution to every window and door design, with no or minimum need for post installation servicing and care. Also UPVC is an inherently chemically inert material which coupled with its toughness gives it the best option for durability over the other available materials.\nUPVC windows offer the best kind of insulation against outdoor noises, sounds and a diverse range of weather conditions, better than any other material in use such as wood, iron and aluminum.\nUPVC windows and frames are good at maintaining indoor warmth from permeating outside and outdoor noises from entering indoors. The multi-boundary set up of UPVC windows and door units aid to create the extra acoustic insulating properties, which is unfounded in other materials in use. Windows and doors made of UPVC offer more advantages than that of their alternatives as it does not rot, warp or peel like wood and unlike iron or aluminum, it wouldn’t rust. And the quality and longevity of UPVC windows and frames is many times more compared to their counterparts.\nMetal balances rather than sash cords provide smooth, easily controlled opening and closing of the best made UPVC windows.\nA simple tilt catch mechanism is all it takes to allow the window sash to tilt inwards to enhance your natural ventilation options. It also aids in easy cleaning of the pane. Severe and thorough testing during production of the UPVC windows, frames and doors have aided in designing tightly weather sealed windows, doors and frames that prevent draughts and rattles which windows usually develop in high wind areas.\nComments Off on Window Treatments: Ideas and Design Tips From An Experienced Interior Designer\nAs an interior designer in Sarasota, Florida, I often write about interior design from a Sarasota perspective. As I sit at my desk and look out the windows at the azure sky, tufts of cotton clouds drift along the breeze, and sheer curtains are wafting in the air. I love the look of a light and delicate sheer drifting into the room on a warm, fragrant, gentle wind.\nLet’s talk about why we treat windows. There is obviously a decorative element: draperies and fabrics add a softness to a room and an opportunity to coordinate other elements and fabrics in decor. But there are practical reasons as well. One is solar control. Draperies can be closed to darken a room, blocking out light and the damaging, fading rays of the sun. In addition, closing the curtains assists in reducing heat-gain or -loss into a room and thereby lessening the need for air conditioning or heating.\nMany of our friends and clients are here for the season and then travel or return to their other places for weeks or months at a time. In order to help protect furnishings and artwork it is important to keep the rooms as dark as possible when you are not in residence. It seems only ceramic tile and most stone flooring are impervious to the bleaching rays of the sun. Wood floors, carpets, furniture and almost all fabrics will suffer from exposure not just to the sun, but even a bright room! Silk fabrics are particularly susceptible to exposure to the sun and are famous for sun-rot; silk curtains must be protected with durable lining to protect them.\nSecondly, there is the measure of privacy that certain fabrics and treatments can provide. Opaque fabrics add quite a bit of privacy, of course, but you have to be wary of sheers. They provide a wonderful tempering of the light and some privacy, but only on the brighter side of the window. For instance, if you are on a sunny street, looking at or into a window with sheers, the fabric blocks your vision into the room, but someone in the room can see fairly well to the outside.\nHowever, at night the condition is reversed. When a room is bright and it is night, someone outside the room can see fairly clearly into the room, while someone in the room can only see the surface of the sheer. So be aware of the fallacy of privacy when using sheer draperies.\nSheers do assist at night however in the reduction of expanses of glass turning into unattractive black mirrors. If you have a view to the bay or downtown, there are the lights and reflections to provide even a nighttime view. But if you are facing onto a golf course or the Gulf, you have only a black window to stare at. Sheers are a fine answer to providing a decorative and pleasant treatment of nighttime windows."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:b7b50ef6-ab07-4765-bd64-976e76d40f9b>","<urn:uuid:c1fd344c-7c06-4ade-8570-c1b16668a494>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How should wool sweaters be dried after getting wet?","answer":"Wool sweaters that get wet should be dried at room temperature away from any direct heat source.","context":["The Wonderful World of Sweaters\nAs the styles of sweaters change, so do the fibers of this wardrobe staple. Sweaters are made from a variety of fibers, ranging from cotton and wool to silk, rayon, acrylic and more. Natural fibers, such as angora, mohair, cashmere, and Shetland are especially popular. To add to the variety many sweaters contain special decorative trims. Trims such as suede, leather, snakeskin, fur, sequins, and beads add to a sweater's special look. The following tips should make the care and maintenance of sweaters easier:\nA good tip for long lasting sweaters is to check to see if it will withstand your lifestyle. If you're an active person or plan on wearing it to dance parties, go for a harder, tighter yarn. Soft, loose yarns tend to stretch easily and often begin to show signs of wear much faster.\n• Although not a common occurrence, check to see if the seams on the sweater pull or fray easily. This is also a good indicator of whether or not it will withstand active lifestyles and can tell you of the quality of the overall product.\n• If the sweater you wish to buy has trim on it, ask the retailer about their return policy. This is recommended because most times the fabric will hold up to the rigors of life in general, but the trim is most often the weakest part. If the there is a problem with the trim, the store may allow you to exchange it depending how long ago it was purchased and the store's return policy.\nFollow your sweater's care label instructions closely to prevent shrinkage and stretching. Many sweaters are hand-wash only. In these cases, it is recommended to allow them to dry naturally by laying them flat. Some sweaters are gentle-cycle washable and others may require drycleaning. In any case, avoid using alkaline-based detergents (usually hard-surface only detergents) on woolens and other animal fibers.\n• If you have any doubts about the best way to approach an item, you may bring it to us to examine and offer a suitable cleaning method.\n• Tumble dry only at low temperatures, if recommended on the care label.\n• Treat stains right away. When spills are blotted immediately and professionally removed, stains won't develop later.\n• Sweaters with pile may be brushed to lift the fabric and remove any surface soils.\n• If wool sweaters get wet, let them dry at room temperature away from any direct heat source.\n• Check knitted sweaters for unraveling and fraying, and secure any loose yarns so the sweater can withstand normal use and care procedures without further unraveling.\n• Place folded sweaters over padded hangers in a well-ventilated closet or place in drawers. Do not hang sweaters from the shoulders; the weight of the sweater can cause it to stretch. Be sure to empty pockets, remove belts, and close zippers.\n• When storing sweaters, be sure to use breathable cloth garment storage bags to prevent yellowing and the development of stains.\n• Be sure to put sweaters away only when they are clean as any stains on the item may develop into worse stains or even attract moths (leading to moths eating through the fabric and creating holes).\n• Remember that delicate items may require special handling.\nPossible Issues When Cleaning\nWhile we are well versed in cleaning many different types of fabrics and treating multitudes of stains, some items may prove more problematic than others to clean. When the sweater is not cared for as directed or the stains on the sweater go untreated for too long then the likelihood of possible irreversible damage goes up.\nStretching, shrinkage, pulls, and pilling, both from use and cleaning may occur even when following the care labels of the items. Some stretching on knit items should be expected as a normal circumstance of wear and care to a given extent. Generally, the softer the knit, the more likely it is to show some change in texture or feel with normal wear, and this may be aggravated with washing or cleaning procedures.\nIf you have any questions about caring for your sweaters simply come to us and we can give you potential solutions to your needs."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:55852df0-0c6f-4552-bbe1-393ffb22de96>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Hi! I'm learning about engines - what is EGR system and how it help environment?","answer":"The Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) system, also known as NOx Reduction System, captures engine exhaust, cools it, and routes it back into the intake manifold. It reduces NOx emissions by decreasing oxygen in the combustion chamber, which allows for more advanced fuel injection timing and lower cylinder temperatures. The system also reduces Particulate Matter, Hydrocarbons, and Carbon Monoxide in the exhaust, making it more environmentally friendly.","context":["…and your conscience will definitely be cleaner when you realise that having a forklift truck with a clean engine is good for the environment. plus, it’s better for your total cost of ownership too!\nDemand for lower vehicle emissions and higher fuel efficiency in the automotive industry has drifted over other motive industries. And, industrial lift trucks are no exception. Besides market demand also (European) regulations influenced the development of the modern industrial engines. But having a clean engine could not only help the environment but could also save you money!\nTo meet these requirements, many diesel engine manufacturers are using Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) systems, an emission after-treatment technology that converts (NOx) in the diesel engine exhaust stream into nitrogen and water vapor – two natural components and certainly more friendly for the environment.\nHow do emission systems work? And, how do they play a role in lowering emissions and improving fuel efficiency?\nThe Combustion Process\nOxides of Nitrogen (NOx) gases are created during the combustion process by high cylinder temperatures in the engine. To reduce NOx emissions before they develop, the cylinder temperature must be decreased during the combustion process.\nTo meet the emissions regulations, several new air systems and technologies have been developed, such as:\n- Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) system\n- Common rail\n1. Exhaust Gas Recirculation\nThe Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) system, which is also known as a NOx Reduction System (NRS) system, captures a portion of the engine’s exhaust, cools it, and routes it back into the intake manifold. The EGR is effective because the total percentage of oxygen available in the combustion chamber is reduced due to the recirculated exhaust gas containing very little oxygen in contrast to the boosted air. This reduced amount of oxygen in the combustion chamber allows for fuel injection timing to be more advanced, which aids in reducing cylinder temperatures. Thus leading to reduced NOx output.\nIt does not stop here. Whilst the EGR reduces the NOx levels during engine combustion after treatment reduces Particulate Matter (PM), Hydrocarbons (HC) and Carbon Monoxide CO in the exhaust.\n2. Common rail\nCommon rail is a fuel injection system found in modern diesel engines. This system provides a level of flexibility leading to class-leading emission control, power and fuel consumption. An increasing number of modern diesel engines employ common rail direct injection (CRDi) fuel systems for the flexibility they provide whilst meeting the most stringent emission control standards.\nIn a common rail system, the fuel is stored at a variable pressure in a cylinder or ‘rail’ connected to the engine’s fuel injectors via individual pipes, making it a ‘common rail’ to all the injectors. The pressure is controlled by a fuel pump but it is the fuel injectors, working in parallel with the fuel pump, that controls the timing and amount of the injected fuel. The fuel is injected under pressure with electronically controlled precision. When compared to older fuel systems, the common rail system is able to supply fuel at a higher pressure, ensuring a more efficient use of fuel. Fuel consumption drops due to a finer spray of fuel which burns more efficiently.\nAnd there’s more\nThe common rail system also provides fuel in more steps, through timing flexibility, instead of only providing it once. This improves noise levels, vibration, and harshness, making the engine quieter and run smoother.\nA further advantage of the CRDi system is that it injects the fuel directly into the combustion chamber. This means that less fuel is wasted as soot or particulates in the exhaust and deposits in the engine.\nThe Welfaux Conclusion\nModern techniques bring high torque, great power at low revolutions and trouble-free operations. But companies are also seeking to minimize their Carbon Footprint by reducing their energy consumption. By utilizing vehicles that have cleaner emissions and lower consumptions rates, they can also expect lower operating costs."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:fa7e3429-920d-41f0-8f8f-2ad9ac246a3b>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do modern industrial facilities combine sand separation technologies with workplace safety measures to protect plant operators?","answer":"Industrial facilities use multiple sand separation technologies including froth flotation, magnetic separation, and gravity separation, particularly for separating sand from minerals like hematite and iron oxides. These processes often involve chemical reagents and specialized equipment for flotation cells. Regarding workplace safety measures, facilities must implement comprehensive health and safety protocols including protection from hazardous chemicals, proper ventilation systems, and safety equipment.

{"question":"How can city planners and community leaders effectively analyze the power structures and information flow within an urban community?","answer":"To analyze power structures and information flow, several key steps should be taken: First, determine the power centers by identifying political figures, police department, business leaders, Chamber of Commerce, and religious leaders. Analyze who controls media, commerce, finance, schools, and arts, including their religious and moral commitments. Second, discover how news and opinion spread in specific community groups - whether through conversation, radio, or TV. Identify the idea-people and opinion-makers, and regularly read local weekly publications. Third, examine traffic flow patterns and locate important community sites such as service centers, libraries, police stations, fire stations, city hall, shopping centers, and sports facilities. This information helps understand where to effectively establish community initiatives.","context":["When we use the word “missional,” we are affirming that the Church by its very nature is sent into our neighbourhoods and cities as people living the implications of the Gospel. In order for the church to do this effectively, it is beneficial to know how to “exegete the neighbourhood,” in much the same way that they have learned to study a biblical text. Reading your community is the first step to demonstrating a commitment to partnering with the community and establishing relational trust. This fosters a greater openness to a discussion of deeper, spiritual needs, and to Christ who meets all needs.\nTo begin the process of reading one’s community, let me propose steps to consider. These are best undertaken by teams—usually ecumenical “task forces”—that try to understand their community context. After the “exegesis” or community assessment, it will be important to prioritize the initiatives that congregations will undertake.\nThese steps can be divided into two sections – 10 Steps to Understand Context & 10 Steps to Consider Church Planting Initiatives.\n10 Steps to Understand Context:\n- Compile a list of significant historical events that inform the community’s identity. These could be historic conflicts that took place, unifying events such as the city coming together to fight a massive fire, decisions that leaders made such as the building of a community centre, or something that happened that gave people hope, such as a person doing something heroic or selfless. These will provide clues to the best way for the church to focus its energy.\n- Study the growth patterns of the city. One can find this information in libraries, city councils, museums, bookstores, local newspapers and on local websites.\n- How and why is the city growing?\n- Who are (and were) the immigrants to the city? Where did they come from and where are they settled? Where are they employed?\n- Study the design of the city.\n- Understand clearly the sections or zones that make up the city.\n- Find out from city planners and real estate offices where city populations are expected to move, where commercial and industrial zones will develop, and which areas are slated to undergo major changes.\n- Study the neighbourhoods: their ethnic, social and economic composition, religious affiliations, occupational patterns, younger and older populations, concentrations of the elderly, young professionals, singles, and problem groups. To understand a neighbourhood, you must walk the streets and talk to people, insiders and outsiders. Census data is important, but onsite observation is best. People groups criss-cross in the community.\n- Determine and analyze the power centres in the community: the political figures, the police department, the business leaders and the Chamber of Commerce, the religious leaders. Who controls the media—TV, radio, the newspapers? Who controls commerce and finance? The schools and the arts? What are the religious and moral commitments of the people in positions of power?\n- Analyze the dreams, aspirations, hopes, and expectation of specific people groups within the community. Observe the obstacles that various groups identify to attain these aspirations. In some communities, such things as personal illness, loneliness, physical hardships, insecurity in terms of housing, property rights, and the threat of losing one’s dwelling are very real. You are looking for indications of receptivity and “keys” which may unlock doors to homes and hearts.\n- Examine the traffic flow. Just as successful advertisers know where to place their signs, practitioners need to know where to begin their ministries, where they can readily be seen and reached. Find out where these sites are located: community service centres, libraries, police stations, fire stations, city hall, shopping centres, sports facilities, and any other significant places.\n- Seek to discover how news and opinion spread in the community, and in particular groups. Mainly through conversation? By radio or TV? Who are the idea-people, the opinion-makers? Subscribe to the weekly publication in the area. Read it faithfully.\n- Examine the relationship between city-dwellers and the rural, small-town communities outside the city. Do certain segments of the urban population maintain strong ties with their rural cousins? Is there a lot of travel and visiting between city and village? What are the present immigration patterns from the countryside? How might the urban-rural interaction be used for the spread of the gospel and multiplication of churches? Most of this information is available in census data.\n- Identify and map the local ministries and churches in the community; identify them by denomination, size, and age. What transformational ministries and social services are already taking place through these ministries and churches? Reflect on what the church map shows.\nSteps to Consider for Church Planting Initiatives:\n- Analyze the various types of existing churches. Find out the growth patterns (if any) of the various churches: attendance, membership, and rate of growth. Try to determine the nature of the growth: is it by transfer, conversion, or by births? One can often locate this information by chatting with congregational leaders.\n- Inquire about church planting efforts and church closures in the past several years. Which churches have closed? Why? Who has started new churches, and why and where did they succeed? Learn all you can from them.\n- Who is currently planning to start new churches? Where, and among which people groups? Find out all you can from church and mission sources as to what is being planned for the community.\n- Strategies: what has been tried in the past, what has failed, and what was effective in starting churches and stimulating growth? Analyze the information you receive. In the light of recent church growth studies, what has been “done right” in this community, and where ought things to have been done differently?\n- Christians and non-Christians: where are the Christians located (of course, this may not be where they attend church)? Identify areas of the city where relatively few Christians live.\n- Identify Christians in positions of influence in the city: in business, politics, the media, education, entertainment, and sports. Analyze their potential for wider spread of the gospel and assistance in planting churches.\n- List and analyze the parachurch ministries (if any) operating in and to the community. How might each contribute something to the overall strategy? Are there some you may want to avoid because they might have a negative influence on church multiplication?\n- Make an inventory of all possible personnel resources that might be tapped for the carrying out of your church planting strategy. For example, are there Bible College or seminary students available to help with door-to-door calling? Could interns be borrowed from existing churches to help younger congregations?\n- Evaluate all known methods for church planting in light of what you know about this community—its history, people, existing churches, and particular characteristics. What methods have proven effective elsewhere and appear appropriate for this community—and are within the capabilities of your resources.\n- List and evaluate the community agencies (private, religious and civic) that are designed to meet particular needs (literacy, overnight shelter, emergency food and clothing, and so on) and consider how their help can be incorporated into your overall strategy.\nApplication in Montréal\nExegeting a community in Monreal brought transformation and fruitful community-wide collaborative ministry opportunities. In 2006, Christian Direction, in conjunction with Roman Catholic parishes and Protestant congregations, published a 45-page study of the east end of Montréal, using these twenty steps. This borough is the poorest continuous borough in Canada going back to the 1871 census!\nNumerous initiatives have been launched as a result of that study. For example, to address the 55% high school drop-out in the neighbourhood, in collaboration with another social service agency, we started a centre to work with adolescents, their families, and the local schools to promote school success. Together with others in the borough, we advocate with local businesses so they do not employ kids during the school day. To address the relational poverty, there are four events each year to break the deep solitude people experience. To break the cycle of intergenerational poverty, three “financial capability” projects have been started for young people and their families. In a short time, all three were generating income. At the heart of the vision are the key indicators of a transformed community. This same experience is now being repeated in 18 other boroughs on the island of Montréal and four other cities in Québec.\nThis example emphasizes the efficacy of how research can and must inform transformational strategies. In order to further the church’s mission in our communities, we have to learn first of all to read those communities.\nThis article is an excerpt from a more detailed paper by Glenn Smith: Reading your Community: Towards an Authentic Encounter With the City.\n In Québec, Christian Direction has worked with congregations in ten different cities and boroughs to implement these steps.

{"question":"What were the breakthrough innovations in visual art introduced by Comarow and Warhol in their respective eras?","answer":"Comarow pioneered 'Polage,' a revolutionary new art form using light-polarizing synthetic filters developed by Edwin Land, creating paintings that appear as blank Plexiglas but reveal complex colors and patterns when viewed through polarizing filters. Warhol, on the other hand, revolutionized art by erasing the lines between Fine and Commercial Art, introducing the Pop Art Movement that gave monumental importance to everyday objects. He developed the silkscreen process for mass-producing multiple images and transformed consumer products and celebrity images into iconic artwork.","context":["Artist breaks barriers by painting with light\nThe world of art is changing.\nAnd then there's Polage.\nAustine Wood Comarow's paintings in polarized light, a medium in which she has been working for more than four decades, go on view Saturday in a retrospective exhibit at Lakeview Museum.\nThe Las Vegas artist will be in Peoria this week to oversee the installation of her unique work.\nWood creates a palette of pure, bright colors using light with cellophane and polarizing filters. Not surprisingly, the filters also can change the angles of viewing and affect the content.\nTo see one of her drawings without the polarizing light is to see a neutral gray sketch - but that all changes with the polarizing filters, and the drawings become colorful moving pictures.\n\"Months of laborious care go into making a single major artwork, which, when finished, appears to be nothing more than a flat piece of clear, colorless Plexiglas, with some opacity added, due to an almost unnoticeable, seemingly sanded and lightly etched jigsaw patterning on the work's surface,\" James Mann, curator-at-large for the Las Vegas Art Museum, explains in a catalog that accompanies the exhibit.\n\"The piece looks like a blank slate, a true tabula rasa, and yet its surface possesses the potential to unlock and release a picture (or pictures) with more shades, patches or bursts of color than a Pointillist painting.\"\nIn her earliest work, Comarow used cracker and candy wrappers and Scotch tape. Now she uses sheets of cellophane cut to shapes.\nSome of her early works are 3 inches by 3 inches, while some of the most recent are 60 inches by 60 inches. She's even created a piece that's 60 inches by 90 inches, although it won't be on display here.\nShe also uses back lighting and reflective techniques in some of her pieces.\nWhen Comarow exhibited a few pieces at Lakeview in May 2007 as part of the \"Trompe L'Oeil: The Art of Illusion\" show, she displayed some of her clear Plexiglas works that changed color and content when viewed through special filters.\nFor that show, Maui Jim sunglasses were made available to viewers. This time, a sample painting in the Lakeview lobby and a large pair of sunglasses will allow visitors to experiment with the brilliance of colors and changing forms.\nA lover of nature, Comarow incorporates many images of the natural world in her paintings and then bathes them in light. One series depicts the Greek goddess Gaia as Mother Earth.\nComarow was born in Louisville, Ky. Her father was in the foreign service and the family traveled around a lot.\nShe did her earliest light painting 42 years ago and exhibited in the Boston Museum of Science in 1986. More recently her work has been on view at the Las Vegas Art Museum.\nMann calls Comarow's kinetic light paintings, made possible by scientist Edwin Land's development of light-polarizing, synthetic filters 70 years ago, \"a revolutionary new art.\"\n\"They are, without exaggeration and improbable as it may seem, something quite wholly new in the history of visual art,\" he writes.\nTheo Jean Kenyon can be reached at (309) 686-3190 email@example.com.","Fame, Mass Media, Consumerism and Death\nBorn Andrew Warhola in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1928, Andy Warhol was destined to change the world of art forever.\nUpon his graduation, he moved to New York where he worked as an illustrator for publications such as The New Yorker, Vogue , and Harpers Bazaar. He also created window displays for several prominent retail stores at this time. It is perhaps during these years that he developed his keen sense of style and realized the power of image and media manipulation. Throughout the 1950s, Warhol was one of New York City’s leading commercial artists, and he received numerous awards and accolades for his work.\nHe held his first solo show at The Hugo Gallery in 1952 and a group show at The Museum of Modern Art in 1956.\nIn 1961, Warhol created his first series of silkscreens with images of Campbells Soup Cans. The Pop Art Movement thrived on presenting seemingly banal, everyday objects and giving them a monumental importance, Warhol was simply making society aware of it’s own obsessions. The silkscreen process enabled silk-screen mass-produced multiple images with a seemingly endless array of color and compositional variances. Consumerism, one of Warhol’s central themes, was evident in many of the works produced at this time. Coca-Cola bottles, Brillo Boxes and Dollar Bills took on a life of their own. The silkscreen technique and the iconic treatment of Products as Art made Andy a star.\nWarhol’s next thematic breakthrough was the Death and Disaster Series. Works depicting car accidents, Electric Chairs, and racial Riots. The heavily manipulated photographs, repeated over and over again, imply through their multiplicity that society is merely a silent witness to everyday horrors and that death, is simply another aspect of life to be reckoned with. The public’s reaction to these works was not exactly all-embracingly positive and at the advice of Henry Geldzahler, Warhol’s Art Dealer, he produced a less threatening series of Flower Prints.\nIn the years between 1962 to 1964, Andy altered his concentration and celebration of iconic images to include famous personalities and focused on the allure and mystique of Fame. It was at this point that he created the now legendary Series of Marilyns, Jackies, and Elvis paintings, at his studio known as The Factory.\nBy this time, Andy Warhol had become a world famous artist. He held exhibits at The Institute of Contemporary Art in Philadelphia, The Leo Castilli Gallery, and as far away as The Moderna Museet in Stockholm. He produced works at an amazing rate and baffled many with his uncanny ability to choose images that literally became instant icons. Warhol erased the lines between Fine and Commercial Art and forced the world to consider a new perspective that it, subconsciously, had already embraced.\nFAMOUS WARHOLIAN QUOTES:\n“ When you think about it, department stores are kind of like museums.“\n“ In the Future, everyone will be famous for fifteen minutes.“\n“ I love Los Angeles. I love Hollywood. They’re beautiful. Everybody’s plastic, but I love plastic.I want to be plastic.“\n“ I want to be a machine.“\nThe Factory was Andy’s art and experimental film studio, where he and his entourage of self-proclaimed „Superstars“ produced over 300 experimental and pornographic films. The Studio was far more than simply an artist’s atelier. It was THE meeting place for artists, musicians, and actors. The atmosphere was a non-stop party where ideas, rock and roll, drugs, sex and art mingled. In 1968, Warhol was shot two to three times by a fanatical woman,Valerie Solanis, who claimed at her arrest that „He had too much control over my Life.“ The truth of the matter was that he had ignored her and her radical organization, SCUM (Society for Cutting Up Men). This near fatal attack changed Warhol and his Art. His artistic response to this episode, The Skulls and The Shadow Series reflected an interplay between printing and Painting.\nMoving away from the repitition of Iconic Figures, Andy’s work focused on singular Portraits of the Rich and affluent. The silkscreen was still utilized but with a far more expressionistic quality and singularity. Some of his subjects were Mick Jagger, Michael Jackson, Liza Minelli and the like.\nIn the early Seventies Warhol began publishing Interview magazine. he also wrote the autobiographical The Philosophy of Andy Warhol (from A to B and back again). He continued to produce numerous Portraits of celebrities and members of the European elite. The phenomenally priced portraits photographed in Europe, were often produced by Warhol’s assistants at the factory with Andy’s long distance artistic „direction“. His subjects in the late eighties, Mao-tse-Tung and The Endangered Species Series continued to confound,delight and shock art lovers with his always new and ever expanding catalog of colorful images.\nDuring the last years of his life, Warhol began a series of collaborations and promotions with a whole new generation of artists, among them, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Keith Harring, and Francisco Clemente.\nInterestingly, these were all younger contemporaries of Andy’s that were carrying on his tradition of artistic revolution. On February 22 ,1987, Warhol succumbed to heart failure, and as a consequence of a badly executed gall bladder operation. The assassination attempt of 1968 had finally taken it’s toll on the physically fragile artist. In 1989, an exhibit was organized by The Museum of Modern Art, encompassing the largest retrospective exhibit of his works to that date. in May of 1994, the Andy Warhol Museum opened in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\nAndy Warhol’s influence on 20th Century Art cannot be denied. His perception, exploration and experimentation in the field of Visual Arts is unmatched. There is hardly an Artist today that is not touched in some way by his thematic and cultural accomplishments and vision. In accordance with his will, he provided a considerable endowment Fund for Art Education and Patronage, The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, Inc.\n“ Andy Warhol looks a scream, hang him on my wall. Andy Warhol, Silver Screen, can’t tell them apart at all.“\n– David Bowie, Hunky Dory, 1971\nWebsites of Interest:\nThe Andy Warhol Museum\nThe Andy Warhol Foundation for The Visual Arts\nAndy warhol Prints\nThis Article Text © 2005 by John Keaton .

{"question":"How does the Breguet La Tradition Fusée Tourbillon combine classical watchmaking elements with modern innovations, and what makes its design distinctive among luxury timepieces?","answer":"The Breguet La Tradition Fusée Tourbillon combines classical elements with modern innovations in several ways. It features traditional elements like caseband fluting, round-ended welded lugs, blued-steel Breguet hands, and an off-centered dial with Roman numerals and Clou de Paris engine-turning pattern. The watch incorporates innovative technical features including a patented 2004 titanium balance, a spectacular tourbillon mechanism coupled with the fusée-and-chain transmission, and a unique power-reserve indicator positioned at 10 o'clock directly on the barrel drum. The watch's design is distinctive for its architectural composition with visible movement components, slim bezel and domed crystal that reveal various movement levels, and the tourbillon carriage's generous proportions. The movement includes signature features like the thin bar, upper bridge, and carriage derived from A.-L. Breguet's earliest sketches, while incorporating modern elements like a titanium tourbillon carriage and nonmagnetic stainless steel barrette.","context":["Breguet FUSEE TOURBILLON TIMEPIECE\nAN EXCEPTIONAL ACHIEVEMENT JOINS THE TRADITION COLLECTION\n|Rating: 70 %1000 with 152 votes|\nAdmired by the public and professionals alike as a truly novel collection heralding a fresh horological era, the Tradition line welcomes its first major complication this year. The design’s essential attributes correspond perfectly to the collection’s bold, visionary approach. Breguet timepiece 7047 features a spectacular tourbillon mechanism coupled to a fusee-and-chain transmission.\nIt incorporates the Breguet 569 handwound caliber, whose technical qualities speak for themselves.\nThe movement’s many unique features include its power -reserve indicator for which a patent application has been filed. Positioned at 10 o’clock, it is located directly on the barrel drum (the movement’s power source) and features a system of reducer differentials allowing the indication to appear directly on the drum. The latter’s large dimensions furthermore enabled watchmakers to fit it with two barrels, increasing the amount of energy stores and provides.\nThe fusee-and-chain transmission is designed to optimize watch-rate regularity by ensuring a constant torque whatever the actual degree of winding tension (a mechanical watch mainspring’s torque usually varies with the degree of winding). Conical in shape, the fusee features differential gears that convey a continuous flow of energy to the movement.\nWhen the watch and barrel are fully wound, thus providing peak traction, the chain connecting the barrel to the fusee winds around the latter’s smallest circumference whereas when the barrel is only partly wound and thus cannot develop its full torque, the chain winds around the broadest part of the fusee, offsetting in this way the barrel’s loss of power. The winding system further benefits from a crown wheel with frontal toothing that considerably improves its responsiveness. Unquestionably a harbinger of things to come, the Tradition 7047 timepiece nonetheless embodies a full measure of Breguet’s product identity.\nInspired by the first tourbillon-equipped pocket watches of the early 19th century, it includes such signature features as caseband fluting, round-ended welded lugs and blued-steel Breguet hands. Its yellow gold case holds centuries of accumulated horological know-how. Slim bezel and domed crystal together clearly reveal the movement’s various levels and provide a good view of the tourbillon carriage’s generous proportions. Its thin bar (or barrette), upper bridge and carriage all derive from A.-L. Breguet’s earliest sketches.\nFitted with a Breguet balance made of titanium, patented in 2004, and an upper bridge also fashioned in titanium, the tourbillon carriage’s impressive size is offset by its spare design. For its part, the Breguet-shaped barrette is made of nonmagnetic stainless steel.\nOff-centred at 7 o’clock, the dial reflects understated design in the established Tradition style, underlined by the movement’s impeccably shot -blasted surface finishing.\nEngine-turning in the Clou de Paris cobbled pattern, classic Roman numerals and Breguet hands all evoke the very origins of the brand. Secured by three blued screws, the dial plate salutes the celebrated subscription watches devised centuries ago by Breguet himself.\nSuch accomplished design enhances each and every component. The ir visibility, contrasting character and three -dimensional structure come together in a unique architectural composition, emblematic of a groundbreaking collection incorporating impeccable horological artistry.\nBreguet 7047 FUSEE TOURBILLON TIMEPIECE specifications\nLA TRADITION BREGUET\nFUSEE TOURBILLON TIMEPIECE\nDESCRIPTION OF THE WATCH\nCase round in 18K yellow gold with finely fluted caseband.\nDiameter: 41 mm.\nRounded horns welded to the case, with screw pins securing the strap.\nWater-resistant to 30 metres (~ 100 feet).\nDial in silvered 18K gold, off -centred to the 7 o’clock position and hand -engraved on a rose engine.\nIndividually numbered and signed Breguet.\nChapter ring with Roman numerals.\n60-second tourbillon positioned at 1 o’clock.\nBlued steel, open-tipped Breguet hands.\nMovement handwound mechanical, with tourbillon regulator.\nNumbered and signed Breguet.

There are many ways in which watchmakers have tried to achieve this goal, some of them were rather ingenious and interesting. The fusée and chain system, intriguingly, is one of them.\nThe idea of the fusée and chain system is simple: provide a constant even force to the escapement as the mainspring unwinds itself throughout its range of power reserve. The constant force will ensure that the escapement performs at the same level regardless of the state of wind of the mainspring.\nSo, how does the fusée and chain system work?\nFirst, one would wind the wind the watch up. The fusée is conically shaped, and its sides are cut for a chain to wrap around it. As one winds the timepiece, the chain will wrap around the fusée from the bottom to the top. The photograph above, of the Zenith Academy George Favre-Jacot shows the fusée with a fully wound chain.\nThe shape of the fusée allows it to act like gearing as it unwinds: increasing the torque delivered to the train as the power from the spring wanes. As the mainspring torque wanes when the mainspring discharges, the chain traverses the fusée from its apex to the larger base. The shape of the fusée is calculated to precisely offset the torque changes. This allows the mainspring torque to be equalized as it is delivered to the movement train.\nBreguet La Tradition Fusée Tourbillon\nFirst up, we have the Breguet La Tradition Fusée Tourbillon.\nWe have always been a great fan of the La Tradition collection by Breguet, as it is one collection that allows collectors to have a nice equilibrium between the modern and the classic. On one hand, it provides collectors with classic complications that have withstood the test of time. On the other hand, the collection’s pieces introduces new innovations, such as the independent chronograph system that is found on the Breguet La Tradition Chronographe Indépendant 7077.\nNow, let us get back to the La Tradition Fusée Tourbillon. The watch, which was launched in 2012, is certainly a stunner. It features several interesting elements, such as the tourbillon, the fusée and chain system, as well as the straight-line lever escapement. While many watchmakers usually utilize just one of the three features that we have stated, but Breguet chose to incorporate all of them into the La Traditon Fusée Tourbillon.\nThe watch is nicely desgned. It features the usual Breguet DNA, such as the coin-edge case, the off-center guilloché dial, as well as the iconic blued Breguet hands. The finishing, as with most Breguet watches, is very good. We are also particularly fond of the open-worked dial as well, giving one a glimpse into the movement to admire the various components (in this case, the tourbillon and the fusée and chain system) of the watch, as well as the finishing that goes into the movement.\nLeroy Chronomètre à Tourbillon\nEven within the ranks of independent watchmaking, we see a clear distinction between the older, more established independents, and the young upstarts. Leroy is one of the new ones. Basel World 2015 is only the second year of its appearance, and it presented its first new collection. We found many beautiful pieces in the collection, and the Chronomètre à Tourbillon is one of them.\nThe Leroy Chronomètre à Tourbillon is undoubtedly a beautiful timepiece. A captivating grand feu dial stands proud as one gazes on the watch. It is accompanied with an enchanting and intricate filigree grid featuring a “Marie-Antoinette” tapestry motif in the middle of the watch providing a frame. The latter adds an interesting artistic touch to this sublime timepiece, without making it too ostentatious or gaudy.\nFlip the watch over and open the hunter case back, and the excitement continues. Beneath the guilloché hinged back cover hides a sapphire crystal, in in turn exposes the movement in full glory. Therein lies many striking features, such as the direct impulse escapement, a fusée & chain system, as well the diamond impulse pallets. For more on these technical bits, we refer you to this detailed review on this timepiece.\nThe Leroy Chronomètre à Tourbillon is a fine and discreet timepiece. We also love the fact that it is extremely well-finished, be it in terms of the movement or the exterior portions of the timepiece. The attention to detail here is amazing. A highly recommended timepiece, especially if one decides to look towards independent watchmaking.\nRomain Gauthier Logical One\nAt the beginning of this article, we have talked about how watchmakers in the past have derived that the conical (or rather, the hyperboloid) shape of the fusée was the most optimal in maintaining a constant torque supply from the mainspring to the gears. However, Romain Gauthier had decided to take a step further to improve the Fusée and Chain system. That, my friends, is how we have the Logical One.\nOne of the greatest differences between the conventional fusée and chain system, and that of Romain Gauthier’s, is the fact that the fusée in the latter is not in the conventional hyperboloid shape where the chain winds up from the base, but a single layer. Romain Gauthier thought that by having a single layer, the chain line is improved, and lateral tension on the chain is eliminated. The traditional hyperboloid-shaped fusée is flattened to a snail cam. You can read the technical discussion of the problem and Gauthier’s solution here.\nThe watch, in terms of its aesthetics and finishing, is excellent as well. We love how the watchmaker had paid tremendous attention to minute details. One interesting bit, we reckon, is the winding of the watch. Instead of utilizing the crown, the user would be required to push a button that is located at the 9 o’clock position of the case. We were told that approximately 40 pushes is sufficient to fully wind the mainspring.\nA. Lange & Söhne Richard Lange Pour le Mérite\nNext up, we have something that is much more discreet and elegant: the A. Lange & Söhne Richard Lange Pour le Mérite. Lange first pioneered the use of the fusée and chain in a wristwatch with the Tourbillon Pour le Mérite released in 1994. This was the first wrist watch to carry this complication, which till then was the reserve of marine chronometers and some pocket watches. This was due to the size and stack height required to house the system. And was solved by the Lange team during its formative years from 1990 to 1994. All Lange watches with the fusée and chain are part of the special collection line which is called the Pour le Mérite collection. The editor has written a book on this subject. See here for more details.\nAt the first glance, the Richard Lange Pour le Mérite may just look like any other excellent dress watch. It is restrained, simple, and very well-made. However, look beneath the beautiful white enamel dial and you will see that this watch offers so much more than what it appears to be on the surface.\nThe Richard Lange collection is a homage to the founder’s son and pays heavy emphasis on the precision and accuracy of time measurement. While this watch is designed to be a three-hand dress piece, but no expense is spared in the creation of its movement. The movement, case, dial, hands are beautifully designed and magnificently executed, as one might expect from Lange. This remains the only watch in the Lange collection with a fusée and chain without a tourbillon.\nZenith Academy Georges Favre-Jacot\nWe next present the Zenith Academy Georges Favre-Jacot, and we personally feel that it is probably one of the best watches that showcase the technical prowess of the Le Locle based watchmaker.\nThe Zenith Academy Georges Favre-Jacot was created in 2014 to celebrate the 150th Anniversary of its founding. Upon the first glance, we can sense that this watch is going to be pretty extraordinary: the conspicuous fusée and chain system that was exposed by the cut-out in the dial.\nOther than the powerful visual impact, the practical utility of the fusée and chain mechanism on this movement is interesting. The watch is powered by the El Primero 4810 movement, which has a high frequency balance. The high oscillation frequency requires more power, and a larger and more powerful mainspring is needed. A powerful mainspring causes other problems. The torque difference from the mainspring in a fully wound state versus when fully unwound state is very large, leading to isochronic inaccuracies. The fusée and chain system offers a near perfect solution to this problem.. This allows the high beat movement to maintain its accuracy throughout the entire duration of its power reserve.\nAside from that, we also thought that the watch is actually quite aesthetically pleasing. We are particularly fond of the gilt-finished movement, as well as the magnificent silver-toned textured dial. The finishing is also done exceptionally well too, especially if one pays great attention to the chain links in the Fusée and Chain mechanism.\nThe 45mm watch may or may not be everyone’s cup of tea, but we believe that this is certainly one of the best offerings from Zenith. It is also a testament to what Zenith is capable of achieving, aside from the more mainstream pieces in both the Elite and the El Primero collection.\nCabestan Terra Luna\nFinally, we have the Cabestan Terra Luna.\nCabestan, as some might know, is one of the up-and-coming watchmakers in the world of independent watchmaking. The concept behind Cabestan, as we reported here, was originally conceived by Vianney Halter and Jean François Ruchonet with the Winch Tourbillon. The collection was extended with the Terra Luna in 2014.\nThe watch is interesting that it is a combination of having both the vertical tourbillon, as well as the fusée and chain system in a single timepiece. Three watches in their collection now feature this double complication. The fourth timepiece features an even more complicated triple axis tourbillon.\nThe Cabestan Terra Luna, in our humble opinion, is one of our favorite watches from this independent watchmaker. We love the complication and the mechanism behind the watch. And we are also attracted to the design, where we get a feeling of a combination of avantgarde and industrial rolled into one. The open-worked dial allows full view of the components of the timepiece. And the 3D Moonphase adds a bewitching touch to the watch as well. An even more special rendition of the Terra Luna is a one off piece done for a Deployant Friend where the moon is substituted by the phase of the planet Saturn, turning in correct spin rate. Click here for our exclusive review of this very special timepiece, and the story behind its creation.\nThe Cabestan Terra Luna is one of the more interesting watches that we have seen in recent times making it one of the more conversational timepieces that we have featured.\nAs one might have noticed, the fusée and chain system is usually fitted to the more high-end and exclusive timepieces. This is not a surprise, considering the amount of work that is required to produce the chain alone. A lot of work goes into the finishing and assembly, and therefore its high price.\nSo, what are your thoughts on the fusée and chain mechanism? Does it justify the high prices??

{"question":"What difference between how US and Venezuela Constitution handle changes and reforms over time?","answer":"The US Constitution is characterized as being 'too hard to change,' requiring significant consensus for amendments, while maintaining core principles like federalism and judicial independence even as some elements evolve over time. In contrast, Venezuela has used constitutional reform more aggressively, particularly since 1999, to fundamentally transform its system. Under both Chávez and Maduro, Venezuela has implemented constitutional changes through mechanisms like referendums and constituent assemblies to dismantle democratic checks and balances, centralize presidential power, and replace representative democracy with what they call 'people's power,' leading to what experts describe as the decimation of the rule of law.","context":["The following is a post by Dr. Jeremiah John, associate professor of politics and interim associate provost, to commemorate the United States Constitution on Constitution Day.\nOne of my favorite aphorists — Heraclitus — said, “The people should fight for their law, as they do for their city wall.” I agree, but I would add that fighting for our law is a more complicated matter — and not an easier one — than fighting for our city wall. This is even truer for Americans, and their most basic, oldest “wall” of all: the U.S. Constitution.\nAmericans love the Constitution. That’s how it seems, anyway, listening to politicians, opinion columnists and activists of various persuasions. The cry of “Defend the Constitution!”— from the left and from the right — is often heard, while the cry of “Reform the Constitution!”or “A new Constitution!” is more rarely heard. A 2007 Rasmussen Report poll reported that 63 percent of Americans rate the U.S. Constitution “great” or “good,” even while dissatisfaction with “the political system in Washington” has more recently risen to over 80 percent.\nBut if the Constitution is loved, it does not seem to be well-known. Whenever some call us to rally around it, others are quick to observe that Americans aren’t very familiar with it. Civic literacy surveys regularly report on the dismal state of knowledge of the Constitution. For example, the Annenberg Public Policy Center conducted a poll in 2013 which showed that only 36 percent of Americans could name all three branches of government, and over half get it confused with the Declaration of Independence. If we admire the Constitution, perhaps we do so from a distance. To capture the style of our dedication, the satirical newspaper The Onion told of an “area man” who is a “passionate defender of what he imagines the Constitution to be.”\nBut what does it really mean to love and defend the Constitution? Does it mean that someone agrees with and endorses all its provisions? For example, was the Constitution worthy of love in 1787 when it included protections for slavery? Was it worthy of love after the Civil War Amendments — which guaranteed, among other things, “equal protection of the laws”— but before the 19th, which prohibited discrimination in voting rights based on sex? Are there some essential elements we can support with enthusiasm, discounting, for example, its number of strange rules for picking the president?\nDo we love the Constitution less, the more we are willing to change it? My home state of Virginia has had, by my count, 6 different constitutions. The 1902 Constitution, which lasted longer than any other in Virginia history, was written in order to disenfranchise African-Americans and to entrench racial segregation in the state. That constitution was superseded by the current one, which was itself drafted before I was born, in 1971. But the Virginia Constitution of 1902, I will easily admit, I do not love.\nAs for the U.S. Constitution, it has many things I find to be wise: its distinct kind of federalism, its design of Congress as a true legislating body — not merely a parliament — and its provisions for judicial independence. Other parts seem wise to me but have been abolished, or diverted from their original purpose over time, such as the appointment of Senators by state legislatures, or the war power of Congress. And in other places, by omission or error, I think the U.S. Constitution is wrong. While many state constitutions are too easy to change, the federal Constitution is too hard to change. And I’d say the Mexican Constitution, in its single six-year term for presidents, or the German Constitution, in its special protections for marriage and family — to give two examples — get it right where our Constitution gets it wrong.\nBut I don’t love those other constitutions in the way I love the United States Constitution. I don’t pledge “true faith and allegiance” to them, because, after all, I am an American citizen. This “true faith” does not spring from a well-considered judgment about what system is best, comparing what we have with all the others that are available. Good thing, too, as almost no citizen knows their own constitution, let alone all the others, well enough to make this kind of judgment. Rather, the Constitution deserves the allegiance of Americans first because it is the only possible focus on our patriotism. Only through it did the United States as a political community come into being. Without it, it may yet cease to exist. The Constitution is, for Americans, our “koinon,” as the ancient Greeks put it: our common thing, the thing all citizens share in. If we also love the land and people of the United States along with its traditions and culture, its institutions and achievements, we must, by extension, love the Constitution of the United States. But love is compatible with correction, even major reform. Allegiance is compatible with criticism if it is measured. Like sailors who are repairing the boat they are currently floating in, we will have to adopt the care of people who appreciate what is keeping their heads above water.\nSo in one way, I like the attitude of the man who is a “passionate defender of what he imagines the Constitution to be.” He knows on a deep level that he has something valuable, even if he wouldn’t know what to do with it, and is unaware of its limitations. Perhaps he could be spurred by his passion to learn more. Perhaps he has ideas for his Constitution, and perhaps those ideas could themselves be perfected into a proposal for improvement. But as with the man fighting for his city wall, ignorant enthusiasm in defense of the Constitution is not likely to succeed. As Lincoln put it in a speech early in his career, defense of the Constitution must be, in the first place a “political religion,” a “state of feeling” taught to the “lisping babe” on the mother’s lap. But it must also make use of “cold, calculating, unimpassioned reason,” the kind that dispels partisan illusions, like the one that tells us that the Constitution guarantees all our favorite policies, or prohibits all the ones we dislike. In short, our allegiance to the Constitution should, I believe, be both warm and wise. It should be affectionate enough to feel that the Constitution is essential to American political identity, but smart enough to see it clearly for what it is, from its flaws to its profound genius and enduring worth.\n(Post by Dr. Jeremiah John, Associate Professor of Politics and Interim Associate Provost)","—José Ignacio Hernández G., Universidad Católica Andrés Bello, Universidad Central (Venezuela); Center for International Development, Harvard University\nDemocracy is in crisis. With this sentence Michael J. Abramowitz introduced the 2018 Freedom House report. In a similar vein, Mark A. Graber, Sanford Levinson and Mark Tushnet recently concluded that constitutional democracy appears in trouble throughout the world. Indeed, evidence demonstrates a slight democratic decline:\nLiberal democracy index 1900-2017\nSource: Varieties of Democracy V-Dem\nWithin the context of threats against constitutional democracy, this post introduces the concept of “constitutional authoritarian populism” through the Venezuelan experience.\nThe concept of constitutional authoritarian populism derives from the definition of authoritarian populism. Following Norris and Inglehart, authoritarian populism can be defined as a political discourse that aims to protect “the people” against the establishment through measures that favor obedience over liberty based on security and conformity.\nPopulism is a politically contested concept. However, it can be defined as a neutral political discourse that recognizes the legitimacy of the people against the establishment or elite. It is a neutral discourse because it can be used to support a myriad of policies, including libertarian or authoritarian ones, as demonstrated with the traditional populism of Latin America that reinforced the democratic pluralism\nHowever, risks arise when populism is used to impose authoritarian measures. Charismatic leaders can use an anti-establishment discourse rooted in authoritarian values assumed by the voters to impose authoritative measures that exalt obedience and therefore, eviscerate the rule of law.\nAs was pointed out by Linz, political regimes are not abstract categories but mixed forms of government. Hence, the authoritarian populist regimes are a mixed form of authoritarian regimes which core element is the protection of “the people” against several “threats” created by the leader and represented in the establishment or elite. They are, therefore, non-democratic and non-pluralist regimes.\nConstitutional authoritarianism and constitutional populism\nThe concept of “authoritarian constitutionalism” describes a particularity of elected authoritarianism. In that sense, authoritarian regimes can tolerate a limited space of freedom with restricted elections. However, those regimes are only subject to a veneer of constitutionality that does not result in real constraints on the government.\nAlso, populism can influence constitutionalism. The constitution can be seen as an instrument to protect the people against the elites. Latin American constitutionalism has a special connection with populism, through social rights that can be seen as instruments to defend vulnerable people against the elitist barriers that might hinder equalitarian development.\nBut constitutional authoritarianism and constitutional populism should be differentiated according to their impact on constitutional democracy. Constitutional authoritarianism erodes constitutional democracy because it diminishes the scope of the rule of law and also hindered the electoral integrity conditions. On the contrary, constitutional populism might not erode constitutional democracy; far from it, it could reinforce it through inclusive policies that strengthen democracy, assuming that populism is a neutral political discourse, as was previously explained. \nConstitutional authoritarian populism from the Venezuelan experience\nConstitutional authoritarian populism is the result of the convergence between authoritarian populism, constitutional authoritarianism and constitutional populism. In that sense, it can be defined as the constitutional institutions that support authoritarian policies adopted to protect the people against the establishment, specifically, against the so-called elites of representative democracy.\nThe concept that I propose is inspired by the so-called “new Latin American paradigm”. However, it is not a “Latin American paradigm”, but a set of principles adopted during the constituent processes in Venezuela, Ecuador and Bolivia in what has been considered as a resurgence of populism in Latin America. Despite its regional origin, the concept can be applied to other realities in order to describe how authoritarian populism can be implemented through the appearance of a constitutional framework.\nIn that sense, the concept has three elements.\nFirst, authoritarian populist values are recognized in the constitution and in the constitution’s interpretation adopted by the government and especially by constitutional courts commonly engaged in “constitutional hardball.” As a result, the constitution is not a political pact that protects citizens’ freedom towards the Government, but instead a political pact aiming to protect the people against the establishment or elites. An example is the use of exceptional powers by the Government to justify the protection of the people.\nSecond, this popular protection is reflected in a participatory democracy that prefers direct consultations with the people like referendums, over the mechanisms of the representative democracy. While the “us” is defined as the people’s direct power, the “them” is defined as the institutions of representative government. It is necessary to clarify that participatory democracy by itself does not contradict constitutional democracy; on the contrary, it can reinforce the accountability principle. However, authoritarian populism uses a distorted vision of participatory democracy, in which the supremacy is shifted from the constitution to the people’s direct power. An example is the use of referendums or public consultations to justify authoritarian measures to “protect” the people.\nThis idea of a direct democracy could be implemented together with the centralization of the Government’s political party. But even in this case, authoritarian leaders tend to promote direct consults with the people, as happened with the 2016 and 2017 Hungary and Turkey referendums.\nFinally, the supremacy of the people’s will is used as a means of protection against several “threats” that justify centralizing moves and strong powers by the government, typically the president. Just as populism requires a strong leader, constitutional authoritarian populism requires institutions that reinforce the president’s power. This is why authoritarian populist leaders tend to justify exceptional and authoritarian measures in order to protect the people against “threats” related to immigration, social inequality or globalization, among others, particularly invoking crisis or emergencies.\nAll these elements are present in Venezuelan constitutional law. Since Hugo Chávez’s election in 1999, constitutional law was modified through the idea of the supremacy of popular will. This was the justification of the 1999 constituent process that produced a constitution that tends to protect “the people” against the elites and that reinforce the presidency´s powers. With the support of the Supreme Tribunal, Chávez promoted a “participatory democracy” that erodes the checks and balances system and helped to build a “communal state”, this is, a political organization based on the “people’s power” in place of representative democracy. Chávez invoked extraordinary powers to face several threats against the people, caused by political and economic elites. Later, Venezuela’s current president, Nicolás Maduro, amidst an unprecedented economic, social and humanitarian crisis, used this framework to call a new constituent assembly that has advanced the dismantling of Venezuelan constitutional democracy.\nThe consequences of constitutional authoritarian-populism have been pointed out by Brewer-Carías in the Venezuelan case: the decimation of the rule of law, the concentration of powers in the presidency and, finally, the implementation of a tyranny that prevents democratic changes.\nIn conclusion, while constitutional democracy is based on the protection of citizens’ freedom against the government, constitutional authoritarian populism is based on the protection of the people against the elites. As a result, the leader uses the constitution to legitimize a “direct government” of the people through public consultations and other institutions that intended to protect the people. Constitutional principles such as checks and balances are seen as mere obstacles that obstruct the political action of the Government in response to “threats” against the people.\nTherefore, the proper theoretical framework to analyze the Venezuelan case is not constitutional authoritarianism, because it leaves aside the relevance of populism. On the contrary, the rise of authoritarian populism –not only in Latin America, but also in the United States and Europe – justifies the study of its influence over constitutional law, as demonstrated by the Venezuelan case.\nSuggested citation: José Ignacio Hernández G., Towards a Concept of Constitutional Authoritarianism: The Venezuelan Experience, Int’l J.

{"question":"¿Cuáles son los different types of text alignment in modern typography and how do they affect readability?","answer":"There are four main types of text alignment: left aligned (also called flush left or ragged right), right aligned (flush right/ragged left), center-aligned (equidistant from a center point), and justified text (where all lines are the same length with both sides aligned). In the West, most documents use left alignment as it offers optimal readability with automatic word-spacing and letter-spacing. Justified text, while common in newspapers and novels, requires careful typesetting to avoid readability problems like tight word packing or distracting 'rivers' of white space.","context":["This post is an introduction to alignment typesetting and an encouragement to look at the details of alignment choices out in the world. Regarding text alignment, there is left aligned, centered, right aligned, and justified text.\nIn left-aligned text, the words are in rows one right below the other on the left side of the page, and the right side of the text is uneven. This uneveness of non-aligned text is called a “rag.”\nIn right-aligned text, the words line up on the right side of the page, and the left side is uneven.\n♦ left aligned = flush left = ragged right = rag right\n♦ right aligned = flush right = ragged left = rag left\nIn center-aligned text, text is equidistant from a center point.\nIn justified text, all the lines of type are the same length, so text on both the left side and right side are aligned.\nIn the West, most documents we write (type) today are left aligned, and we let our software take care of the rag. Word-spacing and letter-spacing are done automatically for optimal readability, no matter our software—Adobe InDesign, Quark, MS Word, or other writing software application.\nYou can chose basic alignment settings in word processing applications, and there are more alignment options in layout applications such as InDesign.\nText Alignment and White Space\nAlthough most of your work will be with left-aligned text, there are times when a right-aligned block of text can serve you well. For example, when an image is placed on the right side of a page, right-aligned type anchors text and image. In the first example below, there is a gap between the text and the image, leading to “trapped white space.” In the second example, the text is right-aligned, freeing up the white space and connecting type to image.\nThere are also times when right-aligned text balances an image on the left or adds a dynamic alternative to the predictability of left-aligned text. This is often seen in business card designs.\nLove the look of justified text? Just Hit the Justify Button?\nJustified text is what we are used to seeing in our newspapers, novels, and text books. However, these printed materials have been typeset by printers or designers, and there is skill involved. Yes, a quickie justify—just hit the justify button—is possible, even in MS Word, and sometimes this will look just fine. However, automatic justification can result in some problems for your readers. See the three versions of justified text below of the quote from Designing with Type by James Craig and William Bevington, page 99.\nProblem #1: You could end up with words and letters too tightly packed together resulting in text that is hard to read.\nProblem #2: You could end up with distracting variations in word-spacing or letter-spacing or “rivers” of white space making distracting columns running through the text, which can make for ugly and difficult-to-read pages.\nRivers are more likely to happen when you do not allow text to be hyphenated, when the line length produces a narrow column, and when word-spacing (tracking) and letter-spacing (kerning) are not adjusted. For more examples, google “rivers in justified text.”\nFor those working with Adobe InDesign who want to know how to create well-justified text in long documents, see Designing a Book by Nigel French on Lynda.com. The entire video book course (4–5 hours) is well worth the time spent.\nThe three most relevant movies to this post are (1) Chapter 3: Creating and Applying Paragraph Styles, (2) Chapter 4: Styling the Text, and (3) Chapter 6: Finessing the Text.\nProper justified type takes time to master, but it is worth the effort to learn more about word-spacing, letter-spacing, orphans, widows, and other type elements if you want to craft beautiful readable typography.\nBefore I spent time learning from Nigel French how to set justification parameters within Adobe InDesign, I never used justified text for long documents. I had seen too many bad examples of sloppy justified text. I would, however, justify short paragraphs of text, but this could be time-consuming. In what was an agonizingly slow process, I have manually changed word-spacing, font size, and letter-spacing, and sometimes word choice for each line of text to get typography that worked. All to prevent the rivers or distracting white space between words.\nIn the HPV poster below (created in Adobe Illustrator), the justified text was done manually by changing the length of the lines, color, font size, word choice, letter-spacing (kerning), and word-spacing (tracking) to eliminate rivers and wide gaps between words.\n- Craig, James and William Bevington.

Recharge, which refers to water replenishing an aquifer, can also dramatically influence water quality—this is especially true in the Edwards Aquifer.\nIf we assume wells are constructed properly and have not deteriorated, there is a lot of natural variability in water quality from wells drilled into the Edwards Aquifer. The Edwards Aquifer has a very high recharge rate compared to other aquifers in Texas due to the presence of caves and sinkholes (known as karst). This has both good aspects, and potentially negative ones.\nThe positive aspect of rapid recharge into the karstic Edwards Aquifer is that the aquifer can be replenished rapidly, and also can store a lot of water. However, the negative aspect of rapid recharge is the lack of natural filtration, and removal of contaminants, through porous materials such as thick soil and sands, before entering the aquifer. So the positive is that water can quickly replenish the water supply, but the negative is that the quality of that water can be directly influenced by contaminants in storm water (Figure 6).\nStorm water carries a variety of contaminants from the surface. The most common contaminants include sediment, bacteria, nutrients, and other trace metals. Sampling well water for bacteria and nitrates, especially after rain events, can indicate if there is a rapid groundwater and surface water connection. Bacteria and nitrates are good indicators for a direct connection with surface water flows and can alert a well owner that additional testing and treatment (such as reverse osmosis or chlorination) is warranted.\nThe District facilitates an annual Water Well Check-up in the Spring to screen samples from private water wells for common contaminants, including fecal coliform bacteria and nitrates. Additionally, there are a number of local laboratories that offer residential well water analyses. If the well is determined to have a surface water connection, additional water treatment may be appropriate to make the water safe to drink. A comprehensive water sample analysis could help identify the level of treatment.\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s rules that protect public drinking water systems do not apply to individual water systems, such as privately owned wells. As an individual water system owner, it is up to the well owner to make sure that the water is safe to drink. Wells should be checked and tested annually for mechanical problems, cleanliness, and the presence of certain contaminants, such as coliform bacteria and nitrates. Contaminants such as these can jeopardize the health of its users, especially vulnerable populations like children, the elderly, or those with compromised immune systems. Well water should be tested more than once a year if there are recurrent incidents of gastrointestinal illness among household members or visitors and/or a change in taste, odor, or appearance of the well water. With increasing development, the quality of groundwater in our area is at greater and greater risk of contamination from a variety of sources.\nFor more resources for well owners including the District Well Owner Guide, information on the 2014 Water Well Check-up, and details about local laboratories accepting residential water well samples visit:"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:8efa2715-3bda-47a1-a1e3-de87f3899d27>","<urn:uuid:6edcfc88-1102-4988-9ab1-0c29fd1cee0e>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How did the development of astronomy guides correspond to improvements in telescope technology?","answer":"Astronomy guides evolved in response to telescope technology advances. Early guides like Webb's 1858 'Celestial Objects for Common Telescopes' remained relevant for decades because telescope technology stayed relatively static. When 6-inch telescopes became common in the 1950s, existing guides needed updating, but it wasn't until the 1970s with Burnham's Celestial Handbook that guides caught up to the capabilities of 6-inch Newtonian reflectors and 8-inch Schmidt-Cassegrain telescopes. Another gap emerged in the 1980s with the advent of Dobsonian telescopes, as observing literature again failed to keep pace with the improved optics.","context":["The Night Sky Observer's Guide\nThis item is out of stock but you can place an order now and we’ll ship when it becomes available.\nby George Robert Kepple and Glen Sanner (vol. 1 and 2)\nby George Robert Kepple, Ian Cooper and Jenni Kay (vol. 3)\nAmateur astronomers today are exceptionally fortunate to be living in an era when high quality, and very large, optics are so affordable. In the first half of the 20th century the telescope deluxe for the amateur was the 6-inch refractor. However, such telescopes were so expensive that very few amateurs could afford them: the majority of stargazers had to content themselves with instruments in the 60mm range. Consequently, most observing guides published during that time emphasized double and multiple stars, with honorable mention for variable stars and planetary nebulae, objects which do well in long focal length refractors. Webb’s 1858 Celestial Objects for Common Telescopes and Olcott’s 1936 Field Book of the Skies were not superseded for so many decades simply because the average amateur instrument did not dramatically improve during the century after Webb. By the 1950s the mass-produced or homemade 6-inch parabolic mirror brought medium-sized optics into the price range of the average amateur, and with it the emission nebulae, open clusters, and galaxies that had been seen only as amorphous blobs-if seen at all-in small refractors. The 1948 Skalnate Pleso Atlas of the Heavens had already displaced the classic Norton’s Star Atlas as the frontline sky-chart for amateurs, but the observing guides badly needed rewriting. However, not until the 1970s and Burnham’s Celestial Handbook was there an observing guide worthy of the 6-inch Newtonian reflector or of the more expensive, but increasingly popular, 8-inch Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope.\nBy the early 80s another revolution in amateur optics was underway thanks to the inexpensive and easily-constructed mounting for large aperture Newtonian reflectors invented by John Dobson. With these big “light buckets” one can see scores of emission nebulae, hundreds of star clusters, and thousands of galaxies, with details visible in virtually all of them.\nBut once again observing literature failed to keep pace with the optics. The purpose of The Night Sky Observer’s Guide was to close this re-widened gap by providing the owner of a medium or large aperture telescope with some idea of what to look for in such instruments—both what objects can be seen, and what details may be seen within these objects. It all began in 1987 when George Kepple and Glen Sanner, founded the Observers Guide, a bi-monthly magazine that set out to describe, with their readers as active participants, what could be seen with telescopes 8-inches and larger from mid-northern latitudes. Unlike an ordinary magazine it would have a finite life because each issue was devoted to one-or occasionally several smaller constellations. When completed in the early 1990s 64 constellations had been covered. Based upon that experience the authors began working on what would become The Night Sky Observer’s Guide\n, a two volume work that was published in 1998 to critical acclaim. However, The Night Sky Observer’s Guide was not yet an all-sky guide—the southern skies, much of which is visible from southern Florida, Texas, New Mexico and Arizona and down to the South Celestial Pole remained to be covered. The problem had always been the general lack of a large number of reliable observing reports from these locations but several things were happening to correct this problem—the migration of observer/retirees to these locations and the rise of the World Wide Web.\nIn 2003, in search of warmer weather and the pursuit of his lifelong love of astronomy, George Kepple moved from Pennsylvania to the clear skies of southwest. George’s new observing site provided a southern horizon with a view down to declination minus 58 degrees, just 32 degrees short of the South Celestial Pole. With retirement George also had the time to “surf” the WEB looking for methodical observer’s “down under”. He was soon rewarded when he struck up an acquaintance with Ian Cooper of New Zealand. Encouraged by his new observing site and what he found via the web he again approached Willmann-Bell to inquire if there was interest in a “southern” volume. The answer was a resounding yes.\nWith George assuming the responsibilities of Editor and Ian Cooper providing observational data as co-author, work began. As things progressed other observers were recruited, one of which was Jenni Kay of South Australia who was especially productive and so was asked and accepted a co-authorship. The result of their labors is The Night Sky Observer’s Guide, Volume 3 — The Southern Skies.\nWhile all three volumes of The Night Sky Observer’s Guide are aimed at amateurs especially interested in observing galaxies, nebulae and clusters — double and variable stars have not been neglected. Data tables for these are provided and these stars are labeled on maps and finder charts. Moreover, the most famous or visually impressive of these are given written descriptions similar to those for other deep-sky objects. Splitting doubles is nearly as popular with amateurs today as it was thirty or forty years ago. They offer the observer many fine, and even spectacular, sights in the eyepiece and often can provide an evening of enjoyable viewing when conditions are poor for “faint fuzzies”.

{"question":"As a healthcare professional, I need to know: what are the risk factors that make someone more susceptible to cellulitis, and what are the different types of cellulitis based on body location?","answer":"Risk factors include any cuts, scrapes, burns or open wounds, surgical wounds, catheter sites, skin conditions like eczema and athlete's foot, insect/animal bites, weakened immune system, long-term hospital stays, medications that depress immunity, diabetes, swollen limbs, and IV drug use. Regarding types by location, there are several: Extremity cellulitis occurs in arms or legs with symptoms of tenderness and swelling; Facial cellulitis typically affects adults over 50 with face/lip tenderness and tightness; Periorbital cellulitis affects the eyelid area without affecting eye movement; Orbital cellulitis is a dangerous type affecting the eye socket; Perianal cellulitis typically affects young children under 3 years; and Erysipelas affects superficial skin with raised borders and is known as St. Anthony's fire.","context":["Cellulitis is one of the most painful, quickly spreading and potentially deadly types of infections that can be caused by Staph or MRSA. Because these infections are becoming more common, it’s best to know what to look for and what to do if you think you have it. MRSA cellulitis can take a long time to get rid of. And like other types of MRSA and Staph, it is prone to recurring and can be difficult to treat.\nFortunately, there are both antibiotic drug and potent alternative options for controlling cellulitis. Becoming more familiar with the symptoms, risk factors and treatment options below is a good first step if you’re struggling with an infection.\nWhat is cellulitis?\nCellulitis is a deep infection of the skin and the underlying tissues. If left unchecked, cellulitis can quickly lead to more dangerous infections of the blood (sepsis), bone (osteomyelitis) and heart (endocarditis) and in some cases tissue death (gangrene).\nCellulitis infections are most common on the lower legs, face and arms, but they can occur anywhere on the body. Children often get this infection on their bottom. The most common symptoms are red, warm and tender skin, but these infections can have many other symptoms as well. Looking a cellulitis pictures can be a helpful tool. Possible warning signs and indications of cellulitis include:\n- Redness of the skin area, which often grows in size over time\n- Swelling or inflammation of the area, which often gets bigger over time\n- Red streaks radiating outward may occur, which often spread outward over time\n- Pain and tenderness in the area\n- Skin that is warm to the touch in the infected area.\n- Skin sores, bumps and small pimples can sometimes occur\n- A rash or red patches in the area may occur\n- Skin sometimes appears stretched, tight or shiny in the area\n- Fever, chills, sweating or shaking can occur\n- Feeling ill, weak or having muscle aches can occur\n- Nausea, joint stiffness and hair loss in the area may occur in some cases\nWho’s at risk?\nThere are many risk factors for cellulitis, some more significant than others. Any of the factors below, either by themselves or in combination, can increase the risk of catching cellulitis:\n- Any cuts, scrapes, cracks, burns, blisters or open wounds on the skin provide an easy entry for bacteria.\n- Surgical wounds, catheter sites and IV injection sites are very common places to get cellulitis and other infections.\n- Dry or peeling skin, Athlete’s foot, eczema, shingles, chickenpox and other skin conditions can make your skin more vulnerable to getting infected.\n- Insect or animal bites or stings can easily become infected.\n- The elderly and people with weakened immune system have a higher risk of cellulitis and other infections.\n- A long term stay in a hospital, nursing home or other healthcare facility can increase your exposure to MRSA and many other infections.\n- Taking medications that depress the immune system, including corticosteroids and antirejection drugs, make you more prone to infections in general.\n- Ulcers caused by Diabetes or vascular disease are a risk factor.\n- Swollen legs or arms caused by either medical conditions (such as cirrhosis, scleroderma or congestive heart failure) or by medications (such as diuretics or water pills) increase the risks of cellulitis.\n- Conditions that weaken the immune system, including diabetes, HIV/AIDS, circulatory disorders, liver disease, kidney disease and leukemia can make you more prone to many types of infection.\n- IV drug use is another risk factor for many types of infection.\nWhat should you do?\nCellulitis can be quite dangerous and should be taken very seriously. If you think you have cellulitis, it’s best to get medical attention as soon as possible. If the infection is spreading or growing, or if it causes chills or fever, it’s crucial to get immediate medical attention. These infections are even more serious if they occur on your face or in other sensitive areas of the body.\nAntibiotics are the most common mainstream medical treatment for cellulitis. Mild cases are often treated with oral antibiotics that can be taken at home. Moderate and severe infections are usually treated with IV antibiotics in a hospital. Recovery can take a few days to several months, depending on the severity of the infection and other complicating health problems.\nWhile there are several natural remedies that can be used for treatment, it’s best to be under the close supervision of a doctor for these challenging infections, regardless of which treatments you use. Natural remedies of high potency taken in larger doses are usually needed. Because higher doses of any natural product can lead to sensitivity, detoxification, liver toxicity and other symptoms, it’s best if your doctor is familiar with these symptoms and the particular remedy you are using.\nShort-term use of therapeutic grade oregano oil taken internally in moderate to high doses is one natural method that has been used. Other essential oils, such as ravensara, clove and cinnamon bark, have been used internally for challenging infections, along with milder oils, such as tea tree, for external skin support. High doses of stabilized allicin and specialized medicinal herbal blends, such as Olive Leaf extract, have also been used for these infections. As with any natural remedy, treatment alone is usually not enough. Additional steps should be taken to boost the immune system and repair damage done by bacteria and drugs, especially for severe infections.\nDepending on the circumstances, both antibiotic drugs and natural remedies have been used together. Getting your mainstream medical doctor to collaborate with your Naturopathic Doctor is one of the best ways to get comprehensive holistic health care.\nTo your best health,\nMicrobiologist and Natural Health Expert","Cellulitis - Pictures, Symptoms, Treatment, Contagious, Causes, Types\nWhat is Cellulitis?\nCellulitis is a bacterial infection of the skin involving the tissue of the deeper layer of the skin both the dermis and subcutaneous tissue. It is a common infection that can be potentially serious as the infection can spread and invade the lymph nodes and enter the bloodstream however, cellulitis is an infection considered to be non-purulent or one that does not form an abscess. Cellulitis often appears in areas with broken skin such as those that created by skin ulcer or wounds from surgical incision.\nCellulitis is apparently an unreported disease that its prevalence remains vague although it is somewhat a common infection that can happen to anybody. No racial and ethnic group predilection or gender has been reported with the epidemiology of cellulitis although it has been seen to commonly affect adults over the age of 50 years old especially with facial cellulitis while children below the age of 3 years old are commonly affected with perianal cellulitis. The development of cellulitis in elderly however, has made them predisposed for developing thrombophlebitis. Cellulitis on the other hand can be potentially life-threatening when the infection continues to spread and affect the lymphatic and circulatory system.\nCellulitis is characterized with skin swelling and redness of skin of the affected area while the skin may feel hot and tender to touch. It initially starts with tenderness, redness and swelling of the skin on the affected area and spread to adjacent area of the skin. The reddened area of the skin will expand overtime while small red spot may also develop over the redness and which may form blisters that burst in time. Fever may develop while the skin redness gradually increases its size and the enlargement and fever may also be associated with chills, sweating and palpable swollen lymph nodes adjacent to the areas of infection.\nCellulitis on the other hand has different types named according to the areas of infection while each has different presentation from another although there may be some similarity.\nCommon types of Cellulitis\nExtremity cellulitis is a type of cellulitis that occurs either in the arm or in the leg. The mode of bacterial infection is through a break in the skin surface with symptoms including:\n- Arm or leg tenderness\n- Pain and swelling over the affected area\n- Redness of the affected skin\n- Affected skin is warm to touch and red spots may develop over the redness\n- Fever associated with chills and sweating may occur especially in severe cases\n- Palpable swollen lymph nodes adjacent to affected skin.\nFacial cellulitis usually occurs in adults aged 50 years and above especially to those with compromised lymphatic systems or to those suffering from upper respiratory infections. The symptoms in this type of cellulitis include the following:\n- Tenderness of the face, lips or tongue associated with skin redness\n- Pain and swelling of the affected area\n- Onset of fever and chills\n- Skin of the face may feel tight and warm to touch.\nPeriorbital cellulitis is also called preseptal cellulitis that affects the eyelid and the skin surrounding the eyes. This type of cellulitis however, does not affect the movement of the eye and generally not a serious condition although the visual can be obscured. It is often the consequence of trauma or damage to the eye and may also be the result of another infection such as sinusitis. The symptoms of this type of cellulitis include the following:\n- Redness and swelling of the skin of the eyelid or the skin surrounding the affected eye\n- Pain and tenderness of the affected eye\n- Fever may develop\nOrbital cellulitis is a rare type although far more dangerous due to its potential to spread in the brain. It is often secondary from an infection in the sinus and it affects the skin lining of the eye socket while it is the result of an injury to the eye. The symptoms of this type of cellulitis include the following:\n- Inflammation of the eyelid and the areas around it\n- Pain and discomfort over the affected eye\n- Affected eye bulges or may have restriction in the eye movement\n- Diminished vision\n- Onset of high fever\nPerianal cellulitis generally affects young children aged 3 years and below and is often caused by Group A Streptococcus. This type of cellulitis is also known as perineal dermatitis and characterized by erythema of the perianal that extends from 2 to 3cm in the anal border. Symptoms of this cellulitis include the following:\n- Redness of the anal skin\n- Painful and itchy bowel movement which may sometimes be associated with bleeding\n- Onset of fever\nErysipelas is a type of cellulitis that affects the superficial skin and is mainly the result of gas produced by the bacteria. This type of cellulitis is also called St. Anthony’s fire or holy fire. Symptoms include the following:\n- Onset of high fever associated with chills\n- Skin lesion is marked by a raised border\n- Skin beneath the lesion is very swollen and reddish and warm to touch\n- Affected area is painful\n- Development of erysipelas lesion over the bridge of the nose and the cheeks.\nThere are numerous bacteria that can cause cellulitis although majority of cases is often an infection from Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes.\nCommon bacteria causing cellulitis\n- Staphylococcus aureus including the methicillin resistant strains which is potentially dangerous due to its property of resistance to antibiotic and methicillin treatment.\n- Beta-hemolytic streptococci are the most common bacteria that cause cellulitis.\n- Haemophilus influenza commonly infects children below the age of 3 years old and commonly occur in the face, arms and upper torso.\n- Clostridium perfringens causes bacteria to produce gas when infection spreads in the muscle.\n- Pasteurella multocida is a bacterial infection from the bite of cat or dog.\n- Aeromonas hydrophilia is bacteria acquired from injury in freshwater.\n- Vibrio vulnificus is bacterial infection from exposure to saltwater and is potentially life-threatening to patient suffering from certain type of chronic liver disease.\nPredisposing factors for cellulitis\n- Surgical wound or incision\n- Break in the skin from trauma, puncture, laceration\n- Break in the skin from animal bites or sting\n- Skin lesions and ulcerations\n- Compromised immune system\n- Addiction from intravenous drug\n- Constant use of steroid drugs\n- Occupational exposure such as farmers, gardeners and fish handlers.\nCellulitis can be treated as out-patient although severe cases require hospitalization although the infection is generally treatable and without result of lasting disability. It is usually treated with prescription of oral antibiotics depending on the type of bacterial infection while others may require intravenous antibiotics especially when the patient is not responding to oral medication which condition usually progresses after three days from initial treatment. The goal of treatment on the other hand is in reducing the severity of infection and to relieve the symptoms while speeding up recovery and skin healing and in prevention of recurrence.\nSurgical intervention is not an immediate recommendation except when there is already a formation of abscess or pus in the tissue and drainage is the option to allow relief of pain while removal of dead tissue is necessary to allow skin healing.\nSelf-care treatment can also be done at home such as:\n- Elevation of affected part of the body to reduce swelling\n- Sufficient rest of the part of the body infected by the bacteria\n- Pain relievers which can be bought over-the counter.\nIs Cellulitis Contagious?\nCellulitis is generally not a contagious disease as the invasion or infection of bacteria is mainly in the deeper layers of the skin such as that of the dermis and subcutaneous tissue. The top layer of the skin or the epidermis is not included in the infection and it provides protection while enveloping the infection and therefore cannot be transmitted from one person to another.\nAlthough treatable and generally not contagious, cellulitis when left untreated is potentially dangerous and life-threatening while it can also result to other medical complications such as:\nMeningitis is potentially at risk in facial cellulitis especially when the infection has spread to the membranes or meninges of the brain.\nBlood poisoning secondary to cellulitis is potential when bacterial infection has reached the bloodstream.\nAbscess or the collection of pus from cellulitis is the result of bacterial buildup or buildup from dead white blood cells.\nThrombophlebitis occurs when cellulitis has disrupted blood circulation which can lead to blood clots."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:24d53e73-3fdb-4fe8-9d31-e9814c6e055a>","<urn:uuid:d38d3b15-8df8-4b04-bcb0-5e5c43751753>"],"error":null}
{"question":"As a corn and soybean farmer, I need advice on cover crop selection. What are examples of cover crops that work well before these specific crops, and what planting rates should be used for optimal results?","answer":"For soybeans, cereal rye is an excellent choice as it provides good weed control when planted at the right rates. However, cereal rye should not be planted before corn because it uses significant water and nitrogen, creating a nitrogen-deficient environment for the corn. For fall planting, cereal rye should be used at 3 oz/100 square feet. Alternatively, you could use a combination of cover crops, such as radishes mixed with cereal rye or oats, which is more effective at capturing nitrogen than single species. The radish-oat mix will winter-kill but could risk spring erosion. For optimal results, cover crops need careful management and proper timing - early planting is especially important for capturing nitrogen effectively.","context":["How to Improve Your Soil Quality with Cover Crops\nCover crops can provide many benefits for your garden. Whether you have a large or small space, these plants give you an easy solution to many of the issues you may have in your garden.\nHere’s what they are, when and how to grow them, and their benefits.\nCover crops are plants you put in open or empty spaces in your garden to benefit the soil. Planting cover crops is as easy as it is beneficial.\nFirst, you need to choose the right cover crop.\nHere are some of the cover crops you might choose to plant in the fall:\n- Annual ryegrass is easy to establish. It dies back over the winter. Use 2 oz/100 square feet.\n- Perennial ryegrass can be established. It has an extensive root system. Use 1 oz/100 square feet.\n- Winter rye can grow in low pH soil at cool temperatures. Use 3 oz/100 square feet.\n- Oats die back in the winter. They can grow in low pH soil, but it’s important that they have good drainage. Use 4 oz/100 square feet.\n- Winter wheat needs fertile soil that isn’t wet or low pH. Use 3 oz/100 square feet.\nSome cover plants can be planted in the summer. For these plants, use 1 oz/100 square feet except for buckwheat, which needs 3 oz/100 square feet.\n- Sweet clover is great for higher pH soil.\n- White clover grows well in low pH soil but needs to be treated with an inoculant.\n- Tall fescue can become weed-like.\n- If you plant buckwheat, it’s crucial that you don’t allow it to mature. Otherwise, it will reseed.\nPlant the cover crop when you have empty garden space during the time of year when that specific cover crop grows well. Start by raking the garden area where you want to plant them. Remove any large stones or other debris. Sow the seeds by broadcasting at the right rate.\nThen, rake them again and water them with a finely-misting hose. They grow with little or no extra care. If you’ve used a perennial cover crop, cut it back once if it becomes too tall in the spring.\nBenefits of Cover Crops\nCover crops have many different benefits. Like manure, they add organic material to fertilize your garden naturally. When you work them into the soil, their root systems make open passages that help water and air move easily and decrease the soil compaction. They also eliminate the damage to your soil that would otherwise be caused by weeding, tilling, and harvesting, as well as by foot traffic. In this way, they protect the soil structure. They not only retain the soil, but they decrease erosion and slow down the runoff, thereby minimizing the impact of rain on the soil. With the cover crops in place, weeds don’t grow.\nCover cropping can improve your soil dramatically with very little effort. They offer a simple way to increase the fertility of your soil in a very natural way.","By Dusty Sonnenberg, CCA, Ohio Field Leader: a project of the Ohio Soybean Council and soybean checkoff.\n“You are not farming the same soils your grandparents farmed,” said Hans Kok, Program Director for the Conservation Technology Information Center in Indiana.\nKok spoke during a presentation at the Ohio No-till Council’s Winter Conference and described the origins of the soils we find in this part of the Midwest, going back to the glaciers and continuing to the modern soil challenges we face. Over the past 100 years, farming practices employed in America have led to a deterioration of the soil quality. “Data from the University of Illinois shows that on plots dating back to 1873, we have lost about 80% of the organic matter in the soils that have been farmed continuously since that time.”\nKok believes that producers can reverse this trend by adjusting their farming practices. One change he recommends is to incorporate the use of cover crops. Cover crops have many benefits. “We get erosion control, nutrient retention, and now we see we are also getting benefits from weed control in some situations,” said Kok. “Cover crops also help with drought and flood control as we face changes in the climate.”\nAt the end of the day, farmers are concerned about yield and profitability. “Cover crops can help increase yields,” said Kok. “They can also help increase profit. There has been some bad press when farmers have not understood how to best manage their cover crops, or selected the wrong cover crops to use on their farms. They have lost yield and money, but if managed properly, both yields and profits can increase.”\nAn example of selecting the wrong cover crop is to plant cereal rye in front of corn. “Cereal rye uses a lot of water, and uses a lot nitrogen, so as a result, the following corn would be planted in a nitrogen deficient environment,” said Kok. “Farmers need to pay attention to what they plant, where they plant it, and when they plant it, for it to be successful.”\nAn example of selecting the right crop is cereal rye in front of soybeans. “Cereal rye provides excellent weed control when planted at the right rates,” said Kok. “Radishes are also good for weed control because they have some bio-fumigation effects.” Radishes should not normally be planted alone. A radish-cereal rye grass mixture is a good option for controlling weeds.\nCover crops can be used to help manage nutrients. “Nutrient needs can be reduced if we use our cover crops well,” said Kok. “We have a lot of nutrients left over at the end of the growing season, especially after a corn crop. Cover crops can help capture a lot of these nutrients.”\nCereal rye and radishes will capture and hold nitrogen along with other nutrients left from the previous cash crop. These nutrients are then released and become available as they break down in the spring and summer months. “The weather does play a role in this nutrient management process,” said Kok. “Planting cereal rye early is important to be able to capture more nitrogen.”\nUsing a combination of cover crops, in a mix, works better than just one single cover crop species, in capturing nitrogen. Cereal rye with radishes, or Radishes with oats can capture a lot of nitrogen. The radish and oats mix will winter-kill, and could risk erosion in the spring. “If you apply manure to a field, cover crops can be extremely helpful in sequestering the nutrients and holding them until the next season,” said Kok.\nCan farmers actually grow nitrogen? “The literature is always full of articles about growing 200 pounds of nitrogen using cover crops,” said Kok. “That is really pushing it in Northern Indiana and Northern Ohio. Farmers need to be careful figuring out how much nitrogen they can grow, and how they do that. Some farmers use multiple species cover crop mixes to supply the nutrients needed. It takes a lot of management. These mixes need to contain some species that will freeze out, and others that can easily be controlled and terminated in the spring, with chemicals or by rolling,” said Kok.

When migrating legacy data to Hadoop, organizations have different options like file-to-file transformation, SQL-based storage using tools like Hive, or individual object storage using formats like XML and JSON. These approaches prioritize analytics capabilities and distributed processing over strict transactional guarantees.","context":["As organizations reconsider their data architectures to enable new analytics applications, we're seeing a transition in which traditional data warehouses are being augmented by big data environments. And while Hadoop data lakes typically hold new types of data, they can also be a suitable repository for older information that has analytical value waiting to be tapped.\nOne of the reasons why Hadoop systems are being integrated with data warehouses is to move cold data that isn't accessed frequently from a warehouse database to Hive tables running on top of the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). This mingling of conventional databases with Hadoop is often a first step in the data modernization process, and it opens up a range of new options for creating useful Hadoop data sets.\nA particularly promising aspect involves migrating the massive volumes of historical data hidden away in many data warehouses to big data environments to make the info more accessible for analysis. In a lot of cases, that data is stored in mainframe files, such as VSAM, IMS and COBOL files. When planning a legacy data migration to a data lake, you have to consider the different alternatives for the target format based on the anticipated use cases for the data.\nFor example, if the goal is purely to move data off of an aging platform and onto a more modern one for ongoing storage, the sensible approach might be to simply copy the mainframe files to HDFS and take advantage of the redundancy and fault tolerance that Hadoop clusters provide. Once all the files are moved, you can move on to preparing the old system for retirement.\nMore than a data salvage job\nHowever, there's growing interest in not just salvaging legacy data, but putting it to productive use. Many older data sets include years of transaction data or operational logs that can be subjected to various forms of advanced analytics, such as time series analysis and machine learning algorithms, to look for patterns in the data that can help predict future trends and business opportunities.\nIf that's your goal, copying the existing files as is won't be sufficient, unless your analytics applications are engineered to read them in the original mainframe source format. The question then becomes this: How do you transform the legacy files into Hadoop data sets that are suited to modern-day analytics?\nLet's look at three alternatives for converting mainframe files to formats that can support broader analysis of the data.\n- File-to-file transformation. In this approach, the original legacy files are transformed into a modern format, such as an ASCII text file, and the original collection of data instances is maintained within the new files. It's suited to a simple data lake environment in which Hadoop data sets are stored and managed as singular data assets.\nIn addition, this option can uphold existing types of data usage that don't rely on new data management and analytics methods -- for example, cases in which users are most likely to request large-scale data extracts that involve simple scans through sets of records. As a result, organizations that are beginning their journey to data modernization may elect this course as the path of least resistance internally.\n- SQL-based storage. A different approach is to leverage SQL-based data engines that are layered on top of Hadoop and other big data platforms. Examples include Hive, Impala, Presto, Drill, IBM Big SQL and Spark SQL. The SQL-on-Hadoop alternative is a little more complex, as it requires introducing data integration processes to transform the legacy data into a format that can be loaded into HDFS or another repository, and then queried via SQL.\nHowever, once that has been done, users can run standard SQL queries to access and analyze the data. This option supports applications for dimensional analysis, as well as direct ad hoc querying and even some level of automated data services.\n- Individual object storage. The third way involves transforming each data instance into its own object using a representation created with technologies such as XML and JSON. Doing so provides much greater flexibility when it comes to analyzing Hadoop data sets because a collection of objects stored in a clustered data lake architecture provides a natural landscape for executing MapReduce or Spark programs that can scale across distributed data.\nThis option may require extra work to transform the legacy data into the target format. However, the resulting repository in HDFS or elsewhere is capable of supporting requests for data extracts, a mix of advanced analytics applications, and data services in which specific API invocations can be launched by accessing requested objects based on a name or meta tag.\nSo, which is the best way to go? That depends largely on the kinds of analytics uses an organization has in mind. But it's important to recognize that data modernization usually doesn't happen overnight. In fact, over time, as the community of data users grows and their analytics needs expand, there may be opportunities to take advantage of each of these approaches to maximize the value of the resulting Hadoop data sets.","DBMS > HyperSQL vs. PostgreSQL vs. Prometheus\nSystem Properties Comparison HyperSQL vs. PostgreSQL vs. Prometheus\nPlease select another system to include it in the comparison.\n|Editorial information provided by DB-Engines|\n|Name||HyperSQL also known as HSQLDB Xexclude from comparison||PostgreSQL Xexclude from comparison||Prometheus Xexclude from comparison|\n|Description||Multithreaded, transactional RDBMS written in Java also known as HSQLDB||Widely used open source RDBMS Developed as objectoriented DBMS (Postgres), gradually enhanced with 'standards' like SQL||Open-source TimeSeries DBMS and monitoring system|\n|Primary database model||Relational DBMS||Relational DBMS with object oriented extensions, e.g.: user defined types/functions and inheritance.

Their base is\nrelatively dark and nearly horizontal. Since these clouds may grow from regions\nabove freezing to levels well below freezing, they may be composed\nsolely of water droplets, supercooled water droplets, ice crystals, snowflakes,\nice pellets or a combination of all. These clouds form in an unstable\nenvironment which allows air parcels to continue to rise once started either\nthrough forced lifting or heating and are sometimes referred to as \"clouds\nof ascending air currents.\".\ntake on a variety of shapes. This image, of\ncumulus humilis, (of small size) is characterized by only a small\nvertical extent and may appear flattened. It never produces precipitation. They\nare sometimes called fair-weather cumulus. Cumulus mediocris clouds are of moderate vertical extent, with small protuberances and sproutings\nat their tops. They generally give no precipitation.\nThe tops of these towers occasionally are formed of\nsmall \"puffs\" which may detach themselves successively from the main\nbody of the cloud. They are then carried away by the wind and\ndisintegrate more or less rapidly, occasionally producing virga.\nCumulus congestus often develops into cumulonimbus type clouds.\ncloud has grown to resemble a cauliflower with strong sproutings and generally\nsharp outlines and often great vertical extent, a cumulus congestus cloud\nhas developed. Cumulus congestus often release abundant precipitation in\nthe form of showers. If a cumulus congestus cloud resembles a narrow, very\nhigh tower, it often is called a towering cumulus, although a more proper\ndesignation would be cumulus castellanus.\nCumulonimbus clouds, with the anvil tops as seen in the distance in this\nimage, are heavy and dense clouds with considerable vertical extent, in the\nform of a mountain or huge towers. The clouds to the front are cumulus and\ntowering cumulus. At least part of its upper portion is usually smooth, or\nfibrous or striated, and nearly always flattened; this part often spreads out\nin the shape of an anvil or vast plume as shown. The top may reach to the\ntropopause. Under the base of this cloud, which is often very dark, there are frequently low ragged clouds either merged with it or not, and precipitaion of the showery form, often very intense.\nWhen cumulonimbus covers a large expanse of the sky, it can easily\nbe confused with nimbostratus, especially when identification is based solely\non the appearance of the undersurface. In this case, the character of the\nprecipitation may help to distinguish cumulonimbus, which produces a showery\ntype and is often accompanied by lightning and thunder, from nimbostratus,\nwhich produces a steady, continuous precipitation.\nCertain cumulonimbus clouds appear\nidentical to cumulus congestus. The cloud should be called cumulonimbus\nas soon as at least a part of its upper portion loses the sharpness of\nits outlines or presents a fibrous or striated texture. If it is\naccompanied by lightning, thunder or hail, it is a cumulonimbus.\nCumulonimbus is composed of water droplets, supercooled droplets and ice\ncrystals, snowflakes, snow pellets, ice pellets or hail stones.\nCumulonimbus may be described as a \"cloud factory,\" and it may produce\nmore or less thick patches or sheets of cirrus spissatus, altocumulus,\naltostratus or stratocumulus by the spreading out of its upper portions\nand by the dissipation of its subjacent parts.

{"question":"How does the spread of white-nose syndrome occur, and what technological solutions are being implemented to study it?","answer":"White-nose syndrome spreads primarily through bat-to-bat contact, though the fungus can also occur naturally in the environment. It's believed that humans initially introduced the fungus by carrying spores on clothes and outdoor equipment into bat habitats. To study this spread, technological solutions like the SICK 270° LiDAR-based Cave Map and Bat Counter have been developed. This device serves two key functions: counting bats entering and leaving caves, and creating comparative 3D scans of hibernation areas. This technology enables 24/7 data collection and helps verify hypotheses about how cave temperature affects the syndrome's spread, while eliminating the safety risks associated with researchers entering caves.","context":["Helping researchers monitor and protect bat colonies\nEven with proper safety equipment, entering a cave puts one at risk of several hazards, including dehydration, hypothermia, rockfall, trips and falls, or simply getting lost. Researchers of bat colonies risk this to collect data for bat and human safety. What if they used LiDAR instead?\nThe second team from Michigan Technological University (MTU) for the 2020 TiM$10K Challenge at SICK included Garrett Smith, Max Heidacker, Spenser Fata, Ethan Baker, Adam Persson, and Bob DeJonge. Their advisor was Dr. Wayne Weaver, an Associate Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. The Cave Map and Bat Counter (CMBC) created for the challenge aims to help Michigan researchers streamline their data collection.\nSo, what is the TiM$10K Challenge? In this challenge, SICK reached out to universities across the nation that were looking to support innovation and student achievement in automation and technology. Participating teams were supplied with a SICK 270° LiDAR, a TiM, and accessories. They were challenged to solve a problem, create a solution, and bring a new application that utilizes the SICK scanner in any industry.\nWhy Focus on Bats?\nResearchers in the MTU Forestry Department and the Michigan Department of Natural Resources (MDNR) are studying white-nose syndrome in bats. White-nose syndrome is a fungus that grows on the faces of the bats while they sleep.\n“The fungus causes irritation to the bats to the point that they wake up during hibernation, which causes the bats to burn so much energy that they starve to death during winter,” DeJonge explained.\nOn top of being terrible for the bats, this has implications for humans as well. Bats are one of the few natural predators of mosquitos.\n“When the bats die off, the mosquito population grows, and so does the risk of them transmitting diseases to humans,” Smith added.\nAt the moment, bat researchers with the MDNR have to walk through caves by flashlight and count the bats they see, which can be both dangerous and inefficient. The MTU team’s solution using LiDAR technology is not.\nDeveloping the Cave Map and Bat Counter\nBy utilizing the SICK 270° LiDAR, the CMBC is able to conduct two functions. First, it can be placed at the entrance of a cave to count how many bats are entering and leaving. Second, it can use 3D imaging to scan an area without bats, then compare it to a similar scan of an area where bats hibernate so researchers have a simpler time counting.\n“This would be especially useful in verifying the widely-held hypothesis that the temperature of a cave effects the spread of white-nose syndrome,” Heidacker said.\nThe benefits of such a device are inherent:\n- No safety risk to researchers from entering caves\n- Faster and more accurate data collection\n- 24/7 data collection\nAnother benefit of the CMBC is its portability. Straps on its sides allow researchers to transport it as a backpack, and handholds have been included to allow it to be carried as a suitcase. What’s more, the CMBC’s acrylic dome allows it to be protected as it is moved between locations.\n“At 27 pounds, it can be easily carried by a single person,” Baker said. However, not everything in CMBC’s development was so simple.\nUnexpected Pitfalls in Development\nThe MTU team was hit hard by COVID-19. While the team had solidified their design and programming, they weren’t able to sufficiently test the entire device, only components of it.\nIn addition to these problems, the MTU team was forced to cut a few of their initial goals out.\n“We were unable to get a cohesive final prototype that would be taken into a cave and tested,” Persson said. “For the 3D scan, it would’ve been ideal if the code could detect the bats solely based on the Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) values of the reading, thus eliminating the need to go in and take an initial scan.”\nStill, the team saw some positives to the development of the CMBC. While the device was originally meant to help the MDNR gather data on bats, they have found other possible uses for it.\n“This device can be used to track how many people enter or exit an area with the proper setup, and it could be used by contractors and architects to easily measure rooms in ‘as is’ condition,” Fata explained. “The MDNR also indicated that they could use it to determine the canopy density of a section of forest.”\nRegister for the 2020-2021 TiM$10K Challenge\nSICK is now accepting entries for the TiM$10K Challenge for the 2020-2021 school year!

It is caused by the fungus known as Pseudogymnoas destructans (PD) and it is recognized as a white fuzz that is growing on the snouts and faces of certain bat species (hence how it got its’ name). It will grow on the bare skin of their faces when they are in hibernation because they are inactive, and this allows for the fungus to take hold. It changes the way that bats behave, and it will make them active during times when they, naturally, shouldn’t be. This unnatural behavior will cause them to burn up the fat stores they have built up in order to survive hibernation and if they use those stores up too soon, they can die.\nAn Epidemic For Bat Populations\nIt has destroyed bat populations in North America, some sites have seen a mortality rate between 90 and 100% of the bats. The species who seem to be feeling the worst effects of this infection are the northern long-eared bat, the little brown bat, and the tri-colored (or eastern Pipistrelle) bat. There are other species who have been seen with this infection, but they are not facing the illness and mortality rates of the three listed here.\nIt has been found in bats of Europe and Asia, but this infection is not as destructive to the populations on these continents as it is to those in North America. It was unknown to scientists until the recent past.\nWhere did it come from?\nCave explorers first took pictures of bats in 2006 in upstate New York that had the white fuzz growing on their faces. It was first seen by scientists in 2007 in caves near Albany, NY. They found sick and dying bats as a result of white-nose syndrome. It is not exactly known where it comes from, but it is suspected that people are to blame for this problem.\nThe fungus grows in cold, damp caves and the spores are able to survive a long time on the clothes and outdoor equipment of people. People most likely carried the fungus into the habitats of these bats and the fungus was able to take hold easily. It has been found that people are not able to contract the illness, but they are likely to be the catalyst that caused the epidemic.\nWhat is being done?\nThis fungus is spreading quickly amongst the bat populations of the United States and Canada. The rapid spreading can be contributed to bat to bat contact but this fungus can occur in nature so it is possible that they get it from the environment. The bat to bat contact is the reason by it is spreading so fast.\nScientists are working diligently across the globe in order to learn as much as they can about this fungus. They are working so hard so that they can save these animals who serve such an important purpose for the world ecosystems. They are exploring possible vaccines and habitat alternations that may help in reducing the spread."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:cc3f9e27-bd5c-43fb-96cf-aa1b91d76e7b>","<urn:uuid:246e135b-a41b-4399-bba9-cb9a0eafc3e6>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the key causes of anaphylaxis, and what is the current protocol for prescribing preventive adrenaline autoinjectors to at-risk patients?","answer":"The main causes of anaphylaxis include foods, insect stings, medications (particularly penicillin and antibiotics), x-ray dyes, and exercise. Autoinjector prescriptions are strongly recommended for patients with a history of anaphylaxis who remain at risk, those with food allergies combined with unstable/moderate-to-severe asthma, and individuals with underlying mast cell disorders. They are sometimes recommended for teenagers/young adults with food allergies, particularly to peanuts, tree nuts and seafood, and for those with limited access to emergency medical care. Prescriptions are not normally recommended for those with oral allergy syndrome, local reactions to insect stings, or cases where the allergen can be successfully avoided.","context":["Anaphylaxis refers to a rapidly developing and serious allergic reaction that affects a number of different areas of the body at one time. Severe anaphylactic reactions can be fatal. Most people experience allergy symptoms only as a minor annoyance. However, a small number of allergic people are susceptible to a reaction that can lead to shock or even death. Fortunately, anaphylaxis is rare. The death rate from anaphylaxis is about 1 out of every 2.5 million people per year.\nAnaphylaxis is often triggered by substances that are injected or ingested and thereby gain access into the blood stream. An explosive reaction involving the skin, lungs, nose, throat, and gastrointestinal tract can then result. Although severe cases of anaphylaxis can occur within seconds or minutes of exposure and be fatal if untreated, many reactions are milder and can be ended with prompt medical therapy.\nWhat Does Anaphylaxis Mean?\nTo fully understand this term, we need to go back almost 100 years. The story begins on a cruise aboard Prince Albert I of Monaco’s yacht. The Prince had invited two Parisian scientists to perform studies on the toxin produced by the tentacles of a local jellyfish, the Portuguese Man of War. Charles Richet and Paul Portier were able to isolate the toxin and tried to vaccinate dogs in the hope of obtaining protection, or “prophylaxis,” against the toxin. They were horrified to find that subsequent very small doses of the toxin unexpectedly resulted in a new dramatic illness that involved the rapid onset of breathing difficulty and resulted in death within 30 minutes. Richet and Portier termed this “anaphylaxis” or “against protection.” They rightly concluded that the immune system first becomes sensitized to the allergen over several weeks and upon re-exposure to the same allergen may result in a severe reaction. You will recall that an allergen is a substance that is foreign to the body and can cause an allergic reaction in certain people.\n- The first documented case of presumed anaphylaxis occurred in 2641 B.C. when Menes, an Egyptian pharaoh, died mysteriously following a wasp or hornet sting. Later, in Babylonian times, there are two distinct references to deaths due to wasp stings.\n- Charles Richet was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1913 for his work on anaphylaxis.\nRichet went on to suggest that the allergen must result in the production of a substance, which then sensitized the dogs to react in such a way upon re-exposure. This substance turned out to be IgE. He was right on target.\nIn the first part of the 20th century, anaphylactic reactions were most commonly caused by tetanus diphtheria vaccinations made from horse serum. Today, human serum is used for tetanus prevention and the most common causes of anaphylaxis are now penicillin and other antibiotics, insect stings, and certain foods.\nIn 1956, Mary Hewitt Loveless showed that the injection of wasp venoms could cause anaphylaxis in individuals allergic to wasps. She subsequently used wasp extracts to successfully immunize such individuals.\nHow Common is Anaphylaxis?\nThe exact prevalence of anaphylaxis is unknown. The available statistics probably underestimate the true frequency because reactions are not always reported. Milder reactions may be attributed to an asthma attack or a sudden episode of hives. More serious, fatal episodes might be reported as a heart attack since the indicative signs of hives, swollen throat, and asthma can fade quickly. Thus, it is quite possible that even the true incidence of fatalities due to anaphylaxis is both under- recognized and under-reported. Regardless of precise statistics, we need to do a better job of preventing and treating anaphylaxis. The importance of awareness, early recognition, and prompt treatment of this disorder must be stressed.\nWhat are common causes of anaphylaxis?\nThe causes of anaphylaxis are divided into two major groups:\n- IgE mediated: This form is the true anaphylaxis that requires an initial sensitizing exposure, the coating of the mast cells and basophils by IgE, and the explosive release of chemical mediators upon re-exposure.\n- Non-IgE mediated: These reactions, the so called “anaphylactoid” reactions, are similar to those of true anaphylaxis, but do not require an IgE immune reaction. They are usually caused by the direct stimulation of the mast cells and basophils. The same mediators as occur with true anaphylaxis are released and the same effects are produced. This reaction can happen, and often does, on initial as well as subsequent exposures, since no sensitization is required.\nThe terms anaphylaxis and anaphylactoid (meaning “like anaphylaxis”) are both used to describe this severe, allergic reaction. Anaphylaxis is used to describe reactions that are initiated by IgE and anaphylactoid is used in reference to reactions that are not caused by IgE. The effects of the reactions are the same, however, and are generally treated in the same manner.\nAlthough it may appear that IgE mediated anaphylaxis occurs upon a first exposure to a food, drug, or insect sting, there must have been a prior, and probably unwitting, sensitization. You may not remember an uneventful sting or be aware of “hidden” allergens in foods. You will, however, remember the anaphylactic reaction that occurs as a subsequent response.\n- Although likely underestimated, about 10,000 cases of anaphylaxis occur per year in North America, with about 750 fatalities per year.\n- Foods and insect stings are the most common causes of anaphylactic reactions that result in death. Foods cause approximately 50-100 fatalities per year. Insect stings cause about 50 deaths per year.\nHow can we recognize anaphylaxis?\nIt is worth mentioning a few general observations regarding the features of anaphylactic reactions. Be aware, however, that these guidelines are not always consistent or reliable for a particular individual.\n- The severity of the reaction varies from person to person.\n- Subsequent reactions to the same trigger are typically similar in nature.\n- The more rapid the onset of symptoms, the more severe the reaction is likely to be.\n- A history of allergic disease (rhinitis, eczema, asthma) does not increase the risk of developing IgE mediated anaphylaxis, but it does incline the person to a non-IgE mediated reaction.\n- Underlying asthma may result in a more severe reaction and can be more difficult to treat.\n- The risk of anaphylaxis may diminish over time if there are no repeated exposures or reactions. However, a person at risk should always expect the worst and be prepared.\nWhat will I feel during an anaphylactic reaction?\nThe symptoms of an anaphylactic reaction may occur within seconds of exposure or be delayed 15 to 30 minutes or even an hour or more later (typical of aspirin and similar drugs). Early symptoms are often related to the skin. Flushing (warmth and redness of the skin), itching (often in the groin or armpits), and hives are common initial findings. These symptoms are often accompanied by a feeling of “impending doom,” anxiety, and sometimes a rapid, irregular pulse. Throat and tongue swelling resulting in hoarseness, difficulty swallowing, and difficulty breathing frequently follow. Symptoms of rhinitis or asthma may occur causing a runny nose, sneezing, and wheezing, which may worsen the breathing difficulty. Vomiting, diarrhea, and stomach cramps may develop. About 25% of the time, the mediators flooding the blood stream cause a generalized opening of capillaries (tiny blood vessels) which results in a drop in blood pressure, lightheadedness, or even loss of consciousness. These are the typical features of anaphylactic shock.\nWhat happens next?\nThere are three possible outcomes:\n- The signs and symptoms may be mild and fade spontaneously or be quickly ended by administering emergency medication in the form of epinephrine (adrenaline). In this outcome, the symptoms do not subsequently recur from this particular exposure.\n- After initial improvement, the symptoms may recur within 4 to 12 hours (late phase reaction) and require additional treatment and close observation. Recent evidence suggests that a late phase reaction occurs in fewer than 10% of cases.\n- Lastly, the reaction may be persistent and more severe, thus requiring intensive medical treatment and hospitalization. This may occur up to 20% of the time with certain exposures.\nEpinephrine, which is also known as “adrenaline,” is a drug that acts immediately to cause the blood vessels to contract, thereby preventing fluid leakage. Epinephrine also helps relax the bronchial tubes, thus relieving breathing difficulty. It also lessens stomach cramps and stops itching and hives. More importantly, epinephrine helps prevent the release of more mediators.\nBeta-blocker medications commonly used to treat high blood pressure, angina, thyroid disorders, migraines, or glaucoma can make it very difficult to reverse anaphylactic reactions, which may then become severe.\nCould it have been something else?\nSeveral disorders may appear similar to anaphylaxis. Fainting (vaso-vagal reaction) is the reaction that is most likely to be confused with anaphylaxis. The key differences are that in a fainting episode, the affected person has a slow pulse, cool and pale skin, and no hives or difficulty breathing. Other conditions, such as heart attacks, blood clots to the lungs, and panic attacks can also be confused with anaphylaxis.\nDiagnosis - Rounding Up the Likely Suspects!\nOnce you think that you might have had an anaphylactic reaction, the first order of business is to see an allergist. The allergist will assess whether or not the reaction was indeed allergic in nature. Usually, a careful and detailed medical history and selected blood or skin tests can identify the cause. Be prepared to recall your activities before the event, the food and medications you ingested, and whether or not you had any contact with rubber products.\nIf you develop flushing, itching, hives, or other allergy symptoms while exercising, STOP IMMEDIATELY. If this has happened before, always carry an emergency epinephrine injection with you and never exercise alone.\nHow do we manage anaphylaxis?\nThe optimal management of anaphylaxis saves lives. An affected or at-risk person must be aware of possible triggers and early warning signs. If you are prone to these reactions, you must be familiar with the use of emergency kits and always have them with you. Emergency measures and prevention are central to management. As always, allergic diseases are best treated by avoidance measures, which will be reviewed in detail below.\nEmergency Measures for Anaphylaxis\nIf you suspect that you or someone you are with is having an anaphylactic reaction, the following are important first aid measures. In general, try to perform these in the order that they are presented.\n- If available, inject epinephrine immediately. The shot is given into the outer thigh and can be administered through light fabric. Rub the site to improve absorption of the drug.\n- Call emergency services or 911 IMMEDIATELY.\n- For reactions to insect stings or allergy shots, place a tourniquet between the puncture site and the heart. Release it for a few seconds every 10 minutes.\n- Place a conscious person lying down and elevate the feet if possible.\n- Stay with the person until help arrives.\n- If trained, begin CPR if the person stops breathing or doesn’t have a pulse.\nShots of epinephrine can be given through light clothing such as trousers, skirts, or stockings. Heavy garments may have to be removed prior to injecting.\nAfter 10 to 15 minutes, if the symptoms are still significant, you can inject another dose of epinephrine if available. Even after the reaction subsides, it is strongly advised that you go to an emergency room or allergist’s office immediately. Other treatments may be given, such as oxygen, intravenous fluids, breathing medications, and possibly more epinephrine. Steroids and antihistamines may be given but these are often not helpful initially and do not take the place of epinephrine. However, they may be more useful in preventing a recurrent delayed reaction.\nDo not be surprised if epinephrine makes you feel shaky and causes a rapid, pounding pulse. These are normal side effects and are not dangerous except for those with severe heart problems.\nTwo situations deserve special attention at this point since they are not covered elsewhere but are particularly interesting.\nRegarding the first situation, in the 1970’s, it was noted that exercise could cause anaphylaxis. Exercise-induced anaphylaxis (EIA) usually occurs with prolonged, strenuous exercise. Conditioned athletes such as marathon runners are frequently affected. The reaction may occur while exercising shortly after eating a meal, after eating specific foods (i.e. lettuce, shellfish, and celery) or after taking aspirin. It appears as though food or aspirin loads the gun and exercise pulls the trigger. Early symptoms are usually flushing and itching, which may progress to other typical symptoms of anaphylaxis if the exercise continues. Pre-medication with antihistamines or other drugs does not consistently prevent EIA. Exercise avoidance is the most effective treatment. If this is not feasible, exercising with a “buddy” and carrying emergency kits is mandatory.\nIn the second situation, when no cause can be found for anaphylaxis, it is termed idiopathic. Recent reports suggest that 25% of all episodes of anaphylaxis are idiopathic. Many of those affected have underlying allergy or asthma conditions. Extensive allergy testing for foods may uncover an unusual food allergy that is responsible for these reactions. For frequent episodes of anaphylaxis, your physician may recommend a combination of antihistamine, cortisone, and a medication to widen the airways of the lungs (bronchial dilator) to help reduce the severity of attacks.\nPrevention Measures for Anaphylaxis\nPreventing anaphylaxis is the ideal form of treatment. However, that may not always be easy since insect stings are frequently unanticipated and allergic foods are often hidden in a variety of different preparations. A consultation with an allergist is vital in helping you identify the trigger(s) and providing you with information and instruction on how to best avoid them. You will learn how to use emergency kits and how to become prepared for any reaction in the future.\nThese are three situations in which preventive treatment might be offered by the allergist.\n- Allergy shots may be suggested to some people with wasp, yellow jacket, hornet, honey bee, or fire ant reactions. This form of treatment gives 98% protection against the first four insect reactions, though somewhat less protection against fire ant reactions.\n- Pre-medication is most helpful in preventing anaphylaxis from x-ray dyes. Alternative dyes that are less likely to cause reactions may be available.\n- Desensitization to problematic medications is often effective. This process is accomplished by gradually increasing the amount of the medication given under controlled conditions. Sensitivities to penicillin, sulfa drugs, and insulin have been successfully treated in this way.\nAnyone known to be at risk for anaphylaxis should wear a Medic-Alert bracelet that clearly states the allergic trigger, the risk of anaphylaxis, and the availability of an epinephrine kit.\nPeople with anaphylaxis to medications should take new medications by mouth whenever possible since the risk of anaphylaxis is higher with injections.\nSince avoidance is not fail safe, a person at risk for an anaphylactic reaction must be adequately prepared in an emergency to handle a reaction. It is recommended that everyone at risk carry epinephrine injection kits designed for self-administration. These kits are available by prescription only and come in two forms:\n- Epi-pen is a spring-loaded automatic syringe that delivers a predetermined dose (0.3mg) when the tip is pressed hard for several seconds. An Epi-pen junior is available for children under 33 pounds and contains half of the dose.\n- Ana-kit contains a preloaded syringe and needles with two 0.3mg doses of epinephrine. These are injected under the skin or into the muscle of the thigh. An antihistamine, alcohol swab, and a tourniquet are included in the kit.\nHere are some important points to remember regarding the kits:\n- Ask you doctor to explain the use of the kit carefully and practice with the demonstrator kit.\n- Check expiration dates and replace outdated kits.\n- Keep kits out of direct sunlight, which may effect the drug.\n- Additional kits should be brought to school or work.\n- Always have kits with you or readily available.\n- Make sure that your friends, relatives, exercise buddies, and co-workers are aware of your condition and know what to do in case of a reaction.\nAnaphylaxis At A Glance\n- Anaphylaxis is the most severe allergic reaction and is potentially life threatening.\n- Anaphylaxis is rare. The vast majority of people will never have an anaphylactic reaction.\n- The most common causes of anaphylaxis include drugs, such as penicillin, insect stings, foods, x-ray dye, latex, and exercise.\n- The symptoms of anaphylaxis may vary from hives, tongue swelling, and vomiting, to shock.\n- If you are at risk, avoidance is the best form of treatment.\n- If you have a history of serious allergic reaction, always have an epinephrine kit available - it could save your life.\nDiseases and Conditions Center\nAll ArmMed Media material is provided for information only and is neither advice nor a substitute for proper medical care.

Rationale: Most food allergy related fatalities occur in those with unstable asthma.\n- Underlying mast cell disorders (e.g. systemic mastocytosis or elevated baseline serum tryptase concentrations) together with any previous systemic allergic reactions to insect stings, including patients undergoing venom immunotherapy.\n2. Sometimes recommended\nHistory of a generalised* allergic reaction with one or more of the following factors:\n- Teenagers and young adults with food allergy. While food allergy is most common in young children aged 5 years or less, the majority of recorded fatal reactions to foods (~90%) occur in teenagers and young adults. This may in part relate to greater risk taking behaviour in this age group, but may also reflect greater likelihood of accidental exposure to food allergens when eating away from home or while not under parental supervision.\n- Specific allergic triggers\n- Peanut, tree nuts and seafood. Fatal anaphylaxis may arise from any food, but most fatalities arise from food allergy that persists into adolescence and adult life (e.g. peanut, tree nut, sesame seed and seafood allergies). Allergic reactions to these foods may occur following ingestion of relatively small amounts, and the risk of reaction is unlikely to be reduced by cooking or food processing.\n- Generalised urticaria alone without anaphylaxis following insect stings (e.g. bee, wasp or jumper ant stings) or following tick bites is not a routine indication for adrenaline autoinjector prescription, but may be considered (in conjunction with allergen specific immunotherapy if available) in selected cases. Decisions regarding immunotherapy will take into consideration factors such as the risk of progression to anaphylaxis (based on follow-up studies), patient age (more likely in adults than children), co-morbidity (significant cardiorespiratory disease) or living or working in remote areas (where access to emergency medical care may be more problematic) or occupational (e.g. bee keeping) or even recreational exposure to stinging insects (e.g. hiking in areas where Jack Jumper ants are endemic).\n- Co-morbid conditions\n- Asthma. Unstable or moderate to severe, persistent asthma increases the risk of respiratory compromise in those allergic to food. Treatment to control asthma symptoms is important in this group (e.g. medication, allergen immunotherapy).\n- Cardiovascular disease (hypertension, ischaemic heart disease or arrhythmia) is associated with a relatively greater risk of fatal anaphylaxis from insect stings.\n- Systemic mastocytosis\nThis list is not comprehensive and if there is a concern, patients should be referred to a clinical immunology/allergy specialist for assessment.\n- Limited access to emergency medical care\n- Remote residential locations. In some remote residential locations (e.g. remote rural areas), access to medical care and early administration of adrenaline may not be possible unless an adrenaline autoinjector is provided to the patient or their carers for administration. It is important to distinguish this situation of permanent risk from those at short-lived risk (e.g. bushwalking, school camps).\n- Prolonged travel abroad. Consideration of temporary availability to patients considered at lower risk, who are travelling abroad may also be considered, where language barriers and lesser control over food preparation may increase the risk of accidental exposure and access to medical care may also be limited.\nThese factors should be considered when deciding whether an adrenaline autoinjector is prescribed, as they are known risk factors for more severe or fatal allergic reactions.\n3. Not normally recommended\n- Asthma without a history of anaphylaxis or generalised allergic reactions.\n- If known allergen can be successfully avoided (e.g. drug allergy, latex allergy). Under these circumstances the wearing of medical identification jewellery is strongly recommended.\n- Oral allergy syndrome - The likelihood of progression to anaphylaxis is very low.\n- Elevated specific IgE only (positive blood or skin allergy test) without a history of clinical reactivity - A positive allergy test (regardless of why performed) without a history strongly suggestive of allergy is an indication for specialist allergy assessment, which will include assessment of the risk of allergy and anaphylaxis, and sometimes include challenge testing.\n- Family (rather than personal) history of anaphylaxis or allergy - Whilst the risk for allergic disease such as asthma, allergic rhinitis and atopic eczema is in part inherited, there is not a substantial genetic contribution to food, sting or drug allergy risk, and the risk of anaphylaxis is not inherited.\n- Local reactions to insect stings in adults and children - Follow up studies demonstrate that these rarely progress to anaphylaxis.\n- Generalised skin rash (only) to bee or wasp stings in children - Follow up studies of subsequent bee stings in children presenting with local reactions or generalised skin rash (only) show that these children are at a very low risk of experiencing anaphylaxis with subsequent stings.\n- Resolved food allergy - This should be established by a clinical immunology/allergy specialist.\n- Isolated angioedema - The risk of fatal angioedema (unrelated to food or insect sting allergy, hereditary angioedema or use of ACE inhibitor medication) is very low. If there is a concern, patients should be referred to a clinical immunology/allergy specialist for assessment.\nAdrenaline autoinjector dose recommendations\nAdrenaline autoinjectors available in Australia and New Zealand include EpiPen Jr (0.15 mg) and EpiPen (0.3 mg).\nChildren less than 10kg\nAdrenaline autoinjectors are not usually recommended for children less than 10kg as the risk of fatal anaphylaxis in children this age is very low. While the ‘optimal’ dose of adrenaline is unknown there is a risk that the lower dose adrenaline autoinjector could provide a significant overdose. However, ASCIA does not recommend the use of adrenaline ampoules and syringes for children less than 10kg as they are inappropriate for non-medical settings (e.g. childcare). Even if they are administered by ‘trained’ non-medical personnel (e.g. parents) there may be a risk of a serious dosing error.\nIf there is a concern regarding the requirement for an adrenaline autoinjector for an infant under 10kg, patients should be referred to a clinical immunology/allergy specialist for assessment. The issues should be discussed with the parents based on a risk assessment. Where it is felt that it is essential for emergency adrenaline to be prescribed for a child less than 10kg, the risk of administering a ‘fixed’ overdose via an EpiPen Jr is considered to be lower than the risk of a dose error with an adrenaline ampoule and syringe.\nEpiPen Jr (0.15 mg) is recommended for children between 10 and 20kg**\nChildren over 20kg and adults**\nEpiPen (0.3 mg) is recommended for adults and children over 20kg**\n** These dosage recommendations are based on expert opinion regarding recommended dose for weight and clinical trials of injected adrenaline in children, which is currently at slight variance with the product information leaflet.\n- available on PBS authority prescription in Australia\n- not currently Pharmac funded in New Zealand\n- also available without prescription in Australia and New Zealand\nNumber of devices to be prescribed\nIn children, two devices per prescription are routinely recommended. This allows one device to be with the patient (or for parental use at home for younger children) and one device to be available for use at childcare or school. Additional devices (if desired) may be purchased privately without prescription in Australia, since more than two devices at a time are not PBS subsidised in Australia. There is currently no Pharmac subsidy for adrenaline autoinjectors in New Zealand therefore all devices need to be purchased privately.\nIn adults and older high school students, one or two devices may be prescribed at a time. A decision to prescribe one or two devices to adults will be influenced by a number of factors (e.g. previous severity, access to medical care) but two devices are strongly recommended in those with:\n- Previous hypotensive or near fatal anaphylaxis;\n- Need for more than one adrenaline dose to treat previous anaphylaxis episodes;\n- Limited access to medical care (e.g. travel or residence in remote areas, perhaps overseas travel in some circumstances;\n- Patients with systemic mastocytosis; and\n- Where high body mass indicates that the routine 0.3mg adrenaline dose will provide an insufficient dose for adequate treatment.\nAnaphylaxis Management Plan\nAn adrenaline autoinjector should only be prescribed within the context of a comprehensive Anaphylaxis Management Plan that includes the following:\n1. Referral to a clinical immunology/allergy specialist\nReview by a clinical immunology/allergy specialist should occur to:\n- Ascertain if the correct trigger(s) have been identified;\n- Determine whether the allergy persists;\n- Advise on specific management, including suitability for allergen immunotherapy (if available); and\n- Advise on co-factors that may increase the risk of more serious reactions (e.g. use of beta blockers, NSAID, exercise, asthma control).\n2. Identification of anaphylaxis trigger(s)\nThis should include a comprehensive history, clinical examination, appropriate use and interpretation of allergy testing and under some circumstances, deliberate challenge to prove or disprove allergy.\n3. Education on the avoidance of trigger(s)\nThis is particularly important with food allergy induced anaphylaxis.\n4. Provision of an ASCIA Action Plan for Anaphylaxis (emergency response plan)\nThis documents the following;\n- Name of child/adult;\n- Confirmed allergens;\n- Parent/guardian contact details;\n- Symptoms and signs indicating when to use the adrenaline autoinjector;\n- Instructions on how to use the adrenaline autoinjector; and\n- Doctor's name and signature.\n5. Appropriate follow-up\nYearly review by a patient’s medical practitioner (normally their GP) should occur to:\n- Review any allergic reactions that have occurred since their last review;\n- Examining co-factors (such as poorly controlled or persistent asthma) that may increase the risk of more serious reactions;\n- Examining the need for the provision of an adrenaline autoinjector for those who do not currently have one available;\n- Provide re-education on adrenaline autoinjector use (using a trainer device) including information about positioning of patient (i.e. not standing or walking when experiencing anaphylaxis);\n- Renew ASCIA Action Plan;\n- Provide ASCIA Travel Plan if required;\n- Ensure the adrenaline autoinjector has not expired; and\n- Determine whether specialist review is required to ascertain if the allergy persists, new allergies have developed or if review is required.\nAny acute onset of hypotension or bronchospasm or upper airway obstruction where anaphylaxis is considered possible, even if typical skin features are absent.\nAny acute onset illness with typical skin features (urticarial rash or erythema/flushing, and/or angioedema), with respiratory compromise due to bronchospasm or significant upper tongue/throat swelling and/or cardiovascular symptoms. In those with severe allergic reactions to insect stings, the presence of severe abdominal pain and vomiting may also indicate anaphylaxis, since their presence correlates with the presentation of hypotension in this group.\nSymptoms/signs of respiratory/cardiovascular involvement include:\nSwelling of tongue\nSwelling/tightness in throat\nDifficulty talking and/or hoarse voice\nWheeze or persistent cough\nLoss of consciousness/collapse\nPale and floppy (in young children)\nLoss of vision\nA generalised allergic reaction is a characterised by one or more symptoms or signs of skin and/or\ngastrointestinal tract involvement without respiratory and/or cardiovascular involvement:\n***Note: While vomiting and abdominal pain are common features of mild to moderate allergic reactions to food, they are signs of a severe allergic reaction to insect stings and tick bites.\nAdrenaline (epinephrine) autoinjector:\nAdrenaline rapidly reverses the effects of anaphylaxis and should be considered the first line treatment for anaphylaxis.\n- Are spring-loaded automatic injector devices for emergency/first aid treatment of anaphylaxis.\n- Contain a single fixed dose of adrenaline to be administered intramuscularly for safer, rapid absorption of adrenaline.\n- Should be administered into the outer mid-thigh muscle and can be administered through a single layer of clothing (not pockets or seams).\nASCIA is the peak professional body of clinical immunology and allergy specialists in Australia and New Zealand - ABN: 45 615 521 452; ACN: 608 798 241 – www.allergy.org.au\nContent updated April 2016"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:d2365cc6-fdf0-41ac-94c5-7ecaee5aa71c>","<urn:uuid:cf27dcc9-7d15-493e-a83a-9eb6e20fb5e5>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How does art instruction at the primary level compare to art education for students aged 8-12 in terms of teaching approaches and requirements?","answer":"At the primary level, art instruction is primarily the responsibility of regular classroom teachers, though visiting teachers or artists may sometimes provide instruction. Teachers should have basic background knowledge in visual arts and appropriate methodology. In contrast, for students aged 8-12, the instruction becomes more sophisticated, focusing on broader range of media, tools, and techniques. Students work with more complex concepts like perspective, proportion, and color schemes. They experiment with lines to indicate emotion, learn about depth and form through hatching techniques, and work with monochromatic color schemes. While primary instruction is more general, the 8-12 curriculum emphasizes technical and observational skills development, helping students recognize that mistakes can become creative opportunities.","context":["From Joanna Black\nCanadian Society for Education through Art\nOverview of Art Education in Canada\nThe Canadian Society for Education through Art is the national art education association representing art educators within Canada. It is a voluntary association founded in Quebec City in 1955, and is the only Canadian national organization that brings together visual art educators, gallery educators and others with similar interests and concerns. Membership represents all levels of education: elementary, secondary, college/university, ministries of education, art galleries/museums, and community education.\n1. Description of Visual Arts Education in Canada\nCanada, a country located in North America, is comprised of thirteen provinces and territories including Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Newfoundland/Labrador, Northwest Territories, Nova Scotia, Nunavut, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Quebec, Saskatchewan, and the Yukon. It has a population of approximately 33 million people and is a bilingual country (English and French) in terms of its political laws, policies, and constitution. Visual arts education within the public school system falls within the purveyance of the Canadian provinces and territories.\nThe school system has many levels: (1) numerous young children enter an early optional childhood education program at the nursery level. Students enter the system at the primary level and it is mandatory that they remain in school until they reach the age of 16. Canadian citizens (2) receive early childhood education (approximately ages 5-8); middle yearseducation (from about ages 9-13); and secondary education (ages range from 14-18 or 19 years old). Within this structure visual art education is primarily taught in the early years and middle years by generalists although it is advocated that specialists teach at the higher level. During the senior years visual arts are for the most part taught by specialists. The provinces and territories have curricula specific to their populations in visual arts education at the early, middle and senior year levels.\nSome Canadian students specialize at the secondary level in visual art education and move on to study at art schools within faculties and departments of education in a wide variety of programs ranging from traditional visual arts, and graphic arts, to new media arts. Postsecondary education at the university and college levels is optional throughout the country and students must pay for their education at universities and colleges.\n2. Role of Art Education (Quoted from The CSEA National Policy pages 26-27).\n“The National Policy of for art education in Canada established by the Canadian Society for Education through Art advocates a number of steps to create and maintain educational programs which have integrity and are accountable to their clientele. Therefore, the National Policy provides a foundation for the development of specific guidelines. The following guideline addresses the issue of teaching art…”\n“Instruction in art at the primary level should be the responsibility of the regular classroom teacher. There may be times however, when visiting teachers or artists could provide art instruction. Although individual teacher may choose to allocate definite periods of time to instruction in art, teachers should be encouraged to provide extended periods of time for large art projects. All art teachers should know the art education guidelines or programs of study required by law to be taught in their jurisdiction. Recognizing this, careful attention should be given to instruction of visual art concepts and skills appropriate for the primary child. In order to provide adequate art instruction at this level, teachers should have a basic background knowledge in visual arts and in appropriate art education methodology…”\n“Instruction in art at the upper elementary level should be taught by an art specialist who may or may not be the regular classroom teacher. This is necessary if the art program is to have integrity as a discipline. Teachers will need to be concerned with theory related to history, criticism, and aesthetics, while also providing expert instruction in a variety of studio activities. To determine the substantive nature of curriculum content for each grade level, teachers should follow the provincial art education guidelines. Whenever possible, at least one hour of discipline specific art instruction should be given weekly. In order to provide quality art instruction at this level, teachers should have the equivalent of a Bachelor in Fine Arts or a Bachelor of Education degree with a major in art education…”\n“Instruction in art at the secondary level should be taught by an art specialist who has the equivalent of a Bachelor in Fine Art or a Bachelor of Education degree with a major in art education. Teachers should teach from the provincial and local art education guidelines while making sure that recommendations made in the National Policy are followed. In this way, authentic art content will be taught. Although local guidelines will likely prescribe the amount of time for art instruction, ideally 60 to 90 consecutive minutes should be allowed for studio production and art history. …”\n“Teachers and their school-based administration should invite practicing artists to share and discuss their art with students. Provincially developed artist-in-residence programs should be used whenever possible in order to enhance the school program. School staff or parent-teacher organizations should also consider purchasing original works of student or professional art to hang in the school. Students need to be exposed to original art whenever possible…School-based and district-level administrators should actively encourage art teachers to attend local, provincial, and national conferences in art education in order to be kept informed of current developments in art education. Local boards of education should be strongly encouraged to appoint local supervisors or consultants of art who would assist the classroom or specialist art teacher in the organization of the art program, broadening the scope and knowledge of teachers through workshops, seminars, visits, demonstration lessons and other in-service activities. “\n“At all levels of public school education, teachers should be granted preparation time to display art, research issues and ideas, prepare lessons, consult with artists and craftspersons, and evaluation the curriculum. In this way, the teacher will be involved in lifelong learning and ongoing professional activities necessary for the implementation of a quality art programs.”\nCanadian art educators recognize art education as a fundamental part of human development and growth. Art educators focus on international, national, regional and local content. We are a multicultural country in which art educators examine national concerns that have relevance for specific cultural communities. We promote mutual knowledge, appreciation and respect between cultures and their art forms. In this country we offer a diversity of visual art programs that follow curricula written by the provincial jurisdictions from coast to coast. These vary in terms of emphasis on a variety of different forms of production, art historical content, critical content, and appreciation.\nCanada is a vast nation with wide expanses of land. This results in some isolation between people. Sometimes it is difficult to hire trained visual art educators in remote country schools. Furthermore, as a result of art education being under the juristication of provinces and territories, it is not as unified as ones created and controlled on a national level.\n5. Approaches and Content: Traditional and Contemporary, Manual and Conceptual in Canadian Art\nArt educators teach a wide range of art practices from traditional drawing and painting embodied in works like the Italian Renaissance masters to Installation Art and Performance Art.\nCanadian art teachers are expected to teach about a wide range of artists and art historical periods. These range from Prehistoric Art and the Gothic Era to Impressionists, and the 20th and 21st century art movements. Conceptual Art is also part of the curricula regarding art education in Canada. Art educators teach about such past luminaries as Marcel Duchamp and his creations, “readymades”. They include newer movements as well, incorporating ideas from, for example, such video works made by artists like the Nam June Paik to contemporary digital artists like Christian Marclay.\nOverall Canadian art educators embrace the past while including and connecting this to present art movements, artists, and concepts. Art educators are expected to teach children about the diversity of art ranging from a variety of cultural contexts and international art historical movements. We address diversity in terms of culture and in terms of gender (art education is inclusive of female artists). Moreover, we teach about hegemony in relation to political structures and how they affect art worlds, art production and artists. Lastly, Canadian art educators teach art education within an international context.\nIn Canada many students graduate from secondary school, train in arts at the postsecondary level, and follow successful international, national and local art careers. Examples of respected visual artists who are internationally recognized are Michael Snow, the Toronto artist who works in traditional art and media arts; Jeff Wall, the innovative photographer from Vancouver; and new media arts Janet Cardiff and her partner Georges Bures, located in the Canadian Prairies. Others pursue art related careers in diverse disciplines. An example is the renowned filmmaker James Cameron, creator of Titanic and Avatar who is now working in Los Angeles. Canadian artists have made an impact internationally in terms of traditional and nontraditional visual arts and its related fields such as documentary films and animation. In the future, we see opportunity for development in all aspects of visual arts education ranging from training students in traditional arts to new media productions and from art history to further developing our youth’s appreciation in the visual arts field.","Overview of the art curriculum for students from 8 to 12 years old\nWithin the context of this programme, students use a broader range of subject matter and media, tools, materials, processes and techniques, to produce works of art. They grow more sophisticated in depicting movement, spatial relationships, and emotions.\nThe working environment is very positive and supportive of students’ efforts, because although they possess increased manual dexterity, their skills may not yet allow them to reach their own expectations in producing increasingly elaborate work. Therefore, focus is given to the growth of technical and observational skills. The idea is to help students recognize that mistakes can be turned into creative opportunities.\nStudents use their knowledge of the elements and principles of design to solve artistic problems and analyse works of art. They generate and develop visual ideas in response to a variety of motivations, using imagination, observation, and a study of artists’ works, and incorporate into their art ideas gained from sources such as independent reading.\nStudents also explore and describe how different media influence the communication and interpretation of ideas in their own and others’ work. They analyse and evaluate an artists’ intent. They also analyse and describe how art-making processes and procedures clarify meaning and intentions in their own and observe how artists tell stories and create mood in their work. Students use their growing analytical and evaluative skills to investigate the purpose and significance of objects, images, and art works in past and present cultures. They also examine the contexts in which they were or are made, viewed, and valued.\nDrawing: Lines, Shapes and Space\nStudents experiment with lines to indicate emotion. The work with contour lines, lines of various weight and repetition to create visual rhythm. They learn how to create depth and form using linear and curved hatching and cross-hatching. They explore shading and shadows to create the illusion of depth.\nStudents are also introduced to proportion. They are taught the relationship of the size and shape of the parts of a figure to the whole figure; the scale of one object compared to its surroundings. They are initiated to gesture drawings and implied lines for movement and depth.\nStudents learn about perspective and the lines that direct the viewer’s attention and how lines can create the illusion of force and movement.\nThey use the focal point to build-up a centre of interest and one-point perspective. They observe and experiment with the changes in shapes, depending on the angle or point of view, as well as positive and negative shapes. They also experiment with the grouping of shapes and abstract shapes and forms, as well as shapes organized in a pattern showing radial symmetry or in a mosaic. Students learn about positive and negative space in art work, the diminishing perspective in various contexts and the variation in size to create the illusion of depth. They experiment with symmetrical and asymmetrical shapes and forms in font and image, as well as with convex, concave and non-objective shapes. They arrange elements of design to create the impression of equality in weight or importance.\nColour and Painting\nStudents experiment with monochromatic colour schemes and colour emphasis through variations in value, contrast and intensity. They work with complementary colours, hue, intensity by dulling, neutralizing by mixing the colour with a small amount of its complementary hue. They explore gradations of value to create an illusion of depth and shading. Students further experiment with repetition and rhythm by using a variety of media to repeat colour (as well as shape) and shape in patterns (randomly, in alternation and regularly). Students use colour concepts to\ncreating balance and study, for instance, how “neutral” colours appear lighter in “weight” than dark or brilliant colours and how warm colours seem to expand, whereas cool colours seem to contract.\nStudents work on texture elaboration, for instance by embossing, piercing, pinching, pressing, scoring, scraping and experiment with texture quality (e.g., matte, sheen) and low relief.\nModeling and Construction\nStudents learn how to make basic 3D shapes and figures (human, animals and other organic forms) using a variety of media: clay, clay polymer, salt dough, paper, cardboard, papier mâché.\nArt History & Aesthetics\nIn this module, students explore the art styles of ancient civilisations and modern cultures, both ethnic and Western. Classes are divided into smaller groups and like art historians, each group investigates the art of a particular time and culture, using a world map. Subjects range from Ancient Egypt, Ancient Greece or China, Maya, Byzantium or Aborigen to name a few. Students choose artifacts and artworks which they think best represents the art of the culture. Pieces can be represented by student-made posters, photographs, drawings, and models of the artworks. They write a general overview giving a brief description of the culture and the major aspects of the art style they are studying. Students are also required to explain why some forms or styles appeared when and where they did, for instance pyramids in Egyptian and Mayan civilisations. Students present their choices to the rest of the class. It is also possible for the class to organise an exhibition."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:77a38d89-300a-4e54-a518-46c7d2b19fa4>","<urn:uuid:1d7d1fac-a99d-4f02-9662-c8fbae076baa>"],"error":null}
{"question":"As a psychology student, how do research topics in intergroup relations compare to studies on veterans' mental health?","answer":"Research in intergroup relations focuses on how different groups interact, examining contact between groups, power dynamics, and prejudice reduction. It studies how group memberships influence self-perception and feelings toward other groups. In contrast, veterans' mental health research examines specific conditions like PTSD, TBI, and substance use disorders, focusing on how these conditions affect cognitive functioning, psychological wellbeing, and quality of life. The research also investigates how cognitive abilities may be compromised by these disorders to improve diagnosis and treatment approaches.","context":["Linda R. Tropp is Professor of Psychology and Director of the Psychology of Peace and Violence Program at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Her research concerns how members of different groups approach and experience contact with each other, and how group differences in power or status affect views of and expectations for cross-group relations. She also studies how group memberships can be important aspects of the self, and how individuals' identities as group members can influence their feelings about themselves, their groups, their social experiences, and their feelings toward members of other groups.\nProfessor Tropp has received the Allport Intergroup Relations Prize from the Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues for her research on intergroup contact, the Erik Erikson Early Career Award for distinguished research contributions from the International Society of Political Psychology, and the McKeachie Early Career Teaching Award from the Society for the Teaching of Psychology.

We study how cognitive functioning (e.g., memory, attention, problem-solving, decision-making) impacts wellbeing in those with addiction and other mental health disorders. We hope to improve addiction treatments so that those who enter treatment are getting the best treatments for their individual cognitive risk factors. We are currently conducting research on the relationship between craving and neuropsychological functioning in a population of non-psychotic substance dependent individuals.\nI AM accepting students (PsyD and PhD) for this research program.\nVeterans are returning from combat zones at higher rates than before with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, Traumatic Brain Injury, and Substance Use Disorder.

{"question":"How does international response to LGBT discrimination differ between Uganda's anti-LGBT legislation and India's transgender prison reforms?","answer":"The international response to Uganda's anti-LGBT legislation was strong and action-oriented, with the US threatening to reduce $485 million in aid, and Denmark, Netherlands, and Norway freezing aid. The World Bank even suspended a $90 million loan. In contrast, India's reforms for transgender persons in prisons, implemented through the 2019 Transgender Persons Act and subsequent prison advisory, have been viewed as progressive steps without international pressure or aid consequences. These reforms include specific provisions for transgender inmates' dignity and rights, representing a more internally-driven change rather than one influenced by international pressure.","context":["Why should the UK care about the rights of LGBT citizens in the Commonwealth?\nOne of the main aims of the Commonwealth is to ‘improve the lives of all peoples of the Commonwealth’. This has not been the case though for LGBT Commonwealth citizens. Same-sex sexual activity remains illegal in 42 out of 53 Commonwealth states, with two states applying the death penalty, another using flogging as punishment and five others imposing life sentences.\nThis article will focus on the recent developments in Uganda, where legislation has been passed that demonstrates these discriminatory issues within the Commonwealth. The law recently passed allows for life imprisonment for ‘aggravated homosexuality’, and up to seven years in prison for ‘attempting to commit homosexuality’ and the ‘promotion of homosexuality’, among others. However, it must not be forgotten that this is a regular feature within the Commonwealth and Uganda is simply one example out of those 42 countries.\nThere have been some attempts to tackle the discrimination that LGBT people face in these countries by the Commonwealth – though it remains distinctly lacking. Ben Summerskill of Stonewall described as a ‘historic step forward’ changes to the charter where it states that ‘[human rights] are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated and cannot be implemented selectively. We are implacably opposed to all forms of discrimination, whether rooted in gender, race, colour, creed, political belief or other grounds’. However, this is simply not the case. The Commonwealth has failed to specifically implement a section for LGBT people, who face extreme persecution, whilst allowing religious freedom to be specifically protected. The hollowness of the charter is demonstrated by the fact that countries such as Uganda are passing ever stricter laws with little rebuke, especially from the UK, and others remain opposed to removing them. The situation is effectively summed up by Patrick Strudwick: ‘to refrain from specification is to collude with silence’.\nWhy should we be so involved in the affairs of other countries? The main argument of the Ugandan government stems from outdated scientific arguments and the application of ‘cultural relativism’ in such situations. One Ugandan government spokesman said that the president ‘wants to sign it with the full witness of the international media to demonstrate Uganda’s independence in the face of Western pressure and provocation’. This article does not have the space to discuss whether human rights are a purely ‘Western’ phenomenon or the notion of cultural relevance, but regardless of the merits of this argument, it’s not one that even Uganda sticks to and so can be rubbished on that basis alone. In the president’s own address, he cites previous British colonial law as being one of the factors that puts him in favour of such discriminatory legislation. If their government is so against Western involvement, then surely the justification of such discrimination using colonial laws is a major contradiction in itself?\nThe UK should feel an additional moral obligation in tackling such discriminatory laws in countries where their own laws are still based upon, encouraged or justified by our colonial law. Late last year, the Indian Supreme Court reversed a High Court decision decriminalising homosexuality. The legislation reinstated by the decision was Section 377, a colonial law that is 153 years old, which states that a same-sex relationship is an ‘unnatural offence’ and can be punishable by a prison sentence of 10 years. The UK, despite being historically responsible for the law, remained silent on the decision.\nHowever, there are some examples of Commonwealth nations not being as vehemently opposed to LGBT rights. One rare example is South Africa, which was the first African country to bring in same-sex marriage in 2006. More fundamentally, in Chapter 2, Section 9 of its constitution, South Africa provides specific protection against discrimination and equality before the law on the basis of sexual orientation. The price of supporting LGBT people is a small one; much smaller than the time and energy put into creating legislation, enforcing those laws and imprisoning those people. If some of these nations spent as much time focusing on the suffering of their people rather than making scapegoats of minority groups then quite a bit would be accomplished, one is to imagine.\nSecretary of State John Kerry compared Uganda’s laws to that of anti-semitic laws passed by Nazi Germany and Apartheid-era South Africa. President Obama described the bill himself as being ‘a step backward’ and saying it will complicate the ‘valued’ relationship between the two nations. It isn’t just powerful rhetoric either; Kerry has stated that the US may reduce or cut off aid, an amount reported at $485 million, with Kerry speaking to the president directly on the issue to continue demands to remove the laws. Denmark, the Netherlands and Norway have followed suit and frozen aid to the Ugandan government too; even the World Bank has suspended a loan of $90m to Uganda.\nCompare this action to Foreign Secretary William Hague’s own, rather lacklustre criticism, of being ‘saddened and disappointed’ by Uganda’s decision. UK aid to Uganda has not been cut, despite threats from David Cameron last year, or even fresh threats made in the light of this new law. Our own government seems to care more about issues such as corruption than it does the rights of LGBT commonwealth citizens; in 2012, the UK government cut off aid to Uganda, around £100m, after the exposure of huge governmental corruption. The UK must do more, in terms of rhetoric and in terms of action, if it hopes to improve the lives of these people. It has shown it can be tough on other issues, why not this one?\nIn addition to this, the UK can spend so much time and energy on the Commonwealth Games, which Scotland will be hosting this year, yet so little in defending fundamental rights. One objective of Glasgow 2014 is to improve the lives of children in the commonwealth through UNICEF’s programmes; other objectives of the Commonwealth include efforts to tackle HIV/AIDS. What is the point in protecting these children when some, undoubtedly, will grow up to will face the death penalty, prison, torture or die of HIV/AIDS out of fear the government will persecute them for seeking treatment, simply due to their sexual orientation? Failure to tackle this discrimination outright will lead to other positive aspects of the Commonwealth being undermined; if the UK wants to realise the goals of equality and improvement in the lives of its Commonwealth citizens it must do all it can to fight the toxic colonial legacy it has left behind in law and demonstrate its commitment by being tougher in its rhetoric and actions.\nWritten by Michael Higgs, Edited by Simon Renwick","Recognition of Transgender Persons in Indian Prisons\n- 12 Jan 2022\n- 7 min read\nWhy in News\nRecently, the Union Home Ministry sent an advisory to Heads of Prisons in the States/UTs to ensure privacy, dignity of the third gender inmates.\n- According to a National Crime Records Bureau, there were 70 transgender prisoners in jails across the country in 2020.\n- The advisory was issued in light of the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019, which came into effect from January 2020.\n- Infrastructure in Prisons:\n- Separate enclosures or wards and separate toilets and shower facilities for transmen and transwomen to preserve the right to privacy and dignity of the inmates.\n- Respect Self-identity:\n- The self-identity of transgender persons must be respected at all times while conducting admission procedures, medical examination, frisking, clothing, requisitioning of a police escort, treatment and care inside prisons.\n- Prisons to facilitate the process of acquiring the transgender identity certificate under the transgender persons law if such a request is made.\n- Search Protocol:\n- Searches should be carried out by a person of their preferred gender or by a trained medical professional or a paramedic trained in conducting searches.\n- The person conducting the search must ensure the safety, privacy and dignity of the person being searched.\n- Admission in Prison:\n- The prison admission register may be suitably revised to include “transgender” as a category other than male and female gender.\n- A similar provision may be made in the Prison Management System in maintaining electronic records.\n- Access to Healthcare:\n- Transgender inmates should have equal right to healthcare, without any discrimination on grounds of their gender identity.\n- Communication with outside World:\n- They must be allowed an opportunity to interact with their family members, relatives, friends and legal advisers and after-care planning by probation, welfare or rehabilitation officers.\n- Training and Sensitisation of Prison Personnel:\n- It should be done for developing an understanding of gender identity, human rights, sexual orientation and legal frameworks for transgender persons.\n- Similar awareness must also be spread among other prisoners.\nMajor Initiatives Related to Transgender\n- Transgender Persons Act, 2019:\n- The Act defines a transgender person as one whose gender does not match the gender assigned at birth. It includes transmen and trans-women, persons with intersex variations, gender-queers, and persons with socio-cultural identities, such as kinnar and hijra.\n- Judgements of the Supreme Court:\n- National Legal Services Authority (NALSA) v. Union of India, 2014: The SC declared transgender people to be a 'third gender'.\n- Read down the Provisions of Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code (2018): The SC decriminalised same-sex relationships.\n- Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Rules, 2020:\n- The Central Government made the rules under the powers conferred by the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019.\n- National Portal for Transgender Persons was launched under in consonance with the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Rules, 2020.\n- Scheme of ‘Shelter Home for Transgender Persons:\n- To provide safe and secure shelter to transgender persons in need, the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment is setting up 'Garima Greh' shelter homes for them.\nPrisons Act and Transpersons\n- In India, the Prisons Act, 1894, is the central legislation regulating the administration of prisons.\n- The Act majorly differentiates prisoners convicted under civil law from those convicted under criminal law.\n- Unfortunately, the Act does not even recognise sexual minorities based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity (SOGI) as a different class of prisoners.\n- It only separates prisoners into the categories of women, young offenders, undertrials, convicts, civil prisoners, detenues and high-security prisoners.\n- The NALSA judgment, while extending constitutional protection to trans persons under Articles 14, 15, and 21, directs states to make policies on their legal and socio-economic rights.\n- This extends to trans prisoners as well, since prisons and their administration is a state subject.\n- Even though the directions given in the NALSA judgment constitute the law of the land, there is still a requirement to bring forth changes in the present laws.\n- The Prisons Act, however, allows the prison authorities to follow procedures that are strictly gender-binary.\n- These procedures not only challenge the validity of the legislation but also result in a kind of torture and degrading treatment being inflicted upon trans people inside prisons.\n- All of this is substantiated by a report titled ‘Lost Identity: Transgender Persons Inside Indian Prisons‘ by the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative (CHRI).\n- This report sheds light on issues faced by Transgender persons confined in Indian prisons.\n- The colonial Prisons Act has become obsolete and it fails to be the touchstone of constitutional morality which ushers for a pluralistic and inclusive society.\n- Since constitutional morality is something that has to be cultivated keeping in mind the evolving nature of the law and the rights of the people, the present law falls short of any such progressive realisation of the rights of sexual minorities.\n- Awareness and documentation are two important tools to address the reforms in reference to sexual minorities, especially trans prisoners.\n- Thus, the CHRI is one step in that process which advocates for a gender-fluid approach for the treatment of transgender prisoners.\n- The CHRI’s recommendations should be considered by the Union government to bring a ‘model policy’ on the special needs of trans prisoners, through a consultative process with the members of the trans community, to honour the mandate of the NALSA judgment."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:640b97cf-bca7-40f4-a519-997538ce0b71>","<urn:uuid:7acef66d-4ede-4572-bad7-7b83f6b89a6c>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What role does data collection play in U.S. soybean farming, and how does it benefit Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG) companies?","answer":"U.S. soybean farmers collect extensive data through technology-enabled farm equipment, along with industry research and checkoff-funded projects. This data helps CPG companies improve their sustainability stories and protect their reputation. The challenge lies in connecting data sources and aligning them to share information with buyers in a way they can easily communicate with their customers.","context":["Consumer packaged goods (CPG) companies across the globe are continually looking deeper into their supply chains for responsible and sustainable sourcing opportunities. They are looking for suppliers that share their values, and they need information to show consumers that they are a brand worth purchasing and trusting.\nThe U.S. soybean industry collects an enormous amount of data about how we run our business, from the field to the market. This information, in the proper format, can help CPG and food companies improve their sustainability stories. Given the right partnerships, the U.S. Soy sustainability platform can help food companies protect their reputation and grow their businesses.\nThis report provides a broad scan of the current U.S. Soy industry as it impacts international soybean purchasers and guides the work of the United Soybean Board and U.S. Soybean Export Council. Each target area section provides a summary of the market condition and considers challenges and opportunities identified for meal, oil and sustainability. In this section, our focus is on sustainability.\nU.S. SOY SUSTAINABILITY\nSustainability started as an environmental stewardship movement based on the concept of using natural resources responsibly to preserve them for future generations. Initially, concerns centered around water use, emissions and waste. For our part, the responsibility of the soybean industry was in decreasing our inputs, water, fertilizers, fuel, pesticides, etc.\nHowever, this early definition of sustainability has evolved. Sustainability now includes deforestation, other biodiversity issues, land use rights and working conditions.\nWhile our competitors are struggling with some of these issues on a global scale, for U.S. Soy, our challenges are more localized. For example, one U.S. growing region may have requirements for a watershed area or a protected habitat for a local species. But generally speaking, sustainability is where U.S. Soy has a competitive advantage.\nU.S. farmers have long embraced environmental best practices on their farms to lower costs and for the value it gave to their products, their land and future generations of their own families. Many U.S. soybean farms have been handed down from one generation to the next, each generation having a responsibility to use resources wisely to protect them and ensure the land’s viability for decades to come.\nThis commitment to responsible farm practices is why our customers and end users choose U.S. Soy. They know that the U.S. Soy industry invests heavily in research and data to help us do more with less, growing soybeans more efficiently.\nOur data is critical to our buyers because the world is putting pressure on them to also create more with less throughout their supply chain. They need products and ingredients that help them support their story, and that’s where U.S. Soy has an advantage.\nCPGs need our help to tell the story. U.S. Soy can and will be a partner to help CPGs and other end users share their positive sustainability story.\nConsumers want to know where their food comes from, and they want assurance that the person who produced their food shares their values. They want to know their food producers care about the environment and in reducing their impact to make the world a better place for future generations. This is the story U.S. Soy can tell every day, and every day we’re working to make it an even better story.\nInvestments in programs like Take Action have the potential to make an incredible and positive impact. Take Action, a farmer-focused education platform designed to help farmers manage herbicide, fungicide and insect resistance, puts the power of knowledge and recommended best management practices into their hands when making purchases and planning decisions for the next planting season. Take Action is a program developed not because farmers were told to do it, but because it is good for the farmers, good for the land and good for the product.This is part of the sustainability story we have to tell.\nU.S. farmers have a lot of data — technology has allowed for many of the pieces of on-farm equipment to generate and track data like never before. Add to that the research and data we gather as an industry through checkoff-funded projects, and information is abundant. The challenge is how we use that data to not only improve the work we do but also how we share the data in a meaningful way. The data show how the improvements we are making as an industry, and from farm to farm, make U.S. Soy a sustainable, responsible choice.\nLooking ahead, U.S. Soy knows the value our data can have for CPGs as part of their sustainability stories. We’ll need to find better ways to connect data sources and have them align so it’s easier to share information with our buyers in a way they can easily communicate with their customers. We need to aggressively stay “tuned in” to the fast paceof technology and the potential impact on farms.\nIn the U.S., we are fortunate to have an exceptional infrastructure system as a competitive advantage, which includes extensive railways, waterways and byways. Efficient infrastructure reduces the impact transportation has on U.S. sustainability data. But our transportation system has been working very hard for many, many years. U.S. Soy remains committed to continuous improvement of our infrastructure system, which is critical to meeting the needs of U.S. Soy customers worldwide.\nU.S. Soy’s Story\nTrust has become quite a valuable part of thebrand and product.\nCPGs are looking for partners to defend their reputations. When we protect our reputation, we protect those who buy from us. When we reduce our environmental footprint, we reduce that of those who buy from us. We should be more aggressive in understanding the reputation and need of our end users and customers.\nOne trending practice leading international customers and CPGs to source soy from high-risk areas is the adoption of standards and certifications. There is a laundry list of them: RTRS, 2BS, ISCC and RSPO, etc. The certification programs provide rules and criteria farmers must follow. When followed, the certification story follows the chain of custody to the repository, and the end user receives assurance that what they receive is a sustainable product.\nAround the globe, U.S. sustainability is verified by the U.S. Soy Sustainability Assurance Protocol (SSAP), an aggregate, quantifiable third-party verification process for sustainable soybean production.1The SSAP provides assurance for international buyers who are seeking a verification of sustainability by ensuring a compliance with a national system of laws and regulations. With more than 95 percent of U.S. soybean farmers participating in SSAP, to date, more than 16 million tons of U.S. Soy has been certified.1The participation in the program is used to determine the percentage of the U.S. Soy crop that meets the SSAP criteria.\nU.S. Soy continues to build on this program by aggressively seeking partnerships and communicating the benefits of SSAP from grower to international soy buyers.\nU.S. soybean farmers committed to sustainability long before it became a buzzword for consumers. They didn’t tell their story because their farm management practices were natural and ingrained from generations before them. But with a global focus on environmental responsibility and lessening environmental impact and footprint, U.S. Soy is in a position to help international buyers, CPGs and others tell an incredible story of a commitment to doing more with less and being a good steward of resources."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:3b4081f1-121a-4c71-b478-12dd8652915e>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the documented benefits of mindfulness meditation for brain structure, and what are the potential risks and limitations of this practice?","answer":"Mindfulness meditation shows several documented benefits for brain structure. Studies reveal increased volume in the hippocampus (associated with memory), enhanced structural connectivity between brain regions, and more cortical folding. After just 8 weeks of meditation, practitioners show increased cortical grey matter density. Research also demonstrates improved white matter changes in the anterior cingulate gyrus after one month of practice, leading to better attention and self-regulation. However, there are important limitations and risks to consider. Meditation may not be suitable for everyone, as some individuals can experience negative side effects including paranoia, confusion, or loss of identity. While scientific research has not extensively documented adverse effects, historical texts mention potential hardships in contemplative practices. Additionally, mindfulness should not be viewed as a quick fix or panacea, as developing mindfulness skills requires longer than an eight-week course, and some participants report difficulties when realizing it is not a cure-all.","context":["‘Meditation’ is so general a word it is best defined by what it is not. Meditation now means a form of attention exercise for wellbeing. Mediation is not thinking through possibilities, judgements, opinions or even reacting to facts. The exercise is focusing on acceptance and being rather than on doing.\nInstead of the common belief that mediation is about control, which denotes suppressing thoughts, it means distancing your thoughts from the ordinary chatter of the mind. It is about encountering the self that we tend to become too focused upon, as merely a series of thoughts and images that do not need any labelling or fixing or any other problematic cause of stress.\nMeditation is about being as objective with the self as possible; to alter our flow of thoughts by playing a game with the mind – one where you practice relating to your thoughts and self generously, as though you were not you; but a friend. And as with any means of changing your habits brain and mind – it takes time. But time can, in a way, be added to our lives by the promising psychological benefits of meditation practice: the time spent on alleviating stress enables one to be more efficient and better at time management.\nThe point of meditation can be as diverse as experiencing oblique insights, blissful mind alteration, perceiving the world attentively. Even purely a letting-go into a relaxed free association. Meditation varies, there are innumerable kinds. The varieties include:\n· Widening awareness\nContemplating the world as a whole, and your humble place within it\nFocusing on a single object in the room or a single idea and coming back to it whenever the mind wanders.\n· Emotional Regulation\nSeparating oneself from negative self-chatter, the 300-1000 words the inner narrator narrates—labelling emotions as the peaks and troughs of being alive rather than definitive.\n· Emotional Compassion\nCompassion is good. Compassion for others is brilliant, and compassion for yourself is brilliant also.\n· Repetitive Movement\nPerforming an action again and again as occurs in Tai Chi, dance or similar activities can warp and relax our minds into being ‘in the zone’. What psychologists call ‘flow’ where time pleasurably flows by.\nSaying or chanting a phrase of encouragement or worship aloud again-and-again. For example, in Kritan Kriya you move your fingers to your thumb in sequence as you chant sa-ta-na-ma\nYou equip your voice to address God, the universe, the dead or whomever.\nYou envision a thought experiment of what it feels like to be a rock, water, and try to ground yourself by that imagination—to gain their resilience. Similarly, you can visualise relaxation or yourself from afar in a pleasant third person.\nThe online conversation around meditation is just plain confusing. Instead of meditation people should expand their vocabulary of forms–to the ones above–in much the same way you would not invite or inform someone about a film by saying “it’s a film”, one ought to specify the genre and its qualities, its positives and negatives.\nThe reason mindfulness has become so popular – and the default genre of meditation online is because it was the first to demonstrate fMRI benefits in the brain after just a month’s participation. While any of these meditations can be fulfilling, after-all it is psychological as much as neurological, perhaps start there – with the proven mindfulness which is ergo more motivating.\nRecently we uncovered an important mechanism by which a month of mindfulness (about 11 hours of practice, 0.5 per day, 5 days a week) improves attention and self-regulation. (Tang et al 2010; 2012). This mechanism is a change in the white matter that conducts signals into and out of the anterior cingulate gyrus. The anterior cingulate is an important part of the system by which we can voluntarily regulate behaviour. After two weeks of meditation, the improvement seemed to involve the number of fibres conducting information. This improvement was related to a more positive and less negative mood self-reports. After 4 weeks of meditation improvement in the white matter involved changes in the myelin that provides insulation to the fibres and thus further increases the efficiency of the network involved in self-regulation.\nAntoine Lutz (2004) have shown that in very experienced meditators (that is 10,000+ hours) there is a high degree of gamma activity in the brain and greater gamma power with greater experience. Gamma waves are related to focused attention.\nWork by Luders and colleagues in 2012 shows that in meditators there is an increased volume of the hippocampus, which is associated with memory functioning, as well as in other areas of the cortex. There is also an increased structural connectivity between regions and more gyrification (cortical folding). Interestingly, recent work by HOlzel et al (2011) shows that changes can be seen very quickly: anyone doing 8 weeks of meditation can increase cortical grey matter density.\nRecent evidence shows that a BSR program can lead to changes in one of the brain structures that dealt with emotions: amygdala. In this study, the brains of 26 healthy but stressed individuals were scanned before and after an MBRS intervention. Results showed that reported stress was lower after the intervention and that this reduction in stress correlated with a decrease in the density of an area of the amygdala.\nThe evidence is pretty indisputable now, right? Consider:\nIn the clinical world, one of the most studied techniques to alleviate symptoms of depression, stress, and unhappiness is mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT or MBT). This therapy combines features of cognitive therapy and mindfulness meditation. The goal is to learn how to pay attention without judgement and to recognise feelings that are ineffective and mentally destructive so that one can respond rationally to these feelings instead of reacting to them impulsively. MBCT usually consists of eight weekly two-hour classes with assignments to be completed at home.\nTo reiterate: meditation is so general a word it is best defined by what it is not. Meditation for wellbeing is not solving your problems, it is not thinking through possibilities, judgments, beliefs, opinions, or reacting to the world and your social milieu. It is accepting, to solve them serendipitously exactly by accepting as perhaps irresolvable and not in need of so much of your mind, or attention.\nThe next time someone talks about meditation – maybe ask them what kind, as there are so many promising kinds. What kind d’you do, or will you choose? Some meditation enthusiasts do many, many forms. But, personally, I’ve settled for compassion and mindfulness—for now. And research encourages me to not quit when I’m feeling lazy (too often).\nI began with Insighttimer, the free community app which offers guided meditations. But am considering doing yoga and Taiji (again) for the combined benefit of friend-making. Practitioners of both benefit from reduced stress, anxiety, depression. And according to The Harvard Medical School Guide to Tai Chi, have had a positive relief on victims of post-traumatic stress disorder.","New voices: Are we mindful of how we talk about mindfulness?\nMindfulness dates back 2500 years, originating in Buddhism. Right now it is everywhere. People are talking about it as a state of being and way of life, writing about it, broadcasting podcasts on it, developing phone-based apps, offering groups and online courses. A few years ago, I went to the ‘Mindfulness in Society’ conference organised by Bangor University’s Centre for Mindfulness Research and Practice. There was a vibrant buzz: you would have understandably left feeling inspired and thinking we should all take up mindfulness practice. Yet I continue to find a lot of people are unaware of what mindfulness really is and what it involves. Some may assume it to be religious, conjuring up images of people chanting. Some believe it to be an alternative or complementary therapy, or that it is at best relaxation: ‘Your PhD is about mindfulness?! That sounds calming, I could do with some of that.’\nMindfulness has been defined as ‘paying attention on purpose, non-judgementally, and in the present moment’ (Kabat-Zinn, 1982). One way of achieving this is through formal breathing or body-based meditation practices. Thoughts and feelings are acknowledged and accepted but not challenged as in cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), for example. Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) have been developed for use in both mental and physical health, aimed at relieving symptoms of stress, depression, anxiety, eating disorders, and more. Jon Kabat-Zinn developed the first structured eight-week course, Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction (MBSR), for clients experiencing chronic pain (Kabat-Zinn, 1982), but you can now embrace mindfulness in workplaces (participating in ‘mindful lunches’ or ‘mindful walks’), in schools (to help children with stress and general well-being: Kuyken et al., 2013) and beyond. To see mindfulness accepted and becoming integrated into people’s lives is inspiring, but we need to be cautious with how we talk about and promote mindfulness, particularly so as to avoid creating unrealistic expectations in those new to mindfulness .\nIncreasing scientific research output has highlighted the growing interest and acceptance of mindfulness-based approaches. In the 1980s, only one or two academic papers were published. In the 1990s this increased to around 10–15 per year. In 2013 alone there were 475 publications on mindfulness (Black, 2014).\nOne particular field in which MBIs have been well researched is in depression. Despite both psychological and pharmacological treatments, many people continue to relapse into depression. Could the beauty of mindfulness lie in not only helping people to get better, but keeping them better? Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT), developed in 1995 as an adaptation of MBSR (Teasdale et al., 2000), aims to provide people currently in remission from depression with skills in mindfulness supplemented with psychoeducational elements of CBT to help prevent further relapse. The first randomised controlled trial (RCT) shows that those who participated in the eight-week MBCT programme showed lower relapse rates 12 months later, compared with those receiving their normal treatment (Teasdale et al., 2000). In fact, 37 per cent of the MBCT group met relapse criteria compared with 66 per cent of the treatment-as-usual group. More recently RCTs have shown that MBCT is as effective as antidepressants in preventing depression and may be beneficial for those with higher childhood trauma (Kuyken et al., 2008; Williams et al., 2013). In terms of mechanisms underlying MBIs, MBCT has been shown to reduce rumination, worry and dysfunctional attitudes (Jermann et al., 2013; Williams, 2008). Both mindfulness and self-compassion have been reported to mediate the effects of MBCT on depressive outcome (Kuyken et al., 2010), and a qualitative study suggested that MBIs can lead to a greater sense of acceptance and control over symptoms of depression (Allen et al., 2009).\nAdditionally, research shows how mindfulness practice can alter brain structure and function in long-term experienced meditators compared with novices, but also following short-term mindfulness interventions of eight or just four weeks in those new to meditation (Tang et al., 2012). Studies investigating MBSR have shown that there are not only mood and well-being gains but also improvements in attention and in hippocampal and amygdala brain structure (Jha et al., 2010; Hölzel et al., 2010; Hölzel et al., 2011). My own PhD is attempting to identify the neuropsychological mechanisms through which MBCT works to prevent relapse in depression, targeting specifically mechanisms of self-compassion, rumination and brain structure.\nSuch evidence is exciting and suggests that taking up mindfulness practice has wide impacts beyond psychological well-being. However, we must remain cautious that we do not talk about mindfulness as a quick fix or, worse, a panacea. Research to date has largely ignored negative side-effects, but one qualitative study reports how MBCT participants expressed difficulties when realising MBCT is not a cure-all and reporting feeling that they could not ‘do’ the mindfulness practice successfully (Allen et al., 2009). Such concerns are not uncommon and would normally be addressed during an MBCT course, particularly as there is no right way to ‘do’ mindfulness. This highlights the importance of raising realistic expectations of MBCT throughout the course, which may also help to ensure continued practice beyond the eight weeks. Development of mindfulness skills will inevitably require longer than an eight-week course, but the course is well suited to providing a foundation for further development of mindfulness techniques.\nRecently an emerging area of research led by Willoughby Britton at Brown University has suggested that mindfulness practice may not be appropriate for all. Whilst scientific research has not yet uncovered many negative side-effects from meditation, there are texts hundreds of years old that do touch on negative experiences or the ‘dark knight of the soul’ (see tinyurl.com/jw4swbk), suggesting there are hardships in contemplative practices. Interestingly, whilst in medical studies side-effects would always be considered in RCTs, they have often been neglected in psychotherapy research (Dimidjian & Hollon, 2010), and thus far, in meditation research. We remain largely unaware of evidence on participants who may be more vulnerable to undertaking meditation practices or those who may experience negative emotions, paranoia, confusion or a loss of identity – some of the experiences reported in Britton’s early research. This can of course all be a natural part of the meditative process, but, for some, such negative experiences can be heightened to an extent they can become very unwell. So there needs to be an awareness of undertaking mindfulness practices with a suitable level of insight and readiness to start meditation. Meditation may look and sound simple, but mindfulness practice involves a considerable amount of active effort – it is quite a commitment to achieve and maintain the benefits reported above. As psychologists, we need to exercise caution in promoting the use of mindfulness as a therapeutic intervention for clients. As above, there may be some who are more vulnerable or not at the right stage in their lives to face the emotions mindfulness can bring to the forefront.\nAlthough there are not currently any formally recognised qualifications to teach mindfulness, and training pathways are not yet accredited, we must not forget that those teaching mindfulness should at the very least have their own established personal practice of mindfulness. Attendance at an eight-week course would not be sufficient for beginning to teach mindfulness techniques to others. We must encourage clients to seek teachers who have an established mindfulness practice, are appropriately trained and supervised and are following UK mindfulness teacher guidelines (Kuyken et al., 2012) to ensure continuation of credible and evidence-based courses.\nPersonally, I have practised mindfulness meditation for around four years; it is certainly not easy or a one-off practice. After all, you are connecting with inner thoughts and feelings you may have learned, over many years, to keep hidden under the surface. My practice has made me more self-aware and connected with my mind, my automatic reactions and behaviour around others, which has at times made me feel low or anxious. This is all a part of the process and is why mindfulness can be so powerful as a therapeutic tool. Whilst mindfulness practice for me has been a life-changing decision, it was not a simple, straight line journey and I’m sure I will have ups and downs as I continue to practise. As Jon Kabat-Zinn said at the mindfulness conference, it will not always be easy but ‘you don’t have to like it, you just have to do it’.\nI am a strong believer in MBIs and can see the benefits it can bring. Yet we must remain ‘mindful’ of how we promote and talk about mindfulness to ensure we carefully promote its use and application to mental or physical health issues whilst in the early days of its research. If we can avoid overstating mindfulness as a gold standard or panacea, those new to mindfulness can start to practise with realistic expectations, under suitably qualified courses, and can begin to experience the wonderful world of mindfulness meditation.\nKate Williams is a PhD student in the Neuroscience and Psychiatry Unit at the University of Manchester\nAllen, M., Bromley, A., Kuyken, W. & Sonnenberg, S.J.

{"question":"How do volunteer programs and pest detection efforts work together to protect California's natural areas?","answer":"Volunteer programs and pest detection efforts complement each other in protecting California's natural areas. Volunteer programs, such as the Wildland Volunteer Network in the San Francisco Bay Area, organize trainings and provide resources like the Cal-IPC Plant Profiles and Weed Worker Handbook to help identify and manage invasive plants.

If they're out of sight, they're out of mind. During winter months, beetles, borers and their brethren burrow deep in our gardens, waiting for warmth and opportunity. Likewise, voles and other crafty critters seek their openings to invade our space.\n\"Many people think there's nothing out there in wintertime,\" said El Dorado County Master Gardener Phyllis Lee. \"They don't see it but it's still there.\"\nInstead of making pests' lives harder, we humans actually help them out. In particular, we unwittingly give bugs and plant diseases a lift, moving them to new areas to conquer.\nAt stake is more than backyard fruit trees or favorite plants California agriculture also is at risk.\nJust like homeland security, vigilance is key to stopping these threats. The more eyes, the better.\nThat's why agricultural experts seek backyard gardeners' help in stopping potential infestations. Our backyards may be the first line of defense against such potentially devastating pests as Japanese beetles and the Asian citrus psyllid.\n\"(The psyllid) is bound to get here,\" said Chuck Ingels, UC Cooperative Extension farm adviser for Sacramento County. \"We need to keep an eye out. It's a real threat to all of our citrus trees everywhere.\"\nOften, pests' favorite mode of transportation is firewood. Old logs can carry all sorts of pests. And winter is when people tend to move wood.\nOr these pests may hitch rides in potted plants, grafted wood, sod or soil. However they got here, they likely had human help.\nAt California's borders, agriculture inspectors are on the lookout for destructive pests such as the emerald ash borer or the Asian longhorn beetle.\nHow common are these bad bugs? Recently, inspectors found in a load of firewood a 6-foot log that contained more than 10,000 destructive beetles.\nAnother unwanted traveler: fire ants. Common in Texas and Southern states, these aggressive ants often hide in firewood.\n\"These pests would be perfectly happy in California,\" said Leigh Greenwood, manager of the Nature Conservancy's \"Don't Move Firewood\" campaign. \"They could be out there already, but we just don't know it yet.\"\nThe campaign recommends keeping firewood within 50 miles of where it was harvested; closer is better.\nBecause California is such a big state, firewood often is moved around without inspection by private individuals. Moving wood moves pests with them.\nWatch out when you bring firewood indoors, too, warned Lee. \"There are lots of possibilities for bringing things in with the wood. Watch out for spiders.\"\nFirewood helped spread the pathogen that causes sudden oak death throughout Northern and Central California. It's also suspected in the transport of the gold-spotted oak borer, a penny-size bug covered with gold flecks.\n\"That borer affects all species of oaks but prefers larger oaks,\" Greenwood said. \"That's why it puts our big trees at such risk. In November, we saw it jump from San Diego County to Idyllwild in Riverside County. It's very, very likely it moved in firewood.\"\nThe shothole borer isn't as picky; it eats all sorts of trees. Once unknown in California, this tiny black beetle attacks trees en masse.\n\"The tree looks like it was blasted with a shotgun,\" Greenwood explained. \"There are lots of tiny holes in the trunk. You'll see drips of sap or piles of sawdust.\n\"Nobody knows where it came from, but suddenly it's here,\" she added. \"It's quite worrisome.\"\nAsian citrus psyllid has landed in the Los Angeles suburbs and traveled as far north as Tulare. This bug carries huanglongbing, a disease also called citrus greening. It has wiped out thousands of acres of citrus in Florida and Brazil.\n\"This is a pest nobody wants,\" Greenwood said. \"Citrus is such a huge component of our urban forests. Every backyard tree is at risk.\"\nThis bug can be relatively easy to spot.\n\"These insects bend at a 45-degree angle,\" Ingels said. \"The tree looks yellow and there's a twisting of small leaves. The challenge is a tree can be infected for a year or more before showing symptoms.\"\nLawn-destroying Japanese beetles, common on the East Coast, were trapped in Fair Oaks in 2011 and 2012. Diligence by state agriculture officials and homeowners kept this infestation contained to a small area.\nIf you see any of these insects, call your county agricultural office to report it.\nIt's too late to eradicate some bugs; they've already made themselves at home here. But winter diligence can help minimize their impact.\nDormant oil sprays applied now can stop scale, soft insects that sap plants and trees of their strength. Kuno scale, for example, attacks stone-fruit trees. Black scale likes olives.\nMost scales attract ants, which \"milk\" the soft-bodied insects for their honeydew. Controlling scale helps control ants.\nCodling moths and other destructive bugs can overwinter in the debris under trees. To help break their cycle, dispose of fallen leaves and fruit.\n\"Those leaves are harboring pests,\" Ingels said. \"They need to be cleaned up.\"\nA recent newcomer to California, spotted-wing drosophila, a tiny fly that attacks cherries, has had devastating effects on backyard trees. Winter cleanup may cut down its population.\nNow may be a good time to attack another pest: voles. With voracious appetites, these mouselike rodents live underground but create visible runways to their shallow burrows.\n\"We've had a huge surge in voles, particularly in the Folsom area,\" Lee said. \"You can see their runways between holes. Put out mousetraps along their paths. Their sight is very poor; they'll run right over the trap.\"\nWINTER CARE WORKSHOP\nWhere: Fair Oaks Horticulture Center, 11549 Fair Oaks Blvd., Fair Oaks\nWhen: 9 a.m.-noon today\nDetails: http://cesacramento.ucdavis.edu, (916) 875-6913\nSacramento County master gardeners will be out in force for this workshop as they demonstrate pruning techniques, tool care and selection, composting and other winter tasks.

{"question":"I'm planning both a hiking trip and a camping trip this summer. How does the recommended daily water intake compare between hiking and camping activities?","answer":"For hiking, you need about 0.5 liters (16oz) of water per hour under normal conditions, which doubles to 1 liter per hour in heat, humidity, or higher altitudes. For camping, the recommendation is higher at about 1 gallon (approximately 3.8 liters) per person per day, with a recommendation to bring 2 gallons per person per day to account for cooking, cleaning, and personal hygiene needs in addition to drinking.","context":["Being properly hydrated when hiking or backpacking is not only vitally important for your health, but for your enjoyment as well. Dehydration can lead to serious health problems, which can be especially dangerous if you’re on a backpacking trip in the middle of no where for days at at time.\nThe biggest issue that comes with stay hydrated is that water is heavy and inconvenient to carry! So in order to keep weight you’re carrying as low as possible while also ensuring that you stay hydrated, it’s best to figure out just how much water you expect to need during your hike.\nHydration Best Practices\nPre-hydrate – hydrating before hiking gives your body a “head start” so that once you start hiking, you’ll last longer before needing more water. If you’re starting already dehydrated, it’s going to be more difficult to remain hydrated during your hike. Drink about a liter of water in the few hours before setting off if you can. Drink it slowly so that your body an absorb it – and then make sure to pee before you leave!\nSip Often – start sipping water every 10-15 minutes right at the beginning of the hike. Don’t wait until you’re thirst to start drinking. The more you can keep yourself hydrated throughout the hike, the more enjoyable your trip will be.\nDon’t Chug – if you’re sipping water every 10-15mins, you’re constantly re-hydrating your body. The small amounts allows the water to be better absorbed. If you’re chugging water, it’s going to go through you more quickly as it’s too much at one time for your body to absorb.\nDon’t Over Do It – it is possible to drink too much water. While it’s very unlikely that you will actually do this, too much water can also make you pee a lot, which reduces your hiking time and just makes you feel full and bloated. It can also dilute sodium levels in your blood. (Salty snacks are also a good idea to enjoy on your hike!)\nReplace Electrolytes, Not Just Water – when you exert yourself and sweat, you lose electrolytes, which are also an important part of keeping your energy levels up. If you’re hiking for more than an hour, you should considered trying to replace electrolytes during this hike. Sodium and potassium are the most important, but calcium and magnesium are too. One of the easiest ways to do this is just to add an electrolyte powder to your water.\nPost-hydrate – once you’re done with your hike, drink extra water to re-hydrate yourself and get back to normal. If you’re backpacking, it’s especially important to drink water at camp in between hikes (when it’s available) as both a post and pre-hydrate. When you’re in the wilderness for days at a time, you want to keep your hydration levels up as much as possible since it will likely decrease over time the longer you’re away from steady water supplies.\nHow much water should you drink when you’re hiking?\nRoughly a 1/2 liter (2 cups or 16oz) of water every hour is what you should be aiming for when hiking during normal conditions in order to stay hydrated.\nWhen hiking in heat, humidity, or at higher altitudes, this doubles to roughly 1 liter every hour.\nAlso know yourself and listen to your body. While this is a good general rule of thumb to follow, it will vary from person to person. Some people just naturally drink and need more water than others. But if you’re not drinking 1/2 liter every hour, you really should try to increase this to avoid problems later on.\nAlso to reduce weight, it’s a good idea to bring a water bottle with filter or purification tablets with you if you know there’s going to be a water source on the trail. That way you can just drink right out of the steam water that carrying all of your water with you!\nCalculating How Much Water To Bring When Hiking\nIf you want to get more specific and take into account the myriad of other factors that can influence how much water you should drink, here’s a more detailed calculation for that:\nHere are the factors you need to know for this calculation:\n- elevation gain\n- backpack weight\nGet ready to do some math!:\n((Miles x 20) + (Elevation Gain / 16.66) + ((Temperature – 80) -> (IF POSITIVE /20) x 120) + ((Altitude – 10000) -> (IF POSITIVE /2000) x 120) + ((Weight – 50) -> (IF POSITIVE /25) x 120) / 120 = Total Liters\nThen it’s also a good idea to add another .5 liters in there for safety.\nA 10 mi hike with an elevation gain of 2000ft in 100 degrees at an altitude of 12,000ft, carrying a 60lb pack. (Phew that sounds awful!)\n10 Miles x 20 = 200 minutes\n2000ft / 16.66 = 120 minutes\n100 degrees – 80 = 20, which is a positive number, so we continue with the rest of this part of the equation; 20/20 = 1 unit of 20; 1 X 120 = 120 min\n12,000ft – 10,000 = 2,000, which is a positive number, so we continue; 2,000/2,000 = 1 ; 1 x 120 = 120min\n60lbs – 50 = 10, which is positive, so we continue; 10/ 25 = .4; .4 x 120 = 48mins\nTotal minutes = 608 / 120 = 5.06 liters (+.5 for safety)\nHow this calculation works:\nWe are trying to reduce all of these variations into time, which can then be converted to liters.\nIn general, the average person walking on a flat path will finish a mile in less than 20mins. So Miles x 20 = Minutes to finish those miles\nIn general, every extra 1000ft of elevation gain will take an additional hour. 1000ft elevation gain = 60mins.\nIf it’s hot (over 80 degrees), you should bring an extra liter of water for every 20 degrees. Temperature – 80 = Degrees over 80. If this number is positive: Degrees over 80 / 20 = Units of 20. For every unit of 20, we want to bring an additional liter of water, but we need to write this in time rather than liters so that it can be added to the other metrics. In the general estimate of time to liters mentioned above, .5 liter = 60mins. So 1 unit of 20 = 1 liter = 120mins.\nYou should also bring an additional liter for every 2,000ft if hiking over altitudes of 10,000ft. Altitude – 10,000 = altitude over 10,000ft. Altitude over 10,000ft/2000 = Units of 2000. For every unit of 2000, we want to bring an additional liter of water, but we need to write this in time rather than liters. So 1 unit of 20000 = 1 liter = 120mins\nFor very heavy backpacks (over 50 lbs), we want to bring an additional liter per 25lbs. Weight – 50 = weight over 50lbs. Weight over 50lbs/25 = Units of 25. For every unit of 25, we want to bring an additional liter of water, but we need to write this in time rather than liters. So 1 unit of 25 = 1 liter = 120mins\nAdd all of that together and you get the total value of these variables in minutes. Divide this by 120 (120 is 60 (minutes in an hour) x 2 (.5 liter every hour))\nHow Much Water Should I Carry When Backpacking?\nWater is heavy – probably one of the heaviest things you’re going to carry. It generally weights about 2lbs per liter, which can add up really quick!\nIf you know there’s going to be water along the trail, I highly recommend bringing a water bottle with filtration system, purification tablets, or a gravity water filter (this is great for once you set up camp to purify larger amounts of water!) so that you can just drink from the available water and not have to bring all of it with you.\nAs a general rule of thumb, you should be prepared for .5 liters every hour. Plus an additional liter for every 1,000ft of elevation gain. If you want a much more detailed and complicated equation taking into consideration several factors, that’s available above.\nKnow your pace and plan out your trip so that you only have to carry the water that you need for each section between water sources. This will ensure that your pack stays as light as possible while still carrying the necessary amount of water.\nAlso keep in mind that a lot of times, water is also needed for your food. Take a look at your meal plan and see how much water you’re going to need to make your food. Dehydrated food takes a lot of water – sometimes .5 – 1 liters per pouch! – and this needs to be accounted for in your calculations for water. This is also why gravity water filters are really helpful when setting up a campsite where you plan on spending a few days since you can filter a large amounts of water at one time.\nCarrying your Water: Bottle vs Bladder\nWhy not both?! I always bring both a bladder and bottle with me when I’m backpacking since each one has it’s own strengths and weaknesses.\nI use the bladder while I’m hiking since it’s so convenient and then will fill up a water bottle with the local water source on the trail and use this for cooking or to refill the bladder.\nHydration packs or bladders\nPros: Really convenient when on the move and carries a lot of water (usually 3 liters). They allow you to have your hands free since the water is on your back and also make it very easy to sip your water since the hose is easily available over your shoulder all the time.\nCons: More difficult to refill, get water out of, and clean. Harder to know when it’s almost empty Also due to the large volume, if you want to add electrolytes or flavors, it’s going to effect all of your water supply.\nReusable bottles can either come with a water filtration system automatically built in, or just a good sturdy regular bottle. When choosing a water bottle, the mouth size can be an important thing to consider. If you plan on using this bottle to collect water along the trail (drips from a seep or a small stream), a larger mouth is generally better.\nPros: Easy to refill in streams, from seeps, or other water sources. Easier to get water out of if needed for cooking.\nCons: Carries a smaller amount of water. Harder to drink from (need to stop to get it out of your pack) or you have to carry it in your hands.\nHow do you know how much water is left in your hydration pack?\nThis can be a bit tricky. I’ve definitely incorrectly estimated how much water I was drinking while hiking and had much less than expected by the time we got to camp.\nCurrently there isn’t a way to monitor the water levels in your hydration pack without just looking at it. There have been a few purposed products such as HydrateMate and Hydration System, which would do this, but as far as I know has not come to exist yet.\nYou really just have to guesstimate. Know yourself and how quickly you usually drink water and if you think you’re feeling particularly thirty during this hike. Expect to drink more when it’s hot and you’re at higher elevations.\nIt’s also a good idea to stop and check your bladder whenever you’re near a water source even if you don’t think you need to refill.","Many new camping enthusiasts wonder how much water to bring for camping. The answer could differ depending on the situation, but here’s a ballpark estimate.\nA normal adult requires around 1 gallon of drinking water each day, while they are camping outdoors during summer months. To be on the safe side, you should aim to take at least 2 gallons of water per person for every day of camping.\nTaking this much water ensures that you will have enough not just for drinking but for cooking, cleaning, and personal hygiene as well.\nLet’s look at the water requirement for a camping trip in more detail.\nWhat You Will Need\nEven if you have clean drinking water available at your camping destination, you will need some water containers and bottles at hand. This equipment will ensure that you do not have to go to the water source every time you need a little water to quench your thirst.\nHere is a list of items that can be handy for keeping water with you at all times.\n- Large Water Carrier\n- Water Flask\n- Water Purification Tablets\nFactors that Affect Your Water Usage\nThe amount of water each person will consume on a camping trip varies based on multiple factors. Here are some of the major issues that affect water usage:\nSeason and Temperature\nThe season of the year and climate of the destination will have a major impact on how much water your body will need. If you are camping at a dry and hot location then you are obviously going to need more water on the camping trip, as you will be sweating a lot more moisture out during the day.\nMany people go for camping at ranches or farmyards that are in hot plains or close to deserts. While these places are great to camp for dirt rallies, hiking and sports, be prepared for the unforgiving dryness that you will experience there.\nOn the other hand, camping during the cold season in a place that has lots of shade and moisture will lower your water requirement.\nLevel of Activity\nIf you do a lot of running or physical activity throughout the day, then your body will warm up more. You will do a lot more sweating to cool down and need more water on camping trip. It would be wise to bring more water to keep you hydrated throughout the day.\nOn the other hand, your will not need a lot of water if you are camping out just to relax and enjoy the scenery. If you will spend most of the time lying down, or watching the flora and fauna, then you will need less water for the camping trip.\nAvailability of Drinking Water\nAnother major factor to determine how much water to bring camping is the availability of drinking water at your camping destination.\nIf you are going to a popular tourist spot, frequently visited by other campers, then there is a good chance that they will have already arranged drinking water for visitors. You will be able to get by even with a single bottle of water that you can refill when you get low on water.\nAvailability of Water\nIn some cases, you will have access to water on camping trip, but may not get drinking water on your trip. For example, if you are camping close to a waterfall, stream or lake, you will be able to use the water for personal hygiene or cleaning dishes. This will lower your need for total water required for the trip.\nHowever, you will still need clean water for drinking, which you should carry on your person before you go camping. You may also be able to boil and clean water with water purifying tablets that you can buy in the market.\nWater for Pets\nIf you are taking pets like dogs on your trip, then make sure to carry enough water on camping trip for them as well. Dogs vary in size and breed, which can affect how much water they consume each day.\nTo calculate how much water you need for your pets, you should have an idea of how big and heavy they are. On average, your pet will drink about 0.03 liters of water for each pound of bodyweight that they have, per day.\nThat means a dog that weighs about 35 to 50 pounds will require around 1.5 liters of water each day. A dog that is twice the size and weighs 100 pounds will need around 3 liters of water each day.\nCan You Ever Take Too Much Water For Your Camping Trip?\nIn most cases, taking extra drinking water on your trip is a good idea. However there are some exceptions.\nThe space inside your car is limited. Every container of water will take away some space and prevent you from carrying other useful items on your trip.\nIf you don’t have enough space in the trunk, you can put your water containers on an empty car seat. If your vehicle has a roof rack, you can put extra water containers at the top of your vehicle.\nOur Final Thoughts\nWater is one of most essential requirements and is a basic necessity for life. We may not realize the value of drinking water in the comfort of our home, but it becomes critical when we go for a camping trip.\nThe answer to the question of how much water to bring camping differs based on your circumstances. The time of the year, duration of the trip, camping destination and your needs can raise the water you will need.\nAt the bare minimum, you will need at least 1 gallon of water for each person, per day. If you want to have an enjoyable and comfortable experience, aim to carry at least 2 gallons of water on camping trip for each person, for each day of the trip."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:d6a9cbc5-287e-4a89-bce8-a7627e0f69a5>","<urn:uuid:fd89bc71-d4be-423c-a4c5-22c2d28be2d3>"],"error":null}

This aligns with B Corp experiences, where businesses report benefits in attracting diverse teams and creating safe, inclusive workspaces. For instance, companies like OlyKraut specifically mention hiring queer and gender queer people as part of their commitment to diversity, demonstrating how sustainability practices help create more diverse and inclusive workplace environments.","context":["Marketing, Practice Management\nWhat is Governance and What Role Can Marketing Play?\nFebruary 24, 2022 | | Marketing, Practice Management\nIf you feel like you’ve seen the term “ESG” pop up more lately, you’re not wrong. Google Trends has shown increasing search popularity in the term, peaking most recently at the end of January 2022. So, what does ESG mean? What is governance in ESG? And, most importantly, how can marketing help an accounting firm reach its governance goals?\nWhat is ESG?\nESG stands for Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance reporting. Depending on your firm size and the size of your clients, you may think that ESG is a sustainability topic that is still in the distance. However, this reporting is likely much closer than you think. According to RSM, the time to talk about ESG reporting is now.\nOut of the businesses they recently surveyed, half with revenues between $10-50m had some kind of formal plan or strategy regarding ESG initiatives. This percentage was higher with businesses whose revenues were between $50 million and $1 billion (72%). On average, two-thirds of businesses had some kind of ESG plan.\nIn ESG, what is governance?\nIt may be your natural inclination to think about the “E” in ESG most frequently. However, environmental metrics are really just the sprout of a much bigger tree that a company can report on.\nWhat governance is\nGovernance is one leg of sustainability that often gets overlooked, but it is foundational to any organization’s success. It is concerned with how the firm is run, which can include its structure, culture, engagement and disclosure practices. It’s hard to tease out individual parts of a sustainability plan in an organizations. A quality of sustainability is that everything is interconnected.\nTake, for example, Certified B Corps. These are businesses that have achieved high standards in 5 areas – environment, workers, community, governance, and customers. The mission & measurement and ethics & transparency set by the governance piece ripple out to the actions taken in all other parts. Think of governance as part of a whole.\nWhat governance includes\nA governance plan could include ethics statements, diversity policies, codes of conduct, anti-harassment and non-discrimination statements, privacy policies, and more. Good governance creates good policies, and sets the foundations for all other ESG-related projects. These policies will tell clients, prospects, referrals, and employees about who you are as a firm, and what your culture and priorities are. Being transparent on sustainability goals and progress can also be part of your governance plan.\nGuides for governance\nThere are several different guides you could use to report on sustainability goals for your own business. For example, the Wisconsin Sustainable Business Council has The Green Masters Program, a program designed for self-reporting on sustainability progress. Firms may also want to assess their progress using the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) or Certified B Corps criteria.\nSASB, the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, is one of the organizations working on establishing standards for sustainability by industry. Businesses can use\nthe standards to evaluate where they stand in terms of sustainability topics that are most material to their operations. For example, when evaluating professional & commercial services, operational matters, such as carbon or water, are not mentioned on the list. However, topics such as data security, professional integrity, and diversity & inclusion are listed. Oftentimes, engaging in sustainability doesn’t look like recreating the wheel. Instead, it looks like refocusing efforts already in motion and setting clear and transparent goals to improve in these areas.\nWhat role does leadership play?\nLike many good initiatives, governance isn’t successful without a top‐down strategy and messaging echoed by leadership. Your leadership should personally engage with ESG, drive sustainability company wide, and set the tone from the top down with commitments and initiatives for the company.\nThis doesn’t need to look like grandiose statements or lofty, unrealistic plans. Leadership in governance can look like risk management that thinks about how ESG ties to an existing strategic business plan. It can look like prioritizing the long-term over the short term, creating stretch goals, and promoting transparency for activities related to sustainability in the firm. It can also look like realizing and acknowledging the innovation that can come from thinking sustainably.\nWhat are the benefits of a strong governance plan?\nSustainability initiatives like governance in ESG aren’t just important for the environment. They are also key to a long-lasting business. Employees want to work at a company that is more socially engaged. It can also serve as a differentiator to separate you from competitors.\nA strong governance plan rooted in sustainability can be beneficial from a hiring and business development standpoint. By 2025, 75% of the workforce will be Millennials, and they are looking for socially responsible companies. You may close the door to them without a ESG or corporate social responsibility (CSR) policy – 64% of Millennials won’t take a job if there isn’t one. In four years, Gen Z will make up 30% of the workforce, and it is anticipated that they will prioritize purpose above salary. Creating a foundation now is an investment in the future of your workforce.\nHow can marketing play a role in ESG?\nMarketing professionals have worn many hats over the past several years. The multi-faceted roles of marketing can come in handy when it comes to aiding in ESG initiatives. You may want to:\nCoordinate or lead a Green Team\nPromote sustainable activities to external stakeholders\nShare top-down messaging internally and externally\nHelp with incentive programs\nSend out surveys to determine internal & external priorities\nKeep an eye on trends in ESG\nAdvise leadership about certifications\nTalk to clients about their ESG initiatives as part of fact-finding\nWhere do I start with governance planning?\nSeveral great resources are available for businesses that are thinking about ESG but not sure where to start. In a previous role, I enrolled in 21st Century Pathways, a training program hosted by the Wisconsin Sustainable Business Council. The design of the program helps companies figure out how sustainability can improve their profitability. It was a helpful program in expanding the definition of sustainability and what it can look like for a professional services firm. Companies can also review standards via SASB, Certified B Corps, and the myriad other standards popping up in recent years. RSM and AICPA also have materials on ESG. I’ve also referenced a sustainability book by Gilbert Hedstrom to make evaluations.\nRemember to start small. Revise your mission statement to incorporate sustainability. Create an ethics statement. Make one plan to improve sustainability in the coming year by a certain percentage. You don’t have to take it all on at once. ESG is about making small, lasting changes to improve your firm.\nAbout Sammi Dittloff\nWelcome to CPA Growth Trends — your source for information, insights, tools and best practices to drive growth within an accounting firm.\nFeatured: Season 1 Episode 1\nCompensation Changes in Accounting Firms – Intersection of HR & Marketing with Andrea Sardon, PBMares\nwith Andrea Sardone from PBMares\nJoin host Mike Jones with Andrea Sardone from PBMares as they discuss the changes in compensation within the intersection of marketing and accounting in accounting firms.","Did you know that 1 in 3 businesses that submit to become a Certified B Corporation will certify for it?\nB Lab, the global network for the B Corp movement, admits that it can be challenging to receive this certification. But it is worth it for businesses ready to walk the talk and pivot to become the best business for the world.\nWhat’s a B Corporation?\nA Certified B Corporation is a business that focuses on a triple bottom line: people, profit, and planet. It is a hybrid between a standard corporation and a nonprofit organization. That means the business earns a profit.\nIn addition, a Certified B Corp is also held accountable to higher social and environmental standards. Being held accountable for these higher standards allows the business to do two things. The business is able to prioritize its triple bottom line. It also elevates the entity to B Corp status.\nHowever, think carefully before pivoting to this Certification. It is critical that the members, or owners, of your business formation prepare to make the shift. If your business is incorporated as a corporation, for example, the board of directors and investors must discuss plans to obtain B Corp Certification. This pivot presents significant changes for the business. All individuals must understand why these changes are useful for the company. Members or owners may vote to make their decision.\nCertified B Corporation Requirements\nBecoming a Certified B Corporation means completing a certification process. Let’s review what happens during this process. We’ll also look at long-term benefits businesses receive with a B Corp Certification.\n1. Complete the B Impact Assessment\nYou may think you are ready to “B the Change,” but first you must take and pass the B Impact Assessment (BIA).\nThe B Impact Assessment is a free tool. It allows a company to measure its impact on its workers, community, environment, and customers.\nBIA starts with an assessment. This includes questions about what it takes to build a better business. Remember that a better business is one that is better for its workers, community, and the environment.\nYou can get a quick snapshot of how your business is doing and its impact by taking the 30-minute test. However, if you wish to further pursue Certification you must complete the full impact report. This takes two to three hours to complete. It consists of 200 questions. These are determined by your company size, sector, and market. A verified total score of 80 across all impact areas is required to pass the BIA.\nOnce you have taken the full impact report, review your results holistically afterwards. See how your answers compare to other businesses. Then, create a customized improvement plan. Work on ways you can improve your score to be part of the B Corp movement. You may download improvement tools and case studies available on the BIA website for additional resources.\n2. Fill Out the Disclosure Questionnaire\nIn order to complete the BIA, the business must answer questions about any material negative impacts. Essentially, the Disclosure Questionnaire allows for a public compliant process. This includes background checks and disclosure of any sensitive business practices.\n3. Meet the Legal Requirement\nThe legal requirement for a Certified B Corporation gives legal protection to directors and officers to consider the interests of all stakeholders when making business decisions. It also creates rights for shareholders to hold directors and officers accountable to consider these interests.\nThere is a grace period from B Lab for companies completing the B Corp legal requirement. Changes may be necessary depending on entity formation and location. For example, some businesses may need to reincorporate. They may also decide to adopt a benefit corporation status. A B Corp Agreement must be signed by the business. This commits to meeting the legal requirement.\n4. Take the Verification Process\nA multi-step verification process must be taken by the business. This allows them to find out if they met the 80-point score necessary for Certification. In addition, the B Corp Agreement should outline transparency requirements. Businesses will agree to meet these requirements as a Certified B Corp.\nOnce you complete the BIA and Disclosure Questionnaire, submit both for review with B Lab.\n5. Schedule an Assessment Review\nAfter submitting the BIA and Disclosure Questionnaire, a B Lab Standards Analyst will reach out to you. This is to confirm this submission and details about your business.\nAn assessment may then be scheduled to review the BIA together. Typically, these calls take between 60 to 90 minutes. This ensures thorough review and accuracy for the company and how it plans to commit to the public benefit. A successful review will allow your business to move forward. Pay the annual certification fees and sign the B Corp Declaration of Interdependence before becoming a Certified B Corp.\nHowever, please note that B Lab is experiencing high volumes of Certification interest. The review process for Certified B Corporations may now take anywhere from six to 10 months to complete. Check in with B Lab regularly for any updates and changes.\nBenefits of Being a Certified B Corporation\nThere is an almost endless list of benefits that come with B Corp Certification. A few years ago, we interviewed the founders of Certified B Corporations. These businesses either started their companies as Certified B Corps or pivoted to that Certification.\nWhat benefits do they receive as a Certified B Corporation?

{"question":"What are the image stabilization capabilities of the Leica zone focusing system versus Sony's SteadyShot INSIDE?","answer":"The Sony A7R IV features a 5-axis SteadyShot INSIDE sensor-shift stabilization system that compensates for five types of camera shake and provides up to 5.5 stops of stabilization. This works with any lens, including adapted ones. The Leica's zone focusing system, while useful for street and landscape photography, is not an image stabilization system - it's a focusing method that relies on depth of field and distance estimation to ensure subjects within a certain range remain sharp at specific aperture settings.","context":["Those are the two key words you need to know about focusing with a Leica. If you’ve used a rangefinder before, you already know this; if you haven’t, then read on.\nLeica cameras don’t focus like the DSLRs, ILC (Interchangeable Lens Compacts like the Olympus E-P2), or point-and-shoot digitals that we’re all used to. For one, Leica lenses are all manual-focus lenses. For another, unlike most other digital cameras today, you’re not focusing through the lens (TTL). You’re actually using a separate viewfinder to do the framing and focusing for you.\nTake a look at the image below. It’s a bit hard to capture the view through a Leica’s viewfinder, but see that slightly bright rectangle near the top-left of the circle? That’s your focusing aid. Now, see how the part of the poster that’s in that rectangle is doubled? Well, on a Leica, you adjust the focus ring of the lens till the two images merge into one.\nThat’s the first way to focus a Leica, and when you’re at a wide-open aperture like f/2.5, it’s the surest way to gain critical focus. But that’s not how zone focusing works.\nGoogle defines zone focusing as “A way to focus that utilizes the depth of field scale rather than the actual distance from camera to subject. Zone focusing is most useful for candid, street photography.” To understand this, let’s take a look at the lens barrel of a Leica.\nIn the image below, you’ll see that there are a number of markings on the barrel. First, closest to the business end of the lens, is the aperture adjustment. In this case, we see that it’s set to f/11.\nNext is the focus ring, and this is where that whole zone focusing thing comes in. Using the tab shown in the image below, you adjust that ring to match the markings at the very base of the lens barrel. Those markings, you’ll notice, are marked with the numbers 4, 8, 11, 16. These are aperture markings, and are arranged so that the get progressively higher in number as they move out from the center of the scale.\nIn the image shown, I’ve arranged the focus ring so that the infinity mark on the lens rests over the f/11 marker. Looking at the other side of the scale, we see that the 3-meter mark on the focus scale is right over the f/11 marker.\nThat means that the lens is now focused in a way that all objects between 3 meters and infinity will be acceptably sharp, as long as the aperture remains at f/11.\nThat’s zone focusing for you. You determine your zone of coverage, the range within which all subjects will be acceptably sharp, then use the markings and the focus ring to set it. If I changed the aperture to f/8, for example, I would get a range of something like just over 3 meters to somewhere short of infinity.\nIs this system precise? No, not if you’re trying to get critical focus on a specific object at a close distance, or if you’re trying to shoot at wide-open apertures. But if you’re a landscape or street photographer, zone focus is your friend. It allows you to quickly raise your camera to your eye and snap off a shot without having to wait till you manually focus your Leica. Set that thing to f/11 and everything from about 10 feet to infinity is acceptably sharp.\nFocusing with the Leica was perhaps one of my challenges. All too often, I was unsure whether I really was getting images that were sharp enough; it took a while to get used to trusting the zone focus system, and even longer to get to a point where I wasn’t constantly peering through the viewfinder and adjusting the focus ring to zero onto a subject, completely changing the focus range I’d set moments ago.\nYet once I got used to it, the use of the Leica as a street shooter’s dream camera started to make more sense. When you use zone focus, it’s just lift, frame, shoot. Assuming you’re not horrible at estimating distances, there’s a pretty good chance that your shot will be spot-on. In the image below, taken in Sausalito, CA, I fixed the aperture at f/16, marked it off so that I had a range of between 2 meters and infinity, and shot away. As you can see, he and the background elements are all in sharp focus.\nAs DSLR shooters, we’ve gotten used to isolating our subjects by shooting with the aperture wide open and blurring the background. Zone focusing doesn’t truly lend itself to shooting wide open, which is why you have to get better at framing your subjects so that even sharp background objects don’t distract from your main subject. I included the photo above precisely because it’s an example of bad framing; the background objects do distract from the main subject.\nIn the end, focusing with the Leica takes a bit of getting used to. What I found most remarkable was that zone focus was a fantastic aid when shooting landscapes. While shooting at Rodeo Beach in the Marin Headlands, I don’t think I touched the focus ring once after I set zone focus.\nZone focus was one of those things that was an “Aha!” moment, as are a lot of things about this camera system. Things that initially don’t make sense suddenly do, and preconceptions that I had going into this project often got broken to pieces, leading to a lot of frustration and angst.\nNext up, The Leica Diary, Part IV – An Unexpected Thing or Two.\nLatest posts by Sohail Mamdani (see all)\n- Field Report: Sony a7RII, a7SII In-Camera S-Log2 4K Samples - March 10, 2016\n- Field Report: Sony a7S II S-Log2 vs S-Log3 Test - January 27, 2016\n- Color Grading Made Eas(ier) with FilmConvert - January 21, 2016","Moving to an even higher resolution realm, the Sony A7R Mark IV A Body continues the noteworthy series of highly capable full-frame cameras, characterized by impressive stills and video performance and versatility. This fourth edition of the a7R sees the inclusion of an updated 61MP Exmor R BSI CMOS sensor and enhanced BIONZ X image processor, which afford impressive imaging results with marked smoothness, a 15-stop dynamic range, and, of course, speed. Up to 10 fps shooting is possible along with the ability to record UHD 4K30 video, both with support for Real-time Eye AF and Tracking AF technologies. The revised sensor design uses a Fast Hybrid AF System, with 567 phase-detection autofocus points, for notably fast and accurate focusing performance. Despite being such a high-resolution sensor, it is also distinguished by its flexible native sensitivity range from ISO 100-32000 for working in a variety of lighting conditions. Additionally, benefitting both stills and video operation, the a7R IV retains the 5-axis SteadyShot INSIDE sensor-shift image stabilization, which is effective to minimize the appearance of camera shake by up to 5.5 stops.\nBalancing the imaging merits, the a7R IV also sees an updated physical design with more robust weather sealing to suit working in especially harsh weather conditions. In terms of usability, the OLED electronic viewfinder has been boosted to an impressive 5.76m-dot resolution for clear viewing and the 3.0\" rear tilting touchscreen LCD has a high 2,359,296 dot resolution for crisp playback, live view shooting, and menu navigation. Dual SD card slots are both UHS-II-rated for faster performance and the inclusion of a USB Type-C port permits tethering and quick in-camera battery charging. Additionally, built-in Bluetooth and both 2.4 and 5 GHz Wi-Fi bands afford wireless transferring and remote camera control from linked mobile devices.\nFeaturing a back-illuminated design, the full-frame 61MP Exmor R CMOS sensor works with the BIONZ X image processor to offer impressively high-resolution stills and video while minimizing noise, improving speed, and achieving a wide 15-stop dynamic range. This sensor structure works with a gapless on-chip lens design and an anti-reflection coating, as well as eliminating the optical low-pass filter, to improve light collection and enhance detail. Also, the copper wiring layer dramatically improves data transmission speed for creating 14-bit, high-resolution 61MP stills with a native sensitivity range from ISO 100-32000, which can be further expanded to ISO 50-102400. Also, it enables internal UHD 4K video recording with a wide 14-stop dynamic range using either the full width of the full-frame sensor or an APS-C-sized area. The BIONZ X processor also works in conjunction with a high-speed front-end LSI to realize faster processing times along with the ability to capture this impressive 15-stop dynamic range with smooth tonal rendering.\nThe sensor and processor combination also avails fast continuous shooting at up to 10 fps at full resolution, for up to 68 consecutive frames, with full-time AF/AE.\nAn updated Fast Hybrid AF system now employs a combination of 567 phase-detection points, which cover approximately 99.7% of the height and 74% of the width of the frame, along with 425 contrast-detection areas for reliable and quick autofocus and subject tracking performance. This focusing system also achieves especially quick speed and reliable tracking, as well as enhanced low-light focusing response down to -3 EV. The use of phase-detection points also enables the use of A-mount lenses via the optional LA-EA3 or LA-EA1 lens mount adapters with full continuous AF/AE tracking compatibility.\nThe apt focus system also lends itself to a variety of focusing functions for refined accuracy, including Lock-on AF, which maintains focus on moving subjects throughout the use of a configurable frame that is set over the desired moving subject and Expand Flexible Spot, which employs neighbouring focus points to retain focus on moving subjects even if the originally selected point loses focus. Additionally, Eye AF can be used to base focus on recognized human and animal subjects' eyes for portraits and is available in both AF-S and AF-C modes, for both stills and video. Autofocus can also be used in conjunction with the Focus Magnifier function for critical focus when homing in on minute subject details. The rear touchscreen can also be used for Touch Focus control, and a Touchpad Focus Control mode lets you use the rear screen intuitively while keeping your eye to the viewfinder.\nPacked into the robust a7R IV is a 5.5-stop effective 5-axis SteadyShot INSIDE image stabilization system that compensates for five different types of camera shake encountered during handheld shooting of stills and video. This allows users to confidently use any lens, even adapted lenses, for critical imaging without encountering blur from camera shake.\nFor long focal lengths, the system will correct for pitch and yaw adjustments. Macro and high-magnification imagery, on the other hand, will benefit from the inclusion of horizontal and vertical shift compensation. All shooting styles will get usage out of the roll compensation. All 5 axes of stabilization will function at all times, even when used with third-party lenses and adapters or lenses with built-in optical stabilization.\nPixel Shift Multi Shooting\nThis unique compositing mode allows you to achieve even greater resolution than the 61MP sensor affords. Working in conjunction with the sensor-shift image stabilization, this mode shifts the sensor while making 16 consecutive exposures in order to acquire approximately 240.8MP of information for greater colour accuracy and detail than possible with a single exposure, along with an impressive image size of 19,008 x 12,672-pixels. These files can then be merged together during post-production by using the Sony Imaging software suite.\nInternal recording of UHD 4K movies is possible in multiple frame rates up to 30 fps and, based on the Super35mm recording area and effective 6K resolution, oversampling renders greater detail and full pixel readout is possible, that is void of pixel binning, for higher quality imagery with reduced moiré and aliasing. Full-frame 4K recording has also been dramatically improved for improved quality when working at mid to high sensitivities to permit full use of the entire sensor width. Full HD 1080p recording is also supported in frame rates up to 120 fps, and both resolutions utilize the 100 Mbps XAVC S format contained within an MP4 wrapper with 4:2:0 sampling. The high-speed, 120 fps recording also enables 4x and 5x slow-motion movie recording with the frame rate set to either 30p or 24p. In addition to high-resolution internal recording, uncompressed HDMI output also enables the use of an optional external recorder for clean 4K recording with 4:2:2 sampling.\n4K video recording also avails the ability to produce 8MP stills during playback by taking a frame grab from a movie and storing it as a separate file.\nOther Video Features:\nSupport for HDR Content:\nAffording extensive customizable color and gamma controls, the a7R IV allows users to adjust the gamma, black level, knee, color level, and more. Also, users can use the same S-Log2 Gamma Curve that is found on high-end Sony Cinema cameras that squeezes up to 1300% more dynamic range into the video signal then traditional REC709, for increased post-production flexibility. HLG (Hybrid Log-Gamma) support is also available, along with the BT.2020 color space, for recording within a wide color gamut and, in addition to S-Log2, S-Log3 is also available for producing an effective 14-stop dynamic range with increased grading control in the shadow to mid-tone regions of the image.\nSlow & Quick Motion:\nTake more control over your video capture capabilities with a variety of new frame rates available in an S&Q mode. This will allow shooters to capture Full HD video at one of either steps between 1-120 fps. These settings will allow you to slow down action as well as speed up a slow-moving scene.

{"question":"Como estudiante de meteorología, me gustaría saber: what is causing the specific rainfall pattern near the Appalachian Mountains during hurricanes?","answer":"Near the Appalachians, hurricane rain shields line up parallel to the mountains, which run southwest to northeast, with the heaviest rain consistently occurring to the west of the track. This pattern occurs due to a combination of the mountains and a wedge of cold and dry continental air forcing the moist air upward, causing the water vapor to condense and fall to the ground as rain.","context":["All eyes are on where hurricanes make landfall, but the massive storms actually cause the most deaths inland, where severe flooding often surprises residents.\nNow, researchers are learning how to predict where tropical storms and hurricanes will dump the most rain — even days after — and hundreds of miles away from — landfall.\nIn a paper in the current issue of the journal Professional Geographer, Corene Matyas, an assistant professor of geography at the University of Florida, outlines new tools to predict how the storm’s intensity, distance it has moved inland and landscape topography alters its “rain shields” — the bands of heavy rain so visible in Doppler radar images. Among other things, her tools proved adept at modeling observations that when hurricanes or tropical storms encounter the Texas hill country or the Appalachian Mountains, their rain shields tend to line up in the same direction and with the same orientation as the underlying topography.\n“There are a lot of different things that can affect where the rainfall can occur in the storm and how heavy that rainfall will be,” Matyas said. “Our goal is to work toward predicting how those factors will determine the rainfall pattern.”\nHistorically, hurricanes have proven most fatal at landfall, with coastal residents overcome by storm surge and high winds. But over the past four decades, forecasters have become more skilled at predicting hurricanes’ tracks over open water, enabling most coastal residents to flee or prepare for the storms well in advance.\nAs a result, the highest proportion of hurricane and tropical fatalities has shifted inland. One study cited in the Matyas paper found 59 percent of deaths from tropical storms or hurricanes between 1970 and 1999 occurred because of heavy rainfall rather than wind or storm surge. As storms track inland, they inevitably ensnare more cities and towns. In 1998, Tropical Depression Charley left 20 people dead near Del Rio, Texas, more than 200 miles from where the storm made landfall, Matyas notes.\nResearchers are developing some models for forecasting inland rain patterns, but they have difficulty accounting for the lopsided or elongated shape the pattern often takes, with most if not all rain falling on one side of the storm. A common assumption is that rainfall will decrease as the hurricane moves away from the ocean, which is generally true but may be obviated by other weather systems and local landscape.\nMatyas’ goal was to find new tools to improve the models.\nShe studied radar data from 13 U.S. storms that made landfall between 1997 and 2003, then used a common tool in geography — geographical information systems, or GIS — to measure how rainfall patterns changed. GIS is a computer system that makes it possible to analyze spatial patterns of data. It is often used to track things such as voting patterns, but using GIS in meteorology — where spatial patterns change — is relatively new, Matyas said.\nMatyas outlined the edge of the rain shields using radar data, then measured their shapes by calculating characteristics such as the position of their center of mass. She repeated the analysis for each hour that the storms were over land. She then used a statistical technique, discriminant analysis, to determine which shape and size best place the storms into groups based on their intensity, how far they travel inland and the topography they encounter. The success of the discriminant analyses indicates that these shape measures could serve as predictive tools for future rainfall models.\nIn a demonstration of the potential, the shape measures helped to confirm that that the orientation of storms’ rain shields corresponds closely to the orientation of the land topography.\nWith hurricanes crossing Texas hill country, the rain shields tend to line up parallel to the main axis of the hills, running west to east. Storms near the Appalachians also line up parallel to the mountains, whose axis runs southwest to northeast, with the heaviest rain consistently occurring to the west of the track. This is due to a combination of the mountains and a wedge of cold and dry continental air forcing the moist air upward, causing the water vapor to condense and fall to the ground as rain. This phenomenon does not happen with the Texas storms, as the dry continental air masses over Texas are similar in temperature to tropical moist air masses that accompany hurricanes.\nFrank Marks, a research meteorologist and director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Hurricane Research Division, said Matyas’ conclusions “have a lot of merit in terms of understanding the structure, size and shape of the rain shield.”\nHe said the next step is to add rainfall amount to the variables. The end goal: a model that will provide inland residents with the same targeted advance warnings and watches that coastal residents get today — but for heavy rainfall rather than wind or storm surge.\nCite This Page:"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:09e79f30-a6ca-4d93-8df1-9ba67abd9526>"],"error":null}

{"question":"I'm researching different primary education approaches. Both Steiner schools and IB Primary Years Programme emphasize teacher development - how do their requirements for teacher training and collaboration compare?","answer":"Both systems place strong emphasis on teacher development but have different approaches. In Steiner schools, teachers ideally stay with the same class for the first eight years, requiring extensive training to handle multiple grade levels and subjects. They must integrate artistic elements into all subjects and follow child development phases. The PYP requires all teachers to receive professional development in IB's specific approaches to teaching and learning from certified workshop leaders. PYP teachers must participate in collaborative planning sessions to ensure consistent teaching practices and a holistic approach. Both systems prioritize ongoing professional development, but the PYP has a more structured approach with formal certification requirements, while Steiner focuses on long-term teacher-student relationships and artistic integration skills.","context":["The aim of Steiner schooling is to educate the whole child, “head, heart and hands”. The curriculum is as broad as time will allow and balances academic subjects with artistic and practical activities.\nSteiner teachers are dedicated to creating a genuine love of learning within each child. By freely using arts and activities in the service of teaching academics, an internal motivation to learn is developed in the students, doing away with the need for competitive testing and grading.\nSome distinctive features of Steiner education include the following:\n- Academics are de-emphasised in the early years of schooling. There is no academic content in the Steiner kindergarten (i.e. pre-class 1) experience (although there is a good deal of cultivation of pre-academic skills), and minimal academics in class 1. Letters and numbers are introduced artistically in class 1, with the children learning to read from their own writing in class 2.\n- During the primary school years (classes 1-8) the students have a class (or “main lesson”) teacher who stays with the same class for (ideally) the first eight years of their schooling.\n- Certain activities which are often considered “frills” at mainstream schools are central at Steiner schools: art, music, gardening, and foreign languages (usually two in primary grades), to name a few. In the younger grades, all subjects are introduced through artistic mediums, because the children respond better to this medium than to dry lecturing and rote learning. All children learn to play instruments and to knit and weave in crafts.\n- There are no “textbooks” as such in the first through fifth grades. All children have “main lesson books”, which are their own workbooks that they fill in during the course of the year. They essentially produce their own “textbooks” which record their experiences and what they’ve learned. Upper grades use textbooks to supplement their main lesson work.\n- All children learn a stringed instrument from class 3 onward. This often includes one-on-one tuition as well as class orchestra.\n- Learning in a Steiner school is a non-competitive activity. There are no grades given at the primary level; the teacher writes a detailed evaluation of the child at the end of each school year.\n- The use of electronic media, particularly television, by young children is strongly discouraged in Steiner schools.\nThe Steiner curriculum is designed to be responsive to the various phases of a child’s development. The era of human history being studied corresponds in many ways with the stage of development of the child. For example, pre-class 1 children are presented with fairy stories matching their dreamy state of consciousness, class 4 study the Vikings and Norse mythology which suit their war-like feelings, class 5 learn of the Greeks at the time their intellect is awakening and their sense of fair play is becoming obvious, and so on.\nThe main subjects, such as history, language arts, science and mathematics are, as mentioned, taught in main lesson blocks of two to three hours per day, with each block lasting from three to five weeks.\nThe total Steiner curriculum has been likened to an ascending spiral: subjects are revisited several times, but each new exposure affords greater depth and new insights into the subject at hand.\nA typical Lower School curriculum would likely look something like the following:\n- Primary Grades 1 – 3\n- Pictorial introduction to the alphabet, writing, reading, spelling, poetry and drama.\n- Folk and fairy tales, fables, legends, and Old Testament stories.\n- Numbers, basic mathematical processes of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.\n- Nature stories, house building and gardening.\n- Middle Grades 4 – 6\n- Writing, reading, spelling, grammar, poetry and drama.\n- Norse myths, history and stories of ancient civilisations (e.g. Greek, Indian).\n- Review of the four mathematical processes, fractions, percentages, and geometry.\n- Local and world geography, comparative zoology, botany and elementary physics.\n- Upper Grades 7 – 8\n- Creative writing, reading, spelling, grammar, poetry and drama.\n- Medieval history, Renaissance, world exploration, history and biography.\n- Geography, physics, basic chemistry, astronomy, geology and physiology.\n- Special subjects also taught include:\n- Handwork: knitting, crocheting, sewing, cross stitching, basic weaving, toy making and woodworking.\n- Music: singing, recorder, string instruments, wind, brass and percussion instruments.\n- Foreign Languages (varies by school): Spanish, French, Japanese and German.\n- Art: wet-on-wet watercolour painting, form drawing, beeswax and clay modelling, perspective drawing.\n- Movement: eurythmy, gymnastics, group games.\n- The school should be open to all children;\n- It should be coeducational;\n- It should be a unified twelve-year school;\n- The teachers, those who would be working directly with the children, should take the leading role in the running of the school, with a minimum of interference from governmental or economic concerns.\nMolt agreed to the conditions and, after a training period for the prospective teachers, die Freie Steinerschule (the Free Steiner School) was opened on September 7, 1919.\nThe main reason is that Steiner schools honour and protect the wonder of childhood. Every effort is expended to make Steiner schools safe, secure and nurturing environments for the children, and to protect their childhood’s from harmful influences from the broader society.\nSecondly, Steiner education has a consistent philosophy of child development underlying the curriculum. All subjects are introduced in an age-appropriate fashion.\nFinally, Steiner schools produce graduates who are academically advantaged with respect to their public school counterparts, and who consistently gain admission to top universities.\nHis background in history and civilisations coupled with his observation in life gave the world the gift of Steiner Education. It is a deeply insightful application of learning based on the Study of Humanity with a developing consciousness of self and the surrounding world.\nReading instruction, as such, is deferred. Instead, writing is taught first. During the first grade, the children explore how our alphabet came about, discovering, as the ancients did, how each letter’s form evolved out of a pictograph. Writing thus evolves out of the children’s art, and their ability to read likewise evolves as a natural and, indeed, comparatively effortless stage of their mastery of language.\nSteiner teachers are not, by the way, alone in this belief. Several books have been written in recent decades expressing concern with the effect of television on young children. See, for instance, Endangered Minds by Jane Healy, Four Arguments for the Elimination of Television by Jerry Mander, or The Plug-In Drug by Marie Winn.\nRudolf Steiner, speaking in Oxford in 1922, defined “three golden rules” for teachers: “to receive the child in gratitude from the world it comes from; to educate the child with love; and to lead the child into the true freedom which belongs to man.”\nWith this approach, the students and teachers come to know each other very well, and the teacher is able to find over the years the best ways of helping individual children in their schooling. The class teacher also becomes like an additional family member for most of the families in his/her class.\nIt’s worth noting that this approach was the norm in the days of the “little red schoolhouse”.\nTransitions in the lower grades, particularly between the first and fourth grades, can potentially be more of a problem, because of the significant differences in the pacing of the various curriculums. A second grader from a traditional school will be further ahead in reading in comparison with a Steiner-schooled second grader; however, the Steiner-schooled child will be ahead in arithmetic.\nA child having difficulty with the material might be given extra help by the teacher or by parents; tutoring might also be arranged. Correspondingly, a child who picked up the material quickly might be given harder problems of the same sort to work on, or might be asked to help a child who was having trouble.\nEurythmy is usually taught by a specialist who has been specifically trained in eurythmy, typically for at least four years. In addition to pedagogical eurythmy, there are also therapeutic (“curative”) and performance-oriented forms of art.","Primary Years Programme: Frequently asked questions\nFind answers to frequently asked questions from students and parents in the UK about the International Baccalaureate® (IB) Primary Years Programme:\n|The Primary Years Programme (PYP) is a curriculum framework for young learners aged 3–12 designed by the International Baccalaureate (IB). Founded on a philosophy that recognizes a child’s natural curiosity, creativity and ability to reflect, the PYP generates a stimulating, challenging learning environment to nurture those assets and foster a lifelong love of learning in every child. The PYP, like all IB programmes, is transdisciplinary, meaning students learn across subject areas while investigating big ideas.|\n|In the PYP, students learn about significant concepts through units of inquiry. The six transdisciplinary themes that guide units of inquiry and compose a year of study are:\nUnits of inquiry interweave subject areas such as mathematics, language arts, science and social studies. This approach encourages students to make their own connections between what they learn in core subject areas and how it relates to the world around them.\nThe school outlines its specific knowledge content and academic curriculum, guided by the following five essential elements:\n- The knowledge content is organized under the transdisciplinary themes. Each school decides which specific topics to study under each theme.\n- The learning skills aim to help students become independent, well-functioning, self-motivated learners. •\n- The learning attitudes aim to develop a lifelong love of learning and nurture a child’s curiosity and confidence.\n- The action component emphasizes the need to connect the student with his or her own potential and responsibility for using what was learned.\n- The rigorous guidelines for classroom practices to match the educational philosophy and values of the IB are communicated through professional development and a school’s internal reflection process.\n- IB World Schools (the only schools authorized to offer IB programmes) are subject to a strict accreditation process monitored by the IB, ensuring that schools provide a high-quality education.\n- IB teaching methods and curriculums are research-based and draw from the best educational practices from systems around the world.\n- IB teachers are required to participate in many professional development opportunities to continually promote their awareness of current educational practices and new thinking.\n- IB students develop a sense of the world around them and their responsibility to it. (See “What is an IB Education?”)\n- IB programmes are recognized internationally and ease the educational transitions of mobile students so that their education is not adversely affected if their families relocate.\nAll PYP teachers receive professional development in IB’s approaches to teaching and approaches to learning from certified IB workshop leaders. This is a requirement for IB World Schools implementing the PYP.\nThe PYP is implemented schoolwide and adapted by teachers to meet the learning needs of all students. In most cases, the Middle Years Programme (MYP) is also a schoolwide program. All PYP teachers are required to participate in collaborative planning and reflection to make their teaching practices consistent and to foster a holistic approach to education. A growing body of evidence suggests a positive relationship between teacher collaboration and student achievement.\nDoes implementing an IB programme mean my child’s school will not teach local or national standards?\nThe IB is committed to making sure that students in IB programmes meet and exceed local or national standards. With the implementation of any IB programme, schools are required to examine their curriculum carefully to ensure that there is alignment with local, state or national standards. More information on the IB is available at www.ibo.org.\nThe IB places great value on external validation of its programmes, curriculums and professional development. A recent Global International Schools’ Assessment study found that PYP students outperformed non-IB students in mathematics, reading and writing. Additional studies on programme impact, quality assurance, programme development and assessment research are available at www.ibo.org/research.\nThe PYP is designed for students aged 3–12 (preschool and primary grades). The MYP spans students aged 11–16, and the Diploma Programme (DP) and Career related Programme (CP) is for the last two years of high school, students aged 16–19.\n- Attend school meetings and events\n- Speak with your school’s PYP coordinator\n- Speak with your child’s PYP classroom teacher"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:ec0c0db6-1813-4ff1-a056-39e43be34781>","<urn:uuid:e28d13dc-2e38-44ef-9292-95976975e8f7>"],"error":null}

With the cooling, the molecules come back to their crystalline state, achieving an excellent welding result.\nAs a general rule, if once the welding process has been completed and occurs that we have some doubt in the resulting weld, such as if it has been performed with the total warranties, we must cut the pipe and repeat step by step the whole butt welding operation.\nDuring the welding process it is possible that we must face the following errors:\nAppearance of a flat part on the top of the Bead, or an excessive wideness of the double bead.\nThis is caused by an overheating of the welding surface, that has been originated reason of an excessively strength during the union operation.\nThe bead gets rolled over the Surface.\nIn case that we found a superficial V channel, that should be originated due to an insufficient heating, together with an insufficient union strength.\nbesides that, if the case is a deep V channel, the origin will be an insufficient heating and an excessive union strength.\nA V Channel enough deep in the double bead.\nThe origin of this incident is the application of pressure during the heating, and an excessive union strength or an insufficient heating.\nThe presence of bites and bubbles on the Bead Surface.\nThis point as well as a rugose fusion, resulting a sandpaper touch are the usual pollution examples in the welding process, it is originated by the presence of hydrocarbons in the operation.\nIrregular Bead size, around the union.\nThe possible causes of this are the misalignment, that the heating tool is defective, maybe that the equipment it is worn out, or the facing process has been incomplete.\nExternal Bead square end.\nThis is consequence of having applied an pressure before time during the HDPE. heating.\nDifferent Bead sizes.\nIf one of the beads is bigger that the other, this is an indication that there is a misalignment. Could it be because to the heating tool it is defective, or to the welding equipment it is not in proper conditions or because the facing process has been incomplete.\nBeads too small or too big.\nSmall Beads are the result of insufficient union strength or reason of an insufficient heating, while those that are too big are due to excessive heating.\nthe Butt-welding process is a method simple faster and cheaper to joint polyethylene pipes (between each other and with their accessories tubes) without the need of use additional elements in the union.\nThat means that the tubes which are cut are the ones – that once heated to a fusion temperature and through a pressure application- to conform the welding.\nThe welding process indicated as following:\n- Install the Butt-welding equipment (there are mechanical as Hydraulic ones) we must follow the manufacturer’s instructions\n- We must procedure with the cutting of the pipes that has to be joined. To start the process both pipes sides must be aligned using a press for that purpose, in order to avoid any axial movement.\n- Once they are aligned and clean, you must heat the thermoelement until it reaches the appropriate fusion temperature: in the case of less than 10mm of wall thicknesses, it will oscillate between 210 ± 5ºC and for wall thicknesses greater than 10mm. it will be between 200 ±.\n- The surfaces to be welded must be pressing the thermoelement, with a strength proportional to the pipe diameter, decreasing it afterwards until the regular Bead gets formed around the circumference. (Look at the machine’s welding table).\n- Once the heating time has elapsed, remove the thermoelement (taking care to do not touch the soft material) so the briefly possible, check both ends, that has the be the same fusion uniform.\n- Put together immediately, both ends applying a gradually strength (that will come indicated by the pipe thickness) from lowest to highest, starting from 1,5 Kg. strength (Look at the machine’s welding table).\n- The final pressure should it be equal to the first one, for the Bead formation and keep it as much time as the indicated at the welding table, without accelerating this process with water, solvents, or water flows.\nNOTE: Parameters such as the starting heating strength, the starting welding strength, the heating time and the cooling times are the manufacturer’s recommendations and they will be included in their specifications inside the welding tables.\nSee below video where you can check and see all the process\nIn this video, you can see the process\nLa entrada Fusion, through Butt welding operation, the 8 most usual mistakes. se publicó primero en Plastic Pipe Welding.","PPN- The Leading Source of Industry News on Polymer Pipes and Plastic Pipe Testing\nGlobal News on Plastic Piping and Fittings in Real-Time\nNEWSMAKERS: * Aliaxis * CSIRO * DuroMaxx® * ExcelPlas * Failure Analysis * IPLEX * PE100+ Association * PEX Pipe Failures * Plastic Pipe Institute * PPI * PPN * ProPEX® * SRPE Pipe * Uponor * Vinidex * WHO * World Health Organization\nWorld Health Organization (WHO) Publishes Report on Potential Human Health Implications of Microplastics\nNew Zealand Ministry supporting Aliaxis investment of €7M in Plastic Recycling\nFire Resistance of Various Plastic Pipes Protected by Fire Collars (Declassified CSIRO Report) [PDF]\nIplex Building Townsville’s Haughton Pipeline Project with PE100 Piping\nIntroducing the New Uponor ProPEX® Connection System (Video)\nPVC Microplastics Found to Leach Phthalates into the Aquatic Environment over Decades\nVinidex Seeking QC Technician for Pipe Extrusion\nWater Hammer in Steel–Plastic Pipes Connected in Series\nPredicting Failure of Rupture of HDPE Gas Pipelines Using Fuzzy TOPSIS Models\nIntroducing DuroMaxx® Steel Reinforced Polyethylene (SRPE) Pipe\nContech DuroMaxx SRPE Pipe combines the strength of steel with the durability of HDPE while being lightweight and providing a smooth polyethylene waterway.\nPEX PIPE FAILURE\nInvestigation of Long-Term Rupture Pressure in PEX-AL-PEX Composite Pipes\nStudy on the Tensile Properties of Reinforced Thermoplastic Pipes Under Different Internal Pressures and Temperatures\nMicroplastics, Their Toxic Effects on Living Organisms in Soil Biota and Their Fate: An Appraisal\nIn vitro Gut Models Reveal How PE Microplastics Affect the GI Tract\nSpectroscopy Reveals a High Abundance of Microplastics in Human Placenta\nMicroplastics: Global Occurrence, Impact, Characteristics and Sorting\nPVC Microplastics Found to Leach Phthalates into the Aquatic Environment over Decades\nHDPE PIPE JOINT FAILURE EXPERTS\nThe failure of electrofusion or butt fusion joints in polyethylene gas pipework can be due to several factors including incorrect alignment, contamination, incorrect temperature or the duration of joint fusion.\nIf a joint failure occurs, investigations are important to help identify modifications to procedures or training that can help you minimise the occurrence of future failure. This is where we can help.\nWe provide a detailed PE joint failure investigation service which typically include:\n- Digital inspection of the received sample, including dimension measurements of sizes and ovality\n- Segmenting the joint for visual and microscopic investigation\n- Elemental analysis of any contamination found in the joint\n- Peel decohesion testing\nPlastic Pipeline Expert Witness\nIf you require expert witness or legal consulting assistance in pipeline failure analysis, plastic pipeline joining methods, plastic piping welding, or associated technical areas please contact us.\nExcelPlas Investigating Poly Pipe Failures\nThrough failure analysis & forensic chemistry, we help clients improve product performance, increase profits, & resolve product liability claims with plastic pipes and fittings.\nWe are dedicated to unmatched excellence in failure analysis, investigative chemistry, material testing, and expert witnessing for plastics, polymers and composites.\nWith over 25 years of investigative experience, the staff at ExcelPlas are uniquely positioned to help clients resolve the most challenging performance and processing issues related to materials and finished pipes and fittings.\nHow to Prevent Failures in Plastic Pipe Welding\nA properly made Electrofusion joint should last as long as if not longer than the service life of the PE pipe it joins (50+ years) and be as strong as the pipe material itself. However, electrofusion joints are notoriously unreliable with some reports suggesting that up to 20% will fail before their expected service life.\nMany quality control regimes on PE pipe installations are limited to pass a pressure test on the main itself only. This form of testing omits the service connections (branch saddles and tapping tees) which remain untapped until the pressure test is completed. Also, this form of testing will only identify overly brittle joints caused by excessive contamination, misalignment and under/overheating but miss partially brittle or strong brittle joints which are more likely to fail later on in service. To achieve at least a 50 year service life all of the joints on the pipeline must remain fully ductile. Furthermore, there is no quality control procedure beyond visual inspection which will satisfactorily test service connections and prevent failures in plastic pipe welding.\nExcelPlas have been developing a new Non-Destructive Testing method for Electrofusion joints and service connections. Due to its low cost and simplicity it can be used cost effectively on all electrofusion joints and service connections on a pipeline to check for misalignment and poor fusion caused by contamination or under/overheating. If used as a standard form of quality control by a contractor it can ensure that joints are suitably welded to last the expected service life and provide a recorded form of quality control to pass on to the owner/operator of the asset.\nFurthermore, ExcelPlas are experts in failure analysis of failures in plastic pipe welding, with a large number of case studies both for expert witness cases, and smaller scale work to uncover material or operational errors which have led to the failures. Our ISO accredited testing laboratory can handle destructive testing of electrofusion and butt fused welds of any size (we have tested joints over 630mm in size), in addition to a host of analytical tests such as DSC, FTIR, TGA, SEM-EDAX to get to the root cause of the failures in plastic pipe welding.\nMORE POLY PIPE NEWS\nPPN the Digital News Platform for Communicating to the Global Plastic Pipe Industry\nSend Us Your News!!!

When a plastic pipeline fails to perform as intended, our team can determine the root cause of failure (e.g. oxidative failure, chemical failure, creep failure, over-stress failure, fatigue failure, design failure, etc). ExcelPlas are experienced with all plastic piping failure modes and mechanisms including Slow Crack Growth (SCG) Rapid Crack Propagation (RCP), Environmental Stress Crack Resistance (ESCR), Oxidative Stress Cracking (OSC), cyclic fatigue, manufacturing defects, and polymer material problems.\nExcelPlas Strain Hardening Test (SHT) for HDPE Pipes\nThe SHT in accordance with ISO 18488 is a relatively new, but excellent way to obtain a rapid indication of the Stress Crack Growth (SCG) resistance of your piping material. This tensile test performed at 80°C has become in just a few years the new standard for Batch Release Testing (BRT). And not without reason. The test requires only a very small amount of material, the results are very reliable with a very low inter-laboratory scatter and the results are available within a few days, regardless of the PE grade. The SHT is usually performed on resin material but it can also be performed on samples taken directly from pipes or sheets.

{"question":"What is the key difference between early illness recognition monitoring at TigerPlace and home automation notification systems regarding data handling?","answer":"Early illness recognition monitoring at TigerPlace links sensor data directly to medical and nursing records to detect changes in health conditions for early intervention, while home automation notification systems simply send alerts about household events (such as doorbell rings, security breaches, or daily activities) to devices like tablets, smartphones, iPads, or televisions.","context":["We have tested our monitoring and health alert system in TigerPlace, an aging in place facility near the University of Missouri campus in Columbia, MO and, more recently, in assisted living in Cedar Falls, IA. The proposed project will build on this work with an innovative, interactive healthcare service. The monitoring system with health alerts will be introduced into independent housing in Kansas City. A new interactive exercise coaching interface will connect a remote physical therapist to senior clients in the home. GENI-enabled networking will be incorporated to support interactive monitoring and coaching that operates in real-time.\nThis project is a collaboration between three different disciplines: Music, Engineering and Health Science. The long-term goal is to develop strategies for injury-prevention in undergraduate piano students. Common causes of injury among young pianists are: skeletal misalignment, excessive muscular tension and repetitive stress injury.\nThe general objective is to develop and test a prototype ACL Gold computer software utilizing the Microsoft Kinect motion sensor that includes a screening tool and intervention to help prevent ACL tears in female youth athletes. The program measures the knee abduction angle during specific jumping and cutting tasks.\nIn this project, we test the concept in senior housing in Cedar Falls, Iowa, using in-home sensors and remote video conferencing for the nurse care coordination. Fiber networking in Columbia and Cedar Falls will provide the bandwidth and latency essential for this approach. Previous system development is utilized and a new hydraulic bed sensor has been integrated. The sensor configuration also includes the team’s previous work with the Kinect depth images for extracting gait parameters of residents in the home.\nThe main goal of this work was to develop algorithms for early illness recognition in elderly. Early illness recognition (EIR) is important, as research has shown that results in better medical outcomes and a reduction in health care cost. We developed methodologies (see Figure 1) that link sensor data to the medical (nursing) records for monitoring the residents of TigerPlace, an aging in place community from Columbia, Missouri.\nHuman subject experiments will be conducted with college students and elderly participants to explore spatial descriptions in a fetch task; results will drive the development of robot algorithms, which will be evaluated using a similar set of assessment experiments in virtual and physical environments.\nBuilding on our current work, we propose to validate and deploy an innovative technological approach that automatically detects when falls have occurred or when the risk of falls is increasing. Subjects will not have to press buttons, pull cords or wear any devices. This new “passive” approach using sensors in the home could revolutionize detecting and preventing falls as well as measuring fall risk.\nWe leverage ongoing research at a unique local eldercare facility (TigerPlace) to study active sensing and fusion using vision and acoustic sensors for the continuous assessment of a resident’s risk of falling as well as the reliable detection of falls in the home environment. The project investigates the interplay between fall detection and fall risk assessment.\nEarly illness detection and recognition of small changes in health conditions are essential for early interventions when treatment is the most effective and when prevention of dramatic changes are still possible. We propose to develop a prospective innovative technological approach to early illness detection and chronic disease management using inexpensive sensors embedded in the environment.\nResearchers at the University of Missouri-Columbia and the University of Washington have established a multidisciplinary team comprised of researchers in computer science and engineering, nursing, and medical informatics dedicated to developing and evaluating technology to keep older adults functioning at higher levels and living independently. We have leveraged ongoing research at a unique local eldercare facility (TigerPlace) to study vision-based recognition methods for multi-person environments designed to capture continuous and automated assessments of older adults’ physical function.\nWe propose a carpet with pressure sensors distributed throughout the floor with an average of 10 sensors per square foot sheet; these will be incorporated onto flooring material such as carpeting, flexible tiles or linoleum. We will be able to “see” the person’s footsteps, assess their gait, and identify their location.\nOur objective is to explore new information technologies to assist the independent living of elderly people and enhance their quality of life at home, while utilizing the time and attention of caregivers and eldercare specialists in the highest efficiency.\nThe overall objective of our RAND/Harford Interdisciplinary Geriatric Health Care Research Center is to promote interdisciplinary research with a special focus on development of innovative clinical and health services interventions for older adults. We will impart to junior faculty and graduate students the needed attitudes, knowledge, and skills for conducting relevant interdisciplinary research related.\nThe dream of older Americans is to remain as active and independent as possible for as long as possible. They want to age in place, not in institutions like nursing homes. Recently, enabling technology in the form of low cost sensors, computers, and communications systems has become available, which with supportive health care services makes the dream of aging in place a reality.\nAmericans are living longer and more fulfilled lives, and they desire to live as independently as possible. But independent lifestyles come with risks. To address these issues, researchers are developing “smart home” technologies to help older adults remain independent at home while controlling costs. Smart homes enhance residents’ safety and monitor health conditions using sensors and other devices. Such technology can help keep older adults independent while controlling costs.","As mentioned before, home automation can be used by seniors who are aging in place. So, what is home automation? Essentially, it is simply a way to make things happen in your home, without (or with limited) input from you. In the sciences, it is called Assistive Domotics; automation technology used by the elderly or disabled. It can provide for remote or automatic control of devices or events in your home. Also, it can control what happens in reaction to an event in your home or notify you of an event.\nFor example, if the doorbell rings, the TV in the living room can switch to a video feed from the front door camera. Or, while you are away from home, it can tell you if a pipe breaks or an intruder is in your home. The system also can turn lights on down the stairs at night, open the garage door when you enter the driveway, monitor occupants to ensure they eat or take medications, and even send out notifications to family members if a person does not get out of bed.\nNotifications from the system can be sent to your tablet, smartphone, system control iPad, television or other devices. The devices that interface with your system also can allow you to control the settings for your home automation system including, creating new event triggers and responses, schedules and so forth.\nWhat is home automation : Basic information\nWe see home automation as an incredible aging in place technology! The basic components of a home automation system include:\n1. Controller – This is the brains of the system. It is where all of the information about what is controlled, how it is controlled and schedules are stored.\n2. Devices – These are the things that are controlled with your system. Lights, security systems, curtains, thermostat, etc. The devices communicate using specific ‘protocols’ on a network (think of that as a language). So, you will have to use devices that use the same protocol. There also are add-on devices in some systems that can be plugged into outlets or screwed into bulb sockets, for example. These allow home automation systems to control lamps or other plug-in appliances.\n3. Interface – This where you can interact with your system. It could be a keypad, smart phone, tablet or TV.\n4. Network – This is where everything on your system can communicate with the controller. A number of network technologies are available, including hardwired (wires in the walls), WiFi (wireless networking), electrical wiring, infra-red or radio frequency.\nThe good news about home automation systems is that there are a lot of choices. However, it can be difficult to choose how to proceed with a home automation project.\nDo-It-Yourself or Installed?\nDIY systems are available from a variety of manufacturers, and they are sold through a large number of stores, both online and off. They can be purchased as packages (each package geared towards specific types of automation functionality) or as individual components. This is a good option if price is a major consideration. Depending on the technology used and complexity of your system, there may be a steep learning curve.\nThere is also the choice of using an installer who can help you plan the system, suggest best technologies or options and setup the system for you. For those not as adept at technology or who want more complex functionality, this may be a better choice. Many home automation installers have been trained and certified in these types of home technologies.\nBefore you start\nAs with most things, having a good plan is where you should start. Do some research and figure out what you would like to be able to do with your system and which options are available. Talk with a few installers about the technology and possibilities. Or, even friends who have systems to get their input on what they like, don’t like or things they wish they had done when they put their system in."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:fd21baa0-1e4b-4e90-bac9-d8c118e4f7a9>","<urn:uuid:29245f3f-f6bc-4b3a-8e42-b48b10ef339a>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do Buddhism and Taoism differ in their approach to achieving harmony with nature and spiritual well-being?","answer":"Buddhism and Taoism take different approaches to spiritual harmony. Buddhism focuses on transforming suffering and ending wrong actions to escape the cycle of rebirth, with practices including meditation, chanting, and following specific precepts. Taoism, on the other hand, emphasizes following the natural flow and cycles of nature, proposing that moving with nature's flow is the path to being in harmony with oneself and the world. This philosophy forms the basis of practices like Feng Shui, I Ching divination, and Tai Chi.","context":["Is Buddhism a religion or a philosophy? This is a frequent question asked by new Buddhists primarily from western countries.\nBut what exactly is “Buddhism”, and what does that mean for your practice? While this may seem superficial, it has deep meaning for your journey in Buddhism.\nAre we losing the Buddhist religion when some call it only a philosophy or way of life?\nLet me get to the point of this article: Buddhism is a religion. However, Buddhism is also beyond what we may think of as a “religion” and is not confined by such structured western definitions.\nBefore you leave this page because you didn’t get the answer you expected, stick around to find out what that means and why. It may not be what you are expecting.\nIs It a “Religion”?\nThe desire to call Buddhism either a “philosophy” or a “religion” is essentially a Western concept based on our own Judeo-Christian beliefs. This makes us want to label something a “real religion”, or not, based on a narrow set of beliefs.\nThis need to categorize something as a religion or not can be traced back to the Abrahamic religions of Christianity, Islam, and Judaism. All three have the same creator God and come from the same “tree”, so to speak. Because these have become some of the large prominent religions, it has also colored our views of what is a “real” religion.\nWhile Buddhism is a non-monotheistic religion of Indian origin, it is important to note that there was no word for “religion” in the ancient scriptural writings of the time such as Sanskrit, Pali, and even Tibetan.\nThe Oxford Dictionary has one definition of religion as:\nA particular system of faith and worship.\nWikipedia has this general explanation of religion:\nReligion is a social-cultural system of designated behaviors and practices, morals, worldviews, texts, sanctified places, prophecies, ethics, or organizations, that relates humanity to supernatural, transcendental, or spiritual elements. However, there is no scholarly consensus over what precisely constitutes a religion.\nThe Buddhist Religion\nBased on the above, we can conclude that Buddhism is a complete religion with:\n- A central religious figure which is the Buddha\n- Salvific teachings / a salvation message that you can transform suffering and end wrong actions, which leads to the end of rebirth\n- An explanation of existence and life after death which includes Samsara, Nirvana, Karma, Rebirth, etc.\n- Monks and nuns\n- Temples and organizations\n- Rituals include religious services, funeral services, chanting, meditation, pilgrimage, etc.\n- Ceremonies include the Triple Gem (becoming a Buddhist), Five Precepts, etc.\n- Structure and methods of practicing the religion\n- Faith in the Buddha’s teachings, even when we do not understand it all\n- Cultural inclusion, holidays, beliefs, etc. (might also be the national religion or a major religion)\n- Holy pilgrimage places with most ancient ones found in India and Nepal\n- Heavenly and supernatural beings such as gods, Bodhisattvas, demons, etc.\n- Scripture related to future Buddha’s (i.e., prophecies)\n- Analysis and philosophy of the scriptures, teachings, and religion.\nAccording to sociologist Emile Durkheim, in his book “The elementary forms of the religious life, a study in religious sociology”, Buddhism is a religion:\nIn default of gods, Buddhism admits the existence of sacred things, namely, the four noble truths and the practices derived from them\nFor 2,600 years, Buddhism has continued to develop. It’s scriptures, commentary, analysis, and rules, evolved even during the days of the Buddha and continue to this day. This growth is seen by some Westerners as an influence by cultural norms of the societies Buddhism went to.\nBut that is exactly what religion is.\nIs It a “Philosophy”?\nBecause of a biased lens of what makes a “true” religion, Buddhism often gets a skeptical view by Westerners since there is no creator God, or other godly supernatural entity (such as Shiva in Hinduism).\nWesterners are also searching for a non-religion to affiliate with and are thus attracted to their perception of Buddhism. They then transform it in the process to something that becomes unrecognizable as Buddhism practiced by hundreds of millions of people worldwide.\nThe desire to make Buddhism only a philosophy can sometimes be due to wanting to “escape” the religion of their childhood. Buddhism fits the bill for them in this case and has brought Buddhism to the awareness of Westerners as a “viable non-religion” they can escape to. The thinking is that after you scrape away all that pesky “religious” and “cultural” stuff, you have found the “real” Buddhism, which isn’t a “Religion” after all – it’s a “Philosophy” or a “Way of Life”.\nAnd that’s the problem.\nWhat Experts Say\nTo explain why this is the incorrect view, Barbara O’Brien wrote:\nIn the same way, arguing about whether Buddhism is a philosophy or a religion isn’t an argument about Buddhism. It’s an argument about our biases regarding philosophy and religion. Buddhism is what it is.\nIndeed, separating philosophy from religion does not work well in the case of Buddhism. Trying to tease apart these two strands of the dispensation would have seemed a futile endeavor to most Buddhists over the long history of the tradition. We in the West need to get over this false dichotomy, which has no significance in speaking about Buddhism or other Asian religions.\nTo say that Buddhism is really just a “philosophy” or “way of life” is saying you don’t need to believe in the things that you don’t agree with (or likely, don’t understand), and can make your own Buddhism (à la carte Buddhism, essentially).\nA growing movement, especially with Westerners, is with “Secular Buddhism”.\nThis form of Buddhism is attractive to those looking for the “Philosophy” or “Way of Life” style of Buddhism, rather than a religion.\nWikipedia summarized Secular Buddhism as:\nThe secular Buddhist framework strips Buddhist doctrine of various traditional beliefs that could be considered superstitious, or that cannot be tested through empirical research, such as: supernatural beings (such as devas, bodhisattvas, nāgas, pretas, Buddhas, etc.), merit and its transference, rebirth, and karma, Buddhist cosmology (including the existence of pure lands and hells), etc.\nIn this style of “Buddhism”, faith is not required. This is because you are taking in Buddhism through your world view, your own testing of the teachings to prove they are correct, and gets rid of anything that feels superstitious or cultural (as explained above).\nThis is highly attractive to Westerners. When they hear about the cultural and superstitious parts of Buddhism, they are often skeptical of them as anything other than cultural baggage. Although I have explained some of this in my article here, Secular Buddhism is an easier thing for Westerners to accept.\nIs Secular Buddhism really “Buddhism”?\nNo, because it fundamentally rejects the Buddha’s core teachings on certain topics – specifically rebirth (which is not reincarnation, but gets confused with that anyways), and other concepts such as Pure Lands (which effectively eliminate the practice of a massive number of Buddhists).\nI can take the body of an expensive sports car and put it onto an economy car (well, maybe that will be a bit difficult, but go with me on this one…). But the car is not that sports car anymore. We stripped away the engine and other performance components while keeping that very appealing shell.\nTeachings like “rebirth” are essential in Buddhism because it is the reason hundreds of millions of Buddhists practice the religion – they want to stop it and escape rebirth! The cycle of rebirth is so central because it causes all this suffering (Dukkha) in our lives. Who wants that?! When you kick it to the curb (remove the engine in my sports car example), you are left with something that looks amazing, and probably gets you better gas mileage, but will not do what you really want in the end.\nIt is great that the teachings (Dharma) can be brought to more people, and more accessible. But we shouldn’t do it at the expense of the core teachings.\nWhile the intention of Secular Buddhism is not meant to be harmful or disrespectful to other Buddhist traditions, it can in-fact strip away centuries of practice, analysis, debate, and revisions that have created the ceremonies, rituals, and beliefs that shape the numerous traditions of today. When we strip those away, we are missing some very deep teachings that can help us with our practice of Buddhism.\nListen to this talk by Bhante Sanathavihari (around 51:16 minutes in until 54:48 minutes. This embedded video should take you to that spot automatically, otherwise scroll to that time index):\nDoes Buddhism Need a Secular Tradition?\nIn the above video, Doug mentions secular Buddhism has similarities to classical Greek philosophy. He also mentions that Buddhism is about this human world [realm] first (subtly referring to the cycle of rebirth, and that other Buddhist traditions don’t focus on the human world/realm). In-fact, Humanistic Buddhism indeed does focus on the ‘human life’ we are living in right now. It is a major form of Buddhism (Chinese Buddhism, which incorporates Ch’an [Zen] and Pure Land) practiced by millions around the world.\nThings such as Pure Land Buddhism, where one recites the name of Amida Buddha in hopes to be ‘reborn’ in his Western Pure Land to learn and be able to achieve enlightenment easier, also get the skeptical eye by Secular Buddhists. This sounds awfully like a ‘Heaven’ and classical misunderstanding of the Buddha’s teachings and cultural creation. But it is not a type of heaven. In fact, anyone who ‘goes there’ is still in the cycle of rebirth\nAs the famous Buddhist monk Venerable Thich Nhat Hanh explains, the “Pure Land” is within us and is like meditative concentration. There are different levels of realization and practice that are part of the Pure Land practice, and each one brings us closer to living in the Pure Land – right here, right now.\nFaith and Culture\nIn my early years of Buddhism, I also was skeptical of numerous cultural and other practices. However, I now have a greater appreciation for what these practices mean and do. It is important to understand many ceremonies, holidays, and other events were unique to that culture that adopted Buddhism. The two are interwoven and the practice is found in that event. It is no different than a holiday or tradition a Westerner may practice which would seem odd to someone in another culture or country.\nJust like how traveling and living in other cultures can open our eyes and minds, we must also look at “cultural” Buddhism the same way. And for teachings, we may not fully understand, or can’t “prove”, does not mean we can strip away the central teachings of the Buddha.\nFaith is hard at times, and there are many Buddhist teachings that can be hard to “see” even in this lifetime. Yet, we have faith in the Buddha and his teachings, even if that means we are still caught in this mundane life for a while longer. This can be a very abrasive thing to some Westerners who want to get out of that cycle of “faith” and just want something to prove with evidence. While Buddhism does indeed advocate that, it also requires faith because if you think you can prove all that right away – you are caught firmly in delusion (which is a major hindrance to progress in Buddhism).\nTapping into the Greater Tradition\nBuddhism has continually adapted to the cultures it encountered, which helped it spread across most of Asia and now around the world.\nThis does not mean the core teachings of Buddhism were ever discarded, or that it became anything less than a religion. Laypersons often need structure, ceremonies, and rituals to practice Buddhism, as they would with any other religion. The same holds true for monastics who also tap into this same need but also have the opportunity to lend support to the lay community.\nGrease on the Wheels\nReligion in the case of Buddhism can be compared to “grease on the wheels” to help things work better. When we look at the Buddha’s life, it took enormous effort and determination on his part to achieve what he did. If this was easy, then he would have been the millionth person to achieve it that year alone. But he was the only one.\nAnd upon his enlightenment, he had a moment of doubt that others would even begin to comprehend what he achieved, what the truth was, and how to achieve it. It was that daunting and complicated. Yet, he was so filled with compassion as a Buddha he set forth to teach by first explaining to his former disciplines who became his first monks. In this instant, I assert, he made Buddhism a religion.\nThe Buddha’s Legacy\nIn the decades that followed, the Buddha was a leader that built a community (in-fact, many communities), taught monks, nuns, and laypersons, established ordinations, rituals, ceremonies, rules, and discipline. This seems deeply religious for a philosophy!\nIn the centuries since his death, cultures have adopted Buddhism and often made it their own without destroying the teachings of the Buddha. Buddhism has always been a continuously evolving religion even in the time the Buddha was alive. While the core is the same, how we practice it in the religion has seen many variations we call traditions.\nIn these traditions, we find rich, deep, and impressive practices that can help us not only understand what the Buddha taught but apply it in our world.\nAs you step back with any biases and views you may have, and lean in with an open mind and heart, the different traditions of Buddhism can fill you with the faith to truly transform your practice.\nThe information contained in this article is for general information purposes only.

Ancestor worship and other folk practices at family shrines pale when compared with the lavish churches, cathedrals, and temples used by the world’s major religions. Some may even feel that China is actually lacking in native spiritual beliefs altogether. But nothing could be further than the truth. Religion in the People’s Republic of China is diverse and quite interesting.\nIn ancient China, religion may have begun thousands of years ago with shamanistic practices that honored the spirits of nature. Fortune was believed to be a result of living in harmony with these spirits, so it was in a person’s best interest to forge a good relationship with then. Otherwise, misfortune could follow a person, his or her family, and spoil all of their endeavors.\nFrom these beliefs eventually Taoism emerged. Although it was China’s religion centuries ago, Taoism (pronounced Daoism) was originally more of a philosophy. It proposed following the flow of nature, moving with its flow and cycles, as the path to being in harmony both with oneself and the world. This philosophy spread throughout China, forming the basis of such arts as Feng Shui, the use of the I Ching, or Book of Changes, as a source of divination, Tai Chi, and the healing arts.\nAlong with Taoism, Confucianism emerged as another one of the famous beliefs systems practiced in China. It was not a religion originally but it opposed Daoism. While it proposed that following laws, strict moral codes, and obeying authority were the path to a harmonious society, Taoism supported individual responsibility and morality. Both of these philosophies enjoyed periods of popularity, and in some ways even blended over time.\nThe arrival of Buddhism also showed the way China’s religion and spiritual practice adapts to new concepts. The only foreign religion to become a widespread practice in China, Buddhism became so popular that at one time it was considered a threat to those in power. Buddhism spawned two schools that even now are the most popular sects in China, Ch’an or Zen Buddhism and Pure Land Buddhism. In China the main religion may well be Buddhism.\nTogether, these three philosophies formed the main branches of China’s religion with Taoism and Buddhism continuing strong to this day. Even Confucian ethics are still an important part of the lives of many people.\nOther Outside Influences on China’s Religion\nBuddhism is not the only religion to arrive in China and make an impression. With trade and exposure to the outside world came both Islam and Christianity. While the indigenous religions and philosophies are a part of daily life for many people, Christian and Muslim Chinese are a minor but influential part of China’s religion.\n- Taoism (Daoism)\nArab traders brought Islam with them in the seventh century AD. As time went on, people converted to Islam from Buddhism and the Nestorian Church, and increased the influence of the religion in the northern regions. A community, called the Hui, grew as male settler arrived and married Chinese women, while maintaining their beliefs and practices. Today nearly half of the Muslims in China are Hui. As China seeks to maintain relations with the Middle East, Islam is tolerated although there have been disputes. These have been based more on the need for autonomy, however, than actual persecution.\nAlso arriving in the seventh century, the Nestorian Church was established in the foreign quarters of large cities. These did not survive the end of the Tang dynasty. In fact, even during the Mongol dynasties, the Church served the Mongols more than the native Chinese. This changed in the late 1500s, when churches began to establish themselves as a growing part of China’s religion and actually gained a sizable number of Chinese converts.\nEven an edict in 1721 by Qing Emperor Kang XI failed to eliminate Christianity, so when missionaries returned in the mid nineteenth century they found Christian communities that were still thriving well. At this time, however, due to the forced opening of China’s borders, many rejected this ‘invading’ religion at first. Christianity continued to grow, however, and despite a crisis during the Liberation of 1949, a resurgence of growth on the 1970s to 80s, greatly expanded its influence, making it a powerful part of China’s religion.\nThe following article, The Growth of Buddhism in China, explores the philosophies arrival and how the Chinese mindset altered its practices. It will also explore its core beliefs and the most popular sects in China today.\nThe Growth of Buddhism in China:\nFinally, The Core Beliefs of Taoism will discuss how that way of life evolved, its practices and its relevance today in Chinese culture.\nThe Core Beliefs of Taoism:"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:023627bc-f803-4aa0-b8b8-6663ffefe804>","<urn:uuid:fc82cd3c-4c32-47b7-9d6b-8bbcdeafd75b>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I'm researching horse management practices and want to understand - when is the optimal time to geld a male horse for behavioral benefits, and what training considerations exist for stallions versus geldings?","answer":"Male horses are typically gelded between 6 months to one year of age, before reaching sexual maturity, to prevent aggressive behaviors that emerge around age 2. Early gelding allows for fewer complications and quick recovery. While intact stallions can be trained to ride, they are more temperamental and require an advanced equestrian due to hormone-driven behaviors. In contrast, geldings are generally more docile and even-tempered, making them ideal for new riders. This is demonstrated in practical training cases like Tiger Tim, where specific exercises are needed to manage stallion tendencies like sitting behind the leg and going wide behind.","context":["When Tiger time qualified for and then won the restricted novice championship at last year's National Dressage Championships, he won many fans. This year he's off on a winning course again so we talk to his trainer, Sharon Brooks, about her methods and how he does so well\nTraditional cob stallion Tiger Tim came to our attention last year when he qualified for and then won the restricted novice championship at the National Dressage Championships. This week he was back in the ribbons winning the novice open freestyle test and an award for the weekend’s highest score (79.44%) at the Winter Regional Championships held at Kingston Maurward (full report 27 February issue).\nThis unconventional 14.2hh champion, bred and owned by Denise Kersley, is trained by stud owner and breeder Sharon Brooks of Coombe Cross Farm. We asked Sharon what she has been working on with Tiger Tim and his rider Alysia Matravers, for her tips on preparing a winning freestyle programme on a less than conventional horse and for a little more about her training philosophy.\n“We’ve taken Timmy from prelim though to novice and elementary. Everything is now geared to increasing his engagement quality and his ability to centralise his balance. It is easy to create more energy but not to keep in balance, too. Stallions tend to sit behind the leg, they are very quick to hold themselves, so we do a lot of work in trot within the pace, forwards and back.\nIf you do this on a circle, going into medium and then back to collected, it is more difficult than on the diagonal. It also develops more suppleness through the back and balance through the circle. It helps to keep the hind leg engaged underneath the horse, if you send them forward.\nStallions tend to go a bit wide behind if you are not careful. A good thing for this is to work in shoulder-fore, shoulder-in down the long side, this helps keeps the hind legs close as long as you keep pushing forwards.\nTiger Tim already has good medium and extended trot and he could go to prix st georges. There is no reason why he can’t do changes and pirouettes which both come into that level. The only thing we have to do is build the strength.”\nSharon’s 6 tips on planning a freestyle to suit your horse\n1. The key point putting Timmy’s floorplan together is to make it logical in a way that is easy to follow. A busy test can be really difficult to follow for the judges, especially after waching a few. Keep it logical incorporating all the points you want to put in.\n2. It is very easy to think you have done everthing equally on both reins — double check.\n3. Your plan must work the horse to his strengths to show off his good points and quality. You want to get the judges’ attention, for them to think ’that’s good, that’s nice’. Tiger Tim has very good extension. In his floorplan we went up the centre line halted, took two steps of normal trot out of halt and turned off on a diagonal line in extension across the quarter marker towards the judge.\n4. When you’re riding your test don’t do too much on the outside track — you are almost doing a normal dressage test. Incorporate the three-quarter line, diagonals and the centre line. If you’re good at shoulder-in, do it down the three-quarter line. In effect you are increasing your level of difficulty.\n5. Try to choose music that possibly your judges can relate too, nothing too obscure. It is easier to pick up the rhythm if you know the sort of music. The whole picture becomes more harmonious. Also, try not to select the same type of music that everyone else is riding too.\n6. As you get to the higher levels it is important to phase the music with the movements your are doing. Try to build up into a medium trot and phase it out towards the end. What you don’t want is background music.\nWhat’s your USP?\nBecause I ride and handle stallions, I feel that I have a good knowledge of temprement. Handling stallions at their most vulnerable moments gives you a greater sympathy when you come to train them. This goes for mares, too, which I think of as ‘entires’ in that they have a full quota of hormones. For instance, with my stallion even if we are not collecting from him [for AI] for a week or so, I will still collect off him twice a week, it keeps him happy and relaxed.\nWhat’s your pet hate?\nI notice riders tend to turn their horses through the nose. My philosophy is to turn the shoulders of the horse with a bend in the body.\nShare with us your signature exercise\nThis is something that we have worked into Tiger Tim’s freestyle. Ride a succession of circles, either 10 metre or 12 metre, down the centre line, from one rein to the other. Most horses are stiffer one way. This is a very good exercise; it highlights the changeover from one rein to the other and will show when a horse isn’t connecting equally.\nIf we were to ask your pupils, what would be the one thing they all say you continually shout?\nShorten your reins!\nTo contact Sharon, who is based in Wincanton, Somerset, visit www.coombecrossfarmstud.co.uk or call 07970 793821","29 Apr What a Male Horse Is Called (And More Fun Facts!)\nUnderstanding What to Call a Male Horse\nIf you have spent any amount of time in the world of horses, you have already been exposed to the many names that are used to identify a horse. Between technical names and nicknames, it can be nearly impossible to know the right term to use when describing a horse! However, it is important to educate yourself on the proper titles for horses at various ages. Doing so will allow you to more effectively communicate with other equestrians and care providers.\nSo, what is a male horse called? A male horse over the age of four years old is called either a stallion or a gelding, depending on its ability to reproduce. Between the age of one-year-old and four years old, male horses are referred to as colts. You may also hear a male horse called a stud or a sire if it is used for breeding purposes.\nAs you can see, the terminology used to describe a male horse is slightly more complicated than that of a female horse. In this post, we will walk you through everything you need to know to properly identify a male horse. With this information in your back pocket, you will be prepared to interact with other equestrians and horse owners as you navigate the world of horses.\nWhat Do You Call a Male Horse?\nA male horse that has reached adulthood is called either a stallion or a gelding, depending on its ability to reproduce. The terms stallion and gelding are reserved for male horses that are over the age of four. In some cases, a male horse is called a stud or a sire when referring to breeding.\nMale horses between one year and four years of age are called colts. Before they reach a year old, all horses, both male and female, are called foals.\nIdentifying a Male Horse\nUnlike identifying a female horse, identifying a male horse is quite simple! A quick glance at the horse’s underside will reveal their genitals. A stallion is an adult male horse that is left intact and maintains the ability to reproduce. A gelding, on the other hand, is an adult male horse that has been gelded. Once the horse is gelded or neutered, they are no longer able to reproduce.\nMost male horses are gelded before they reach one year old if the owner knows that they will not be used for breeding purposes. Gelding a male horse is the best way to eliminate the aggressive behaviors that often begin to appear once the horse reaches sexual maturity around 2 years of age.\nIn order to ensure that you are using the right terminology for the male horse, you will also need to determine its age. This is best done by examining the horse’s teeth. If the horse has a full set of permanent teeth, they are likely over the age of five.\nHorses that are under the age of four will not have their full set of teeth, this fact alone confirms that they are a colt, whether they have been gelded or not. Of course, there are other, more accurate ways to determine the exact age of a horse. However, examining their teeth will give you the quickest results.\nHow to Tell the Difference Between a Stallion and a Gelding\nLet’s take a closer look at the factors that define a stallion versus a gelding. These terms are often used interchangeably when describing an adult male horse. However, it is important to understand the correct terminology to ensure proper communication.\nAny male horse over the age of four that is left intact and has the ability to reproduce is called a stallion. Stallions, while certainly necessary for the advancement of the equine population, often display aggressive behaviors that make them difficult to manage. For this reason, many horse owners choose to geld their male horses.\nGelding is a surgical procedure in which reproduction is made impossible through neutering. Most horses are gelded between the ages of 6 months to one year of age before they reach full sexual maturity. Not only does gelding eliminate some of the aggressive behaviors that the horse may otherwise display but it also eliminates unintentional breeding.\nAny male horse over the age of four that has been neutered and is not able to reproduce is called a gelding. A male horse that is between the ages of one and four years of age is called a colt. Because gelding commonly occurs before four years of age, there is some crossover in terminology. However, if the horse is younger than four years, colt is the most accurate term to use, regardless of their ability to reproduce.\nOther Names for Male Horses\nIn addition to the common terms used to describe a male horse, there are some other, more specific terms that you may come across. When in doubt, it is best to resort to calling a male horse a gelding or stallion as these are more broad terms.\nWhat is a Colt?\nAs we mentioned previously, a colt is a male horse that is between the ages of one and four years old. Before they reach their first birthday, both male and female horses are called foals. After a horse reaches five years old, they are no longer a colt and, instead, should be called a stallion or gelding.\nTo learn more about baby horses, check out my article What a Baby Horse is Called ( And More Fun Facts!)\nWhat is a Stud?\nA stud is an adult male horse that has been used for breeding purposes. Studs are often highly valuable and sought out by other horse owners for their bloodline and genetics. A male horse that has been used in breeding can be called a stud whether or not it has produced offspring.\nWhat is a Sire?\nOften confused with a stud, a sire is an adult male horse that has been used for breeding purposes and has produced offspring. The terms stud and sire have nothing to do with the number of times that a male horse has been used for breeding but rather the outcome of the breeding.\nShould You Geld Your Male Horse?\nThere is great debate amongst the equine community on whether or not you should geld your male horse. The general consensus is that if you are not planning on breeding your male horse, gelding is beneficial both for training and management.\nStallions are typically much more aggressive and unpredictable. They often present challenges when it comes to riding, training, and management. Additionally, you may need to house your stallion away from other horses to avoid aggressive behaviors or unplanned breeding.\nGeldings are much more calm and easy to manage. In fact, the majority of horses used for riding are geldings due to these favorable qualities!\nIf you are planning on gelding your horse, it is best to do so at a young age. For this reason, many experts recommend gelding a male horse before its first birthday. Doing so will eliminate any unwanted aggression or the development of bad habits. Additionally, gelding your horse at a young age typically involves fewer complications and a quick recovery time.\nRiding a Stallion\nThere is no doubt about it, the thought of riding a stallion holds a certain allure for many equestrians. While most stallions are quite temperamental, they can be well-trained and become rideable. In ancient days, in fact, warriors would ride stallions into battle!\nHowever, it is important to note that even the most well-behaved stallion is controlled by their hormones and can quickly become temperamental. For this reason, it takes an incredibly patient and advanced equestrian to properly manage a stallion.\nIf you are new to the world of horses, it is not wise to ride a stallion as this could result in injury to yourself, your horse, and others.\nRiding a Gelding\nMost of the horses that are used strictly for riding purposes are geldings! With less testosterone due to castration, geldings are much more docile and even-tempered. Compared to female horses, geldings are also much more constant in mood and temperament. For this reason, geldings are often the best choice for a new horse owner or beginning rider!\nIt is important to note that not all geldings have the same behavior. The age at which the horse was gelded will have a great impact on its future temperament and demeanor. For the new rider, it is best to consider a gelding that was castrated early on in life to eliminate the potential of aggressive behaviors.\nRegardless of the horse’s gender or reproductive abilities, you must take the time to get to know the horse you are riding. Just because a horse is gelded doesn’t mean you can assume that they will be calm and even-tempered. Likewise, just because a horse is a stallion does not mean that it will be aggressive and temperamental (although it’s highly likely).\nWe hope you are now equipped to use the correct terminology when referring to the male horses in your circle. Knowing the differences between colts, stallions, geldings, sires, and studs will allow you to communicate more effectively and progress in your equine journey.\nWant to know more about female horses?

{"question":"As someone concerned about female health: Which is more harmful to the female reproductive system - conventional household cleaners containing phthalates or personal care products with bisphenol S (BPS)?","answer":"Both substances are harmful to female reproductive health, but in different ways. Phthalates, found in conventional household cleaners, disrupt the endocrine system, particularly affecting the reproductive system, and accumulate in the body over time through skin contact and inhalation. Meanwhile, BPS, used in personal care products as a BPA replacement, has been shown to negatively influence oocyte maturation and reproductive system development, and may cause severe fertility disorders. BPS has been detected in 89.4% of tested urine samples, indicating nearly ubiquitous exposure in the US population. Both chemicals act as endocrine disruptors, but while phthalates have a general disruptive effect on hormones, BPS specifically acts like estrogen and can influence hormonal regulation and estrogen receptor activity, potentially leading to conditions like PCOS, ovarian failure, and infertility.","context":["You love keeping your place clean and healthy. But if you’ve ever looked at the ingredient list of conventional household cleaners, you’ll know that, even though they’ve got the “cleaning” part down, the same can’t be said for the “healthy” part.\nWhen we examined what’s in conventional household cleaners, we were shocked by what we found. (Spoiler alert: they’re really toxic).\nAnd today we’re sharing these findings with you.\nWe’ve put together a list of the most dangerous chemicals in household cleaners. Use this post to sort through your household cleaning products and stop exposing yourself (and your family) to harmful substances.\nWe’ve also researched some natural alternatives to household cleaning products, all vetted by the Environmental Working Group (EWG) to equip you with some safe home cleaning product options that you can switch to.\nIf natural DIY cleaning recipes are more your style, we’ll also tell you about ingredients that have even amazed researchers when they tested their cleaning power.\nWithout further ado, here are the most toxic ingredients in your household cleaners.\nHarmful chemicals in household cleaners\nPhthalates are nasty because they disrupt your endocrine system – meaning your hormones, which are important for the proper functioning of several body systems, especially the reproductive system.\nThey accumulate in your body over time. Your body acquires them both through contact with your skin and inhalation (or ingestion).\nPhthalates commonly lurk in soaps of all kinds (including shampoos, hand soaps, body washes, and dish soap), hair sprays, anything containing artificial fragrance (including household cleaners and baby wipes), and even toilet paper.\nCheck the ingredient list of your household cleaning products to make sure they do not contain phthalates. According to the National Academies Press, these are the most commonly found phthalates:\n- DMP – Dimethyl phthalate\n- DEP – Diethyl phthalate\n- DBP – Dibutyl phthalate\n- DIBP – Diisobutyl Phthalate\n- BBP – Benzylbutylphthalate\n- DEHP – Diethylhexyl phthalate or DOP – dioctyl phthalate\n- DINP – Diisononyl phthalate\nUnfortunately, there are far more than can be listed here. Suffice it to say: if there’s an ingredient that ends with the word “phthalate”, or that is listed as an acronym that ends in “P”, steer clear of it.\n2. Perchloroethylene (PERC) or Tetrachloroethylene\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has classified perchloroethylene as a potential human carcinogen.\nIt also wreaks havoc on your nervous system. Symptoms of exposure include neurological effects, behavioral changes, impairment of coordination, sleepiness, dizziness, and loss of consciousness. (Yikes!)\nIt can also irritate your respiratory tract and cause eye and kidney problems. This is mega-bad stuff, folks.\nPerchloroethylene is most commonly found in dry-cleaning products. That’s why it’s super important to only go to a dry-cleaner that refrains from using perchloroethylene.\nShould you encounter household cleaning products that include perchloroethylene on the ingredient list, it’s important to avoid inhalation and contact with the skin.\n3. Quarternary ammonium compounds, or “Quats”\nThese chemicals can be found in products like floor cleaners, fabric softeners, oven cleaners, hard-water-stain removers, toilet cleaners, stove top cleaners, all-purpose household cleaners, and in chemically-based antibacterial products.\nLike the recently-banned triclosan, Quats promote the growth of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. According to the EWG’s Healthy Guide to Cleaning, Quats should not be inhaled or come into contact with skin.\nThe best way to avoid these ingredients is to avoid using chemical disinfectants and store-bought fabric softener. (Vinegar is a great alternative on both counts).\nIf that’s not your style, we have created a list of common Quats so you can check the ingredients of your products:\n- Babassuamidopropalkonium chloride\n- Behentrimonium chloride\n- Behentrimoniu methosulfate\n- Benzalkonium chloride\n- Cetalkonium chloride\n- Grapefruit seed extract (…I know! But this stuff is actually\nheavily processed with intense chemicals, hence the Quats.)\nGuar hydroxypropyltrimonium chloride\n- Methylbenzethonium chloride\n- Stearalkonium chloride\n- Vegetable oil quaternary\nThis is what gives the household cleaner products in your cabinet—multipurpose cleaners, kitchen cleaners, bathroom cleaners, and window cleaners—their sweet smell.\nAccording to the EPA, exposure to 2-butoxythanol enters your body through skin contact, inhalation, and/or ingestion. Once inside, it can damage your red blood cells and liver, depress your central nervous system, and cause cancer.\nProducts that contain 2-butoxythanol can be dangerous to your health, and should be avoided.\nAlthough many people believe they will be fine as long as they use the product in a well-ventilated room, our two cents is: why be so cavalier with your health? After all, if it’s a scented product and you can smell it, then you’re breathing it in.\nWe recommend using safer alternatives like water, vinegar, lemon juice, salt, baking soda, and hydrogen peroxide (available at any drugstore).\n5. Ammonium hydroxide\nAmmonium hydroxide is found in glass cleaners and polishing agents for sinks and bathroom fixtures, as well as oven cleaners, drain openers, toilet cleaners, stove top cleaners, and all-purpose household cleaners.\nThis substance can be dangerous if inhaled, leading to asthma and chronic bronchitis.\nAccording to the New York State Department of Health, exposure to this chemical even at low concentrations leads to skin or eye irritation, and even blindness. Higher concentrations cause severe injury and burns.\nAmmonia that comes into contact with products containing chlorine (including bleach) gives off fatal fumes.\nThis is why we recommend staying away from products that include ammonia.\n6. Chlorine (sodium hypochlorite)\nIf you use bleach, toilet bowl cleaners, laundry whiteners, scouring powders, oven cleaners, drain openers, hard water stain removers, stove top cleaners, household cleaners, or mildew removers, you may be exposing yourself to chlorine.\nAccording to The New York State Department of Health, chlorine can lead to airway irritation, wheezing, difficulty breathing, sore throat, cough, chest tightness, eye irritation, and skin irritation (learn more about things you should never put on your skin).\nAs we saw, chlorine produces a poisonous (potentially fatal) gas when it comes into contact with ammonia. This combination can happen even if you are not mixing bleach with other cleaning products. For example, urine naturally contains ammonia. Therefore, using chlorine to clean a diaper pail, kitty litter box, or urine mess can inadvertently release poison gas.\nChlorine also gives off poisonous gas when it comes into contact with anything acidic–which includes vinegar, lemon juice, window cleaners, drain cleaners, and other types of cleaning products.\nChlorine bleaches are harmful in other ways besides creating poison gas. They kill germs in a heavy-handed way that helps to create drug-resistant “superbugs”.\nChlorine is also highly corrosive, and can damage the surfaces and materials in your home. Chlorine bleach should never be used on wood, paper, stone (including stone countertops), tile, grout, or fabric, because it corrodes these materials. It also shouldn’t be used on anything metal.\n7. Coal tar dyes (aniline)\nThe National Toxicology Program and the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) have found coal tar to be carcinogenic. Also, the Campaign for Safe Cosmetics warns of exposing your skin to coal tar.\nRemarkably, many household cleaning products include coal tar dyes even though they serve no purpose in the cleaning function!\nTo spot coal tar dyes, look out for these ingredients on cleaning product labels:\n- Coal tar solution\n- Coal tar solution\n- Coal tar solution USP\n- Crude coal tar\n- KC 261\n- Picis carbonis\n- High solvent naphtha\n- Naphtha distillate\n- Benzin B70\n- Petroleum benzine\n8. Nonylphenol ethoxylates (NPEs)\nA study published in the Oxford Journal of Toxicological Sciences has shown that nonylphenol ethoxylates affect your endocrine (hormone) system and harm male reproductive capabilities.\nNonylphenol ethoxylates are found in numerous cleaning products, including stain removers, toilet bowl cleaners, all-purpose cleaners, air fresheners, degreasers, liquid laundry detergents, and car wash products.\nOur suggestion: avoid the NPEs. Instead, use genuinely natural cleaning products made from good ingredients.\nHere’s a list of Nonylphenol ethoxylates (NPEs) to look out for on your household cleaning products:\n- 2-(p-Nonylphenoxy) ethanol\n- 2-(2-(p-Nonylphenoxy)ethoxy) ethanol\n- p-Nonylphenol polyethylene glycol ether\n- Nonylphenol hepta(oxyethylene)ethanol\n- Nonylphenol nona(oxyethylene)ethanol\n- Onylphenoxy ethanol\n- Oxirane, methyl-, polymer with oxirane, mono(nonylphenyl) ether\n- 2-(2-(2-(2-(p-Nonylphenoxy)ethoxy) ethoxy)ethoxy) ethanol\n- Nonylphenol polyethylene glycol ether\n- Ethanol, 2-[2-(nonylphenoxy)ethoxy]-\n- Nonylphenol ethoxylate\n- Poly(oxy-1,2-ethanediyl), alpha-(nonylphenyl)-omega- hydroxy-, phosphate\n- Nonylphenol ethoxylate\n- Ammonium salt of sulphated nonylphenol ethoxylate\n- Poly(oxy-1,2-ethanediyl), alpha(isononylphenyl) omega-hydroxy\n9. Sodium dichloroisocyanurate dihydrate\nThis ingredient has been found to seriously irritate the respiratory system and eyes. Inhaling its fumes or dust causes respiratory damage.\nHands should be washed upon contact, as sodium dichloroisocyanurate dihydrate can also severely irritate the skin.\nThis ingredient is commonly found in deodorizers, surface cleaners, toilet bowl cleaners, and disinfectants.\nNow that you know some of the worst common ingredients in cleaning products, and no longer want to use them, how do you get rid of them?\nHow to safely dispose of products containing these ingredients\nHere are a few tips to keep in mind in order to do this the right way.\nWhat NOT to do:\n- Do NOT pour these products down the drain (as this will contaminate the environment and your local water supply)\n- Do NOT toss them in the garbage (as the container will eventually leak, causing the toxins inside to leach into the ground and groundwater).\nWhat to do:\n- Drop them off at your local collection point for toxic household products. Most local governments offer at least one “hazardous waste” collection day per year; if you live in a big city, your local collection point might be open several days a week. A quick web search will reveal what’s available in your area.\n- Talk to members of your household about the dangers of these products in order to prevent them from reappearing in your cupboards.\n- Choose safer alternatives. Water, club soda, hydrogen peroxide, vinegar, lemon juice, salt, baking soda, non-chemically-based dish soap, and good old-fashioned elbow grease are wonderfully versatile cleaning agents. When you are armed with knowledge about the clever uses of each, no household grime will stand a chance.\nReady to learn more?\nDIY natural household cleaners for cleaning your home\nIf you want to stop using conventional household cleaners, the good news is that there are many natural alternatives available to you that work well, especially for removing hard water stains.\nVinegar is one of them.\nA study published in Environmental Health showed that vinegar can be used as a household cleaner. Tests have shown that it kills 98.6% of common bacteria found in households. Vinegar’s acidity also helps it to dissolve dirt and grime.\nIt’s a simple, all-natural substitute to conventional cleaners and well-suited for cleaning windows, blinds, kitchen appliances, bathtubs, shower floors, sinks, stove tops, and many other areas in your home. (Just don’t use vinegar on marble or granite countertops, because the acidity can etch the stone). Lemon juice substitutes well for vinegar.\nAnother ingredient that makes for a great DIY household cleaner is baking soda. Sprinkling some baking soda onto a moist cloth is a great for cleaning surfaces like kitchen counters, sinks, tiles and other areas.\nWhat if you don’t like the smell of vinegar, and are looking for a stronger cleaner than baking soda? Then you can choose from a number of carefully-formulated natural cleaning products.\nThere’s one important caveat though. You need to ensure that each product you buy is truly safe for your health, and isn’t just a marketing hoax.\nIn the next section we’re going to walk you through what to look out for when choosing a truly natural household cleaner.\nNatural alternatives to conventional cleaning products\nThere are some amazing natural cleaners available that facilitate your move away from toxic household cleaners to healthy, natural alternatives.\nBut don’t take a product’s packaging at face value. As consumers have grown more health-conscious, manufacturers have gotten increasingly clever at leading us to believe that their products are “green,” even when they’re not.\nAn independent study by The Sins of Greenwashing found that only 4.5% of products that claim to be healthy and environmentally friendly actually live up to their promise.\nThe most common sins that manufacturers commit include:\n- Cherry-picking certain positive attributes without mentioning a product’s weightier harms (e.g., organic cigarettes; sugary cereal fortified with iron; a cleaning product that contains essential oils alongside really harmful ingredients.)\n- Making vague promises, or not providing any proof for claims (e.g., “MSM is known as the ‘beauty mineral’.”)\n- Designing product labels in “earthy” tones, or using retro / nostalgic / childlike graphic design to imply that a product is wholesome.\n- Making meaningless “green” claims (e.g., advertising a product as “CFC-free” even though CFC is a universally-banned substance.)\n- Implying that a harmful ingredient is safe by offering irrelevant information about it (e.g. “laureth-7 (plant-derived cleaning ingredient)”).\n- Making outright false statements about a product’s environmental impact.\nThe surest way to protect yourself from harmful ingredients –and from marketers’ greenwashing attempts– is to read a product’s full ingredient list.\nThe list of dangerous chemicals in household cleaners that we presented in this post can help you to a certain extent to spot dangerous ingredients and identify greenwashers.\nAt the same time, chances are you will quickly run into ingredients on product labels that you do not recognize. When that happens, ignore anything the manufacturer may say on the label or website (e.g. “plant-derived”) to attempt to explain the ingredient away. Instead, look up the ingredient or product in the EWG database.\nThe EWG database is a powerful tool that helps you to see through a company’s marketing communications and spot ingredients that can harm your health.\nBut in case you don’t have time for that, we created a list of common cleaning products that got excellent scores for health and sustainability from the EWG:\nTheir natural laundry soap gets your clothes clean, makes them smell great, and all of this without any (and we mean any) harsh or toxic substances.\nHere’s their ingredient list:\nWater, Decyl glucoside, Sodium oleate, Glycerin, Caprylyl glucoside, Lauryl glucoside, Sodium chloride, Sodium gluconate, Carboxymethyl cellulose, Alpha-amylase, Protease, Lipase, Citrus Limon (Jade lemon) peel oil, Citrus aurantium bergamia (Bergamot) peel oil (Furocoumarin-free), Syzygium aromaticum (Clove) bud oil, Citrus limon (Lemon) peel oil, Cinnamomum zeylanicum (Cinnamon) bark oil, Eucalyptus radiata oil, Rosmarinus officinalis (Rosemary) leaf oil.\nWe checked each ingredient individually to ensure the formula is safe, and we were very pleased with the result. This is a truly natural product that we’re happy to recommend. You can check for yourself in the EWG database to see if you agree and then read what other customer had to say about this amazing product.\nThis next cleaner easily removes food residue on your countertop and dinner table. It works great in your bathroom, even electronic gadgets, hardwood floors, granite, glass, metal, painted surfaces, plastic, porcelain, stainless steel, and any other solid surface.\nAnd all of this without using any harsh and toxic ingredients.\nThe ingredients of this all-purpose cleaner are: lavender oil, grapefruit oil, coco-glucoside, lauryl glucoside, ethanol, and water.\nThe EWG gave this product an “A” rating, and you can check out how the individual ingredients were rated in the EWG Guide to Healthy Cleaning database.\nHaving a natural all-purpose cleaner in your household can be very handy, especially since there’s no natural alternative for some types of special cleaning products.\nThis is one example where a natural all-purpose cleaner comes in handy and if you happen to have a glass or ceramic stovetop, and want a simple, non-toxic solution, then a stove-top scraper can serve you in addition.\nDue to the especially harsh toxins in conventional toilet bowl cleaners, you should consider using a natural alternative to protect yourself and your family.\nWe found a toilet bowl cleaner that was formulated without ingredients that compromise your health. You can read the reviews here:\nNot all Seventh Generation products are of equally high quality. However, we are happy to recommend Seventh Generation’s Toilet Bowl Natural Cleaner, Emerald Cypress & Fir because the formulation is so non-toxic that the EWG gave it an “A” rating.\nDish soap is another household cleaner product that contains ingredients that are more harmful than most people would expect.\nConventional dish soaps often contain ingredients like:\n- Benzisothiazolinone (leads to skin irritation or damaged skin)\n- Dipropylene glycol (causes cancer, damages DNA, irritates or damages skin, damages vision, affects respiratory, digestive, nervous, endocrine, and reproductive systems.\n- Fragrance (unspecified ingredient used to hide a large number of toxic chemicals)\n- Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (affects your digestive system)\n- Methylchloroisothiazolinone and methylisothiazolinone (irritates and sensitizes skin, causes allergic contact dermatitis)\n- Polysorbate-20 (damages DNA, causes cancer, developmental, endocrine, and reproductive problems, affects respiratory, nervous, and digestive systems, irritates or damages skin, and damages vision)\n- Sodium laureth sulfate and sodium lauryl sulfate (damages DNA, affects many body systems including respiratory, endocrine, reproductive, digestive, and nervous systems, and causes cancer)\nYour dishes are what you eat from. Your (moist) food spends time on the dishes, and picks up any chemical residue lingering on it– which is why the chemicals in your dish soap matter more than any other household cleaning product in your house.\nHere’s an all-natural dish soap we’re excited to recommend. It’s made from just six easy-to-understand ingredients:\n- Distilled water\n- Vegetable glycerin\n- Coconut oil\n- Castor oil\n- Lavender essential oil\nNow that you’ve learned which ingredients in household cleaners to avoid, find out how to detox your body naturally in 8 sure-fire steps.\nAnd if you wanna read more about how to keep your home sparkling clean, here’s a list of the top 100 house cleaning and housekeeping blogs.\nHey there reader!

We always love to hear from you!","Common Endocrine-Disrupting Chemicals and Women’s Health\nFemale reproductive health may be affected by a wide range of chemicals present both in the environment and within consumer products. Called endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), these substances have been linked to an increased incidence of early puberty, pregnancy length disorders, and other reproductive health abnormalities.1 In 2012 alone, the US produced 9.5 trillion pounds of EDCs, which are embedded in products such as pesticides, plastics, chemical drugs, and even personal hygiene products.1 Endocrine-Disrupting Chemical Exposure EDCs can be grouped according to their origin as follows: industrial (e.g., dioxins, polychlorinated biphenyls [PCBs], and alkylphenols), agricultural (pesticides, insecticides, herbicides, phytoestrogens, and fungicides), residential (phthalates, polybrominated biphenyls, and bisphenol A [BPA]), and pharmaceutical (parabens); even heavy metals such as cadmium, lead, mercury, and arsenic may be included in the list of EDCs.2 The most common exposure pathways are through inhalation, food intake, and direct contact.2 Personal care products, marketed uniquely to women, are a specific source of EDC exposure. The most widely found EDCs in personal care products include:\nResearch suggests that women ages 18 to 34 are more likely to be heavy buyers of personal care products, purchasing more than 10 types of products a year.4 What’s more, these women and their children may experience heightened vulnerability to these environmental chemicals if the products are used during sensitive periods of development such as preconception or pregnancy.5 In an analysis of National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data, increased levels of phenolic 2,5-DCP from dichlorobenzene (DCB), a common fumigant, correlated with earlier menarche in girls aged 12-16.6 The researchers measured a single chemical, but there are hundreds of known endocrine disruptors in our everyday environment. In a different analysis of NHANES data, 15 known toxicants were identified as contributors to early menopause in women7 while other EDCs have been linked to earlier menarche.6 Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) has also been associated with EDC exposure, particularly bisphenols.1,2\nToxins have been known to be endocrine disruptors, and what that means is that these toxins are estrogen mimetics—they act like estrogen, but they are dysfunctional hormones. As a result, they get in and they start changing things like metabolism; they start binding to receptors and upregulating things that perhaps shouldn’t be upregulated. -IFM educator Deanna Minich, PhD, FACN, CNS.\nBisphenols & Female Health Exposure to bisphenol A (BPA) is ubiquitous, with more than 90% of Americans having traces of BPA in their bodies.8In fact, the first endocrine-disrupting chemical (EDC) identified in 1936 was BPA; later, in 1950, it was discovered that BPA could be polymerized for the manufacturing of plastics.9 The United States Environmental Protection Agency has established a safe level of 50µg/kg/day and the European Food Safety Authority has established a tolerable daily intake below 4µg/kg/day;1 however, data from the literature suggest that exposure to BPA, even at low doses, may result in adverse health effects, particularly among pregnant women.9 These may include:\nAdverse reproductive outcomes\nBecause bisphenol molecules have an effect similar to estrogens, they may influence hormonal regulation and the activity of estrogen receptors.11 Bisphenols may also negatively influence oocyte maturation, spermatogenesis, and the development of the reproductive system. A 2019 review of the research literature suggests that bisphenol S (BPS), which has now been used to replace BPA in many products, may have comparable negative effects on reproduction and may cause severe fertility disorders.11 BPS is an industrial alternative to the endocrine disruptor BPA and may be found in some products labeled “BPA-free.”11 Data on current human exposure levels of BPS and bisphenol F (BPF), which is also being used to replace BPA, is reflected in NHANES 2013-2014 data.12=3 BPA, BPS, and BPF were detected in 95.7, 89.4, and 66.5% of randomly selected urine samples, respectively, indicating that exposure of the general US population to BPA and its substitutes may be nearly ubiquitous. According to the European Chemical Agency, 1,000 to 10,000 million metric tons of BPS are manufactured or imported annually to the European Economic Area alone.13 In humans, Lee et al observed associations among high urinary BPA levels and increased serum levels of testosterone, estradiol, and pregnenolone in girls diagnosed with precocious puberty.10,14 In particular, a correlation was observed between estrogen metabolism and BPA levels irrespective of the type of precocious puberty; the correlation, however, does not imply causation.14 In another compelling study, serum BPA concentrations were higher in women diagnosed with PCOS compared to women in the healthy groups.9,14 In addition to PCOS, higher BPA levels have been associated with an increased risk of developing ovarian failure, infertility, and fibroids.3 BPA is known also to cause adverse reproductive outcomes in non-human animals.10 Specifically, it has been demonstrated that BPA disrupts the HPG axis in mice, rats, and zebrafish.10 An interesting 2018 study found that in aquatic larvae of C. riparius midges, the general transcriptional profile of several genes were affected after 24-hour exposure to BPS, especially those involved in endocrine and biotransformation pathways.11 The study suggests that BPS activated the transcription of genes encoding nuclear receptors, concomitant with an increase in expression levels of other genes involved in the hormonal pathway mediated by ecdysone, indicating that BPS may be acting as a hormone agonist.12 Clinical Applications: Education Is Key Educating women about EDCs, including guidance about potentially problematic ingredients in personal care products, may help reduce exposure. Research suggests that many people are unaware of the sources of endocrine disruptors; in 2017, Rouillon et al reported that in France, 54.0% of pregnant women or those in the postpartum period were unaware of endocrine disruptors and had limited knowledge about potential sources of exposure.16,17 A randomized intervention trial for female college students in the United States effectively reduced exposure to BPA by promoting improved hygiene habits and the use of BPA-free cosmetics and glass food and water containers.16,18 In addition to education, improving biotransformation and aiding in the elimination of toxicants may also assist in fertility and possibly overall health. Food and nutrients that support liver biotransformation may help alleviate toxic burden, allowing the body to operate more efficiently and improve resilience. IFM’s Detox Food Plan benefits patients by helping them eat more of those foods that support pathways in the liver for healthy elimination, as well as reduce additional exposures to toxic compounds. In functional medicine, practitioners often utilize the phytonutrient-dense Detox Food Plan to support intestinal and liver function during the metabolic detoxification process. Functional medicine clinicians guide patients on how to reduce their exposure to EDCs and develop and organize individual treatment protocols to help the body deal with these toxicants using a multi-pronged approach that includes diet, nutraceuticals, botanicals, and behavioral interventions."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:c452bc92-a827-46c9-b36e-97d7fb72ea81>","<urn:uuid:aaf89773-9fa0-461c-a959-68535e9b2d16>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How is groundwater depletion linked to international food trade, and what are the projected changes in global water demand by 2050?","answer":"Groundwater depletion is embedded in international food trade through 'virtual water trade,' where water resources are effectively traded across borders within agricultural commodities. A majority of the world's population depends on imports from countries that deplete groundwater for crop production, with countries like the USA, Mexico, Iran and China being particularly vulnerable as both producers and importers. Looking ahead to 2050, water demand is expected to increase significantly due to population growth to 9 billion people, economic development, increased food production needs, changes in diet (especially more meat consumption), and biomass production demands.","context":["Unsustainable pumping of groundwater for irrigated agriculture is acclerating rapidly around the world, according to new research that matches crop production statistics against high-tech measurements of aquifer drawdowns.\nAgriculture’s heavy demand on the world’s freshwater resources is well understood from the output end — of all water consumption for all uses, the United Nations estimates, 70 percent goes to produce food.\nBut the problem has been more difficult at the sourcing end, which requires distinguishing between perpetually replenished surface water from lakes and streams on the one hand, and essentially nonrenewable underground reserves on the other.\nQuantifying the impact of withdrawals from aquifers has become a little easier since the introduction about 15 years ago of the satellite program known as GRACE, for Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment, developed in a collaboration of the U.S. and German space programs.\nUsing a pair of satellites equipped with sensors that measure changes in the earth’s gravitational field, scientists can now visualize what’s going on with changing water volumes far below the surface (also, for that matter, with water locked in polar ice sheets).\nFor a paper published last week in the prestigious journal Nature, an international team of researchers — led by scientists at the UK’s Institute for Sustainable Resources and NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies — looked at the gap between the rapid rate at which water is being withdrawn from aquifers and the very slow pace at which it is returned, essentially via rainfall and surface water filtering down through soil. Because most of the returns occur on time scales of many decades, at least, the gap amounts to a long-term depletion of groundwater resource.\nBut where is the water going?\nTo answer that question, the team made what appears to be the first effort to overlay depletion data with country-by-country statistics on agricultural output, to see how much of the loss could be attributed to food production.\nThey called the resulting measurement GWD — groundwater depletion for irrigation — and the numbers were rather grim in terms of the acceleration rate.\nDepletion up 24 percent in just 10 years\nIn the year 2000, GWD was estimated at 19.47 cubic kilometers. By 2010, the endpoint of the analysis, it had risen to 24.14 km3 — an increase of 24 percent in just one decade. (If that volume measure seems unimpressively small, note that one cubic kilometer is 26.42 billion gallons.)\nOf course, agricultural depletion is not uniform across the globe. About two-thirds of the GWD calculated for 2010 was in just four countries: India (7.35 km3), Iran (3.33 km3), Pakistan (2.75 km3) and China (2.40 km3). Almost 85 percent occurred in 10 nations — the top four plus the United States (1.62 km3), Mexico (1.11 km3), Libya (.25 km3), Turkey (.20 km3), and Italy (.20 km3).\nDuring the decade that ended in 2010, the acceleration of GWD was most rapid in India (23 percent), China (102 percent) and the United States (31 percent).\nNor does all agriculture contribute equally, the researchers found:\nThe crops leading to the most depletion globally in 2010, both because of their large production and high GWD intensity, are wheat (22% of global GWD, or 65 km3/year) rice (17%), sugar crops (7%), cotton (7%) and maize (5%).\nAs a result of this, GWD itself is further concentrated within parts of the producing countries where output is highest:\nMost GWD is concentrated in a few regions that rely significantly on overexploited aquifers to grow crops, mainly the USA, Mexico, the Middle East and North Africa, India, Pakistan and China, including almost all the major breadbaskets and population centres of the planet [my emphasis].\nBoth distribution factors raise obvious issues of food security — and so does a third, which the paper addresses at some length:\nFood and water security\nBecause many of the crops driving GWD trends are globally traded commodities, the threats to agriculture posed by overconsumption of groundwater for irrigation are also threats to the economies of exporting countries, and to essential food supplies in importing countries.\nIndeed, many countries where GWD is accelerating are both exporters and importers — the U.S., Mexico, Iran, Saudi Arabia and China are in the top tier on both sides of the trade ledger — and therefore face the dual risk of losing production capacity and access to food produced elsewhere.\nThis embedding of groundwater in globalized commodities also results in a “virtual water trade,” in which this most fundamental and local of resources is bought and sold across borders within what you might consider the “packaging” of grain, fiber and sugar. And this adds yet another dimension of insecurity:\nA vast majority of the world’s population lives in countries sourcing nearly all their staple crop imports from partners who deplete groundwater to produce these crops, highlighting risks for global food and water security. Some countries, such as the USA, Mexico, Iran and China, are particularly exposed to these risks because they both produce and import food irrigated from rapidly depleting aquifers.\nThe big and unanswered question in this area, of course, is how much water remains in the world’s aquifers. GRACE can measure changes in volumes but not the volumes themselves.\nEven where the situation has been studied closely, as with the Ogallala aquifer underlying the central U.S., and those beneath California’s Central Valley, the complexity and sheer scale of the geology and hydrology involved defy efforts to measure and forecast the available resource with confidence.\nSo we simply don’t know whether the glass is half full or half empty. We just know that it’s emptying out rapidly, that the rate is accelerating, and that replenishment will take may generations.\nAnd now we are coming to know more about how heavily the depletion is being driven by agriculture, driven in turn by population growth and rising living standards around the world.\nThe paper suggests that its findings could be used to\nhelp target efforts to improve the sustainability of water use and food production. Solutions to minimize GWD could include, in the producing countries, water-saving strategies such as improving irrigation efficiency and growing more drought-resistant crops, together with targeted measures, such as metering and regulation of groundwater pumping. These policy efforts need to be further supported by local analysis that takes into account socio-economic, cultural and environmental aspects.\nAll worthy aspirations, and I imagine the world’s governments will be taking them up as soon as they’ve finished fixing that little problem of global warming.\n* * *\nThe full paper, “Groundwater depletion embedded in international food trade,” can be found here but access is not free.","Presentation on theme: \"Willem Ligtvoet, January 12 1 Climate change and Water Management Policy options for the future.\"— Presentation transcript:\nWillem Ligtvoet, January 12 1 Climate change and Water Management Policy options for the future\nWillem Ligtvoet, January 12 Climate Change and Water Management 2 Climate change – dealing with uncertainties Temperature rise Sea level rise Precipitation patterns River discharges – averages and peak discharges Storm surges and hurricanes\nWillem Ligtvoet, January 12 Climate Change and Water Management 3 Risks with respect to water management Changes in flood risks: coastal and river areas Changes in water availability and drought risks Salinization of deltas Increased risks of urban flooding According to IPCC effects of climate change may be prominent in second half of 2100 (IPCC, 2008)\nWillem Ligtvoet, January 12 Climate Change and Water Management 4 Trend in weather-related disasters 1980-2009 -Data do not allow conclusions about relationship climate change and disasters -Corrected for population growth and economic growth there is a stabilization Source: Visser et al., in prep 2010-2050 -Population growth by 1/3 up to 9 billion -Further economic growth Vulnerability increases Water demand increases\nWillem Ligtvoet, January 12 Climate Change and Water Management 5 World water resources Salt water1,05 billion km397,5% Freshwater 35 million km3 2,5% Available for use <1 % Source: UNEP; WWAP\nUncertainties availability demand: tipping points Resource variability time water demand 2030 2050 Options: -Increase resource *water harvesting *de-salinization - Increase resource efficiency *households *industries *agriculture Result: - Reduced vulnerability - Buying time water quantity\nFreshwater use world wide Households 8% Industry22% Agriculture70% 20% of agricultural area => 40% of food production 80% agricultural area rainfed Source: UNEP; WWAP Irrigation increases crop production factor 2-5\nRelevant drivers increasing pressure on water Population growth up to 9 billion people with 70% in cities Economic growth and increasing wealth Growth of food production (irrigation, nutrients, pesticides) Changes in diet: more meat increases water demands Globalisation and liberalisation => shift of food production from dry areas to wet areas Biomass production: water demand >> rice and wheat Climate change\nWater demand 2000-2050 increases Source: PBL in OECD\nPopulation lacking access to improved watersupply UrbanRural Source: PBL in OECD\nPopulation lacking access to improved sanitation UrbanRural Source: PBL in OECD UrbanRural\nShift of food production increases water stress Source: PBL in OECD; WUR Saoudi Arabia -> Ethiopia food Soedan China, Korea, Japan -> Africa food, biomass Brasil -> Mozambique biomass sugercane Europe food/biomass\nWater embedded in complex interactions Urban developments Rural & Nature developments Capital driven agriculture water land conversion labour emissions food migration capital land conversion capital food ….

Use only treated water to avoid shaft pitting.\nStuffing box using woven or soft packing rings that are compressed with\na gland to prevent leakage along the shaft.\nIn which turbine is tip leakage a problem?\nAnswer: Tip leakage is a problem in reaction turbines. Here, each vane forms a\nnozzle; steam must flow through the moving nozzle to the fixed nozzle. Steam\nescaping across the tips of the blades represents a loss of work. Therefore,\ntip seals are used prevent this.\nWhat are two types of clearance in a turbine?\n- clearance at the tips of the rotor and casing.\n- the fore-and-aft clearance, at the sides of the rotor and\nWhat are four types of thrust hearings?\nBabbitt-faced collar bearings.\nTilting pivotal pads.\nTapered land bearings.\nRolling-contact (roller or ball) bearings.\nWhat is the function of a thrust bearing?\nAnswer: Thrust bearings keep the rotor in its correct axial\nWhat is a balance piston?\nReaction turbines have axial thrust because pressure on the entering side\nis greater than pressure on the leaving side of each stage. To counteract this\nforce, steam is admitted to a dummy (balance) piston chamber at the\nlow-pressure end of the rotor. Some designers also use a balance piston on\nimpulse turbines that have a high thrust. Instead of piston, seal strips are\nalso used to duplicate a piston's counter force\nWhy should a steam or moisture separator be installed in the steam line\nnext to a steam turbine?\nAnswer: All multistage turbines, low-pressure turbines, and turbines operating at\nhigh pressure with saturated steam should have a moisture separator in order\nto prevent rapid blade wear from water erosion.\nWhat are some conditions that may prevent a turbine from developing full\nThe machine is overloaded.\nThe initial steam pressure and temperature are not up to design\nThe exhaust pressure is too high.\nThe governor is set too low.\nThe steam strainer is clogged.\nTurbine nozzles are clogged with deposits.\nInternal wear on nozzles and blades.\nWhy is it necessary to open casing drains and drains on the steam line\ngoing to the turbine when a turbine is to be started?\nTo avoid slugging nozzles and blades inside the turbine with condensate on\nstart-up; this can break these components from impact. The blades were\ndesigned to handle steam, not water.\nWhat is steam rate as applied to turbo-generators?\nAnswer: The steam rate is the pounds of steam that must be supplied per\nkilowatt-hour of generator output at the steam turbine\nWhat are the two basic types of steam turbines?\nWhat is the operating principle of an impulse turbine?\nAnswer: The basic idea of an impulse turbine is that a jet of steam from a fixed\nnozzle pushes against the rotor blades and impels them forward. The velocity\nof the steam is about twice as fast as the velocity of the blades. Only\nturbines utilizing fixed nozzles are classified as impulse\nWhat is the operating principle of a reaction turbine?\nAnswer: A reaction turbine utilizes a jet of steam that flows from a nozzle on the\nrotor. Actually, the steam is directed into the moving blades by fixed blades\ndesigned to expand the steam. The result is a small increase in velocity over\nthat of the moving blades. These blades form a wall of moving nozzles that\nfurther expand the steam. The steam flow is partially reversed by the moving\nblades, producing a reaction on the blades. Since the pressure drop is small\nacross each row of nozzles (blades), the speed is comparatively low.\nTherefore, more rows of moving blades are needed than in an impulse\nWhat are topping and superposed turbines?\nAnswer: Topping and superposed turbines arc high-pressure, non-condensing units\nthat can be added to an older, moderate-pressure plant. Topping turbines\nreceive high-pressure steam from new high-pressure boilers. The exhaust steam\nof the new turbine has the same pressure as the old boilers and is used to\nsupply the old turbines.\nWhat is an extraction turbine?\nAnswer: In an extraction turbine, steam is withdrawn from one or more stages, at\none or more pressures, for heating, plant process, or feedwater heater needs.\nThey are often called \"bleeder turbines.\"\nWhat is a combination thrust and radial bearing?\nAnswer: This unit has the ends of the Babbitt bearing extended radially over the\nend of the shell. Collars on the rotor face these thrust pads, and the journal\nis supported in the bearing between the thrust collars.\nWhat is a tapered-land thrust bearing?\nAnswer: The babbitt face of a tapered-land thrust bearing has a series of fixed\npads divided by radial slots.

{"question":"What are the four distinct stages that occur during shock in the human body?","answer":"The four distinct stages of shock are: Initial stage, compensatory stage, progressive stage, and refractory stage. In the refractory stage, irreversible cell death and organ damage occur, and the patient becomes unresponsive to treatment, leading to death.","context":["Shock is a dangerous state in which there isn’t enough blood flow or oxygen getting to the tissues of the body. There are different types of shock that medical professionals should know about. And that is exactly what we’re going to cover in this study guide.\nSo if you’re a Respiratory Therapy, Nursing, or Medical Students, you’re in the right place. Let’s go ahead and get started.\nWhat is Shock?\nTypes of Shock:\nThere are 7 different types of shock to know about as a medical professional:\nThe following practice questions can help you learn more about each of the different types of shock.\nShock Practice Questions:\n1. What is\nShock is a syndrome that is characterized by decreased tissue perfusion and cellular metabolism. Cells are not getting what they need, so there is an imbalanced supply of oxygen and what cells need (nutrients). It is a condition in which the circulatory system fails to provide sufficient circulation to enable every body part to perform its function. It is also often called hypoperfusion. Basically, it is a life-threatening state of inadequate tissue perfusion.\n2. What are the four types of shock?\nHypovolemic, cardiogenic, obstructive, and distributive (anaphylactic, septic, neurogenic).\n3. What is perfusion?\nIt is the passage of fluid through the circulatory system or lymphatic system to an organ or a tissue, usually referring to the delivery of blood to a capillary bed in tissue.\n4. What are the components of normal perfusion?\nHeart: pump function; blood vessel: container function; and blood: content function.\n5. What are the primary causes of shock?\nPump failure, poor vessel function, and low fluid volume.\n6. What are the four distinct stages of shock?\nInitial, compensatory, progressive and refractory.\n7. What causes anaerobic metabolism in the initial stage of shock?\n8. Why does peripheral edema occur in progressive shock?\nBecause all the fluid your body was trying to preserve during compensation is not being moved around anymore.\n9. What is the refractory stage of shock?\nIrreversible cell death and organ damage, unresponsive to treatment and death\n10. What is cardiogenic shock?\nThis is caused by inadequate function of the heart or pump failure. The heart muscle cannot pump effectively, causing a backup of fluid, pulmonary edema, and hypotension. There is a decline in cardiac output despite adequate fluid volume that leads to failure of the heart to pump effectively. This is caused by low cardiac output due to reduced preload, high afterload, or poor myocardial contractility\n11. What is the main reason for cardiogenic shock?\n12. What does cardiogenic shock cause?\nInadequate heart function, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, severe mitral regurgitation, and ventricular tachycardia.\n13. What is the treatment for cardiogenic shock?\nKeep the patient comfortable, high flow oxygen, assist ventilation ALS, and rapid transport.\n14. What pulmonary issue can occur in cardiogenic shock and what can you treat it with?\nPulmonary edema and you can treat it with diuretics.\n15. What is obstructive shock?\nObstructive shock is an impairment of the heart to pump effectively as a result of a non-cardiac factor. It is caused by mechanical obstruction which prevents an adequate volume of blood to fill the heart chambers. Two common causes are cardiac tamponade and tension pneumothorax.\n16. How can you treat obstructive shock?\nOxygen, keep warm and rapid transport, ALS.\n17. What is anaphylactic shock?\n18. How do you treat anaphylactic shock?\nAdvanced airway, high flow oxygen, and if directed epinephrine.\n19. What is\nTrauma-based damage to the cervical spine widespread blood vessel dilation. It is caused by spinal cord damage, typically in the cervical region, which leads to massive vasodilation below the level of injury and relative hypovolemia results due to an increase in vascular space. Neurogenic shock interrupts normal communication pathways between the CNS and\n20. What is the primary cause of neurogenic shock?\nA spinal cord injury.\n21. How can you treat neurogenic shock?\nSecure airway, C-spine, high flow O2, assist ventilation, ALS, keep patient warm and prompt transport.\n22. What type of shock shows an increased cardiac output, fast capillary refill, and warm and flushed extremities?\nSeptic shock is the only type that includes these characteristics.\n23. What causes septic shock?\nIt is caused by a severe bacterial infection.\n24. How do you treat septic shock?\nFluid resuscitation by administering a minimum of 20 ml/kg crystalloid to maintain 60-65 mmHg MAP. If fluid resuscitation fails, use vasopressor drugs (dopamine, norepinephrine are the first choices). Broad spectrum antibiotics should be administered within 3 hours while waiting on cultures. Fix any altered coagulation problem. This is due to inflammatory response, stimulation of the complement cascade, and reduction in protein C and antithrombin III. The patient should be put on corticosteroids to help with inflammation.\n25. How is hypovolemic shock different from cariogenic and septic shock?\nHypovolemic shock has many varied and diverse origins.\n26. What are the causes of hypovolemic shock?\nSevere dehydration, vomiting, diarrhea (dehydrates you the quickest), burn, diuresis, blood loss, gynecologic, trauma, DKA, surgery (cauterization) and internal fluid collection (peritonitis or ascites).\n27. What is often the main cause of hypovolemic shock?\nSimple blood loss\n28. What amount of fluid loss do patients be at risk of hypovolemic shock?\nMore than 750 mL of fluid loss, cardiac output begins to fall and vital signs change (subtly).\n29. How do you treat hypovolemic shock?\nTry to restore the fluid volume and blood pressure.\n30. What is the pathophysiology for hypovolemic shock?\nFluid loss causes the autonomic nervous system to initiate fight or flight, norepinephrine and dopamine increase to increase heart rate, vasoconstriction occurs trying to shunt blood to vital organs increased PVR. Patients’ peripheral extremities can be cool and clammy. RAS system attempts to increase BP and CO. A decrease in urine output and increase respirations can be observed.\n31. What happens during the Initial Stage of Shock?\nIt is usually not clinically apparent, only changes are on a cellular level. The body has been dealing with the imbalance on its own.\n32. Which shock depends on fluid resuscitation?\nSeptic, Hypovolemic, and anaphylactic.\n33. What kind of IV is needed for shock patient?\nAt least 2 large bore IVs with isotonic fluids since the liver is failing and lactated ringers cannot be broken down. Albumin, a fluid expander in the intravascular space, can be given since it won’t cross the membranes.\n34. What happens if we give fluid too fast?\nThere will be signs and symptoms of fluid overload.\n35. What is the best thing for hypovolemic shock?\nPrevention, monitor ‘leaky’ patients and give fluids, oxygen, and monitor for fluid overload.\n36. What is hypovolemic shock?\nIt is a decrease in intravascular volume of at least 15%-30%. It is a fluid problem, loss of blood can cause this but also dehydration due to vomiting, diarrhea, or burns. Signs and symptoms include trauma/blunt/penetrating, bleeding, altered LOC, nausea/vomiting/diarrhea, and typical signs of shock.\n37. What is\nIt is a pipe (blood vessel) problem, occurs due to widespread vasodilation and increased capillary permeability, which causes blood pooling and relative hypovolemia (low volume relative to the size of vascular space), expands blood vessels making the vascular space bigger and volume inadequate for effective circulation. Different types of distributive shock are anaphylaxis, neurogenic, psychogenic and septic.\n38. What is the compensatory stage of shock?\nCompensatory stage of shock is when the body is experiencing a state of low blood volume but is still able to maintain cardiac output by increasing the heart rate to restore tissue perfusion and oxygenation. The kidneys hold on to water (decrease urine output) and blood pressure goes up.\n39. What happens in the progressive stage of shock?\nCompensatory mechanisms fail, blood pressure goes down, heart rate goes down, urine output decreased further and widened pulse pressure.\n40. What are expected findings that all shock can cause?\nChest pain, lethargy, somnolence, restlessness, anxiousness, dyspnea, diaphoresis, thirst, muscle weakness, nausea, and constipation.\n41. What are the causes of cardiogenic shock?\nMyocardial infarction, heart failure, cardiomyopathy, dysrhythmias and heart valve rupture or stenosis.\n42. What are the causes of obstructive shock?\nBlockage of the great vessels, pulmonary artery stenosis, pulmonary embolism, cardiac tamponade, tension pneumothorax and aortic dissection.\n43. What are the three subtypes of distributive shock?\nNeurogenic, septic and anaphylactic.\n44. Describe neurogenic shock?\nLoss of sympathetic tone causing massive vasodilation due to a sympathetic response.\n45. What are the causes of neurogenic shock?\nHead trauma, spinal cord injury and epidural anesthesia.\n46. Describe septic shock?\nExotoxins and other mediators causing massive vasodilation. It is caused by severe infection, which damages blood vessels and increases plasma loss out of the vascular space. Vessels do not constrict well during septic shock, diminishing ability to compensate that leads to relative hypovolemia due to\n47. What vital signs can be observed with septic shock?\nIncreased temperature, increased respiratory rate, hypotension, and tachycardia.\n48. What is the most common cause of septic shock?\n49. What is the pathophysiology of shock?\nShock is poor perfusion (hypoperfusion) and inadequate tissue perfusion. Cells in the body do not get the oxygen and nutrients they need from the circulatory system.\n50. What are the stages of shock?\nCompensated shock, decompensated shock, and irreversible shock.\n51. What is compensated shock?\nIt is the early stage of shock. The body is still able to compensate at this point for the hypovolemic state through defense mechanisms like tachycardia and peripheral vasoconstriction.\n52. What is decompensated shock?\nIt is the Late or progressive stage of shock. The body can no longer compensate for the hypovolemic state, so blood pressure starts to fall.\n53. What is irreversible shock?\nThe final stage of shock where the patient will not survive and systems start slowing down.\n54. What are the early signs of shock (compensated)?\nCold, clammy hands and feet; pale or blue-tinged skin tone; weak, fast pulse rate;\n55. What are the late signs of shock (decompensated)?\nFalling blood pressure (systolic of 90 mm Hg or lower with adults), weak, thread or absent peripheral pulses, ashy or cyanotic pallor, decreased mental\n56. What are the three causes of shock?\nPump (heart problems): MI, cardiac trauma; Pipe (blood vessels): anaphylaxis, spinal trauma, infection; and, Fluid (blood volume): bleeding, vomiting, diarrhea.\n57. What are the compensation mechanisms?\nTachycardia, peripheral vasoconstriction (will constrict vessels to try and increase blood pressure and increase perfusion to organs), and increased breathing rate.\n58. What is one of the most pertinent late signs of shock?\nFalling blood pressure.\n59. What are the signs and symptoms of cardiogenic shock?\nHypotension, portable cardiac history, chest pain, respiratory distress, pulmonary edema, and altered LOC.\n60. What is cardiac tamponade?\nFluid accumulation within the pericardial sac and compresses the heart, also called pericardial tamponade. Signs and symptoms include JVD, narrowing pulse pressure, and hypotension.\n61. What is a tension pneumothorax?\nAir enters the chest cavity due to injury or sucking chest wound and accumulating pressure compresses the lungs. Signs and symptoms include JVD, respiratory distress, diminished lung sounds, poor compliance with BVM, and tracheal deviation toward the unaffected side (late sign).\n62. What is psychogenic shock?\nPseudo-shock caused by sudden, temporary vasodilation that leads to syncope. Psychogenic shock does not inherently present a sustained problem due to inadequate tissue perfusion. Sudden vasodilation interrupts blood flow to the brain, leading to syncope.\n63. What are the early signs and symptoms of shock?\nAltered LOC (anxiety, irritability), tachycardia, pale/cook skin, weak peripheral pulses, increased respiratory rate, thirst, and delayed capillary refill.\n64. What are the late signs and symptoms of shock?\nFalling blood pressure, irregular breathing, cyanosis, and absence of peripheral pulses.\n65. How do you manage shock?\nControl bleeding (if any), put the patient in Trendelenburg position, prevent loss of body heat, and initiate rapid transport.\n66. What are the main causes of respiratory emergencies?\nMedical conditions or traumatic injuries, chronic and acute and airway obstruction.\n67. What is the timing of anaphylaxis?\nOnset can be almost immediate and is usually within 30 min of exposure to\nSo there you have!

{"question":"What is the fundamental cooling principle of refrigerators and how has refrigerant regulation evolved?","answer":"Refrigerators operate on the principle of thermal equilibrium, where heat flows from a hot body to a cold body until they reach the same temperature. This process occurs as the refrigerant absorbs heat from inside the fridge. Regarding refrigerant regulation, there has been significant evolution over time. Initially, CFCs and HCFCs were commonly used but were phased out through the 1987 Montreal Protocol due to their ozone-depleting properties. They were replaced by HFCs, which while not harmful to the ozone layer, are potent greenhouse gases. This led to the 2016 Kigali Amendment, which aims to phase out HFCs globally, with implementation beginning in high-income countries in 2019 and expanding to low-income countries in 2024 and 2028.","context":["What is a Refrigerator?\nA refrigerator commonly called as fridge is defined as a machine which is used to maintain or keep the food materials at low temperature and prevents their spoilage. The food materials kept at low temperature spoils or degrade gradually and can remain fresh for longer time. The refrigerator generally keeps the perishable items at a lower temperature range.\nWorking Principle of Refrigerator\nIt works on the principle of thermal equilibrium i.e. when a cold body comes in contact with a hot body than the heat flows from hot body to cold body until they will not attain the same temperature. In the same way a liquid (called as refrigerant) at low temperature is allow to pass through the fridge compartment. As the refrigerant comes in contact with the air, it takes the heat from it and lowers its temperature. This process keeps continue and the temperature inside the fridge lowers down and keeps the food or perishable items at lower temperature and stops or slows down their spoilage time and can be stored for weeks or months.\nA refrigerator has the following five main components\n- Refrigerant: Isobutane, CFCs, ammonia.\n- Compressor: Compresses the vapor and maintains the flow of refrigerant in the cycle.\n- Condenser Coil: Cools the high pressure vapor and changes it into high pressure liquid.\n- Expansion device or throttling device: Expands the high pressure liquid, reduces its temperature and pressure.\n- Evaporator coil: Takes the heat from the air inside the fridge and makes it cool.\nLets discuss the function of each component in detail\nIt is also called as coolant and is the working fluid for the refrigerator. It takes the heat from inside of the refrigerator and transports it to the outside. Most commonly used refrigerant in the refrigerator are isobutane (used in modern fridges), CFCs and ammonia (toxic gas and not used in modern fridge)\nIt circulates the refrigerant during the working of the fridge. It compresses the refrigerant gas and increases its temperature and pressure. Compressor is the heart of the fridge, without it its working is not possible.\n3. Condenser Coil\nIt is present outside at the back of the refrigerator. It has grill tube and looks like radiator. Its main purpose is to cools the hot and high pressure gases from the compressor. When the hot gases pass through the condenser coil, it gets cool down by the cool air of the room and gets converted into high pressure liquid.\n4. Expansion Device or Throttling Device\nAs its names indicated it expands the high pressure liquid refrigerant and reduces its temperature and pressure. The temperature drops to 20 degree Celsius and pressure to 0.6 bar.\n5. Evaporator Coil\nEvaporator coil is present inside the fridge. It takes the heat from the air inside the fridge and makes it cool. And this cool air inside the fridge takes the heat from the food materials and lowers their temperature.\nHow Refrigerator Works?\n1. The high pressure and high temperature (80-90 degree Celsius) refrigerant vapor from the compressor enters into the condenser. In the condenser the vapor gets cooled down and changes into liquid.\nHow condenser cools the liquid?\nSince the condenser coil is exposed to the room temperature and when the hot high pressure vapor inside the condenser coil is comes in contact with room air, It gets cooled and changes into high pressure liquid.\n2. Now this high pressure liquid has a temperature of 45 degree Celsius and pressure of 8 bar and passes to the throttling device where it expands and its pressure and temperature drops to .6 bar and 20 degree Celsius and partially gets converted into vapor.\n3. The partially converted vapor-liquid refrigerant passed to the evaporator coil and it absorbs the heat from the air inside the refrigerator and completely gets converted into vapor. Here refrigerant cools the inside air of the fridge by absorbing its heat. In the evaporator the temperature of the refrigerant do not changes. The cool air inside the fridge is used to maintain the food items at lower temperature.\n4. Form evaporator the low pressure vapor enters into the compressor. The compressor compresses the vapor to high pressure. But as the pressure of the gas increases it also increases its temperature. And this high pressure and high temperature vapor enters into the condenser to repeat the cycle.\nThe cycle that is used in the working of the refrigerator is called vapor compression cycle.\nFor better explanation about how refrigerator works watch the video given below:","Energy costs of condensate and other waters\nThe following chart shows you the energy costs (from pumping, transport, cooling, and/or treatment) of various sources of water…\nNote the especially high end of the kWh/gallon range for on-site AC (air conditioning) condensate (an active condensate source). Active condensation occurs on mechanically cooled surfaces (surfaces cooler than the air temperature)—where a generated power source such as electricity is needed to cool the surface on which the atmospheric water (moisture in the air) condenses. Excerpted from Rainwater Harvesting for Drylands and Beyond, Volume 1, 3rd Edition.\nNote the typically free on-site waters highlighted above within the red borders — especially AC condensate—, and how their energy costs can range from 0 kWh per gallon/liter to 360 kWh per gallon (95 kWh per liter). A kWh is a kilowatt hour of energy.\nThe average household in\nArizona consumes 1,095 kWh/month\nU.S. consumes 920 kWh/month\nWorld 250 kWh/month\nThe zero energy costs for various water sources reflected in the chart above typically result from harvesting those waters with no energy-consuming pumps or water treatment. Energy costs are incurred once pumps or mechanical water treatment is used. Or, in the case of AC condensate, the high energy cost does not reflect the use of pumps, but rather the large amount of energy the air conditioning unit itself consumes when on.\nDue to the high-energy cost of the manufacture and use of air conditioning units (and their harmful chemical refrigerants – see next section), I don’t consider their condensate to be a truly sustainable on-site water source (even if renewable energy is the power source). But if air conditioners are already on site and used, you ought to at least harvest and use their condensate in beneficial ways, rather than just wastefully drain it away.\nSee appendix 9 of Rainwater Harvesting for Drylands and Beyond, Volume 1, 3rd Edition for charts and examples that show the water costs of different energy sources and the carbon costs of different energy sources in order to make more beneficial and informed choices in your life.\nThe refrigerant in air conditioners, refrigeration units, freezers, and ice machines is a major contributor to climate change\nAccording the book Drawdown, the number one cause of climate changing gases in our atmosphere is the chemical refrigerants used in refrigerators and air conditioners.1\nAs reported in the book, Losing Our Cool: Uncomfortable Truths About Our Air-Conditioned World (and Finding New Ways to Get Through the Summer) by Stan Cox, “The air-conditioning of buildings in America is responsible for a quantity of carbon dioxide equivalent to what would be produced if every household in the country bought an additional vehicle and drove it an average 7,000 miles (11,200 km) per year.”2\nThis is horrifying due to the massive use and ever-expanding growth of the use of such appliances. But the main problem is not the appliances, but the chemical refrigerants used within them. And as history shows there is a path that could remedy this.\nIn the past, the chemical refrigerants (specifically chlorofluorocarbons [CFCs] and hydrochlorofluorocarbons [HCFCs] used to absorb and release heat) in refrigerators and air conditioners used to deplete the ozone layer of our atmosphere, and created massive holes (over entire countries) in the ozone layer. That ozone layer is essential for healthy life on our planet because it absorbs, and protects us from, the sun’s ultraviolet radiation.\nThanks to countries around the world agreeing to, and signing, the 1987 Montreal Protocol on Substances That Deplete the Ozone Layer; CFCs, HCFCs, and other ozone-depleting chemicals such as those that used to be used in aerosol cans and dry cleaning; have been phased out of use. As stated in the book Drawdown, “It took two short years from the discovery of the gaping hole (in the ozone layer) over the Antarctic for the global community to adopt a legally mandated course of action. Now, three decades later, the ozone layer is beginning to heal.”3\nThe replacement chemical refrigerant to CFCs and HCFCs, is primarily hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), which does not destroy the ozone layer, but HFCs’ capacity to warm the atmosphere is one thousand to nine thousand times greater than that of carbon dioxide!4\nAs Drawdown states, “In October 2016, officials from more than 170 countries gathered in Kigali, Rwanda, to negotiate a deal to address the problem of HFCs. Despite challenging global politics, they reached a remarkable agreement. Through an amendment to the Montreal Protocol, the world will begin phasing HFCs out of use, starting with high-income countries in 2019 and then expanding to low-income countries — some in 2024, others in 2028. HFC substitutes are already on the market, including natural refrigerants such as propane and ammonium.”5\nThe Kigali Amendment took effect January 2019, and over 65 countries have ratified the agreement,6 but as of this writing the U.S. is not one of them.7 Though on January 27, 2021 President Biden took the first steps for U.S. ratification.8\nCommunicate to your politicians and policy makers the importance of ratifying the Kigali Amendment; and make changes in your own lives, by reducing or eliminating your reliance on, and use of, appliances using HFC refrigerant (Rainwater Harvesting for Drylands and Beyond, Volume 1, 3rd Edition gives you many strategies to do this), and dispose of the refrigerant in a way that will keep it out of the atmosphere (Construction and Demolition: How to Properly Dispose of Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Equipment, https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/documents/ConstrAndDemo_EquipDisposal.pdf, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, accessed 11-1-2019).\n1.

When replacing disposable filters, matching the original type and size is important. For outdoor units like DPFs and air conditioning units, different approaches apply - DPFs require periodic cleaning or replacement at specific mileage intervals (70,000-100,000 kms), while outdoor air conditioning units don't need special maintenance like winter covers since they're built to withstand outdoor conditions and actually benefit from rain cleaning.","context":["Frequently Asked Questions\nWhat is a DPF?\nA DPF is a Diesel Particulate Filter (or FAP in French cars). It is a device designed to remove diesel soot (or particulate matter) from the exhaust gas of a diesel engine.\nWhy should a DPF be cleaned?\nThe DPF (FAP) Diesel Particulate Filter system used in a typical car diesel engine has the ability to regenerate itself (incinerate collected soot) but at some point it will fill up with ash and must be cut open and cleaned—or replaced all together.\nCan I remove a DPF or not use a DPF?\nRemoving a DPF device is now illegal in the UK or Ireland and a motor car that was originally fitted with a DPF by the vehicle manufacturer will fail the MOT or NCT test if the DPF device is missing from that vehicle.\nHow does a DPF (Diesel Particulate Filter) operate?\nThe filter medium in the DPF is made up of a ceramic core through which the exhaust gasses are forced as a result of the temperature and pressure created when as leave the engine. The soot particles are trapped in the filter until a predetermined level controlled by the engine ECU is reached. At this point the DPF will clean itself by a process called regeneration. During the regeneration process, the temperature inside the filter increases and incinerates any trapped soot particles inside the filter core.\nDoes my driving affect the DPF Regeneration process?\nIn order to complete the regeneration process the temperature inside the Diesel Particulate Filter unit needs to be increased and maintained. When driving on motorways and dual carriageways, the temperature and pressure of the exhaust gases inside the DPF is sufficient to complete the regeneration process without any assistance. However, if the vehicle is operated in an urban environment, with frequent stopping and starting or experiences long periods at idle, the temperature and pressure of the exhaust gases is considerably reduced. In this situation, the DPF filter might not regenerate without assistance from the driver. If regeneration fails or is incomplete the driver is informed by the illumination of a warning lamp on the dash and a message in the vehicle’s information screen. Eventually, the DPF needs to be cleaned of the soot or replaced, typically at 70,000 to 100,000 kms. This will happen sooner if the DPF fails to regenerate regularly. Generally, a diesel car operating mostly in stop/start driving or urban driving will require a DPF cleaning more often that a diesel car doing regular motorway or long journeys.\nWhat are the most common reasons for rejecting air filters for cleaning?\nSome of the most common reasons for rejecting an air filter for re-use or cleaning include:\n- The existence of pinholes in the media\n- Damaged filter media or damage to the casings or coverings\n- Diesel fuel or oil stains in the filter media\nDoes the cleaning process harm my filter?\nNot at all. The horror stories that you have heard about are usually related to filters that were “cleaned” by the user themselves. Remember, the cleaning and re-conditioning process is the key when it comes to cleaning your filters. At Valley Filters, our unique cleaning system has been tried and tested over many years.\nHow many times can you clean an air filter?\nDepending on their condition, your primary (or outer) engine air filters can be cleaned up to four times. The secondary(or safety) air filters can be cleaned from four to six times depending on condition. Industrial or other non-engine filters can be cleaned up to eight times. However, if there is any damage to the filter casing or media, or the filter is showing signs of aging, we will not process it. Our requirements and limits are self-imposed and serve to protect your expensive equipment.\nDo you track and inspect my filter during cleaning?\nWe have exacting systems in place devoted to tracking, inspecting, and quality control in our filter cleaning, filter remanufacturing and stock control departments.\nHow are the air filters packaged after they have been cleaned?\nAll cleaned or reconditioned air filters are wrapped in protective plastic packaging to protect them during shipping and delivery back to the customer.\nWhat types of air filters do you clean?\nWe can clean or recondition the following types of air filters:\nEngine Air Filters:\n- All round primary or outer engine air filters\n- All round secondary or safety engine air filters\n- Square cab filters\n- Radial Seal type air filters\nIndustrial Air Filters:\n- Cement silo filters\n- Fabric type air filters\n- Pleated bag type filters\n- Rock drill filters\n- Wire backed air filters\nDust Collector Filters:\n- Conical cartridge filters\n- Dust collector cartridges\n- Panel type collectors\n- Envelope style bag filters\n- Tapered bag filters\n- Tube bag filters\nDo you provide new air filters?\nYes, we are official agents for Fleetguard and Luberfiner and can offer our customers a complete range of air, oil, fuel, hydraulic and other heavy duty filters at competitive prices.\nDo you offer a pick up and delivery service?\nYes, we offer a free pickup and delivery service to our customers in Ireland and the UK. Call us now at 042-966-2365 for more information or to arrange a pick up.","Frequently Asked Questions\nQ. How often should air filters be cleaned or replaced?\nA. Generally, they should be replaced or cleaned once every month depending on how often your equipment runs, how many pets and people are in the home, and the particular design of the filter.Many new systems are equipped with permanent filters. These should be cleaned according to the instructions supplied by the manufacturer or the contractor that installed the original equipment. When replacing disposable filters, match the type and size of the original filter.\nTip: Every time you pay your electric bill, change your\nQ. If an outdoor unit needs replacing, should the indoor unit be replaced, too?\nA. YES, It is not only a good idea to replace the entire system when an air handler or condenser needs to be replaced, ITS THE LAW in NC! The efficiency rating is based on the entire system. To gain the maximum benefit of new, highly efficient technology, the entire system should be replaced together. This ensures the system is reliable and achieving its true efficiency rating. (AHRI Matched)\nQ. How do you know what size system a house needs?\nA. There are many variables to be considered before determining which system is best for you, such as size of the house, climate at the location, the number and type of windows, insulation of the house, number of people in the house, etc. A quality contractor will consider all factors, by performing heat and cooling loads, based on The Manual J and obtaining energy use calculations for any home before making any size recommendations.\nQ. What do SEER rating numbers mean?\nA. To help consumers make informed choices, the U.S. government requires an efficiency rating of all air conditioning and heating equipment. The rating is meant to reflect the percentage of energy used efficiently. A high rating indicates high efficiency. There are various names for the efficiency ratings of varying types of equipment. Air conditioning equipment is rated by the Seasonal Energy Efficiency Rating, or SEER. Heat pump equipment is rated by the Heating Seasonal Performance Factor, or HSPF. Gas furnaces are rated according to their Annual Fuel Utilization Efficiency, or AFUE.\nTo learn more about efficiency ratings on heating and air conditioning equipment in your home or business, please visit the U.S. Department of Energy's Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Consumer's Guide website.\nQ. Should outdoor units be covered in winter?\nA. Air conditioners that operate seasonally are built to withstand an outdoor environment. There is no advantage to covering an air conditioning unit during off seasons. In fact, rain helps to keep the unit clean.\nQ. Should a thermostat be set to “auto” or “on”?\nA. When the thermostat is set to “auto,” the fan operates only when the temperature requires it. This is the most used setting. However, there are advantages to using the “on” setting. First of all, the air in the house is constantly filtered through the unit’s air filter. Secondly, the constantly circulating air results in an even temperature throughout the house. However, the \"on\" position will result in higher humidity since air is being blown over wet coils after the condenser shuts off.\nQ. Can shrubs and flowers be planted around an outdoor unit?\nA. Yes. However, we recommend that plants be no closer than 18 inches from the unit. This allows plenty of room for air circulation in and out of the unit. Without this room for air circulation, the unit could overheat, resulting in a premature need for service."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:9e6ae190-e75e-4ba6-82fe-e282809f4f57>","<urn:uuid:61ad1c13-529a-4d1d-b778-1c660c387f3a>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I'm researching operational resilience. How do critical business unit dependencies compare with IT system component dependencies in terms of impact assessment?","answer":"Critical business unit dependencies involve interconnected operations between departments, personnel, and services, with impacts affecting supply/trading, payroll, accounts, and safety functions. When multiple business processes are affected, the incident has greater potential impact extending to personnel, vendors, and customers. IT system component dependencies, on the other hand, focus on the interconnection between hardware, software applications, connectivity, and data restoration. The failure of IT components can affect multiple departments simultaneously, particularly through networks, servers, computers, and enterprise-wide software systems, making both types of dependencies crucial for operational resilience.","context":["Companies may not consider the interdependencies between critical operations, departments, personnel, and services until an event disrupts normal operations. A Business Impact Analysis (BIA), a key component in business continuity planning, presents the ability to identify and quantify which business unit that, when absent, would significantly impact a company. While the size and complexity of essential business elements required for sustainability varies among industries, companies, and specific facilities, the ability to quantify and prioritize critical workflow components is a key business continuity element.\nCritical business units, associated functions, and a trained workforce provide the greatest financial value to companies. Companies that prioritize process sustainability initiatives that can meet recovery time objectives have a better chance of minimizing impacts of impeding disruptions.\nWithin each key business unit, additional business functions should be considered and evaluated. By identifying cross business unit dependencies, the need for integrated risk mitigation solutions can be highlighted and proactive measures can be taken. A workflow analysis may prioritize those business functions and processes that must be recovered in order for business continuity plans to be effective. Functions within each business unit may include, but are not limited to:\n- Supply and trading\n- Personnel and payroll\n- Accounts payable\n- Environmental health and safety\n- Information technology\nOnce critical business functions and workflows are assessed and prioritized, a BIA should be performed. The goal of the analysis should be to identify the potential impacts of identified risks, uncontrolled threats, and potential non-specific events on these business functions and dynamic processes. Any potential resilience capabilities should be prioritized and mitigation opportunities should be examined. Operational and process managers should explore and quantify the following aspects to initiate the BIA process:\n- Identify critical operational time periods when an interruption would have greater impacts (seasonal, end of quarter, specific month, etc.).\n- Priorities should be determined if an interruption during high-output timeframes creates amplified operational and financial impacts.\n- Indicate how likely each specific threat could occur, considering existing capabilities, mitigation measures, and history.\n- Identify the duration and point in time when an interruption would impair operational processes and have financial impact.\n- Estimate the maximum allowable downtime for each specific business function\n- Consider downtime impacts from less than 1 hour to greater than one month\n- Identify staffing level requirements (including contractors or suppliers) to meet typical daily productivity goals, as well as recovery time objectives.\n- Identify the effects associated with a business unit interruption, considering existing mitigation measures. These may include, but are not limited to:\n- Lost sales and income\n- Negative cash flow resulting from delayed sales or income\n- Increased expenses due to overtime, outsourcing or other operations that increase costs\n- Regulatory fines and legal implications\n- Contractual penalties or loss of contractual bonuses\n- Customer dissatisfaction or withdrawal\n- Delay of business plan execution or strategic initiatives\n- Identify the time frame necessary to recover specific critical processes under existing capabilities and, if possible, potentially altered conditions.\n- Determine and quantify financial impacts, considering existing mitigation measures.\n- Critical functions that have the highest financial impacts should be prioritized in business continuity plans.\nIf a business continuity incident affects two or more business processes, the incident has a greater potential for impact. Interoperable communication and coordination among departments must be exercised for a swift recovery. The effects of a multi-tiered business continuity event can extend beyond the facility borders to affect personnel, multiple critical business processes, vendors or suppliers, and customers.\nAdverse information technology (IT) conditions may affect numerous company departments, units and functions. IT components may include networks, servers, desktop and laptop computers and wireless devices. The ability to utilize both office productivity and enterprise-wide software may be essential to restore normal operations. Therefore, time critical recovery strategies for information technology, such as exercised data backup and restoration procedures, should be developed in order to limit the effects of interruptions across multiple business units.\nOnce critical business units are identified and the BIA is completed, companies can develop an applicable business continuity plan, ensuring a faster state of recovery.","IT Disaster Recovery Plan\nData Backup Plan\nBusinesses large and small create and manage large volumes of electronic information or data. Much of that data is important. Some data is vital to the survival and continued operation of the business. The impact of data loss or corruption from hardware failure, human error, hacking or malware could be significant. A plan for data backup and restoration of electronic information is essential.\nAn information technology disaster recovery plan (IT DRP) should be developed in conjunction with the business continuity plan. Priorities and recovery time objectives for information technology should be developed during the business impact analysis. Technology recovery strategies should be developed to restore hardware, applications and data in time to meet the needs of the business recovery.\nPriorities for IT recovery should be consistent with the priorities for recovery of business functions and processes that were developed during the business impact analysis. IT resources required to support time-sensitive business functions and processes should also be identified. The recovery time for an IT resource should match the recovery time objective for the business function or process that depends on the IT resource.\nRecovery strategies should be developed to anticipate the loss of one or more of the following system components:\n- Computer room environment (secure computer room with climate control, conditioned and backup power supply, etc.)\n- Hardware (networks, servers, desktop and laptop computers, wireless devices and peripherals)\n- Connectivity to a service provider (fiber, cable, wireless, etc.)\n- Software applications (electronic data interchange, electronic mail, enterprise resource management, office productivity, etc.)\n- Data and restoration\nDeveloping an IT Disaster Recovery Plan\nBusinesses should develop an IT disaster recovery plan. It begins by compiling an inventory of hardware (e.g. servers, desktops, laptops and wireless devices), software applications and data. The plan should include a strategy to ensure that all critical information is backed up.\nIdentify critical software applications and data and the hardware required to run them. Using standardized hardware will help to replicate and reimage new hardware. Ensure that copies of program software are available to enable re-installation on replacement equipment. Prioritize hardware and software restoration.\nDocument the IT disaster recovery plan as part of the business continuity plan. Test the plan periodically to make sure that it works.\nBusinesses generate large amounts of data and data files are changing throughout the workday. Data can be lost, corrupted, compromised or stolen through hardware failure, human error, hacking and malware. Loss or corruption of data could result in significant business disruption.\nData backup and recovery should be an integral part of the business continuity plan and information technology disaster recovery plan. Developing a data backup strategy begins with identifying what data to backup, selecting and implementing hardware and software backup procedures, scheduling and conducting backups and periodically validating that data has been accurately backed up.\nDeveloping the Data Backup Plan\nIdentify data on network servers, desktop computers, laptop computers and wireless devices that needs to be backed up, along with other hard copy records and information. The backup plan should include regularly scheduled backups from wireless devices, laptop computers and desktop computers to a network server. Data on the server then can be backed up. Backing up hard copy vital records can be accomplished by scanning paper records into digital formats and allowing them to be backed up along with other digital data.\nData should be backed up frequently. The business impact analysis should evaluate the potential for lost data and define the “recovery point objective.” Data restoration times should be confirmed and compared with the IT and business function recovery time objectives.\nResources for Information Technology Disaster Recovery Planning\n- Computer Security Resource Center - National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Computer Security Division Special Publications\n- Contingency Planning Guide for Federal Information Systems - NIST Special Publication 800-34 Rev. 1\n- Guide to Test, Training, and Exercise Programs for IT Plans and Capabilities – NIST Special Publication 800-84\n- Building An Information Technology Security Awareness and Training Program - NIST Special Publication 800-50"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:53abadb8-85ff-46da-a781-84cded3b7c01>","<urn:uuid:74d348dc-5e76-4b25-94cf-a0da34d1c591>"],"error":null}

Chemists have studied those preparations of the atoms, and located that each substance is a few kind of association of atoms. to demonstrate this concept, allow us to think of one other instance. If we pass right into a box of small violets, we all know what “that scent” is. it truly is a few type of molecule, or association of atoms, that has labored its means into our noses. to begin with, how did it paintings its method in? that's fairly effortless.

The six carbons which shape a hoop don't shape a flat ring, yet a type of “puckered” ring. the entire angles and distances are identified. So a chemical formulation is in simple terms an image of the sort of molecule. whilst the chemist writes this sort of factor at the blackboard, he's attempting to “draw,” approximately conversing, in dimensions. for instance, we see a “ring” of six carbons, and a “chain” of carbons placing at the finish, with an oxygen moment from the tip, 3 hydrogens tied to that carbon, carbons and 3 hydrogens sticking up the following, and so forth. determine 1-9 How does the chemist locate what the association is? He mixes bottles choked with stuff jointly, and if it turns crimson, it tells him that it comprises one hydrogen and carbons tied on right here; if it turns blue, nevertheless, that isn't the approach it truly is in any respect. this is often some of the most marvelous items of detective paintings that has ever been done—organic chemistry. to find the association of the atoms in those tremendously advanced arrays the chemist appears to be like at what occurs while he mixes diverse components jointly.\n- Alice in Quantumland: An Allegory of Quantum Physics\n- Physics for the Inquiring Mind: The Methods, Nature, and Philosophy of Physical Science","Ships same day or next business day via UPS (Priority Mail for AK/HI/APO/PO Boxes)!

The method specifically involves the application of many layers of ground marble dust and slaked lime. It was traditionally used by a particular caste of Masons in Rajasthan as a way of finishing walls and floors to give them a high polished sheen.","context":["Muirne Kate Dineen\nMuirne Kate Dineen is in essence a colour artist. She has worked in many different mediums, but has pared this down to two main elements in her work, both concerned with the concept of ‘building colour’ as a physical object.\nThe first of these elements is the process of Araash Fresco, an ancient and complex tradition of Fresco painting believed to have come originally from the area of Rajasthan in Western India and which dates back to pre Sultanate periods in Indian histoty. It is a built surface made up of Marble dust, slaked lime and pigments. Dineen has learnt and customised this practise in order to suit her own work.\nThe second and more recent addition to her practise is the use of Concrete in her work, a common and universal material, which provides a different method and opportunity of building colour as form. It is mainly these two processes that are referred to in the description and explanation of images, both in the Art work for exhibition purposes, and her work within an architectural context.\nKate Dineen’s deceptively spare and simple ‘sculptures’ straddle the traditional and the contemporary and embrace both Indian and Western art. Her large polished blocks of intense colour, and her smooth egg shaped sculptures call to mind the formal concerns of an artist like Mark Rothko, as well as the cross-cultural and multi-media range of someone like Anish Kapoor. The complexes of Indian mythology also come to mind, but more than anything, there is pure, intense, luminous colour and an evocative tactile quality: you want to touch them, to run your hands along their smooth surfaces.\nDineen’s initial interest in India was perhaps not so unusual, but the country drew her back over and over, almost against her will; in her words ‘it was the anarchy of colour…’ But that anarchy, as it manifested in the colour and the quality of light there, has been continuously and intensely compelling to an artist already immersed in the visual language of colour.\nDineen graduated with a first class honors from the London Colledge of Printing where she studies Graphic Design. She then went on to attend the Royal College of Art where she received an MA in Textiles and Illustration. In 1988 she received a British council/Commonwealth Arts scholarship to study “Araash” a kind of Fresco painting originating from Rajasthan in Western India. The method, involving the application of many layers of ground marble dust, and slaked lime was traditionally used by a particular caste of Masons, essentially as a way of finishing of walls and floors and giving them a high polished sheen. Dineen eventually earned a studio based PhD from the Royal College of Art that focused on the process. What she recognized was a method of working that could achieve the kind of rich reverberating colour that she sought “There’s something about this – It’s very uncompromising – the idea that I can build a solid three-dimensional block of pure colour, I like the weight of it, the fact that there is nothing lightweight or ephemeral.”\nDineen’s work is anything but ephemeral, though it is about absence as well as presence. In her sculptures and installations, she has eliminated all superfluous detail, rendering each piece down to its minimal and spare essence – the inevitable merging of shape and colour. Still she has given a form that could seem remote and conceptual, a tactility and physicality – even an earthy quality – that draws the viewer in. Some of the square or oblong installations have a seam running down the middle where Dineen has joined one half to the other, suggesting a membrane or skin, with a scar running down the centre. With their intense, luminous colour, there is something nearly alive about these objects – they practically glow. The sensual egg-shaped pieces are based on Shiva Linghams, stones that turn up when riverbeds dry out. The stones, which have been tossed and turned by the river and marked and sworn smooth by the water, are picked up and often used in the context of worship, often to worship Shiva, the Hindu god who represents masculine energy. The shape is phallic clearly, but it might also be read as it’s opposite, an egg form suggesting feminine characteristics of birth and rebirth, sexuality and creation. The very idea of the Lingham, calls up its opposite the (feminine) Yoni, or the concavity into which the Lingham fits. There is always this same sense of balance in Dineen’s work. The simplicity of the forms, which engenders a certain feeling of serenity, recalling Hindi chakras, and abstract representations of gods and symbols – Balancing again with the clean lines and simple repetitive shapes within the practices of modern art.\nDineen’s installations, to a rare degree, burst with colour, rich, lush, deep colour – Blood reds, Lapis blues, rich mustardy yellows, deep pinks. “I want people to be enveloped by colour, to be swallowed by it.”\nHer minimal meditative installations do just that, by enveloping and drawing you into a state of contemplation.\nIn addition to her own personal work, Dineen has also been very interested and involved in working within an architectural context, on projects both in the UK and overseas. Taking and applying her sense of colour and surface as an integral element of the buildings she has worked on. Using large seamless expanses of colour as intrinsic and elemental elements to the buildings for both interior and exterior.\nFor example Dineen’s collaboration with the Architectural practice ‘Studio Mumbai’ over the last sixteen years has built on her own personal relationship with colour as substance, and it’s role within a contemporary architectural context. She has explored a range and variety of materials and has been drawn to concrete, in part as an antidote to the extreme precious nature of the Araash process. It is an ironic choice, concrete being the material which essentially displaced and replaced the art of Araash within its own architectural context in India in the last century. Dineen has embraced the challenge to find and demonstrate the potential and intrinsic beauty of cement, a universal and cheap material, and to work with it in tandem with her continuing work in the Araash Fresco process, building pure colour as form, continuing a lasting preoccupation which runs through all her work.\nText taken from articles by Jean Dykstra, courtesy ‘Kashya Hilderbrand Gallery’, and Bettina Von Hase, courtesy ‘Vogue Magazine’."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:a6f3c917-cfcd-4218-af77-64375427dccd>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the main objectives of the proposed pipeline test facility in the US, and what unique challenges are faced during pipeline emergency rescues in river areas?","answer":"The proposed pipeline test facility aims to validate new safety technologies, test leak detection systems under real-world conditions, and explore safe trenching methods for retrofitting existing pipelines. It would include a buried 'flow-loop' pipeline with engineered orifices to simulate leaks, using water and compressed air as proxies for oil and natural gas. The facility would help both operators and regulators validate technologies more quickly. Regarding emergency rescues in river areas, the main challenges include difficulty in identifying pipeline safety status due to turbid water and inability to determine floating pipe conditions, restricted rescue operations due to high water flow and velocity, and problems accessing rescue sites with heavy equipment. Additionally, during floods, the poor terrain and loose sediment structure of riverbeds create significant risks for rescue operations and scaffolding construction.","context":["FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\nOctober 24, 2018\nFiber Optic Sensing Association\nContact: Mark Uncapher\nWASHINGTON DC – OCTOBER 24, 2018 – The Fiber Optic Sensing Association (FOSA) today called for the federal government and the pipeline industry to work together to establish a pipeline safety test facility in the United States.\n“Other U.S. transportation sectors systematically improve safety through government-supported research facilities,” said FOSA Chairman Mike Hines of OFS. “The Federal Aviation Administration, Federal Railroad Administration, Federal Highway Administration, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, and others have facilities for validation of new technologies and techniques, but no such facility exists for pipelines. A comprehensive pipeline test facility operating under real-world conditions would benefit the industry, government regulators, and the public.”\n“Pipeline operators are constantly working to deploy new safety technologies,” Mark Uncapher, FOSA Director said, “but when it comes to testing the technologies on active pipelines, there are limitations. Bringing advanced pipeline monitoring technologies more quickly into service can help address the public’s safety concerns.”\nTo determine industry interest, FOSA interviewed safety officials with numerous pipeline operators.\n“Based on the operators’ input, we believe what’s needed is a buried ‘flow-loop’ pipeline with engineered, controllable orifices to emulate leaking pipes under real-world environmental conditions,” said Dr. Chris Minto of OptaSense, the FOSA Technology Committee Chair. “Furthermore, water and compressed air could serve as proxies to oil and natural gas to manage safety and environmental concerns when creating temporary leak on this test platform to validate leak detection technologies.”\nThe facility also would be used to address the question of retrofitting new safety technologies to previously installed pipelines.\nGareth Lees of AP Sensing, who led the FOSA process for interviewing pipeline operators on the test facility concept, commented, “Retrofitting is a big focus of the pipeline sector right now. Trenching near a buried pipeline is challenging because you risk puncturing the pipe. FOSA companies are working on ways to trench safely, but like leak detection technology, trenching technologies need to be validated to the satisfaction of the operator and a scaled pipeline test facility would help in proving out new and safer methods of sensor installation.”\nAccording to Uncapher, a pipeline test facility would also help regulators do their jobs. “Increasingly, pipeline regulators are expected to explore technology solutions. With a facility of this nature, they would have a place to do that, and sooner, helping the public benefit from such technologies more quickly.”\nFOSA’s concept diagram anticipates the testing of both internal and external safety technology, the incorporation of “noisy” environments such as highways, and the use of different soil types at different locations along the test pipeline.\n“FOSA’s concept diagram is framed around operator’s number-one must-have: Real life validation of advanced leak detection technologies incorporating differing soil conditions and background activity such as highways or railroads,” added Chris Minto.\nAs a next step, FOSA suggests that government and industry work together on an engineering study of the proposed facility.\n“Bottom line, we think a facility of this nature will help reduce pipeline incidents,” Hines said. “That’s the goal of both pipeline operators and technology companies. We look forward to working with interested parties to make this a reality.”\nTHE FIBER OPTIC SENSING ASSOCIATION (FOSA)\nFOSA is a non-profit organization created in Washington DC in 2017 with the mission of educating industry, government and the public on the benefits of fiber optic sensing.

Measures have been proposed from the perspectives of pipeline process operation, pipeline protection, and disaster prevention and control, providing suggestions for improving geological disaster prevention and control in river and valley areas, and providing reference for future pipeline disaster prevention and rescue operations.\nChina's oil and gas pipelines have a long route and a wide distribution area. They almost cross all landform units in China, and the natural geographical conditions such as terrain, topography, and meteorology along the pipeline, as well as the complex and diverse geological backgrounds of geological formations, structures, hydraulic engineering, and environmental geology. Every year during the flood season, geological disasters occur frequently in areas such as high mountains and valleys, river crossings, and loess distribution areas, and oil and gas pipelines are inevitably threatened by geological disasters. For this reason, pipeline enterprises need to spend a huge amount of manpower and material resources on emergency pipeline rescue every year.\n1. Characteristics of Disasters in River and Valley Areas\n1.1 Development of Geological Hazards\nThe pipeline laying methods in mountainous areas can be divided into horizontal slope laying section and vertical slope laying section. Taking the 4084 geological disasters identified in the Se'ninglan, Lanchengyu, Zhongwu, and Lanzhengchang pipelines from 2005 to 2010 as an example, more than 90% of water damage disasters occur in river and valley areas, while other disasters such as landslides are mainly distributed in the horizontal slope laying section of mountainous areas (Figure 1 and Figure 2).\n1.2 Scale of Geological Hazards\nThe development of geological hazards is closely related to their own gravitational potential energy and water kinetic energy. The terrain in the valley area is steep, with a large drop, and the accumulated potential energy of the rock and soil volume is high. The water flow speed and kinetic energy in the river area are high, resulting in a large scale and high risk of geological disasters in these areas, and serious consequences of accidents. According to statistics, landslides are the main cause of oil and gas pipeline breakage. Mudslides, floods, and water damage to river channels often lead to long-distance suspension of pipelines, and in severe cases, pipe breakage may occur; Collapse can easily cause pipeline depression and deformation, affecting its service life; Slope water damage, terrace water damage, and loess collapse often result in exposed and suspended pipelines.\n1.3 Relationship between Pipeline Laying Methods and Disasters\nThe impact of geological disasters on pipelines is closely related to the laying method of pipelines. The cross slope laying zone of pipelines in valley areas is an area where geological hazards such as landslides and rock mass movement are concentrated, and disasters such as floods and debris flows in the ditch can have a significant impact on the pipelines on the slope. Under the working conditions of laying pipelines along longitudinal slopes and ridges, due to the influence of rainfall, soil erosion at the top of the ditch can also cause insufficient burial depth of the pipeline and a small amount of suspended exposed pipes. However, overall, the harm is relatively small (Figure 3).\nWhen pipelines are laid along unstable river channels, they are greatly affected by riverbed oscillation and gravel riverbed. The swaying and diversion of the riverbed can cause pipelines that were originally on the shore to enter the river, leading to insufficient burial depth and floating pipes in the air. Water related operations greatly increase the difficulty of emergency rescue work during the flood season; The rock and soil structure of the gravel river bed is loose, extremely unstable, and easily washed away by floods, which can also cause the above phenomena.\n1.4 The Relationship between Rainfall and Disasters\nRainfall is the main factor inducing geological disasters. In recent years, extreme rainfall has occurred frequently in northern China, which is mainly manifested in the decrease of rainfall days, the increase of rainstorm days and the concentration of rainfall. According to statistics, the vast majority of major disasters are caused by rainfall in extreme weather conditions such as typhoons, which is also a very clear pattern in recent years. It can be seen from the analysis of flood damage of a company in flood season in recent years that the number of water damage caused by a few extreme rainstorm accounts for more than half of the total number of water damage (Figure 4).\n2. Difficulties in Emergency Rescue in River and Valley Areas\n2.1 Difficulty in Identifying and Warning\n(1). Pipeline accompanying optical cables have a warning effect on geological disasters, but there are errors in accurately locating the interruption location, especially in mountainous areas where on-site positioning often takes several hours, which affects the efficiency of rescue efforts. During the typhoon, the optical cable was interrupted in multiple places, and the location of the interruption at both ends can be quickly found, but it is very difficult to locate the interruption point between the two ends.\n(2). In case of typhoon, extreme rainstorm and other weather conditions, the infrastructure is severely damaged, the traffic roads and communication are interrupted, and with potential risks such as collapse and flood, it is difficult for the line patrol personnel to go to the site in time for troubleshooting. Short distance emergency rescue points can now be inspected using drones, but the flight distance is limited, and the final investigation results still need to be confirmed by personnel entering the site.\n2.2 Difficulty in Distinguishing Pipeline Safety Status\n(1). During the flood season, the water flow was turbulent and personnel were unable to enter the water to check the suspended condition of the pipeline. Prior to the 2022 flood, multiple techniques such as single beam, multi beam, and side scan sonar were used to detect the current situation of the pipeline at the Yellow River crossing point through testing unmanned ships and sonar equipment. However, due to the turbid river water, the results were not ideal.\n(2). When a floating pipe occurs in a river pipeline, it is difficult to determine the length of the underwater floating pipe, the swinging mode of the pipeline, the magnitude of stress, and the fatigue state of the pipeline. Currently, only some stress detection and monitoring can be carried out at the closest possible position, but it can only reflect the situation at that point and cannot clearly investigate the stress distribution status of the entire pipeline.\n2.3 Shortage of Rescue Resources\nEmergency rescue is to seize resources. Typhoons and other disasters cause regional scale disasters, and multiple industries such as transportation, power, and communication are carrying out emergency operations. This often leads to shortages of large machinery such as excavators, bulk materials such as stones and concrete, as well as manpower, making emergency pipeline rescue difficult.\n2.4 Difficulty in Entering the Emergency Rescue Site\nWhen emergency rescue is carried out in valley areas, the locations are generally far from traffic arteries, making it very difficult for large equipment and bulk materials to enter the site, and it is necessary to build access roads. After floods and heavy rainfall, the soil becomes saturated and soft, making it difficult to provide sufficient bearing capacity, resulting in a long and difficult construction period for the access road, which slows down the rescue progress.\n2.5 Restricted Rescue Sites and Measures for Water related Operations\nDuring river flooding, the water depth and flow velocity are high, posing significant safety hazards to rescue workers. The poor terrain of the riverbed, loose sediment structure at the bottom, and low bearing capacity also bring great risks and difficulties to the construction of scaffolding and equipment entry operations. Emergency rescue requires controlling risks in the shortest possible time, avoiding pipeline fatigue strength failure, and restoring production. However, due to limitations such as construction period, site, and resource supply, many methods and technologies are difficult to implement.\n3. Emergency Response in River and Valley Areas\n3.1 Be well Prepared and actively Respond\nCarry out inspections of key flood control areas before the flood season, improve emergency plans, reserve necessary flood control materials, and establish a social support for large-scale rescue equipment and bulk rescue materials. Actively respond to extreme weather conditions, major floods in reservoirs and rivers, deploy rescue forces in advance if necessary, intensify on-site inspections, identify signs of disaster activities, and detect, prepare, and initiate risks early. After confirming the danger situation, sufficient rescue resources should be quickly mobilized and the construction of access roads should be initiated as soon as possible to create conditions for rescue operations.\n3.2 Rescue Process Measures\nPipeline leakage can cause serious pollution to the surrounding environment such as river water and soil. When there is a risk of pipeline leakage, corresponding process measures need to be taken according to the conveying medium. For oil pipelines, measures such as reducing pressure, stopping transportation, closing the valve chamber in the direction of oil supply, and closely monitoring changes in pipeline pressure can be taken. For pipelines with the risk of condensation, if conditions permit, the oil type can be adjusted, and if necessary, the pipeline should be cleaned. For gas pipelines, measures such as pressure reduction, shutdown, and venting can be taken, and combustible gas monitoring work should be carried out at the rescue site.\n3.3 Emergency Measures for Disaster Bodies\nThe main disaster body of river channel water damage is floods. Firstly, it is necessary to communicate with the relevant management departments of the upstream reservoir, adjust the reservoir flood discharge plan, lower the downstream water level, and leave enough time and space for emergency operations. Secondly, engineering measures should be taken to protect the pipeline, such as constructing cofferdams, diversion dams, and river dredging, to change the direction of water flow and reduce the impact of floods on the pipeline. At the same time, space should be left for large-scale equipment to enter the site for operation, or temporary silt dams, gabions, and riprap measures should be built downstream of the pipeline to raise the height of the riverbed, so that the pipeline can be buried underground again, playing a role in protecting the pipeline.\n3.4 Protective Measures for Pipelines\nDuring river emergency rescue, measures such as driving steel pipe piles, building scaffolding, and placing balance bags downstream can be taken to support and reinforce the pipeline, control its displacement and vibration, and avoid material fatigue and strength failure of the pipeline. In addition, it is necessary to monitor the safety status of pipelines, including pipeline displacement monitoring, strain monitoring, and pipeline leakage monitoring, in order to grasp the on-site situation in real time.\n3.5 Safety and Environmental Protection Measures\nAttention should be paid to personnel safety and environmental protection during emergency rescue. The medium transmission pressure of oil and gas pipelines is high, and pipeline leakage monitoring should be done well to avoid endangering the safety of rescue workers. Water related operators on site should be strictly managed to avoid safety accidents. During the flood season, meteorological and flood monitoring should also be carried out in the rescue area and surrounding areas to ensure the safety of rescue workers. Oil pipeline leakage can cause serious pollution to the surrounding environment. Multiple oil interception points can be set up downstream to reduce the impact on the surrounding environment such as river water and soil in case of extreme situations.\nTo more economically, reasonably, safely, and efficiently control the risk of pipeline disasters in river and valley areas, reduce the difficulty of rescue, and ensure pipeline safety, it is recommended to improve and enhance from the following aspects:\n(1). Improve the quality standards of pipeline construction and fundamentally reduce the occurrence of dangerous situations. Minimize the laying of pipeline cross slopes as much as possible to avoid long-distance laying and crossing of pipelines in unstable river channels such as riverbed swings.\n(2). After the pipeline is put into operation, geological hazard investigation and identification should be actively carried out to reduce the risk of geological hazards. By comprehensively utilizing remote sensing, fiber optic vibration and other technologies, the early identification rate of geological hazards such as landslides can be improved, and early detection and treatment can be carried out. For unstable riverbed laying sections, measures such as changing the route and improving defense standards can be taken.\n(3). Introduce new methods, technologies, and equipment, draw on innovative technologies and experiences from industries such as highways and railways, and turn them into our own, in order to improve the emergency rescue efficiency of pipelines in river and valley areas."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"opinion_recommendation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:a1efdb6c-954f-4bd5-9c6d-10bddd4d447c>","<urn:uuid:fca4e4d5-aa2e-437a-9d5a-bc4c566f2f5e>"],"error":null}
