{"question":"What are the key structural rules and essential elements for composing a traditional Japanese haiku?","answer":"A traditional Japanese haiku consists of three lines with a specific syllable pattern: 5 syllables in the first line, 7 syllables in the second line, and 5 syllables in the third line, totaling 17 syllables. The essential element is the juxtaposition of two images with a kireji (cutting word) between them. This form requires much discipline and practice to express thoughts, emotions, and observations within these constraints.","context":["[SI_section_desc description=”The haiku requires much discipline and practise. What was essential was the juxtaposition of two images with a kireji (‘cutting word’) between them…” text_color=”#393939″]\nThe haiku form and style of writing verse was invented in Japan and was much influenced by Zen thinking. Traditionally it was a short poem consisting of three lines.The first line had five syllables, the second seven, and the third had five. Within a total of 17 syllables the haiku practitioner had to express his thoughts, emotions and observations. This obviously required much discipline and practise. What was essential was the juxtaposition of two images with a kireji (‘cutting word’) between them. The leading Japanese masters such as Basho, Buson, Issa and Shiki made the haiku a sophisticated art form.\nTagore was so fascinated by the form that he wrote haiku in Bengali. The first poet to write haiku in English was Ezra Pound. R.H. Blyth, an Englishman who had lived in Japan, popularised haiku in the Englishspeaking world after Japan’s collapse in 1945. Japanese culture spread to other countries through the medium of haiku verse. Poets in various languages took to writing haiku.\nJaspreet Mander, an Indian academic, has just published Our Land, Our Times which is a fine collection of her free-form haiku. She lays bare the disharmony and discord of Indian society in general and Punjabi society in particular. However, Professor Emeritus Harjeet Singh Gill of Jawaharlal Nehru University asserts that she “transcends the mundane to arrive at the abstract, the conceptual and the spiritual”. Here are a few examples: Contemporary Punjabi wombs / traverse great lengths to / end female foetuses. Fragility and strength / live in / liquid waters. Where birth is not a delivery / chrysanthemum tendrils emerged / with smiles and fragrances. Bee and petal / their mutual surrender / yields nectar.\nThis book is a pleasure to handle. It is imaginatively designed and adorned with paintings, computer graphics and calligraphy.\nThe latest collection of poems by the Pakistani poet Ejaz Rahim is titled Roots at the Edge. Many of his verses have more than a hint of haiku in them such as: Open the mouths of graves / And you’ll find / The same stench emanating / From a saint’s and sinner’s / Mortal remains.\nSince this book has been warmly dedicated to my wife Jamila and me, I must thank Ejaz Rahim publicly in print.\nThe Agra-based engineer and entrepreneur is also a practising poet. His 21st Century Love Poems: Love is a lot of work is dedicated to his wife with everlasting love. This collection has particular importance and relevance for this hi-tech century. The vast number of young upwardly mobile Indians who are impatient with the ‘moon in June’ sort of saccharinesweet love poetry will respond to these verses. Even though tough IT whizz-kids compete in an international arena and have to cultivate a killer instinct in terms of professional expertise, they are still human. They fall in love.\nThe verses of Rajiv Khandelwal speak to today’s technocrats in a language that they will comprehend and to which they will relate most readily. The poems have an immediacy and urgency. Their sharp laserlike intensity penetrates the head and the heart. Khandelwal is a new voice singing songs of love for the new generation of the new world.\nMulk Raj Anand(1905-2004) was with Raja Rao and R.K.Narayan a founding father of Indian fiction written in English. He adroitly captured the idiom and colour of Punjabi and Hindi as spoken by illagers who were by and large illiterate. He was born in Peshawar, now in Pakistan, and his father originally a coppersmith joined the British Indian army as a sepoy and served in WW1. By sheer hard work and devotion to duty Lal Chand Anand was promoted to the rank of Subedar, the second highest rank that an Indian could attain at the time. A Subedar was a Viceroy’s Commissioned Officer.\nAnand was educated at the universities of Punjab, Cambridge and London. In London he was friendly with the likes of Eliot and Virginia Woolf. In India, under the influence of Gandhi he wrote The Untouchable which deplored the iniquities of the Hindu caste system. His next significant novel was Across the Black Waters (first published in London in 1940) which detailed the struggles of Indian sepoys on the Western front during WW1.\nThe central character is a sepoy named Lalu and the title of the novel is taken from the old Hindu belief that it was sinful to cross the seas. Nothing good could come of it since a Hindu lost his caste in a foreign land. And to lose one’s caste was to lose one’s identity. That was a curse.\nThe battle scenes are vividly described as are the conditions in the trenches. Anand is aware of both the brutality of war as well as the compassion of the common soldier. What emerges is the utter futility of war. He says in prose what Wilfred Owen and Siegfried Sassoon said in poetry. What is brilliant about the book is that though it is set in Europe and is written in English it is still an Indian novel. This revised edition has been translated into eleven European languages and is available in London from Soma Books who are based in Kennington(020 7735 2101).\nA hundred years ago Indians of all castes and creeds fought against tyranny in Europe and hence the historical significance of this novel which ranks with Erich Maria Remarque’s All Quiet on the Western Front. Dominic Rai, director and founder of the Man Mela theatre company has written the preface. In 1998 he produced and directed a dramatized version of the novel at the Hackney Empire. Baroness Flather inaugurated Salt of the Sarkar in the Palace of Westminster and on October 22 the new edition of the novel will be launched at Houseman’s (Peace) Bookshop, King’s Cross, London. Rai is now planning a new production based on Anand’s novel."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_synthesis"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:9594227d-ec28-495f-8b46-71de2bb6316f>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Ancient stone walls vs modern mortarless walls: what are the key construction differences between the ancient stone walls found in Kazakhstan and today's mortarless retaining walls?","answer":"Ancient stone walls in Kazakhstan, like those found at the Buddhist monastery compound near Oskemen, were built using large blocks with smaller stones fitted between them, creating walls up to 6 feet high and 7 feet thick. These walls required great labor and used uncut blocks. In contrast, modern mortarless walls use specially engineered stackable blocks that interlock through design features like rear lips. Modern walls are built on compacted crushed rock or gravel rather than directly on soil, require careful leveling, and incorporate modern elements like drainage systems and landscape fabric. While both types use gravity and weight for stability, modern walls are more systematized, using uniform blocks and specific installation techniques including proper drainage and backfilling with gravel.","context":["Wherever he travelled in Central Asia and Siberia, Thomas Atkinson always took an interest in archaeological remains. He was not a historian, but would often try to find out about the various impressive ruins and strange earthworks he came across on his travels. For example, in Oriental and Western Siberia he describes a copper knife he had been given by Cossacks, who had found it near the Bouchtarma River in what is now northern Kazakhstan. They cut it in half, he says, believing it to be gold.\nOn 30th November 1859 Thomas also delivered a paper at the Geological Society in London “On some bronze relics found in an auriferous sand in Siberia”, at which he exhibited the said fragments. He told his audience that the decorated bronze pieces, which appeared to be either from a horse harness or a bracelet, were found in August 1851 on the River Shargan in southern Siberia (lat. 59֯ 30’ N and long. 96֯ 10’ E) and that he was given them only hours later by the director of the goldmine in which they were found. The miners were excavating a bank of gravel and sand and the objects were found at a depth of around 14 feet. “As I have no theory to establish, I give them without any speculations as to the period when these relics were deposited in the sandy gold-bearing bed”, he remarked.\nOriental and Western Siberia also gives a brief description of Thomas’ visit in 1847 to Ablaikit, near Oskemen, (Ust-Kamenogorsk) in north-eastern Kazakhstan. This is the site of a ruined Buddhist monastery compound that dates back to the seventeenth century and which had also been visited and drawn (see below) by Peter Simon Pallas, the German-born scientist who spent the years 1768-74 travelling in Siberia and Central Asia. The site is of great interest to modern-day archaeologists and this summer a major investigation into the site was begun.\nThomas, who was seemingly unaware of Pallas’ writings, writes: “We now turned to the south, riding along about a verst from the foot of the high rocks and had not gone far when we came upon a large enclosure surrounded by a thick wall build of very large blocks, with smaller stones fitted in between them. This wall encloses a space of almost a verst in length and half a verst in width, extending up to the foot of some perpendicular rocks. It has been a work of great labour and must have been built by a different race from the present, who look upon it with wonder. In some parts it is six feet high, in others a little less and seven feet thick. None of the blocks have been cut.” Clearly as a former mason, he was particularly interested in the stone work.\nHe spent some time at the ruins, entering the enclosure, much to the surprise of his Kazakh guides, who declined to follow due to their superstitious beliefs.\nFurther south, during his journey to Kapal with Lucy in the summer of 1848, as he approached the Djungar Alatau mountains, Thomas came across further examples of earthworks and buildings from prehistory. He remarks in his second book, Travels in the Regions of the Upper and Lower Amoor, on the profusion of kurgans (tumuli) they saw, describing some places where there were literally hundreds of mounds, of all shapes and sizes, dotted across the landscape.\nOne particular description has always interested me, but until now I have not been able to identify its location. He writes: “The ancient inhabitants of this region rendered it extremely productive. The numerous canals which still exist show their engineering skill and the extent of the irrigation it produced. In some of the channels the water yet runs and where it overflows, the sterile soil is covered with a luxuriant carpet of vegetation, adorned with flowers of singular beauty…The vast number of tumuli scattered over the plain, the extensive earthworks which have been either cities or strongholds, afford convincing evidence that a great people were once located here.”\nHe describes one such ancient group of buildings in the valley of the Lepsy River, describing it as “a parallelogram about 700 yards in length and 300 in breadth. The earth walls are now about 12 feet high and have been considerably higher. Their thickness is about 16 feet at the bottom and nine feet at the top. This enclosure was entered by four gates, one being in the centre of each side; but the eastern end has been partly destroyed by the river, which is gradually cutting down the bank.\n“Half a mile to the north and south are numerous mounds and at about a mile from the western end there is a large tumulus, about 150 feet in diameter and 50 feet high. The people who produced them were a very different race to the present occupiers of the country and had made an extraordinary advance in agriculture and mining.”\nLast year, as I travelled south-west from Lake Alakool towards Lepsinsk, Sarcand and Kapal, I had tried to locate this place, but could find no-one who knew anything about it. However, this week, after a determined online search I think I have found the exact spot, which is in the modern-day village of Koilyk (previously called Kayalyk or, more recently, Antonovka), not far from Sarcand. Read this recent description: “Kayalyk territory was surrounded by a fortified wall, having the form of an irregular quadrilateral with sides of 750 to 1,200 meters. Nowadays, it has been preserved well in the eastern part of the unoccupied area of modern buildings and the height reaches 4 m. Elsewhere it can be observed only fragmentary. Certain significant buildings, such as the Buddhist temple, are located at a distance of a few hundred meters from the city walls. This means that agricultural land, farms, centers of spiritual missions were at a considerable distance from the city, enclosed by the city wall, built from mud brick.” You can read more about this site here.\nFrom this description I have no doubt that it is the same place described by Thomas as an irregular parallelogram. Recent archaeological investigation has revealed that the site is archaeologically extremely rich, with the remains of a large mosque dating back to the early Islamic period, as well as Buddhist and Manichaean temples. This was once an important town on the Silk Road, close to the ‘Djungarian Gates’ that lead through the mountains eastwards into what is now Xinjiang in Western China.\nI am now working on an Atkinson Trail for the Zhetysu region of Eastern Kazakhstan and Koilyk will certainly be one of the highlights.","© 2008 by Raymond Alexander Kukkee\nWant to build a retaining wall without hiring a block layer or mason?\nNow you can do it yourself. Modern technology and design has made it possible to create almost any structure using a dry, or mortarless system. Specially shaped blocks are easily assembled into terrace walls, retaining walls, and decorative enclosures. With many choices of style and architectural features available, appearance can be highly variable, imitating natural stone, coloured stone, adobe, or even polished rock. The blocks fit together easily and securely.\nHow Does it Work?\nA stone or block “gravity wall” that is “dry” laid without mortar uses it’s own weight to resist movement. It’s all in the design. Some types of stackable blocks have a lip at the rear of the stone that sits behind the lower course. Suitable for lower walls to 4 -5 ft, the weight of the soil behind the wall actually strengthens the structure. Various designs of engineered interlocking blocks are available for higher structures.\nThe Mortarless Retaining Wall\nA mortarless retaining wall prevents soil movement and allows a slope to be terraced and landscaped to maximize use of the area by preventing soil movement and reducing erosion.\nThe advantages of a mortarless wall are many. No concrete footing is required because of the inherent flexibility of a dry wall. To establish a footing, a layer of compacted crushed rock or gravel is placed to minimize settling.\nA mortarless wall can be easily disassembled and relocated later if desired. Blocks are available in a variety of sizes and widths. Trim stones, cap stones, pavers and other accessories are offered. Curved walls can easily be constructed.\nNatural, dry field stone has been used by highly skilled stone masons for the construction of durable walls for centuries. Stackable blocks are the modern version, the engineered answer to retaining walls and structures of all types, and are now considered to be the system of choice by design.\nBuild the Wall\nLet us examine the process of building a mortarless retaining wall. Initially, a design is required. Design considerations and choices must be made. Will your wall be curved or straight, and what height will it be? Keep in mind, the higher a retaining wall is built, the more critical the structural elements become.\nChoose two successive, lower retaining walls to prevent structural problems and simultaneously take advantage of the terraced landscaping potential offered by that choice.\nAny retaining wall over 4′ high requires structural reinforcement and municipal regulations may even specify additional engineering requirements and fencing for safety.\nWhen creating your design, do obtain any necessary building permit and contact your local utilities for location of cable, pipes, or gas lines prior to doing any proposed excavating work.\nTools and supplies you will need\n- Safety glasses and gloves\n- Shovel, pick and wheelbarrow (or mini-backhoe service for excavating)\n- Tamper or plate packer if available\n- Line level and carpenter’s level ( use a laser level or transit level if available)\n- Carpenter’s line\n- Wide masonry chisel (or chop saw with Concrete cutting blade)\n- Heavy hammer ( 3 lb. Or more)\n- Pickets or stakes\n- Crushed rock or crushed gravel for the footer,\n- Sand for leveling\n- Stackable blocks\n- Landscape fabric (soil and weed barrier)\n- Deadmen galvanized cable anchors for reinforcing ( if wall is high)\n- 4″ perforated flexible weeping pipe\nLet’s build it!\n1. Design and lay out the wall using pickets, carpenter line, and line level. Measure the physical length, and used the proposed height to calculate the number of blocks required including all of the design elements, including cap stones.\n2. Excavate the soft organic soil down to solidified mineral soil below ground level, making the trench wider than the blocks to allow room for a drainage weeping tile on the high side of the wall. The bottom of the trench should be level from one end to the other! If not, “step” the footing design to match courses, or consider re-designing your project using two or more individual sections of wall instead, keeping the individual sections level.If the wall is split, incorporate that feature to allow an access stairway, or add other features, like a pillars, abutments, or right-angled offset in the wall which can substantially increase the strength of the wall.\n3. Add a layer of crushed rock if soil and ground conditions are overly soft! Use a layer of crushed rock or gravel with 6″ as a minimum. For soft, bad conditions, use an 10″ or 12″ layer. Level and compact the footing layer. You may also choose to install a thin layer of leveling sand at this point for ease of leveling the blocks.\n4. Lay out the first course of blocks to the line, keeping the course absolutely level. The first course should be not only level, but very securely bedded in the gravel or sand. Use a plate packer if available to flatten, pack, and level the gravel/sand bedding. Tamp the blocks down and remove, or add additional sand to level the successive, lower retaining wall course as necessary. Use a line level from one end to the other to ensure the first course is straight and level.\n5. Remember that as with all retaining walls, drainage is always an issue regardless of material or design. Install a length of 4 ” weeping pipe level with the bottom of the first course, placing the holes facing down. A strip of ground fabric placed over the gravel will help keep soil and fines from entering the tile. Ensure the ends of the tile are placed to direct any water flow away from the wall.\n6. For the second course, alternate the joints, remembering the mason’s rule of two over one, and one over two. Start with a half-block as necessary to stagger the joints on every course. Cut the block , scoring with the mason’s chisel, or use the chop saw if available. Ensure that all blocks are level and seated properly. Remember, the objective is to build a retaining wall the mortarless way. The blocks must be seated properly dry, without mortar for adjustment.\n7. If the wall is high, establish galvanized anchor cables after the second or third course as required for additional structural strength.\n8. Install ground fabric behind the wall to prevent infiltration of soil and weeds into the wall.\n9. Back fill with gravel immediately behind the wall. In back filling, establish a 12″ vertical layer of coarse gravel against the wall to ensure adequate drainage of water. Pack all soil and gravel backfill with a plate packer if possible, to minimize future settling.\n10. If the blocks are hollow and require ballast, add ballast stone as specified by the manufacturer.\n11. Install the cap stones over the last course and secure as the manufacturer specifies.\n12. Complete the landscaping of the terraces as desired, and establish grass by seed and mulch or install sod. Replace lawn and plant accessory bushes and trees as soon as possible to assist in the prevention of erosion.\nNow it’s time to build a raised patio to match the retaining wall. Congratulations! You already know how to do it – the mortarless way.\nIs that Incoming I hear?\nTags: retaining walls, how to build retaining walls, yard & garden, mortarless, DIY, ground fabric, landscaping"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:dc4bdc81-9a5e-4795-b890-9d0a5646ff61>","<urn:uuid:98eeb8a6-15d6-4fcc-befb-268826cc45da>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Which deities was the Erechtheion temple dedicated to?","answer":"The Erechtheion temple was dedicated to both Athena and Poseidon.","context":["With this post I start my new series taken in Athens where I spent a last week. Hope you will like it.\nThe Erechtheion is an ancient Greek temple located on the north side of the Acropolis of Athens dedicated to both Athena and Poseidon. The temple as seen today was built between 421 and 406 BC. On the north side, there is large porch with six Ionic columns, and on the south, the famous \"Porch of the Maidens\", with six draped female figures (caryatids) as supporting columns. The porch was built to conceal the giant 15-ft beam needed to support the southwest corner over the metropolis, after the building was drastically reduced in size and budget following the onset of the Peloponnesian war.

{"question":"When did the term 'cobbler' first appear in written records?","answer":"The term 'cobbler' first appeared in the 1839 edition of Kentucky Housewife by Lettice Bryan. The exact origin of the term is unknown, but some sources suggest it comes from the cobblestone look of the dough.","context":["Life was harsh when the first settlers came to the new world. They left many of their possessions in Europe and started life anew in often harsh conditions. The settlers brought with them a love of desserts and recipes from their homelands. In the new world, however, desserts were often a luxury. Cooking utensils and ingredients were often in short supply. Because cobbler can be made from many types of fruits that are abundant in America, many different forms of the dessert were created. Cobblers were made from native fruits, including apples, berries, and peaches.\nWithout the resources of brick ovens . . . colonial cooks often made cobblers — also called slumps or grunts — and their cousins, pandowdies, in pots over an open fire. . . . In these types of pies, a filling made of fruit, meat or vegetable goes into a pot first; then a skin of dough is placed over the filling, followed by the pot's lid. As cobblers cook, the filling stews and creates its own sauce and gravy, while the pastry puffs up and dries.\" 1A \"grunt\" was said to reflect the sound of the fruit bubbling as it cooked. The \"slump\" said to reflect the appearance of the top crust as it molded itself over the fruit. Louisa May Alcott (1832-1888), author of the book, Little Women, named her Concord, Massachusetts home \"Apple Slump.\"\nThe exact origin of the term \"cobbler\" is unknown, but some sources suggest it comes from the cobblestone look of the dough. The first use of the term appeared in 1839 edition of Kentucky Housewife by Lettice Bryan.\nThere are many variations of the cobbler. A traditional cobbler has a thick crust and a fruit filling. Some cobblers have a top and bottom crust, others have only a top crust, and some have a drop-biscuit topping. Crisps and crumbles have a layer of fruit on the bottom with a crumb topping. A betty commonly consists of a layer of fruit between layers of buttered crumbs. A buckle is usually made by adding a single layer of fruit to the batter. Another variation, my dad's specialty, is baked in a dutch oven.\nCurious about other traditional foods, I found fried chicken can be traced back to the first century A. D. French toast can be traced even further back to the Ancient Romans, a dish the French called \"Pain a la Romaine,\" or Roman bread. Deviled eggs are also traced back to the Romans; spicy stuffed eggs were known in 13th century Andalusia, although the name is said to be an 18th century invention.\nThe culinary arts are deeply rooted in our family history, and food with its social role and ability to prompt memory plays a huge role in all families. Looking into the history of family favorites may be just one more way to explore family history.\n1 Smith, Andrew F. The Oxford encyclopedia of food and drink in America.

{"question":"As a humanitarian worker, I'm interested in comparing the technological and therapeutic approaches used to help Syrian refugees - what are the main differences between the VR-based camp evacuation training and the medication review service in terms of their impact on refugee well-being?","answer":"The VR-based camp evacuation training and medication review service helped Syrian refugees in different but complementary ways. The VR technology was used to create virtual evacuation routes in a refugee camp in Lebanon's Beqaa Valley, helping over 1000 people learn how to safely evacuate during emergencies like fires. This addressed immediate physical safety concerns, especially after a tragic incident where a young Syrian child died in a fire. Meanwhile, the medication review service focused on health and mental well-being - it significantly reduced drug-related problems (from 600 to 182) and improved anxiety scores among refugees with chronic medical conditions. While both approaches helped refugees, the VR training targeted emergency preparedness and safety education, while the medication service addressed ongoing health management and psychological well-being.","context":["Yet VR turned out to be the primary tool that a group of volunteers from the Heber City, Utah-based non-profit organization Field Innovation Team (FIT) used to help a group of Syrian refugees learn how to evacuate their camp during a visit to the Algarhih camp in Lebanon’s Beqaa Valley, which lies near Syria’s border, this past March.\n“The camp leader, Ali, started telling a story about these fires that broke out in the camp in June 2015, how they lost a young Syrian child, and how they feared they may lose others in future fires,” FIT CEO Desi Matel-Anderson, who led the visit, tells ITBusiness.ca. “He wanted to know how we could help them spread awareness and create a sense of preparedness.”\nSince 2010, FIT has sent volunteers from a variety of disciplines, both technical (engineering, programming, robotics) and humanitarian (educators, artists, community justice workers) to disaster zones across the world, where they have developed what the organization calls “cutting edge” solutions to emergencies including the 2013 Boston marathon bombing, last year’s earthquake in Nepal, and 2012’s Hurricane Sandy.\nThough technology is often involved, many solutions simply require finding the easiest, least resistant (i.e. technology-free) path, Matel-Anderson says, though others, such as March’s visit to the Algarhih camp, require volunteers to create technology on the fly.\n“We’ve found that if we want to have an exponential impact and scale, technology is an incredible tool for doing that,” she says.\nThe technology that FIT teams wind up having access to can also be surprising, she says, citing Facebook and Instagram as tools that are frequently available.\n“The neat thing is, everyone in the camp had a smartphone or access to a smartphone,” Matel-Anderson says. “So our VR team came together with Ali’s team, and we used our 360 cameras to record everything and create a virtual evacuation route.”\n“Not only did we share it with the camp leadership, but they can now download the evacuation routes and walk anyone else who enters the camp through this virtual realm,” she continues. “It’s great.”\nThough Matel-Anderson isn’t certain how many people were living in the camp, she estimates that more than 1000 people saw the video, which represented only one of several initiatives by FIT during a trip that helped thousands of Syrian refugees, she says.\nOthers included a theatre-based project that brought Syrians with opposing viewpoints together and encouraged them to collaborate on performances that illustrated each others’ points of view; and the development of a chatbot that communicated with refugees about their experiences until they were ready to ready to receive professional help, at which point the bots connected them with therapists and psychologists who could provide real-time mental health resources and psychological services.\nWhenever FIT approaches an emergency, the organization utilizes a three-step process:\n- Establish situational awareness by deploying teams of volunteers to analyze what is happening and where;\n- Define the challenge, identifying exactly who requires help and why;\n- Collaborate between groups to create solutions to whatever problems have been outlined.\nMatel-Anderson believes North American companies and their employees could learn a great deal from FIT’s solutions, both when responding to their own emergencies and when they need to look at a situation from another party’s point of view.\n“We may not be in the Beqaa Valley and worried about evacuating a camp of 250 tents, but… we need to learn to step into other peoples’ shoes,” she says.\nMatel-Anderson will be sharing how FIT used VR to help Syrian refugees during a keynote address at this year’s World Conference on Disaster Management (WCDM), which will be held on June 7 and 8 in Toronto.

Pharmacists delivering the medication review service can have a role in improving this growing worldwide problem.\nObjectives: To assess the effect of the medication review service on QoL and anxiety scores for Syrian refugees living with chronic medical conditions.\nMethods: This randomized single-blinded intervention control study was conducted in Jordan. Syrian refugees were recruited and randomized into intervention and control groups. Two home visits were organized with each participant, at baseline and three months later. The medication review service was delivered to the participants and questionnaires regarding QoL and anxiety were completed by all participants. As a part of the medication review service, drug-related problems (DRPs) were identified by a clinical pharmacist for all patients, but recommendations to resolve these DRPs were delivered to intervention group refugees’ physicians only (control group patients did not receive this part of the service till the end of the study); DRPs were corrected and pharmacist-delivered counseling and education were provided as well. At follow-up, DRPs assessment, QoL and anxiety scores were assessed for refugees in the intervention and control groups.\nResults: Syrian refugees (n=106) were recruited and randomized into intervention (n=53) and control (n=53) groups with no significant difference between both groups at baseline. The number of medications and diagnosed chronic diseases per participant was 5.8 (SD 2.1) and 2.97 (SD 1.16), respectively. At follow-up, a significant decrease in the number of DRPs for refugees in the intervention group was found (from 600 to 182, p<0.001), but not for the control group (number stayed at 541 DRPs, p=0.116). Although no significant difference between the groups was found with regards to QoL at follow-up (p=0.266), a significant difference was found in the anxiety scores between the groups (p<0.001).\nConclusion: The medication review service delivered by clinical pharmacists can significantly improve refugees’ DRPs and anxiety scores. As for QoL, significant improvements can be seen for all refugee patients, regardless of whether the DRPs identified were resolved or not.\nTurrini G, Purgato M, Ballette F, Nosè M, Ostuzzi G, Barbui C.

{"question":"What are the similarities and differences between mechanical digestion in the mouth and potential complications from gallstones in terms of their effects on overall digestive health?","answer":"Mechanical digestion in the mouth involves teeth cutting and grinding food into smaller pieces, with the tongue contributing to mixing and facilitating transit to the esophagus. This process is essential for proper digestion and forms a food bolus that can be safely swallowed. In contrast, gallstones can significantly disrupt digestion when they block the gallbladder, preventing it from draining properly. While mechanical digestion in the mouth is a normal process, gallstones can cause serious complications including belly pain, jaundice, gallbladder infection, and in severe cases, tears in the gallbladder that can be life-threatening. Additionally, gallstones can interfere with the liver and pancreas drainage, potentially causing more widespread digestive issues.","context":["What is Digestive System?\nThe digestive system is a set of organs located one after the other in charge of the digestion process. Food is the fuel our body needs to live and function properly. In order to be absorbed and used, food must be “digested”, that is, it must be broken down into small pieces. Each portion of this tube has a different shape and function. It starts at the mouth and ends at the anus. We are going to explain The Digestive System Parts and Functions for children.\nDigestive System: Organs and Functions\nThe digestive system’s function is to transform food into small elements called nutrients. Nutrients are tiny substances, absorbed and used in cells. In order for you to grow healthy and for your body to function properly, you must provide it with the right amounts and proportions of nutrients.\nThe functions of the digestive system are:\n• Transport food through your body to all cells.\n• Segregate digestive juices.\n• Absorb nutrients from food.\n• Eliminate waste, which are substances that are no longer going to be used in our body.\nPDF Free Printable\nThe Digestive System Printable Page\nExplore the PDF pages on this website to find more resources for your students.\nThe Digestive System: How it Works.\nIn ancient times, scientists studied the human body as a machine. But over time they discovered that it was impossible to compare living beings with machines. For this reason, the organism is analyzed as a set of interrelated structures. In this system that is our body, the relationships established between these parts are as important as the parts themselves.\nHuman Digestive System and Nutrition Systems\nWe generally associate nutrition with everything we eat. The digestive system integrates one of the four 4 systems of nutrition. They reveal that we are not only nourished when we eat.\n1. Digestive System.\n4. Excretory Systems.\nAs the blood circulates through our body we are also nourished. The circulatory system through the blood, transports nutrients and oxygen, distributing them throughout the body for use. Breathing is involved in the oxygenation of all tissues and cells. What the body is no longer going to use is discarded through the excretory system.\nHow the Digestive System Works: Summary for Kids\nThe digestive system incorporates food by transforming it during the digestion process. This is not just breaking the food down, it breaks down the food into particles with a simpler chemical structure. This allows the small molecules to enter the bloodstream where the circulatory system will help distribute them throughout the cells.\nRead Also: Food Groups for Children\nWhat Organs make up the Digestive System?\nWhat are the Functions of the Organs of the Digestive System?\nThe organs of the digestive system share the same goal: to transform food so that it can be absorbed. This system is made up of the mouth, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, the nutrients pass through its walls, they pass into the blood that will transport them to all the cells. What is not absorbed in the small intestine passes into the large intestine and exits through the anus as fecal matter.\nAssociated Glands: Functions\nThe digestive system has accessory organs and attached glands: the salivary glands, liver, gallbladder and pancreas. During digestion, food passes through the organs of the digestive tract, except for the accessory glands. Although food does not “circulate” through the glands and accessory organs. They produce juices and secretions that flow into the small intestine through ducts, and are involved in digestion.\nThe Digestive Process (Parts, Organs, and Functions)\nThe mouth is a cavity where the teeth and the tongue are housed, through which food and drinks enter.\nThe teeth are responsible for chewing, whose purpose is to grind food. We must always keep them healthy, since they transform food so that it passes through the pharynx and the esophagus to the stomach. Teeth are not all the same and have different functions. The canines tear, the incisors cut, the molars and premolars grind and grind food.\nThe tongue is a muscle with a large number of taste buds, it contributes to chewing and mixing food, facilitating its transit to the esophagus. The salivary glands participate in chewing.\nSaliva acts as a lubricant. It is composed of 95% water and 5% minerals such as sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate and phosphates.\nFunction: In the mouth, the chemical digestion of carbohydrates begins by the action of the enzyme called amylase or ptyalin. It breaks down starch molecules into a simpler compound, called maltose. From chewing, a homogeneous mass is obtained: the food bolus that will pass into the pharynx.\nIn back of the mouth is the pharynx. It is part of both the digestive and respiratory systems. It is shaped like a tube. It is located in the neck and connects the nose and mouth with the trachea and the esophagus respectively. Both air and food pass through it by means of a “lid”. The epiglottis allows the food bolus not to go into the respiratory tract. The epiglottis closes when you swallow food.\nIt is a 25 to 30 cm tube that connects the pharynx with the stomach. Its function is to drive food from the pharynx to the stomach.\nIt is an organ in the form of an elongated bag whose size can vary depending on the volume of its content. It has several parts:\nThe Stomach Anatomy: Parts and Functions\n• Cardia: It is the opening (esophageal sphincter) that communicates with the esophagus, through which food enters.\n• Fundus (bottom): It is located next to the cardia. It has cells that produce acid and pepsin (digestive enzyme) from gastric juice that help digest food.\n• Body: It is the middle part, between the upper and lower part of the stomach.\n• Antrum: It is the lower part, close to the intestine, where food is mixed with gastric juice.\n• Pylorus: It is the outlet opening that leads to the intestine. It acts as a valve to control the emptying of stomach contents into the small intestine.\nFunction: The stomach receives the food bolus. It produces gastric juices that contain digestive enzymes. It makes some movements that beat the food and mix it with the gastric juices.\nThe human intestine measures between 3 and 8 meters, depending on individual characteristics. The main function of the intestine is the incorporation of nutrients into the body. It is carried out through the processes of digestion and absorption of nutrients. The intestinal epithelium, which is the layer of cells that covers its interior, has multiple folds, which extend into intestinal villi and micro-villi, increasing the absorption surface up to 200 meters (656 feet). They are like tiny “hairs” on a towel. This is where nutrients from food are absorbed.\nIt is a very long and folded tube that secretes digestive juices. This is where the usable substances pass into the blood. It is divided into three parts: Duodenum, jejunum, and ileum.\nIt is the way out of substances that will not be assimilated called waste. It is formed by: cecum, colon, rectum and anus.\nThe liver is the largest gland in the body. The function of the liver is to make bile that is stored in the gallbladder. The bile is poured into the digestive tract in the duodenum. Contributes to the digestion of fats.\nThe pancreas is a gland that has the function of secreting the hormone insulin. Insulin controls the amount of sugar circulating in the blood and a lack of this hormone can cause a disease called diabetes mellitus.\nWhat Is Digestion?\nA food is incorporated into the body after being digested, that is, physically and chemically degraded so that its components can be absorbed, can pass through the wall of the digestive system and pass into the blood (or lymph).\nTo do this, food must undergo various physical and chemical changes that are called digestion and that make them “absorbable”.\nAlthough it is not always necessary for some change to occur for the component to be absorbed. For example, water, minerals, and certain carbohydrates are absorbed without prior modification.\nDigestion consists of two processes, one mechanical and one chemical. The mechanical part of digestion includes chewing, swallowing, peristalsis and elimination of waste.\nDigestive Process for Kids\nDigestion is not just a mechanical process in which food is crushed, cut and reduced to small particles by the action of the teeth and the tongue in the mouth. But there are also chemical transformations by the action of digestive juices on food.\nWhere does my food go after I eat it?\nHere’s what happens to your food as it travels through your body.\nIt goes to cells throughout the body, which are constantly being replaced. Food is transformed during the digestion process until nutrients and energy are obtained. Human beings obtain the energy contained in food to carry out daily activities.\nRead also: Human Body\nSummary: What is Digestion?\nDigestion is a process whose function is to transform food so that it can be absorbed and used by the cells of our body.\nWhere Does Food Go When You Eat?\nIt starts in the mouth, when you eat some food. The teeth cut and grind the largest pieces. Chewing is a very important step for the correct digestive process. We must chew by grinding the food well, slowly, to form the food bolus, which is a soft mass ready to be swallowed.\nIt goes down your throat through the tube formed by the larynx and esophagus and from then on you are not really aware of what is happening. It then continues to the stomach, small intestine, large intestine. The material that is not used is compacted in the form of fecal matter and eliminated to the outside through the anus.\nSome organs of the digestive system have the function of producing digestive juices. On the sides of the alimentary canal are accessory organs (called accessory glands). Its function is to secrete more juices that are poured into the tube to help digestion. These accessory glands are the salivary glands, liver, and pancreas.\nDigestive System: Conditions and Disorders\nWhat are some common conditions that affect the digestive system?\nThere are many diseases that can affect the different organs of the digestive system. We are going to mention a few.\n• Celiac Disease: It is a disease in which affected people do not tolerate a protein called gluten. They should not eat any food that has gluten. Because if they do they suffer from diarrhoea, intestinal inflammation, lack of growth. Gluten is found in foods with wheat, rye, barley, and sometimes oats. They must check that all the products they consume have the symbol suitable for celiacs on the labels. Diarrhea: It can occur when you consume contaminated water or lack of hygiene during food handling. Causes liquid, frequent stools, abdominal pain, fever.\n• Constipation: it is the difficulty in the evacuation with delay in the elimination of intestinal waste. It can cause abdominal pain, swelling, others.\n• Caries: Damage to the tooth enamel caused by bacteria.\n• Gastric ulcers: They are open or unhealed wounds that in this case are located in the stomach.\n• Gastritis: It is inflammation of the stomach.\n• Hepatitis: Inflammation of the liver.\n• Appendicitis: Inflammation of the appendix\n• Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD): Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis.\n• Diverticulosis: Disorder in the intestine.\n• Achalasia: Disease in the esophagus. Difficulty to swallow.","What are Gall bladder stones, Gallbladder stone symptoms, gallbladder stones treatment\nWhat is the gallbladder?\nThe gallbladder is a small, pear-shaped organ that is tucked under your liver. It stores bile, a fluid that helps the body break down fat.\nWhat are gallstones?\nGallstones are small stones that form inside the gallbladder. They can be tiny specks or get as big as the whole gallbladder, which can be up to 6 inches long.\nNormally, the gallbladder fills with bile in between meals. Then, when you eat fatty foods, the gallbladder empties the bile into the intestine. Sometimes, though, gallstones clog the gallbladder and keep it from draining. Other times, gallstones just irritate the gallbladder. If the gallstones are pushed out of the gallbladder, they can keep the liver or pancreas from draining.\nWhat are the symptoms of gallstones?\nIn most cases, gallstones do not cause any symptoms. When they do cause symptoms, gallstones can cause:\n●Belly pain – Often on the right side just under the rib cage or in the middle top portion of the belly\n●Pain in the back or right shoulder\n●Nausea and vomiting\nIf you know that you have gallstones but have no symptoms, you probably will not need treatment. But if you start having symptoms, you should get treated. The symptoms can come and go, but they often get worse over time.\nAre gallstones serious?\nNot usually. In some cases they can lead to serious problems, including:\n●Jaundice, a condition that turns your skin and eyes yellow\n●Infection of the gallbladder\n●Tears in the gallbladder, which can lead to death\n●Inflammation of the pancreas (the pancreas is an organ that makes hormones and juices involved in food breakdown)\nIs there a test for gallstones?\nYes, doctors can find out if you have gallstones by doing an imaging test, such as an ultrasound. An ultrasound is a painless test that uses sound waves to create a picture of your gallbladder.\nEven if tests show that you have gallstones, that does not mean they are causing symptoms. Your doctor might need to do other tests to make sure your stones and your symptoms are related.\nHow are gallstones treated?\nPeople with gallstones generally have 3 treatment options. They can have:\n●No treatment – This option is best for most people who have no symptoms. If they start having symptoms, they can think about treatment then.\n●Surgery to remove the gallbladder and the stones – Gallbladder surgery is routine in the United States. But it involves using anesthesia, so it has some risks. The surgery does not affect digestion very much. But about half the people who have surgery have mild symptoms afterward, including watery bowel movements, gas, or bloating. These symptoms usually get better. People who have their gallbladder removed do not need to worry about gallstones coming back.\n●Treatment to get rid of the stones but keep the gallbladder – People who choose this approach can take medicines to break up gallstones. In rare cases, doctors can use with a device to break up and remove stones. Medicines only work with some stones, and even then they take time – months to years. The stones can also come back after these treatments.\nHow do I know which treatment to have?\nThe right treatment for you will depend on:\n●How large your stones are\n●Whether you have symptoms, and how bad the symptoms are\n●How you feel about the treatment options\nAsk your doctor or nurse how each treatment might affect you. Then work with them to find the treatment that makes the most sense for you.\nCan I do anything to keep from getting (more) gallstones?\nYes. You can try to keep yourself at a healthy weight. People who are overweight are more likely to get gallstones.\nIf you plan to lose weight quickly – even if you have never had gallstones – ask your doctor or nurse what you can do to keep from getting gallstones. Losing weight quickly – for example, through weight loss surgery – can lead to gallstones. But your doctor or nurse can give you medicines to keep that from happening."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:cddf8083-46b8-4a49-8b28-28612063f5a4>","<urn:uuid:57af4881-216d-4976-9194-5eb0868140da>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Having visited several Buddhist archaeological sites, I'm curious how the Buddhist ruins at Salihundam in Srikakulam compare to the architectural and design elements of the Venugopalaswamy Temple in Mysore?","answer":"The Buddhist site at Salihundam, located 18 km from Srikakulam on the Vamsadhara river banks, features a maha stupa, votive stupas, chaityas, platforms and viharas with inscriptions from the 2nd century AD.

There are three revenue divisions in Srikakualm, namely Srikakulam, Tekkali and Palakonda","Everything about Mysore Attractions !Venugopalaswamy Temple\nThis is a hidden gem in Mysore. As a visitor to the Brindavan Gardens, you are practically visiting the south side of the dam. That's where the garden is located. There was a time when visitors could climb to the top of the KRS dam to see the vast expanse of the backwaters. Due to security concerns, that is not allowed anymore.\nHave you ever thought why the garden was so named, by the way? The story of Venugopalaswamy Temple unrolls at the far side of the dam.\nYear 1910. There was no dam at this place. Nor the Brindavan Gardens. Kavery was flowing unobstructed like any large river through the fertile plains. Let us walk along the northern banks a few kilometers upstream from where the present day dam is located.\nThe first place you will encounter is a large village called Kannambadi. Right in the middle of this village is a sprawling ancient temple dated of 12th century. Close to it , towards the riverside is the temple of Kalamma, a local folk deity. Further towards the riverside is the Sri Kenneshawara Swamy temple.\nFast forward in time to year 1930. The first phase of the KRS dam is completed. Water level slowly rose to about 80 feet from the riverbed. Gone submerged in the backwater are many villages, Kannambadi included.\nBefore this happened, the then king of Mysore, Krishnaraja Wodeyar IV ordered construction of a new village for the residents of Kannambadi. The new village was aptly named Hosa Kannambadi ( the New Kannambadi).\nThe original Kannambadi village along with its ancient temples gone submerged for ever.\nDuring the summer months of the drought prone years, the water level of KRS dips, and the temple resurfaces. According to the local tradition the resurfacing of the otherwise buried temple sounds the approach of bad luck. True. Scarcity of water looming large on an agrarian community is no a welcome thing.\nThis hide and seek of the temple has been going for more than seven decades with mixed emotions - the happiness of seeing the temple, and the subtle warning of the looming drought.\nAround the year 2004 a mammoth work started to replant the temple, thanks to an entrepreneur philanthropist. Originally the new location planned was at Madhuvana, a locality close to the Mysore city center. But due to the sensitivity of the Hosa Kannambadi villagers, a new site was found close to the village.\nWhen you see the serenely of this chosen place, you'll realize that there could be no better places than this to relocate this majestic structure.\nIt was an unusual task hitherto undertaken in this part of the country. The idea was to transplant the temple, stone by stone, from its original place to the new location.And everything has to be faithfully re-created as the original. Tens of thousands of photographs where taken and each stones where marked before the dismantling operations started. In short all the physical aspects of the temple were digitized for later use when the re-installation start.\nExperts in temple construction were roped in, especially from Tamilnadu. Digitizing the details and marking of each stones where mammoth task. And it as to be done during the short period during the drought season when water recede from the temple location. So was dismantling quickly and orderly transporting the stone blocks to the new location.\nImagine doing this on 300 feet by 180 feet ( about 92 by 55 meters) temple complex siting on a riverbed.That included its massive compound walls.\nWhat will surprise you when you visit the Venugopalswamy Temple is its finish. Naturally you would be expecting the temple should look old. No, it looks as a newly finished large temple. That is because the surface of every stone is re-dressed by removing a layer of the flaky surface.\nSeven decade of submersion has done no damage to the temple. The only thing that gone bad was the surface appearance of the stones. That's solved by this polishing operation. Still in many areas of the temple you can see the unfinished original surface of the stones. That remains as a good glimpse to its past!\nThe temple is oriented in an east-west axis with its main entrance at the east, facing the reservoir.\nWhat you first see of the temple is its massive compound wall, called parakara. This is made of giant granite blocks on one over the other without the use of mortar.\nA giant porch with verandah in the east gives access to the temple compound. A Yagasala ( hall for ritualistic prayers) and kitchen is located on either sides of this giant gateway. The center of the gateway appears as a tall hall. When you pass this , note the details carved on the ceiling.\nAlso on the porch , just before the doorway is a plank with inscription in old Kannada scripts.\nAfter going through the main entrance you'll reach an open court with one more enclosure wall ( parakara) . So that makes it a twin parakara style architecture, a feature found only in large temples.\nNow you are standing in front of a granite flag post, an unusually tall one. The circular capital and the cubical base of the pillar are noteworthy. Baring the circular capital and the base features, it is monolithic granite block. At the base of the block are images of Ganapati and Nandi (bull). Both are typical Shiva iconography. At the top of the pillar is the image of a peacock.\nA pillared hall goes along the walls, facing the open court. This was used by the priests and the devotees for prayer and also served as the mass dining area.\nFrom this point the main temple is still not visible in a great way, thanks to its squat design typical of the Chalukya style temples.\nYou'll agin go through a massive gateway structure to enter the inner court, where the temple is located. This gateway has a pair of beautiful balustrades decorated with lotus buds, all carved in stone. The roof of this gateway is pyramidal with a sequence of steps.\nThis gateway is flanged by two pillared halls, both opened toward the temple. That is again the area dedicated for prayers and other temple ceremonies. Beyond that you'll find yourself in a paved open courtyard. The temple is located in the middle of this court.\nAgain along the inner walls of the court you can see a series of cell like shrines, all facing the temple in the center. There are 17 cells each on north and south sides and 12 on the west ( which is the rear side of the temple). The verandah along this cells are supported by cylindrical pillars with cubical capitals. The doorjambs of each of the cells are carved to imitate such work in wood. So are the cylindrical pillars, and specifically the capitals.\nThe cells are devoid of images. In its original form, each of these shrines contained icons, related to Vaishnava themes. Most important where the 10 avatars of Vishnu. Also the shrines contained images of Jala sayana Naraya , Hayagriva, Harihara, Brahma, Saraswati and so on.\nJalasayana Naraya is the image of Vishnu in a reclining posture on water. Hayagriva is an aspect of Vishnu. In iconography Hayagriva spots four arms, horse's head and human body. Brahma is the creator god in Hindu trinity. For some mythological reasons, it is rare to spot temples dedicated to Brahma. Saraswati is the goddess of learning. Harihara is a deity combining both Shaiva and Vaishnava traditions.\nThe main temple is executed in the classic Chalyukya style. What it means is the overall layout of the temple follows certain geometric patterns and spots peculiar architectural features.\nFor example the squat lathe turned pillars of the halls, called Mantapa. What was once a in the domain of woodwork is applied on the stone pillars. Practically all the pillars in the main hall of the temple, are made using this technique.\nYou get access to the open hall through the entrance located at the front of the temple. The whole temple structure stands on a platform a couple of feet heigh. From this entrance point you can see the Sanctum through a series of halls that is oriented along the principal axis of the temple. Though the Sanctum area is darker, nothing obstructs viewing the Sanctum from the entrance point.\nAround this open hall is a semi covered balcony. The bench like platform for sitting is interesting. From this open hall one can easily see the many shrines located around the open court.\nWhat dominated the halls are the pillars and the way it supports the ceiling. On the pillars you can see, holes as if it was socket for some features. This was part of the modifications done (probably part of an upgrade in the past) to cover the hall using wooden screens. What remains is only the sockets where the screens were fixed.\nWhile the pillars are peculiar, the ceilings are still interesting. In the main hall you will see ceilings made of large sheets of carved rocks. Most of it spots symmetrically executed floral patterns. The hall further close to the Sanctum ( cella ) has dome shaped (concave) ceilings with lotus bud protruding downward at its center point.\nAs you walk close towards the sanctorum, you reach a narrower hall called navaranga. Nava means nine and ranga means hall. Now count the number of sections (ceilings) of this hall. It's nine!\nBetween the navaranga and the sanctorum is a chamber called antarala ( the 'intermediate space' ). Literally this is the intermediate space between the god's image and the devotees.\nIn any Hindu temples , only priests are allowed into the antarala and to the Sanctorum.\nThe Sanctorum is closed chamber, where the image of the god is installed. Originally he Venugopalaswamy Temple sanctorum contained the image of Krishna as the cowherds boy with flute playing attitude under a Honne tree (Indian Kino Tree) .\nThe most architecturally thrilling part of the temple is its tower over the sanctorum called the sikhara. This fluted design is executed by placing finely carved blocks one over the other without the use of mortars. Thanks to the peculiar design it is difficult to spot the joints. Thus the whole tower looks like a dexterously executed single block.\nVenugopalaswamy Temple is located in a peninsula formed by the backwaters of the KRS dam. From Mysore you've to follow the same route as you take to the Brindavan Gardens. If you are driving from Bangalore side, you can take the right deviation to KRS after Srirangapatna to skip entering Mysore city. Similarly , if you are driving towards Mysore from the Hunsur side, take the left deviation at Yelwal for KRS dam. There are signboards, still you may as locally to confirm if you have taken the right road to KRS.\nAs you near the dam, you've to stop at a point before a long bridge to pay the toll fee. The dam and Brindavan Gardens appears on your left. Immediately after crossing the bridge you've to take a steep left turn to head towards the parking area of the Brindavan Gardens. For heading to Venugopalaswamy Temple you need to head straight instead of taking that left turn towards the dam. In other words, head straight after the toll booth and the bridge.\nThe road will cross a few more irrigation canals. On your right will appear a few ancient temples.\nAfter a few turns and a couple of kilometers later this road will hit a larger road (bus route) near a village called Katteri . Turn left to take the main road. Now you are practically going around the backwaters. A few kilometers later the road makes a few bends and goes through a village called Hosa Kannambadi.\nIf you are not able to spot a signboard, ask at this point for the diversion. Drive slow as it's a difficult to find diversion on your left. ( Otherwise this road heads towards Krishnarajpet ( KR Pet) and further hit NH48 at Channarayapatna)\nYou've to practically go through a narrow ally of Hosa Kannambadi village to reach the Venugopalaswamy Temple. Now you can not go lost. A little ahead , after crossing the village you can see the KRS backwaters on either sides of this narrow peninsula. The temple hides in lowland, so you'll notice it only after you've practically arrived at the tip of this peninsula. On the way you'll see some rocky outcrops and paddy fields on either sides.The road ends right behind the temple compound.\nThe distance should not be more than 7 to 8 kilometers if you travel from Brindavan Gardens to Venugopalaswamy Temple.\nWhat is you are backpacking and depending only on public transport?\nUp to Brindavan Gardens you can easily reach by one those frequent bus services from Mysore city. From the Brindavan Gardens to Venugopalaswamy Temple there are no public transport available, baring the odd bus services passing by this area (heading towards K.R.Pete).\nTry your luck first for the possibility of a local bus to Hosakannambadi or Katteri. In any case from Hosa Kannambadi village you've to walk about a kilometer.\nIf that doesn't look viable you can try to hire an auto rickshaw locally (at KRS town circle or near the dam area). Negotiate a return 'package' that includes an hours waiting time too. And of course you may ask for a free lift on a bike or on one of those tractors loaded with haystacks!\nThe open hall in front of the sanctum of Venugopalaswamy Temple\nLathe carved pillars inside Venugopala swamy temple\nOpen pavilion in from of the Venugopala swamy Temple.

{"question":"Which architectural masterpiece took longer to complete: the Nativity Cathedral of Suzdal during its 1528-1530 reconstruction, or Barcelona's La Sagrada Família which began construction in 1882?","answer":"La Sagrada Família has taken significantly longer to complete than the Nativity Cathedral's reconstruction. The Nativity Cathedral's major reconstruction was completed in just two years (1528-1530) under Moscow's Grand Prince Vasily III. In contrast, La Sagrada Família, which began construction in 1882, has been under construction for over 140 years and is still not complete. The basilica's construction was interrupted by Antoni Gaudí's death and is targeted to be completed by 2026.","context":["Cathedral of Nativity of Mother of God, northwest view. Right: Bell tower & Archbishop’s Residence. May 29, 2007.William Brumfield\nSergei Prokudin-Gorsky spent more than 11 years traveling across the Russian Empire, documenting the country and its people in photographs. His vision of photography as a form of education and enlightenment was demonstrated with special clarity in his images of medieval architecture in the historic settlements northeast of Moscow, including Suzdal, Vladimir and Pereslavl-Zalessky.\nProkudin-Gorsky’s photographs of the ancient town of Suzdal were taken in summer 1912. Bypassed by railroad construction and with little industry, Suzdal retained a bucolic atmosphere captured so poignantly in Prokudin-Gorsky’s photographs. At the time of his visit, the town had about 7,000 inhabitants (only slightly less than its current population of 10,000) and an extraordinary concentration of churches and monasteries. Suzdal was also renowned for its connection with the family of Prince Dmitry Pozharsky, a national hero who was instrumental in bringing about the end of the Time of Troubles in the early 17th century.\nThe first mention of Suzdal occurred under the year 1024, yet there were undoubtedly settlements of Finno-Ugric and Slavic peoples in the area by the 9th and 10th centuries. By the early 11th century, Kiev had extended its political and religious authority into this rich agricultural territory, and at the turn of the 12th century, Prince Vladimir Monomakh of Kiev arrived with a new wave of settlers. Monomakh erected a citadel (kremlin) above the small Kamenka River and began construction of the Suzdal cathedral around 1102. It is possibly the earliest major brick structure in the territory of northeastern Rus.\nIn 1222-25 Prince Yury Vsevolovich, the great-grandson of Monomakh, razed the original church and erected the magnificent cathedral dedicated to the Nativity of the Mother of God (Theotokos). The structure was built primarily of a light tufa, with limestone for the details. Prokudin-Gorsky devoted special attention to the Nativity Cathedral, which he recognized as a defining monument of medieval Russian culture.\nSuzdal. Cathedral of Nativity of Mother of God, southeast view, summer 1912. / Photo: Sergei Prokudin-Gorsky\nMy own photographs of the cathedral span a range from March 1972 through May 2009.\nCathedral of Nativity of Mother of God, east view.

May 29, 2007. / Photo: William Brumfield\nThe exterior was decorated with the ornamental stone carving that is a distinctive feature of stone churches built in the Vladimir area at the end of the 12th century by Yury’s father, Vsevolod III. The carved ornamentation included columns that formed the arcade band, as well as lions and female masks at the corners and along the facades. Prokudin-Gorsky recorded these details in a separate photograph of the south façade in 1912.\nCathedral of Nativity of Mother of God, south facade. Summer 1912. / Photo: Sergei Prokudin-Gorsky\nThe Nativity Cathedral withstood the sack of Suzdal by the Mongols in 1238, even though the interior was completely pillaged. Through decades marked by plague, famine and invasion, the structure stood until 1445, when a raiding force of Kazan Tatars sacked the town and set fire to the cathedral interior. The attack so weakened the roof vaulting that the upper part of the building collapsed.\nIn 1528-1530, Moscow's Grand Prince Vasily III rebuilt the Nativity Cathedral as part of a campaign to restore the heritage of the Russian lands under Moscow’s protection. During this reconstruction, the remains of the stone walls were uniformly lowered to the level of the \"blind\" arcade at the top of the first floor. The upper structure and the drums beneath the five cupolas were rebuilt of new brick in the style of large Muscovite churches. Fortunately, much of the original stone carving was preserved.\nCathedral of Nativity of Mother of God, south façade.

May 29, 2007. / Photo: William Brumfield\nIn the 1630s, Archbishop Serapion repaired damage to the structure that had occurred during the Time of Troubles and oversaw the construction near the cathedral of an octagonal bell tower with a small church dedicated to the Annunciation on its second level. Crowned by a “tent” roof, the bell tower was expanded at the end of the 17th century by Metropolitan Hilarion. A powerful and cultured prelate, Hilarion also built the third component of the cathedral ensemble, the Archbishop’s Residence. Its oldest section, visible on the left in Prokudin-Gorsky’s photograph, retained walls from a15th-century bishop’s residence.\nThe upper part of the Nativity Cathedral was damaged by a major fire that swept through Suzdal in 1719, and it subsequently underwent substantial repairs. Further changes were implemented in 1748, when the five cupolas gained their flaring onion shape, and a sloped roof was placed over the rounded gables (zakomary). In 1815, a chapel dedicated to the Nativity of Christ was added to the south façade. In 1895, the cathedral gained a new heating system that required the construction of a tall chimney, which can be seen in Prokudin-Gorsky’s view.\nIn the 1950s, a capital restoration of the cathedral retained the 18th-century onion domes, but restored the curved roof line of the 16th century zakomary. The attached chapel visible in Prokudin-Gorsky’s photograph was removed to reveal the original limestone porch. The beige-toned aggregate that coated the facades was replaced with whitewash. Prokudin-Gorsky’s photograph shows 19th-century frescoes on the zakomary, but Soviet specialists considered the paintings insignificant as well as distracting and replaced them with whitewash. My photographs show these many changes to a monument that is now included on the UNESCO World Heritage List.\nCathedral of Nativity of Mother of God, northwest view.

Despite being the second smallest among the other six continents worldwide, it doesn’t disappoint in making every traveler’s experience special.\nEurope doesn’t need any introduction to convince someone that it is the best place to be where every corner is teeming with majestic spots, historic landmarks, and sophisticated culture admired by lurking outsiders.\nTo date, there are about 44 sovereign countries in Europe having their respective spots to leave everyone in awe.\nHere are among the best places to visit in Europe:\nEiffel Tower in Paris\nEiffel Tower is everyone’s must-visit spot when visiting Europe. This tower was built 130 years ago and still stands 1063 feet, charming every spectator visiting France.\nIt was initially built to commemorate the French Revolution and became a symbol of love where marriage proposals and courtships are declared.\nAbout 7 million people are visiting the tower yearly.\nColosseum in Rome\nColosseum takes you back to the ancient Roman times of gladiator battles as a sign of entertainment. It was said that the construction of the Colosseum started in 70 A.D., and it could seat 50,000 audiences at that time.\nIt was the grandest amphitheater built by the Roman Empire, named after its colossal structure.\nOther than the size of the Colosseum, tourists are flocking to admire the classical column styles of the architecture. Ironically, this architecture was built by Romans with a Greek column style.\nA whopping 6 million people are visiting the Colosseum every year.\nParthenon in Athens\nGreece takes pride in its iconic monument built in 447 B.C, the Parthenon. It is a sacred temple built in honor of the Greek goddess Athena Parthenos. The Parthenon is made of white marble and stands at 23,000 square feet at the top of the acropolis.\nSame as the Eiffel Tower, there are also about 7 million people visiting the Parthenon yearly. Most people are amazed at how perfectly the ancient Greeks were able to build such a temple.\nLa Sagrada Família in Barcelona\nAnother tourist spot to behold in Europe is the La Sagrada Família, showcasing the masterpiece of the Spanish architect Antoni Gaudí.\nThe basilica’s construction began in 1882 but was interrupted due to Gaudí’s sudden death. La Sagrada Família has been under construction since then, and it is targeted to be completed by 2026.\nUNESCO regarded La Sagrada Familia as one of the world’s heritage sites.\nStonehenge in England\nStonehenge is another historic spot to explore in Europe. There are a few speculations of its purpose from the time it was built 5000 years ago. Archaeological research said that it was used as a burial site in ancient times and a ritual place.\nStonehenge is a Neolithic stone built in a circle. The area is attractive to travelers and researchers who are curious about how the ancient people can carry such heavy tons of rock.\nLeaning Tower of Pisa in Pisa\nWho would have thought that an architectural mistake could be the world’s famous destination? The Leaning Tower of Pisa was built in 1173 as part of Pisa’s cathedral, but the foundation where it’s built was frail.\nThe 57-meter-tall tower was built on swampy ground and was expected to collapse when it leaned 5.5 degrees to the ground in 1995.\nNow, it is another European pride greeting 5 million tourists every year.\nSt. Peter’s Basilica in Vatican City\nSt. Peter’s Basilica is tops as the largest church all over Europe and every Christian’s pilgrimage destination. It was constructed during the 4th century A.D in a Renaissance style.\nSt. Peter’s Basilica is witness to all significant events in Catholicism. It is the headquarters of all the catholic churches over the world and where the pope resides. Near the vicinity of the basilica are other ancient and scenic spots like the Vatican Museum and Castel Sant’Angelo.\nEvery year, about 10 million tourists are visiting the basilica.\nLouvre Museum in Paris\nLouvre Museum is considered the largest art museum globally, housing 38,000 specimens and 7,500 paintings.\nIt is also where the world’s famous Mona Lisa painting resides. It was said that you might take 100 days to view all the pieces in Louvre with just a 30-second stare per artwork.\nIn 2018, Louvre reached 10 million visitors making it the most visited museum in the world.\nPantheon in Rome\nAnother preserved temple from ancient Rome and now a Christian temple, Pantheon, is admired by many tourists setting foot in Rome. Pantheon is also one of the most ancient structures in Europe, constructed in 25 B.C by Marcus Agrippa.\nPantheon’s style is a simple classical temple style with giant columns and a perfectly shaped dome. Unlike Parthenon, it is made of bricks, concrete, granite a bit of white marble.\nEvery year, about 7 million tourists are admiring the Roman architecture."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:e77ec711-955d-49fa-b0ae-6238c6f1dd2c>","<urn:uuid:409438c1-65ae-4758-88b2-5c3e342adfc4>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the differences between the Bat Shadow and Horsehead Nebula in terms of their distances from Earth?","answer":"The Bat Shadow, located in the Serpens Nebula, is approximately 1,300 light-years away from Earth, while the Horsehead Nebula is slightly farther at approximately 1,500 light-years from Earth.","context":["Shadows on Earth can be mysterious and foreboding, but when they occur in space, they can convey information we otherwise could not know. In a stellar nursery called the Serpens Nebula, nearly 1,300 light-years away, a young star’s game of shadow play is revealing secrets of its unseen planet-forming disk. The near-infrared vision of NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope captured the shadow cast by the fledgling star’s brilliant light being blocked by this disk.\nNamed HBC 672, this Sun-like star is surrounded by a debris ring of dust, rock and ice — a disk that is too small and too distant to be seen, even by Hubble. But like a little fly that wanders into the beam of a flashlight shining on a wall, its shadow is projected large upon the cloud in which it was born.\nIn this Hubble image, the feature — nicknamed the “Bat Shadow” — spans approximately 200 times the length of our solar system. It is visible in the upper right portion of the picture.\n“This is an analog of what the solar system looked like when it was only 1 or 2 million years old,” explained Klaus Pontoppidan, an astronomer at the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) in Baltimore, Maryland. “For all we know, the solar system once created a shadow like this.”\nThe presence of a shadow means that the disk is being viewed nearly edge-on. This is something that could not otherwise be known because of the disk’s great distance from us, which makes it too small to be seen by Hubble.\nThe disk’s shadow is similar to what is produced by a cylindrical lamp shade. Light escapes from the top and bottom of the shade, but along its circumference, dark cones of shadow form. Although the disk that gives rise to the shadow is a common object around young stars, the combination of an edge-on viewing angle and the surrounding nebula is rare.\nScientists can use the shadow to figure out the shape of the disk. For example, they now know that the disk is puffy, which implies that it is full of gas. While most of the shadow is completely opaque, scientists can look for color differences along its edges, where some light gets through. They can use the shape and color of the shadow to determine the size and composition of dust grains suspended in the disk.\n“These shadows are not easily seen in visible light, but the stellar disks and the shadows they project onto the surrounding nebula can be easily detected in infrared light,” said Max Mutchler, a research and instrument scientist at STScI. “This infrared Bat Shadow reveals properties of both the small, dusty disk and the much larger nebula.”\nThe shadow is an example of what the future James Webb Space Telescope will be capable of studying in even greater depth. “Webb’s power lies in its ability to see into the dust and gas of these disks to understand the material that comprises these environments that form planets,” explained scientist Alexandra Lockwood of STScI.\nA similar-looking shadow phenomenon emanates from another young star, at the upper left of the Hubble image. At the lower right, what appears to be a void is likely a part of a foreground cloud. Light from the red, double star inside the void is partially blocked by this cloud.\nThe image will be used with NASA’s Universe of Learning to illustrate how shadows can convey information about phenomena invisible to us. This program creates materials and experiences to enable learners to explore the universe for themselves.

The nebula is located just to the south of the star Alnitak, which is farthest east on Orion's Belt, and is part of the much larger Orion Molecular Cloud Complex. The nebula was first recorded in 1888 by Scottish astronomer Williamina Fleming on photographic plate B2312 taken at the Harvard College Observatory. The Horsehead Nebula is approximately 1500 light years from Earth. It is one of the most identifiable nebulae because of the shape of its swirling cloud of dark dust and gases, which bears some resemblance to a horse's head when viewed from Earth.\nThe dark cloud of dust and gas is a region in the Orion Molecular Cloud Complex where star formation is taking place. This stellar nursery, as it is known, can contain over 100 known organic and inorganic gases as well as dust consisting of large and complex organic molecules.\nThe red or pinkish glow originates from hydrogen gas predominantly behind the nebula, ionized by the nearby bright star Sigma Orionis. Magnetic fields channel the gases leaving the nebula into streams, shown as streaks in the background glow. A glowing strip of hydrogen gas marks the edge of the massive cloud and the densities of stars are noticeably different on either side.\nThe heavy concentrations of dust in the Horsehead Nebula region and neighbouring Orion Nebula are localized, resulting in alternating sections of nearly complete opacity and transparency. The darkness of the Horsehead is caused mostly by thick dust blocking the light of stars behind it. The lower part of the Horsehead's neck casts a shadow to the left. The visible dark nebula emerging from the gaseous complex is an active site of the formation of \"low-mass\" stars. Bright spots in the Horsehead Nebula's base are young stars just in the process of forming.\n- Arnett, Bill (2000). \"Horsehead Nebula\".

{"question":"What are the treatment approaches for food intolerance versus ulcerative colitis?","answer":"Food intolerance and ulcerative colitis require different treatment approaches. Food intolerance is typically managed by identifying trigger foods through keeping a food diary and then avoiding those foods. In specific cases like celiac disease, this means following a gluten-free diet. Ulcerative colitis, however, requires more complex treatment options including medications to start or maintain remission and improve quality of life, and in some cases surgery may be necessary. The treatment plan for ulcerative colitis depends on the severity of the disease, past complications, and response to previous treatments.","context":["What are digestion problems?\nThe digestive system is an intricate and extensive part of the body. It ranges all the way from the mouth to the rectum. The digestive system helps your body absorb essential nutrients and is responsible for getting rid of waste.\nDigestion problems can mean more than unwanted symptoms. Minor problems that are left untreated can lead to more serious, chronic illnesses.\nBecause there are so many different types of digestion problems, you might mistakenly dismiss them. It’s important to understand common digestion problems — as well as emergency symptoms — so you know when to talk to a doctor.\nChronic constipation indicates a problem with getting rid of waste. This most often occurs when the colon can’t pass or move stools through the rest of the digestive tract. You may experience abdominal pain and bloating as well as fewer bowel movements (which are more painful than usual).\nChronic constipation is one of the most common digestive problems in the United States.Getting enough fiber, water, and exercise will likely help curb constipation. Medications can also provide relief in more serious cases.\nFood intolerance occurs when your digestive system can’t tolerate certain foods. Unlike food allergies, which can cause hives and respiratory problems, an intolerance only affects digestion.\nSymptoms of food intolerance include:\nFood intolerance is usually diagnosed by keeping and reviewing a food diary. Recording what you eat and when can help you identify which foods are triggering your symptoms.\nCeliac disease, an autoimmune disorder, is one type of food intolerance. It causes digestive problems when you eat gluten (a protein in wheat, barley, and rye). People with celiac disease must follow a gluten-free diet to minimize symptoms and damage to the small intestine.\nHeartburn is an occasional occurrence for many adults. This happens when stomach acids go back up into the esophagus, causing chest pain and the trademark burning sensation.\nIf you have more frequent heartburn, you might have gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Such frequent episodes can interfere with your daily life and damage your esophagus.\nSymptoms of GERD include:\n- chest discomfort\n- dry cough\n- sour taste in the mouth\n- sore throat\n- swallowing difficulties\nYou may need medications to control heartburn. A damaged esophagus can make swallowing difficult and disrupt the rest of the digestive system.\nInflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a type of chronic swelling. It affects one of more parts of the digestive tract.\nThere are two types of IBD:\n- Crohn’s disease: affects the entire gastrointestinal (GI) tract but most commonly affects the small intestine and the colon\n- ulcerative colitis: affects only the colon\nIBD can cause more general digestive ailments, such as abdominal pain and diarrhea. Other symptoms can include:\n- incomplete bowel movements\n- loss of appetite and subsequent weight loss\n- night sweats\n- rectal bleeding\nIt’s important to diagnosis and treat IBD as soon as possible. Not only will you be more comfortable, but early treatment also reduces damage to the GI tract.\nA gastroenterologist is a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating diseases involving the digestive system. If you continue to experience digestion problems, it’s time to make an appointment.\nSome signs are more serious and could mean there’s an emergency medical problem. These signs include:\n- bloody stools\n- continuous vomiting\n- severe abdominal cramps\n- sudden, unintentional weight loss\nYou may be able to overcome digestion problems with treatment and lifestyle changes. Certain diseases of the digestive system might be long-term, but medications can help alleviate symptoms.\nIdentifying specific digestion problems and talking with a gastroenterologist can go a long way in terms of helping your doctor give you a proper diagnosis. Remember, you don’t have to put up with constant digestive issues.","Ulcerative colitis is a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that affects the colon and rectum, and can cause severe belly pain, cramps, diarrhea and bleeding.\nUlcerative colitis may start slowly and get worse for many weeks. It can have times of remission (time when your symptoms get better) or mildly, moderately or severely active. It can be described as fulminant, which means that it is severely active and not responding to therapy.\nMost symptoms of ulcerative colitis relate to bowel movements. But, the symptoms of ulcerative colitis can vary from person to person, based on where the disease is in the body and how bad the inflammation is.\nThe most common symptoms of ulcerative colitis are:\nYou might have weight loss or other symptoms that affect the entire body. The inflammation of ulcerative colitis can also affect your joints or skin, leading to painful joints and skin rashes. During a flare-up, symptoms may go beyond those that affect the digestive system, including:\nKeep of track of any symptoms, how often you have them and how bad they are to talk about with your health care provider.\nThere are many tests your gastroenterologist can do to find out if you have ulcerative colitis. First, he or she will take your past health and family health info, listen to your symptoms, and do an exam to feel and listen to your belly. No one test makes the diagnosis, but testing is used to confirm the gastroenterologist’s clinical suspicion that ulcerative colitis is causing symptoms.\nUlcerative colitis is diagnosed by the presence of the common symptoms and endoscopic and biopsy (small tissue sample) findings of long-term inflammation in the large intestine.\nTalk to your doctor about which test is best for you. Your doctor will tell you how to get ready for your test for ulcerative colitis.\nWhile there is no cure for ulcerative colitis, there are many options to help treat it. The goals of treatment are to:\nTreatment will depend on the severity of the disease, past complications and response to earlier treatments. Remember, everyone experiences symptoms of ulcerative colitis differently. If one treatment doesn’t work as well, there are other options. Just be sure to be in touch with your gastroenterologist often.\nTreatment options for ulcerative colitis involve medications, surgery or a combination.\nThe goals of using medications are to start or keep up remission (no symptoms) and to improve quality of life. Each person reacts a little bit differently to each drug and many need a combination of drugs. While some of them have side effects, the benefits and symptom relief often outweigh those drawbacks. Learn more about each class of drug in the Living with IBD pages.\nEven with the availability of medicines to treat ulcerative colitis, surgery may still be needed to manage the disease. There are a few types of surgery that your gastroenterologist with discuss with you.\nBefore having surgery for ulcerative colitis, it is important to understand what the aim of the surgery is, what will happen during the procedure and the length of the recovery period. Patients with ulcerative colitis having surgery should speak to other patients who have had the procedure. Previous patients are often very willing to share their experiences and add perspective.\nNo matter what you may be feeling upon hearing you have ulcerative colitis, it is of great value to know that you are not alone. Many places have support groups, both in-person and online, for people all ages that can be very helpful. Talk to your doctor about support groups at their office or the hospital or do your own research to get involved with the ulcerative colitis (and IBD) community.\nIf you are overwhelmed by your new diagnosis, don’t wait to reach out to a mental health expert to talk through the changes. Relaxation techniques, such as yoga, meditation or mindfulness, may be very helpful.\nWorking together with your health-care team, you can make a treatment plan just for you, to help control your symptoms and put you in charge of your ulcerative colitis.\nQuestions to ask your health care provider\nIf you don’t know something at any point, ask for more (or clearer) information! For some, hearing that they have ulcerative colitis is a relief, a reason for symptoms and a light at the end of the tunnel. For others, it can be scary and daunting. Many will have a mix of feelings. All of this is completely normal.\nTaking your medicine and staying well hydrated and nourished can help keep ulcerative colitis under control. Sometimes, though, complications can happen. Often, with ulcerative colitis, these issues will need medical attention.\nIf you think you are having one of these complications of ulcerative colitis, let your doctor know right away.\nUpdated August 2020"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"content_constrained"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"opinion_recommendation"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:63d74562-05c7-4f43-ba1a-10090daa58ae>","<urn:uuid:6bcaf154-5bbb-4db0-894a-4c82f3743a98>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do high-intensity vs low-intensity resistance training affect muscle fiber growth?","answer":"Both high and low-intensity resistance training can be effective for muscle growth, but they affect different muscle fiber types. High-intensity training (>50% 1RM) tends to produce greater growth in type II (fast-twitch) fibers, while low-intensity training (<50% 1RM) may stimulate more growth in type I (slow-twitch) fibers. Recent evidence shows that low-intensity training can produce comparable whole-muscle hypertrophy to high-intensity training when sets are taken to failure, with type I fiber growth rates rivaling those of type II fibers. The key factor is the degree of effort - when sets conclude with maximal or near maximal effort, motor unit recruitment is maximized regardless of the resistance used.","context":["2014 Back Issues\nWhat Principle has been Misinterpreted and Distorted to the Detriment of Resistance Trainees?\nA Review of a Critical Analysis of the Size Principle\nCarpinelli RN. The size principle and a critical analysis of the unsubstantiated heavier-is-better recommendation for resistance training. Journal of Exercise Science and Fitness. 2008; 6: 67-85.\n- Over the last several years, Carpinelli's incisive critical analyses1,2 of resistance training studies\nhave shown that there is very little evidence to support the complex, higher volume training advocated by professional\nand commercial organizations. And, Carpinelli has shown that there is little evidence that the many variations of resistance\ntraining variables such as number of repetitions and percent of maximum (1RM) used for an exercise, also advocated by\nthese same organizations to produce very specific outcomes, in fact, do produce such specific outcomes.\nInstead, Carpinelli has shown that simple, brief, resistance training with muscle groups trained twice per week produces good\noutcomes regardless of trainee status. Outcomes are largely attributable to genetic factors and far less to variations of routines.\n- Performing higher volume, complex routines will not particularly harm trainees. Such training, however, may become daunting\nand frustrating over time and perhaps lead people to lapse in their training or stop altogether.\n- One variation of a training program that is often advocated, however, can be harmful. The variation is based on the idea that to maximize strength and muscular hypertrophy, it is necessary to use very heavy resistance.\n- In this new critical analysis, Carpinelli decisively provided evidence about two central and related aspects of resistance training. The first is the size principle and the second is whether the use of heavy resistance provides superior outcomes.\n- Size Principle:\n- As described in a number of prior issues of Master Trainer, the size principle of motor unit recruitment is one of the standard neuromuscular principles with universal application. Universal means that the size principle applies to everyone and to every modality of training. There are no exceptions to the principle.\n- The principle states that motor units are recruited in the order of their size. The smaller motor units are recruited first and then the larger motor units are recruited. The percent of motor units recruited that are associated with specific muscles or muscle groups is dependent upon a dimension of the task performed. The dimension associated with the percent of motor units recruited is the degree of effort. The degree of effort is the intensity involved in performing the task. A high degree of effort, or maximal effort, that is a high degree of maximal intensity, will result in maximal motor unit recruitment.\n- In this critical analysis, Carpinelli showed that for about 30 years, most of the leading luminaries of resistance training researchers, many associated with a leading organization, have wittingly or unwittingly misinterpreted the size principle. The main fault is their equating external force, the resistance used in an exercise, to intensity. In the widely promulgated framework used by these researchers and their organization, intensity is based on the percent of 1 RM used in an exercise. For example, if 70% of 1 RM is used in an exercise, this is considered ‘moderate intensity’. If 90% of 1 RM is used, this is considered ‘high intensity’. Intensity in this framework is the amount of weight used relative to the 1 RM and not the degree of effort.\n- According to a proper interpretation of the size principle, if a set performed with 90% of 1 RM is concluded with a last repetition at maximal or close to maximal effort, this should maximize motor unit recruitment. Likewise, if a set is performed with 70% of 1 RM is concluded with a last repetition at maximal or close to maximal effort, this also should maximize motor unit recruitment. With the 90% of 1 RM, perhaps 5 reps are performed in the set. With 70% of 1 RM, perhaps 12 reps are performed in the set. But if both sets represent maximal or near maximal efforts, then the outcomes based on the size principle should be similar, or perhaps the same. This is because the effort - the degree of intensity - is the same.\n- Note that it is possible to have a high amount of external force such as the 90% of 1 RM, but only modest effort. This would occur, for example, if only one or two repetitions were performed with the 90% of 1 RM when four or five could be performed.\n- It also is likely that performing exercises with heavy resistance can increase the probability of injuries. However, because of their distortion of the interpretation of the size principle, organizations and commercial interests have advocated the use of heavy resistance to optimize outcomes.\n- Why have they advocated the use of heavy resistance? For some organizations, resistance training in its many forms is still construed as ‘weight lifting’. This presumably is the identification, area of expertise, framework, .and marketing points for these organizations. If resistance training really was not weightlifting and should be construed in a different way, then these organizations would not be viable and have little to offer to athletes and typical trainees.\n- But, this question remains. What do the results of studies actually show about the use of heavy resistance for optimizing outcomes?\n- In his critical analysis, Carpinelli reviewed 21 resistance training studies that compared within the same study training with lighter or moderate resistance typically performed with higher repetitions per set to training with heavy resistance with typically lower repetitions per set. In 20 of the 21 studies, there were no differences in strength outcomes.\n- If maximizing motor unit recruitment and strength depended upon the amount of resistance used in an exercise, then overwhelmingly the studies comparing training with different loads would show much better outcomes when heavy resistance was used. Instead, about 95% of such studies showed no difference in outcomes favoring the use of heavy resistance.\n- Proper interpretation of the size principle points toward the use of any reasonable, self-chosen resistance and time under tension for producing optimal outcomes when sets conclude with a maximal or near maximal effort. The use of more moderate resistance and somewhat longer time (60-90 seconds) under tension may also reduce the risk of injuries associated with heavy resistance.\n- This also makes resistance training more acceptable and a lot safer for many people, from top athletes, bodybuilders of all ages, and to a wide spectrum of the general public. Conversely, the belief and promotion of the use of heavy resistance by professional organizations and commercial concerns represent a weightlifting framework that may have discouraged many people – maybe even you - from engaging in resistance training and possibly resulted in many unnecessary injuries.\n- To read more about how to effectively use more moderate resistance based on a proper interpretation of the size principle, see our new training primer, Optimal Training.\n- Carpinelli RN, Otto RM, Winett RA.

Today we have an awesome guest blog by Dan Ogborn, one of the industry’s top experts on the effects of strength training on skeletal muscle. We’ve read Dan’s blogs before and we are big fans of his work because he uses science to back up his claims, so we asked him to spread some knowledge with the Train Loco readers so you all could get into the weight room and apply drop sets to your training protocols and further your gains. Enjoy!\n-Eric and Chris\nThe dropset goes by many names, and opinions on their use in hypertrophy training are just as plentiful. To some, it’s a gateway to pain and overtraining, an unnecessary technique reserved only for those “advanced” enough to handle it. To others it’s the quickest ticket to slabs of muscle. Despite the widespread use and abuse of dropsets in training, and the variety of methods for their use, little is known as to whether or not dropsets are actually effective, and if they are, how they work from a physiological perspective.\nThe Science of Drop Sets\nUnfortunately the scientific community hasn’t given much thought to the dropset, and I’m not sure this technique will see much time in the lab in the future either. Two studies from Goto et al. (1,2) have suggested that dropsets may confer a slight hypertrophic advantage. In the first (2), the inclusion of a lower load set (50%-1RM) immediately after a high-load set (90%-1RM) resulted in a greater acute growth hormone (GH) response and post-exercise muscle swelling which the authors cautiously theorized could enhance the adaptation to training. The significance of the post-exercise GH spike is unclear (3), especially in the context of recent evidence that post-exercise fluctuations in systemic hormones (like GH), do not necessarily impact or correlate with the ultimate hypertrophic response (4-8).\nIn the second study, Goto et al. (1) trained groups of men in what they considered to be a hypertrophy-type training program (variable %-1RM, minimal rest) for six weeks, then split the groups into a pure strength group (5 sets at 90%-1RM, 3 min rest) and a strength group that performed a final dropset for their last set (5 sets at 90%-1RM, drop to 50%-1RM on last set), over an additional four weeks. While both groups increased muscle size roughly 5% in the initial hypertrophy phase, the addition of the dropset in the subsequent training phase did not result in a statistically significant difference in growth between the groups (2% vs -1%, p=0.08). While this is a very specific experiment that may not reflect what happens in most hypertrophy training programs, it doesn’t provide the most compelling case that dropsets confer a hypertrophic advantage.\nDropsets are actually difficult to study, and in Goto et al’s (1,2) work there’s a major limitation. Scientific studies require strict controls in order to determine how individual variables contribute to the result of the experiment. In the case of the dropset it’s hard to control for the volume of exercise or work performed when you add on additional dropsets between the experimental groups. It may be that the dropset advantage in these studies (1,2) is simply because they had higher training volumes than without dropsets, that may contribute to increased muscle growth.\nSo it seems at this point we have many anecdotal accounts and articles singing the dropset praises, however the scientific evidence (1,2), while showing the potential for modest benefit at best, can’t give us a solid conclusion. While the data may not be there yet, there is a nice physiological rationale that can be used to justify using dropsets in your hypertrophy programming based on some recent evidence on the effects of various training intensities on muscle growth.\nA Tale of Two Fibers\nWithout going into too much detail, skeletal muscle is mainly composed of two fiber-types, the slow-twitch type I and fast-twitch type II fibers. As their “slow-twitch” name alludes, the type I fibers are often smaller, weaker, and have lower power outputs than their type II relatives but are highly fatigue-resistant (9,10). In the hypertrophy world, it is often thought that type II fibers have superior growth potential to type I fibers (11), and that training programs should target type II fibers to maximize muscle growth by utilizing high training intensities (12). This assumption is not necessarily invalid, and work from Fry (11) has shown that when the results of multiple training studies are pooled, type II fibers respond well to high intensity (>50%-1RM) training, and to a greater extent than the type I fibers. At lower training intensities (<50%-1RM), type I fibers may grow more than type IIs, but the peak growth rates are still lower than at high training intensities. Unfortunately, the majority of training studies utilize higher training intensities (>50%-1RM) (11,13), so it’s hard to conclusively say that type II fibers always outgrow the type I fibers, or that this response is specific to higher training intensities. In fact, recent evidence has shown that low-intensity training can stimulate muscle protein synthesis (14) and produce comparable whole-muscle hypertrophy to high intensity training when sets are taken to failure (15,16). Even more interesting, in this dataset the type I fiber growth rate with low-intensity training rivaled that of the type II fibers with high-intensity (15), suggesting that we may have misjudged the ability of our type I fibers to grow. The fact that bodybuilders also have larger type I than II fibers (11), and powerlifters and olympic lifters have larger type II than I fibers, adds additional, albeit indirect support, to this recent data on type I fiber and whole muscle hypertrophy when training to failure regardless of load (15,16).\nSo how does this impact your training? If you’re focused on packing on more muscle mass, you need to ensure you provide a training stimulus to promote the growth of both type I and II fibers. Focusing solely on load (high intensity) may be great for type II fiber growth but may leave your type I fibers under-stimulated and craving some time under tension. On the opposite end of the spectrum, focusing on fatigue and time under tension with light loads, which can possibly still hit your type II fibers (17), may not be optimal for type II fiber growth (18). Since the scientific literature on the topic is still undecided (19) you’ll need to take an approach that maximizes type II fiber recruitment (high training intensity, high effort, and/or high fatigue/failure) and satisfies the type I fibers. Not a small order!\nWhat Does This Have to do With Dropsets?\nUltimately our understanding of muscle growth and fiber-type specific hypertrophy is not at the level where we should be making black-and-white statements to training exclusively at high or lower intensities to maximize mass. There’s a multitude of ways to address the needs of your type I and II fibers across a strength training program, but the dropset allows us to get the best of both worlds in a single, but painful, set.\nWhile there are many ways to structure a dropset, the traditional dropset allows us to maximize both load and time under tension. In the first portion of the set, load can be emphasized, even as high as a 3-5RM, to demand high levels of muscle activation so you’ll have to recruit your full complement of motor units and tap into your fast-twitch fibers. As you work through each subsequent drop in weight, you’ll be providing greater time under tension than if you stopped after one set, giving the type I fibers the stimulus they need to get growing. If things couldn’t get any better, the increased fatigue will act as a safe-guard to ensure you really hit those type II fibers, as fatigue can actually make it easier to recruit your type II fibers at a weight where their use wouldn’t be normally be required (17).\nMaximizing muscle growth is a balancing act of training variables, but simple techniques used judiciously in a well thought out training program, consistently executed is the path to pounds of extra muscle. While the research hasn’t given us conclusive insight into the use of dropsets for hypertrophy training, based on our understanding of muscle physiology it’s likely that dropsets are still a viable and valuable component of your training toolbox.\nNeed Help Putting Together a Flexible Training Program\nIf you want personalized help with us programming a flexible and individualized training program, you can work directly with us.

{"question":"As a history student, I'm wondering how do the false memories of 9/11 celebrations in New Jersey compare to the actual footage of Pearl Harbor destruction in terms of visual documentation?","answer":"While there was extensive documented footage of Pearl Harbor's destruction showing wrecked planes, burning ships, and damaged hangars at locations like Hickham Field, there is no existing footage of the alleged celebrations in New Jersey on 9/11 that Trump claimed to have seen. Despite Trump's insistence that he watched 'thousands and thousands' of people cheering in New Jersey as the towers fell, extensive searches by NPR, news organizations, and others found no archival footage matching this description. The only somewhat related incident involved five individuals (who were Israeli, not Arab) photographing themselves inappropriately in front of the burning towers.","context":["NEWS: On 22 November 2015, presidential candidate Donald Trump appeared on ABC’s This Week with George Stephanopoulos; among topics of discussion was Trump’s 21 November 2015 assertion that he witnessed footage on television of large crowd of Muslims in New Jersey celebrating the September 11th attacks.\nTrump was challenged by Stephanopoulos, who began by replaying footage of the candidate’s 21 November 2015 remarks in Birmingham, Alabama. In that footage, Trump stated:\nHey, I watched when the World Trade Center came tumbling down. And I watched in Jersey City, New Jersey, where thousands and thousands of people were cheering as that building was coming down. Thousands of people were cheering.\nAfter they viewed the clip Stephanopoulos told Trump “police [in New Jersey said] that didn’t happen” and that “those rumors have been on the Internet for some time,” before asking whether Trump misspoke. Following a brief exchange, Trump responded:\nThere were people that were cheering on the other side of New Jersey, where you have large Arab populations. They were cheering as the World Trade Center came down. I know it might be not politically correct for you to talk about it, but there were people cheering as that building came down — as those buildings came down. And that tells you something. It was well covered at the time, George. Now, I know they don’t like to talk about it, but it was well covered at the time. There were people over in New Jersey that were watching it, a heavy Arab population, that were cheering as the buildings came down. Not good.\nAs Stephanopoulos suggested, the claims were in fact rooted in early rumors about the September 11th attacks (which were later proved false). Multiple iterations of those “Muslims celebrating” tales circulated in the weeks and months after 9/11, rumors a 21 November 2015 New York Times article reported were never substantiated:\nIt was not clear what Mr. Trump was referring to. There were cheers of support in some Middle Eastern countries that day, which were broadcast on television. But a persistent Internet rumor of Muslims celebrating in Paterson, N.J., was discounted by police officials at the time. A search of news accounts from that period shows no reports of mass cheering in Jersey City.\nA 26 July 2007 Reuters article appeared several years after the attacks, but incidentally provided a possible explanation for how Trump came to so firmly believe he saw non-existent footage:\nTHE CELEBRATION THAT WASN’T\nPaterson was shaken by the September 11 attacks. On that day, a report circulated on some radio stations and Internet sites that Muslims in Paterson had demonstrated in celebration.\nPaterson officials promptly issued a statement denying the report, and Muslim leaders insist it was pure fabrication.\nTrump’s assertion could handily be corroborated via a large volume of easily accessed archival footage from September 2001. NPR attempted to locate any material matching that description, but found nothing:\nWe asked our library to look through contemporaneous news reports. They tells us that that they could not turn up any news accounts of American Muslims cheering or celebrating in the wake of Sept. 11.\nA 22 November 2015 Atlanta Journal-Constitution blog post (titled “What Donald Trump might have seen on 9/11. Hint: Not ‘cheering’ Arabs”) provided additional background as to related incidents which may have sparked the “cheering Muslims” rumor:\nHere’s the thing. As the towers came down, some people indeed saw a group of five — not thousands, but five — Middle Eastern men clowning around and photographing themselves in front of the burning towers from the New Jersey waterfront. They weren’t Arabs, and they weren’t Muslims.\nThey were Israeli and Jewish – young men making asses of themselves, as some young men are wont to do. Perhaps not recognizing the import of what they were seeing.\nHow do I know this? I tracked one of their friends down to Jesus’ hometown, two months after the attack[.]\nWhile many presumed Trump was outright lying or fabricated the claim (and others believed his version of events), a third compelling possibility remained. Trump (like many New Yorkers and Americans) was clearly exposed to erroneous, misattributed, or otherwise faulty information in the chaotic period after September 11th. Both internet and radio reports made mention of the rumor; suggesting possibly conflation, or a false memory:\nIn two separate experiments, they had more than 170 undergraduates view, imagine or listen to the sound of common, easily recognized events, such as a baby crying, a toilet flushing, a hammer hammering or a basketball bouncing. And they found that participants were much more likely to incorrectly say they saw, for example, a hammer if they previously imagined a hammer, or heard a tape of hammering, than if they had no previous exposure to anything “hammer-like.” And they were even more likely to falsely remember the hammer if they visually imagined it and, at a different time, heard hammering.\nThe findings suggest that repeated exposure to certain objects and events through sight, sound or just imagination can muddle people’s memories of where or how they experienced something or even whether their experience is real, conclude [researchers].\nTrump wouldn’t be the first politician to experience a fractured recollection of the events of that day. In a February 2015 article CNN referenced a 2004 paper titled “President Bush’s False ‘Flashbulb’ Memory of 9/11/01,” [PDF] reporting:\nEven President Bush suffered a false memory of what he saw on television the day of the September 11, 2001, attacks.\nBush recalled more than once how he saw the first plane hit the north of the World Trade Center before he entered a classroom in Florida, where his reaction to the devastating attacks was forever captured on television cameras.\n“In reality, he had been told that a plane had hit the building, but had not seen it — there was no live footage of the plane hitting the tower,” the two professors wrote.\nAs it turns out, muddled memories about the events of (and days after) 9/11 appeared to be exceptionally common among all Americans, not just the people stumping for a nomination. A 6 September 2011 Skeptic article (titled “How Accurate Are Memories of 9/11? Recollections of the circumstances of how we first heard of the 2001 terrorist attacks may feel extraordinarily vivid and true, but they are flawed”) examined long-term research into “flashbulb memories” of the event.\nWhat researchers learned was that while confidence in the accuracy of such recollections was high among respondents, the data didn’t reflect that certainty:\nOur measure of accuracy is consistency with what people told us in the survey the week after the attack. From that first survey to the second survey a year later, the overall consistency of the details of how they learned of 9/11 was only 63 percent. At the third survey, three years after the attack, consistency was 57 percent. So people were only a little more than 50 percent right for a lot of the details.\nBut they were particularly bad at remembering what their emotions were after 9/11—accurate only about 40 percent of the time, after a year. And yet overall, for all those details, people’s confidence in their memories was, on average, greater than 4 on a scale of 1 to 5.\nNew York University psychologist Elizabeth A. Phelps led the study, and surmised that “enhanced confidence” was a possible function of the relative weight of chaotic, dangerous events:\nI think—and it’s just a theory—that part of why we have this super-enhanced feeling of remembering and sense of vividness for these highly emotional events is that knowing that they occurred matters a lot. Knowing the details about how they occurred, who told you about it, doesn’t necessarily matter.\nBut the enhanced confidence that we have in the memory lets us rely on it and act quickly. You want to be confident of that previous memory, the main point of which was that there was this terrorist attack that could threaten my life and now I have to be wary of things that might be similar. Because you don’t want to have to go, “Gee, does this remind me of anything…?” before you act on those types of threats in the future.\nMoreover, extant research generally attributed such conflations not to malice or deceit, but the alarming tendency of the human brain to stitch fractured recollections into a useful, cohesive narrative:\nThere is no evidence that the mistaken accounts of either person were malicious or intentionally false. Studies of memories of traumatic events consistently show how common it is for errors to creep into confidently recalled accounts, according to cognitive psychologists.\n“It’s pretty normal,” said Deryn Strange, an associate psychology professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. “That’s the hard thing to get our heads around. It’s frightening how easy it is to build in a false memory … They are more likely to do that when they are upset about the event — if they are getting intrusive thoughts about it, or talking to other people about it,” she said.\nIn short, it’s certainly possible Trump fabricated the story. However, the candidate’s spotty recollection of 9/11 was not unlike that of many of his fellow Americans, including President George W. Bush. Finally, Donald Trump himself has been the unwitting star of similar (albeit less emotionally fraught) widespread false memories:\nEven with a straight news story like this, a bit of manufactured memory has changed many people’s recall of the event. There are those who now swear they saw Donald Trump hand over an oversized, Ed McMahon-type check on TV. Likely this “Publisher’s Clearing House” mental image fits in better with our notion of how a celebrity would reward an ordinary fellow, hence the substituted memory.\nOn 23 November 2015, Trump tweeted:\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 23, 2015\nHowever, it should be noted that the excerpt to which Trump pointed (originally published by the Washington Post on 18 September 2001) described individuals who “allegedly” celebrated the attacks on rooftops in Jersey City (indicating that the celebrations were rumored, not confirmed). Trump claimed to have seen “thousands and thousands” of individuals in New Jersey on television, footage that has long been cited in rumors but doesn’t appear to exist and doesn’t jibe with the material he cited. Finally, it’s unlikely thousands of any group of people could physically congregate on a rooftop.","Scenes of destruction at Hickham Field in Pearl Harbor after bombing by Japanese.

{"question":"Which battle had more British casualties: Brown's Marsh or Lexington/Concord?","answer":"The Battle of Lexington/Concord had significantly more British casualties with 73 killed, 174 wounded, and 26 missing, compared to Brown's Marsh where the British only suffered two killed and five wounded.","context":["Brown's Marsh, Battle of\nThe Battle of Brown's Marsh was the last in a long line of military encounters in North Carolina at the end of the Revolutionary War, following Loyalist colonel David Fanning's capture of Whig governor Thomas Burke at Hillsborough on 12 Sept. 1781. The precise site of the battle, as well as its exact date, is currently unknown, but it likely took place sometime between 28 Sept. and 2 Oct. 1781 near present-day Clarkton in Bladen County. While attempting to convey their valuable prisoners to the British garrison at Wilmington, Fanning's command was ambushed by Gen. John Butler's Whig army at Lindley's Mill in what is now Alamance County on 13 Sept. 1781. The Loyalists managed to extricate themselves, but Fanning was severely wounded and his command devolved to Col. Archibald McDugald.\nMcDugald led his army and prisoners through the Sandhills en route to Wilmington, stopping at the Loyalist stronghold of McPhaul's Mill to regroup and turn over the captives to a swifter party commanded by Col. Duncan Ray (although some of the Loyalists escorting the prisoners from Hillsborough continued on the journey). Hearing news of the successful raid, Maj. James Craig, leader of the British force in Wilmington, went up River Road to meet the Loyalists. Governor Burke and his fellow prisoners were delivered to Craig at Livingston Creek by 23 Sept. 1781.\nMeanwhile, Butler had gathered what militia he could and set off to overtake the Loyalists and liberate the governor. When word of Butler's plans reached the British at Wilmington, Craig dispatched a Major Manson and 180 British regulars from the Wilmington garrison to accompany the Loyalists as far as Brown's Marsh. Scouts soon brought news of Butler's exact location back to Manson, who planned to attack the Whigs before they found out that the Loyalists had been reinforced.\nThe British rode all night through swamps and forests that required expert guides to negotiate. When close to Butler's camp, Manson divided his force into three wings: the British regulars, the Highlanders, and a contingent of Fanning's command under Capt. Steven Holloway. Each wing was accompanied by an experienced guide who was believed to be able to bring the respective units into position for the attack but who ultimately proved unprepared for the task.\nAs the British were groping about in Brown's Marsh, the Whigs had been alerted to their presence and hastily prepared defensive positions. Heedless of this setback, Manson ordered an attack in the predawn darkness. From the outset, consternation reigned in the Whig camp. As he had at Lindley's Mill, Butler ordered a retreat soon after the fighting began, but once again Col. Robert Mebane stepped forward to stop the Whigs' flight-though on this occasion, even with the help of Col. Thomas Owen, his efforts were only temporary.\nIn less than an hour, the Battle of Brown's Marsh was over. The British had routed the Whigs and were now in possession of their camp, while the Whigs were fleeing north to safety with Butler at their head. The victory cost the British two killed and five wounded-both deaths coming from Fanning's men, including their leader, Captain Holloway. The Battle of Brown's Marsh capped a successful campaign in what was to be the high point of the Loyalists' efforts during the Revolutionary War.\nLindley S.

Moran\nEditor's Note: This article was reprinted from the February 1997 Edition of the The Liberty Tree and Valley Compatriot Newsletter\nIt can be argued that April 19th, 1775 is the most important date in American history. The Battle of Lexington, Concord and Battle Road was the opening engagement of the American Revolution. And, it is not surprising that after two hundred and twenty-two years, some of the details are still the subject of some debate.\nSince our readership is very familiar with the battle, we will only present an overview of the battle as background to our biography.\nOn April 14th, Lieutenant General Thomas Gage (1) received orders from London to do something decisive to end the unrest in Massachusetts. He had already taken some steps, but had advised London that his force of 3,500 Regulars needed reinforcements, and requested an additional 6,000 men.\nNevertheless, on April 19th, abiding by his orders, he launched an expedition to seize the military stores alleged to be stored in the town of Concord, some 18 miles inland.\nGeneral Gage choose Colonel Francis Smith (2), who had served in North America for 12 years and was overweight and slow thinking, to lead the expedition. Smith's selection has baffled historians, but, perhaps it was the very fact that he was \"slow\" that prompted General Gage to appoint him. Gage certainly did not want an aggressive Officer to lead the delicate expedition, Gage wanted to avoid any possible confrontations.\nSmith was given command of an elite corps of about 700 men, consisting of the flank companies (3) of the 5th, 10th, 18th, 23rd, 38th, 43rd, 52nd and 59th Regiments. Major John Pitcairn (4) of the Royal Marines was selected as second in command.\nAt about 5 a.m. Major Pitcairn's advanced guard came into contact with Captain John Parker's (5) Lexington Minutemen and the battle started. Sweeping the Lexington Minutemen aside, leaving eight dead and ten wounded, Smith advanced on Concord.\nAs the morning wore on it became painfully obvious to Smith that he was in trouble. Massachusetts minutemen and militia units were arriving in great numbers and already out numbered him. Before he could assemble his units, which were searching nearby farms for the military stores he was sent to destroy, fighting broke out at the North Bridge. The battle was on! Smith led his small army down a narrow road toward the safety of Boston, fighting every inch of the way.\nAt the North Bridge an incident occurred that was to have a profound effect on the day's events. A soldier from the 43rd Regiment was wounded and lay slumped against the bridge's railing. When the Patriots forced their way across the bridge, the soldier was dispatched with a hatchet. Later, Captain Lawrence Parsons, retreating with his his four companies of Light Infantry recrossed the North Bridge, saw their dead fellow soldier, and from the severity of the wound, assumed he had been scalped and his ears cut off. The rumor spread through the entire British expedition that the colonists were not taking prisoners and were scalping and mutilating the wounded!\nThe running battle was almost won by the Massachusetts militia. Smith's men had formed up for the expedition at 8 p.m. the previous night, marched the18 miles from Boston, another six miles back to the outskirts of Lexington, and had been fighting for several hours. They were completely exhausted. Further, they had only been issued thirty rounds of ammunition (the normal quantity) and many were already out of ammunition. Some historians have suggested that only the severe discipline of the Regulars saved the expedition, but accounts by the private soldiers suggests that the generally accepted idea that the colonists were giving no quarter encouraged them to this superhuman effort.\nAt Lexington, Smith's battered force was rescued by General Hugh Percy (6) who had led the First Brigade out of Boston. The Brigade consisted of the line companies of the 4th, 23rd and 47th Regiments and 460 Royal Marines, for a total force of some 1,400 men. After an hour's rest for Smith's exhausted men, Percy ordered the retreat to Boston. Percy was continually attacked all the way back.\nWhen the British Force finally battled its way to safety, they had lost 73 killed, 174 wounded, 19 of them officers, and 26 missing. The American losses were 49 killed, 39 to 41 wounded and 5 missing. The American casualty figure is disproportionate to the normal ratio of killed versus wounded, 1 to 3. Because of the incident at the North Bridge, the British Soldiers were not taking prisoners, and were putting the American wounded to the bayonet!\nMost people believe that the Americans picked up their muskets, left their farms and fought the battle as individuals. This is incorrect, for the most part they fought in company strength units (30 to 50 men), commanded by their elected captains. Their advantage was that they were far better organized then the British believed. But there were individuals and the story of Captain Samuel Whittemore is an excellent example. He demonstrated the willingness and the ability to fight, contrary to the popular belief of most British Officers, who felt the colonists were \"cowardly and would never fight the Crown\", until April 19th, 1775, that is.\nCAPTAIN SAMUEL WHITTEMORE\nSamuel Whittemore was born in England on July 27th, 1695, and came to North America as a Captain in His Majesty's Dragoons, fighting the French in 1745. He was involved in the capture of the French stronghold, Fort Louisburg, and there captured a decorative french officer's sword, which he cherished for the rest of his life. About its capture, all Sam would say is that its previous owner had \"died suddenly\".\nAfter the war he stayed in the colonies, purchasing a farm in Menotomy (now Arlington, Massachusetts). He married Elizabeth Spring, and after her death remarried to Mrs. Esther Prentice. By his two wives he had three sons and five daughters. His house, on Massachusetts Avenue, in Arlington, still exists. (7)\nIn 1758, war again broke out between England and France. And again, Fort Louisburg had to be taken. At 64 years of age, Sam volunteered and joined a Colonial Regiment which reduced the fort to rubble. He then went on and joined General James Wolf in the successful assault on Quebec.\nThe 1763 Indian Wars in the west next attracted Sam's attention. Leaving his wife, children and grandchildren to attend the farm, he rode off to join the colonial force launched against the Ottawa chief, Pontiac. He returned home some months later with a brace of dueling pistols as a souvenir, and here again, all Sam would say is that the previous owner \"died suddenly.\"\nIt is recorded that Sam believed in American independence stating that he wanted his descendants to be able to enact their own laws and not be subject to a distant king. So, it is not surprising when he again took up arms on April 19th, 1775.\nThat night he watched as Colonel Smith led his column of 700 soldiers through Menotomy. He was probably concerned, but the British had come out of Boston before and there had not been any serious trouble. Later that morning he heard rumors that there had been fighting at Lexington and Concord. But, when General Percy marched through the town with an additional 1,400 soldiers, Sam's military experience told him there was serious trouble - - 'why else would the British be sending reinforcements?' , he probably asked himself.\nWord had come to Menotomy that the combined, heavily engaged, columns of Smith and Percy were retreating toward the town, and were burning homes along the way, so the aged warrior decided to take action in spite of his being eighty years old! He strapped on his captured french sword, stuck his brace of dueling pistols in his belt, put on his powder horn and shot bag, took his musket from its place on his fireplace mantle and went to war!\nSam selected a position that gave him a excellent view of the road from Lexington, and sat down to wait. His fellow minuteman from Menotomy pleaded for him to find a safer position, but he choose to ignore them.\nHis fellow minuteman started firing at the oncoming British Grenadiers of the 47th Regiment of Foot, falling back to reload, then firing again. Sam waited. Finally, when the column was directly in front of him, he stood and fired his musket. A grenadier fell dead. He drew his two pistols, firing both at almost point blank range. Another grenadier fell dead, a third fell mortally wounded. The British soldiers were on top of him, he had not the time to reload his musket or pistols, so drawing his sword, he . started flailing away at the bayonet wielding soldiers. A soldier leveled his Brown Bess musket, at point blank range and fired. The .69 calibre ball struck Sam in the cheek, tearing away part of his face and throwing him to the ground. Sam valiantly tried to rise, fending off bayonet thrusts with his sword, but he was overpowered. Struck in the head with a musket butt, he went down again, then was bayoneted thirteen times and left for dead.\nThe British continued their fight through the streets of Menotomy, which turned out to be the costliest action of the day. They left forty of their soldiers dead in the town and another eighty wounded, half the casualties of the day.\nAfter the British column had fought its way clear, the town's people and minuteman started to search for their wounded compatriots. Several had seen Sam Whittemore's \"last stand\" and approached to remove his body. To everyone's astonishment Sam was not only still alive, but conscious and still full of fight. Laying there, he was trying to load his musket!\nUsing a door as a makeshift stretcher, Sam was carried to Cooper Tavern, which was being used as a emergency hospital. Doctor Nathaniel Tufts of Medford attended to Sam. He cut off his bloody clothes, and exposed the gaping bayonet wounds. Sam's face was horribly injured. Doctor Tufts knew the injuries were fatal, stating it wouldn't do any good to even dress the wounds. Sam's family and friends insisted and Dr. Tufts did the best he could. He tried to make the old man as comfortable as possible. After his wounds were attended to Sam was carried to his home, to die surrounded by his family. To everyone's utter amazement Captain Sam Whittemore lived! He recovered and remained active for the next eighteen years. He was terribly scarred, but always was proud of what he had done for his adopted country. He is quoted as having stated that he would take the same chances again.\nYou can question the old soldier's tactical judgment, making the stand in the manner he did, but you can never question his bravery. He also proved you are never too old! Sam died on February 3rd, 1793, age 98 and is buried in the town's cemetery.\nGeneral Hugh Percy shared the opinion that the colonists would never fight, or if they did, they would be ineffective. After his fighting retreat, he wrote to General Harvey, in England: \"... during the whole affair the Rebels attacked is in a very scattered, irregular manner, but with perseverance and resolution, nor did they ever dare to form into any regular body. Indeed, they knew too well what was proper, to do so.\nWhoever looks upon them as an irregular mob, will find himself much mistaken. They have men amongst them who know very well what they are about, having been employed as Rangers against the Indians and Canadians and this country being much covered with wood, and hilly, is very advantageous for their method of fighting. . . . \".\nNOTES AND COMMENTS:\n1. Lieutenant General Thomas Gage, (1719?-1787) Commander-in-Chief of all British forces in North America. He was relieved of his command by General William Howe October 10th, 1775.\n2. Colonel Francis Smith (1723-1791), commanding officer of the 10th Regiment of Foot. In 1787 he was promoted to Lieutenant General and Aide-de-Camp to King George III.\n3. In the 18th Century a British Regiment was comprised of ten Companies, each between 35 and 50 men. One Company was light Infantry and one Company were Grenadiers (wearing the famed tall bearskin cap) and eight companies of the line. When the Regiment was formed up, the Light Infantry and Grenadiers were at either end of the formation, hence the term \"flank companies\".\n4. Major John Pitcairn (1722-1775) of the Royal Marines He led the final charge at Bunker's Hill, with the cry \"Now, for the glory of the Marines\" and was struck by what was probably the last volley from the American redoubt. He died in his son's arms (a Marine Lieutenant). He was survived by his eleven children.\n5. Captain John Parker (1729-1775) commanding the Lexington Minutemen had served in the French and Indian Wars and was probably one of Roger's Rangers. He died of Tuberculosis on September 17th, 1775.\n6. General Hugh Percy (1742-1817) was known as Earl Percy.

{"question":"How do DNA communication patterns differ between nucleus-to-cell and mitochondria-to-nucleus pathways, and what role do these pathways play in protein regulation?","answer":"DNA communication occurs bidirectionally. In the nucleus-to-cell pathway, DNA in the nucleus uses RNA as an intermediary to transport genetic information to the cytoplasm for protein assembly. The RNA copies the code from DNA and serves as a template for codons to produce amino acids that form proteins. In contrast, the mitochondria-to-nucleus pathway involves mitochondrial DNA encoding a protein called MOTS-c that can enter the nucleus and regulate nuclear gene expression. During metabolic stress, MOTS-c translocates to the nucleus, binds to chromatin, and promotes stress resistance by regulating genes with antioxidant response elements.","context":["Cardiomyopathies: genetic counseling and analysis\nAbout the history: the structure of DNA was discovered in 1953, thanks to the studies of Rosalind Franklin, who was the first to imagine its helical structure. The images obtained were then used by Watson and Crick to prove their theory (1958), for which they won the Nobel Prize in 1962.\nWhat is DNA, i.e. the genetic code? Every single cell of any living organism contains DNA, a very complex structure composed mainly of a double strand, coiled around itself to form a double helix. DNA contains the genetic code, formed by an alphabet of only 4 letters (ATGC), aligned in different sequences of 3 consecutive letters, i.e. triplets, called \"codons\", allow to produce 20 fundamental amino acids (e.g. Arginine, Lysine, Glycine, Alanine, etc). These amino acids, in turn, by binding together, produce all the proteins necessary for the functioning of our body.\nA \"gene” consists of a variable number of codons, which encode amino acids, which are used to produce different individual proteins such as, for example, \"Myosin\", \"Troponin T. or I\", \"Myosin-binding protein C\", essential proteins for contraction of heart cells, or \"Desmoplakin\" for cell-cell adhesion, or \"Titin\".\nIn XNUMX the genetic code of man was analyzed and over XNUMX genes have been identified.\nWhere is DNA? DNA is delicate and its integrity must be preserved. It is enclosed within the cell nucleus, where it replicates at each cell division in order to possibly keep the genetic information of that organism or individual intact. Unable to leave the nucleus, DNA needs an intermediary, called RNA, which copies the information encoded in the genes and transports it to the area of the cell around the nucleus called \"cytoplasm”, where proteins are assembled and main activities of the cell itself take place.\nMessenger RNA, a molecule similar to DNA, but with only one strand, copies the code from the corresponding DNA, and functions as a template for each specific codon. Each codon produces its own amino acid and the amino acid sequence forms a protein of precise length and spatial conformation to ensure the function it will have to perform.\nWhat happens if the code is altered, or is incorrectly transcribed?\nVarious errors can occur, called \"mutations\" or \"variants\", which produce a protein, for example, missing some parts, such as a book that is missing a few pages. A malfunctioning protein can be responsible for diseases, and therefore also Cardiomyopathies, which can be recognized at birth, more often in adulthood. If the \"mutations\" are transmitted to children, these diseases are defined \"hereditary”, as in most cases, for example, of Cardiomyopathies. However, mutations can also play a positive role. They contribute to the diversity of individuals, for example. in children or in a population, so as to ensure the variability of the species and the continuous adaptation to the changing environment.\nToday we know thousands of \"mutations\" in numerous genes that cause cardiomyopathies, although several genes still remain to be identified.\nThe search for \"mutations\" in genes known so far is important to well evaluate the patient who has cardiomyopathy and his family members.\nGenetic analysis (NGS - next generation sequencing)allows to identify one or more mutations(also called \" variants\") of the genetic code in one or more genes, responsible for the development of cardiomyopathy. For each type of cardiomyopathy, the most frequently encountered gene groups are analyzed.\nFor example, XNUMX genes are initially analyzed for patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: MYBPCXNUMX, MYHXNUMX, TNNTXNUMX, TNNIXNUMX, TPMXNUMX, ACTCXNUMX, MYLXNUMX, MYLXNUMX, GLA, LAMP XNUMX, PRKAGXNUMX, TTR. If genetic mutations in these genes are not identified, a more in-depth analysis may be requested by the cardiologist with extension of the analysis to further gene groups.\nIn some laboratories, a greater number of genes are immediately analyzed (e.g. 45 or 174) and in some cases it is also possible to examine the whole set of genes (Exome).\nGenetic analysis allows to :\n- precisely identify the type of disease underlying Cardiomyopathy\n- choose the most appropriate therapy\n- carry out a more accurate assessment of the risk of evolution and complications in subsequent years, obviously together with other clinical and instrumental elements (for example: ECG, Echocardiogram, cardiac magnetic resonance, cardiorespiratory test, dynamic ECG)\n- check if there is familial transmission of Cardiomyopathy, by looking for the mutation in family members as well\nWith current techniques the detection of a genetic variant is more frequent if one cardiomyopathy has already been diagnosed, through ECG and ECHO, also in other family members (the probability is about 60%, while it is lower if it has not been found in family members, about 30%).\nGenetic testing must be preceded by a genetic consultation, made by the geneticist or an experienced cardiologist, as well as the interpretation of the written report..\nTHE FUTURE : One of the objectives of scientific research is the correction of genetic mutations, to be used in treatment of cancers and hereditary genetic diseases, including cardiomyopathies. However, genetic modification involves numerous ethical dilemmas and is still under study.","The DNA communication that streams through the cell isn’t always a top-down affair, a matter of the nucleus issuing directives, in the form of DNA-coded templates, to other cellular components. Sometimes, the relatively lowly mitochondria issue directives—and the nucleus complies. According to a new study from the University of Southern California (USC), mitochondria use a bit of their DNA to encode a protein that can enter the nucleus and regulate the expression of nuclear DNA.\nThis mitochondria-to-DNA messaging activates an antioxidant response, helping the cell cope with metabolic stress. In addition, this kind of messaging is of interest for a more general reason. It shows that the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes co-evolved to independently cross-regulate each other. Mitonuclear communication, the USC scientists speculate, may be genetically integrated.\nUnderstanding how DNA communication is hardwired into the cell will lead more researchers to appreciate the coordination of genes encoded in both genomes, said Changhan David Lee, Ph.D., an assistant professor of gerontology at USC. Moreover, appreciating the contributions of both genomes will help illuminate their role in aging and disease.\nWorking with human cells, Lee and colleagues showed that metabolic stress triggers 5′-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK)–dependent translocation of a protein called MOTS-c. This protein, which is encoded in the mitochondrial genome, localizes to the nucleus, binds to chromatin, regulates nuclear gene expression, and promotes resistance to metabolic stress.\nDetails of this work appeared July 5 in the journal Cell Metabolism, in an article entitled “The Mitochondrial-Encoded Peptide MOTS-c Translocates to the Nucleus to Regulate Nuclear Gene Expression in Response to Metabolic Stress.”\n“In the nucleus,” the article’s authors indicated, “MOTS-c regulated a broad range of genes in response to glucose restriction, including those with antioxidant response elements (ARE), and interacted with ARE-regulating stress-responsive transcription factors, such as nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NFE2L2/NRF2).”\nKnowing intimately how cells operate could lead to greater understanding of age-related disease and, perhaps one day, new mitochondria-based treatments. Prescription drugs today are designed based on the blueprint encoded in the nuclear genome. “We haven't been looking at the full complexity of the cellular network,” Lee noted. He added that if we were to fight cancer, for example, with only one of our genomes, then we may have just a partial solution. We could, however, fight cancer and other diseases “with all our genetic components.”\n“Most diseases are due to aging, and aging leads to a breakdown in cell functions,” Lee continued. “When things go wrong in the body, it's because some mechanism in the body went wrong. So, understanding how cells age means we have more insight into how the damage occurs and how we can prevent or fix it.\n“Mitochondria have their own DNA that presumably comes from ancient bacteria that joined our cells a long time ago. We didn't know that our mitochondrial DNA encoded messages to control the nucleus. In fact, the nucleus has been long thought to hold all our genetic blueprint for building and operating a cell. This is a fundamental discovery that integrates our two genomes as a co-evolved genetic system and may have a lasting impact for a broad range of scientific and medical fields.”"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:2cf59bfd-162d-41e7-8345-66cd27f88087>","<urn:uuid:5ed0a092-e605-45b7-ae47-a8145db4ae3e>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What is the average resolution of Dawn spacecraft's images of Vesta's surface during HAMO phase?","answer":"During the high-altitude mapping orbit (HAMO) phase, the images had an average resolution of about 70 meters (230 feet) per pixel.","context":["This colored animation of Vesta is made from a mosaic of Dawn Framing Camera (FC) color composite images wrapped around the shape model of Vesta. The shape model is a 3-D representation of the topography of Vesta, which is calculated from images observed from different viewing angles. The FC has 7 color filters that allow it to image Vesta in a number of different wavelengths of light. In this case we are interested in filter 2, which images Vesta at 440 nm, filter 5, which images Vesta at 750 nm and filter 7, which images Vesta at 920 nm. Nm stands for nanometers and is a measure of the wavelength of light. Being able to image in many wavelengths enhances features and colors that would otherwise be indistinguishable to the human eye. The mosaic shows a RGB color composite view of Vesta. In an RGB image the colors red, green and blue each display a specific characteristic and are stacked together to form one image. In this case red represents the ratio of the brightness at a wavelength of 750 nm to the brightness at 440 nm; green is used for the ratio of the brightness at 750 nm to 920 nm and blue is used for the ratio of the brightness at 440 nm to 750 nm. These ratios have all been picked for specific scientific purposes. The green shows the relative strength of a particular mineralogical characteristic, the ferrous absorption band, at 1000 nm so that a brighter green color signifies a higher relative strength of this band. The blending between the red and blue heightens the color range of visible light. The animation begins overlooking Vesta’s north pole. This region is gray in color because it has not yet been imaged by Dawn. It is clear from the wide range of colors that Vesta is a very diverse asteroid. A number of areas of ejecta show a strong red-orange color and the Rheasilvia impact basin, in the southern hemisphere, has a strong greenish color. The Rheasilvia impact basin is a region of strong ferrous absorption band material because green shows the relative strength of the ferrous absorption band.\nNASA’s Dawn spacecraft obtained these images with its framing camera in September and October 2011. The images were taken through the camera’s clear filter. The distance to the surface of Vesta is around 700 kilometers (435 miles) on average and the images have an average resolution of about 70 meters (230 feet) per pixel. These images were acquired during the HAMO (high-altitude mapping orbit) phase of the mission. The shape model was made by Robert Gaskell (PSI) and the animation was made by Dave O’Brien (PSI).\nThe Dawn mission to Vesta and Ceres is managed by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, for NASA’s Science Mission Directorate, Washington D.C.

{"question":"What are the differences between Douglas fir's growth patterns and color characteristics compared to exotic woods like Purpleheart?","answer":"Douglas fir and Purpleheart have distinctly different growth patterns and color characteristics. Douglas fir primarily grows in the Northwest United States, displaying a creamy reddish light brown color and a straight trunk that can grow up to four feet in diameter. In contrast, Purpleheart grows in South America and undergoes a unique color transformation - it starts as a lightish brown but turns into a deep dark purple when exposed to UV light, with over 20 varieties each providing their own unique purple shade. Douglas fir shows natural variations in grain and color that add to its aesthetic appeal, while Purpleheart is specifically sought after for its dramatic purple coloration.","context":["We use a variety of different wood species at SoKno Woodworking. Some of them are domestic woods that grow here in the United States. A few of our products are made from trees that grew in Tennessee. Other types are exotic woods that grow in different countries around the world.\nMost trees have three layers: bark, sapwood, and heartwood. Bark is the outermost layer and protect the trees from the elements. This layer is typically cut away in the milling process and occasionally left on for a \"live edge\" look. The sapwood is the adjacent layer and is used by the tree to carry water and nutrients throughout the tree. It is typically lighter in color. The heartwood is the centermost layer and is usually the desired wood for use. This layer ranges in color depending on species.\nBlack Walnut- This is my personal favorite wood to work. I love the deep dark color of the heartwood. Walnut trees provide edible nuts in the fall. Their wood is highly desired due to its color, strength, and grain patterns. The tight grains are close together and prevent bacteria from seeping down into the pores. This makes it an excellent choice for cutting boards.\nPecan- This wood also produces an edible nut in the fall. Its wood is creamy colored and extremely hard. Pecan wood is similar to Hickory, which is considered one of the most hard and resilient woods available domestically. This wood also has tight grains and is excellent for cutting board use.\nCherry- This type of tree is the wild cherry and not the domesticated type. Its heartwood is reddish in color and has beautiful grain patterns. It is a hardwood with tight grains, which make it great for cutting boards.\nHard Sugar Maple- This tree is the same tree that produces maple syrup. It has a very light colored heartwood that is almost white. It has very consistent grain patterns. It is the gold standard for cutting board woods.\nEastern Red Cedar- This wood is an aromatic softwood. It is naturally weather and insect resistant. The color consists of a reddish heartwood and whitish colored sapwood.\nDouglas Fir- This tree grows all over the US but is primarily grown for commercial use in the NorthWest. It is naturally weather and insect resistant. The color is a creamy reddish light brown. It is a soft wood used for construction. It is a favorite to wood boring bees because they can easily bore through its softwood. This is why we use it to create our bee traps.\nBocote- This wood is considered to be the most expensive wood per board foot of commonly available exotic wood. It has a beautiful wood grain pattern of black and golden brown. These trees grow in Central America and the West Indies.\nSpalted Tamarind- This wood is a beautiful white color. The spalting describes the dark streaks that run throughout the grains. The streaks are formed by microbes that enter the wood, leaving behind their marks. These trees are native to Africa.\nLeopardwood- This wood is very unique. It naturally has patterns in it that resemble leopard print. It is a pinkish color. These trees grow in Central America.\nPurpleheart- This wood has one of the brightest and most beautiful colors in nature. It grows a lightish brown color. However, once cut and exposed to UV light, it turns into a deep dark purple color. There are over 20 different varieties of purpleheart trees that each provide their own unique color. These trees grow in South America.\nYellowheart- This wood is a pleasant yellowish gold color. These trees are cousins to the purpleheart variety and also grow in South America.\nPadauk- This wood is a very unique species due to its deep dark red color. It tends to fade in sunlight and requires a UV protective finish. These trees grow in Africa.\nZebrawood- This wood is very unique due to its wood grain pattern. The pattern is a sequence of black and creamy brown, which resembles zebra print. These trees grow in Africa.\nMarblewood- This wood produces a grain pattern similar to marble. It has a pleasant light yellow and orangish pattern. These trees grow in South America.","The desire for local fresh food has given a boost to the practice of home gardens, and raised beds are a popular option--especially in areas with naturally occurring rocky soil or in small spaces. There are different materials kinds of wood and other materials, such as cinder blocks & metal tanks that you can choose from when building these raised garden beds. Is Douglas fir also an option?\nYes, you can use Douglas fir for building raised beds in your garden. Given its resistance to rot, Douglas fir is a durable wood, and can last as long as 10 to 15 years before needing replacement. Douglas fir is also one of the cheapest of the types of wood for building raised garden boxes.\nThere are some clear advantages to using Douglas fir for raised beds. First is its affordability, but there are other reasons as well. This article explores some of the traits that you should consider before using Douglas fir for the raised beds in your garden.\nDouglas fir is abundant & sustainable\nIt has become increasingly common for people to choose locally sourced and sustainable materials for their homes and gardens. Douglas fir forests can be found throughout the western coast of the United States. They are resilient as they can regrow after major events like timber harvests and wildfires. Using Douglas fir is not only environmentally friendly but is easy on the wallet too.\nDouglas fir is durable\nFor raised garden beds, Douglas fir wood is a very durable material. They last from 10 to 15 years as a raised bed. The moderate lifespan of the Douglas fir allows the gardener to change things up a bit every few years, or even moving houses without being guilty of wasting lumber.\nDouglas fir is an affordable option\nDouglas fir boards cost almost a third less than the other options available in cedar and redwood. There are several grades of Douglas fir available. The most cost-effective one is a mill-run grade that helps create tight knots in the wood. Tight knots ensure that the wood does not break open and create holes.\nAlthough you may need to replace boards made of Douglas fir sooner than the other ones, replacing Douglas fir boards will still be less expensive than any other lumber that is as durable as the Douglas fir.\nThese Construction Douglas Fir Board Stud Wood Lumber can be used to make raised garden beds in your home. They are not only affordable, but they also add beauty and structural integrity to your garden.\nNaturally Rot Resistant\nDouglas fir are naturally resistant to garden rot as the resins in this species help the trees to defend themselves against decay and pest infestations. The lumber sawn from this species will retain these desirable qualities making the Douglas fir rank higher in terms of return on investment.\nDouglas fir fares better vs. other woods & materials\nThere are many options for building raised garden beds available in the market today. While a cinder block is cheap and durable, it is heavy to lift and can hold heat. Retaining heat is probably a good thing in a winter garden, but for a summer garden, it does more harm than good to your plants.\nGarden beds made of rocks are heavy to lift and work with. They will also require frequent maintenance, so that weed and grass do not make their way in. Among the other options, steel, concrete, and galvanized metal tanks can be very expensive. Galvanized metal containers and steel containers also tend to rust over time and are not ideal for growing edible vegetables.\nPressure-treated wood may seem like a great choice too as it is readily available and can survive for years in the ground or in situations where it is constantly wet. However, pressure-treated wood contains heavy metal chemicals that are used to treat the wood to make it rot resistant and resistant to bugs and decay. These toxins will leach into the soil and be harmful to the plantings that you are growing in that soil.\nIn wood, there are some options such as cedar and redwood that last for more than ten years. Even though the Douglas fir does not last as long as ten years, it is a third less expensive than the other options available in wood. In Europe, Douglas fir is considered to be tougher and more drought resistant than its other alternatives.\nDouglas fir raised beds look great\nDouglas fir are tall, beautiful conifers that grow along the Pacific Northwest coast. The tree looks like a tall and slender triangle. It adds elegance and beauty to the landscape in which it grows. Young Douglas fir are often used as Christmas trees.\nThe straight trunk of a fully grown Douglas fir can be as much as four feet in diameter and sometimes even twice that wide. The lumber produced from these trees looks sturdy and beautiful as well.\nDouglas fir is a product of nature; therefore, variations in grain and color do exist. This becomes apparent in the lumber that is cut out from these trees. The variation in color and grain also adds to the aesthetic beauty of the wood. In a garden, raised beds made of this wood will only add to the garden’s beauty.\nHow long do Douglas fir raised beds last?\nGenerally, Douglas fir raised beds can last 10 to 15 years. However, the longevity depends on your climate, and other factors--chiefly, how wet the wood gets and for how long.\nFor example, in New Mexico where I live, we’re technically in a desert--which means we get roughly 10 inches of rain or less per year. Compare that to, say, the Pacific Northwest, where some places can get 100 - 200 inches of rain per year. So, chances are that Douglas fir raised beds are going to last several years longer in the dry Southwest than the Pacific Northwest.\nHow to make Douglas fir raised beds last longer\nWood burning or Yakisugi--an ancient Japanese form of wood preservation--can help make wood of any species last longer. Charring the wood without combusting the whole piece leads to carbonization. Carbonization further renders the wood water resistant, thereby making it more durable. Wood burning also makes the wood weather-resistant, bug resistant, and in some cases, even fire-resistant.\nAre Douglas fir raised beds safe for vegetables?\nThe wood that you will use for building the raised bed in your garden is likely to be constantly wet and will be in direct contact with the soil on which your plants will grow. You need to build your raised beds using a material that does not quickly decay due to the constant moisture and which is also safe for your produce.\nKeeping this in mind, Douglas fir are suited to build raised beds in your garden as they do not decompose even after prolonged exposure to wet surfaces, nor does it discharge toxic materials into the soil.\nRaised beds can warp and split over time\nRaised beds constructed from wood can warp and split over time. This is true for any wood--even a rot-resistant species like Douglas fir.\nAs a softwood species, Douglas fir boards tend to warp and split in outdoor exposure and must be secured properly to prevent a raised garden bed from falling apart. This happens because the fir wood experiences shrinkage over time. This shrinkage in the wood dimensions results in warping and splitting of the wood.\nDouglas fir has proven to be one of the top choices for building raised beds in the garden. It is also beneficial to use untreated wood. While the lumber industry has modified its processes in the past decade and no longer uses toxic chemicals to treat wood, untreated wood is still best. Douglas fir is durable, cost-effective, and safe for your produce."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"advanced_reasoning"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:de6f7f2b-0cd2-4f80-9685-aa4982c9dadb>","<urn:uuid:eabe3c99-2756-4713-b31e-6ab83850fb61>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I'm researching industrial processes - how do the processing requirements differ between cold heading operations and plastic injection molding in terms of material flow and forming methods?","answer":"Cold heading and plastic injection molding have fundamentally different processing requirements. Cold heading is a cold forging process where metal blanks (like wire or bar) are shaped through upsetting dies under impact forces, suitable for materials like low-carbon steel wire (75-78HRB), copper alloys, and aluminum alloys. In contrast, plastic injection molding involves heating plastic in a barrel until molten, then injecting it through a nozzle into a mold cavity where it cools and hardens to form the final shape. The plastic must flow through a gating system including main channels, runners, and gates before filling the cavity, requiring careful consideration of flow patterns and cooling.","context":["What are the requirements for springs in the hardware mold industry?\n1.

Commonly used die materials include Cr12MoV, Cr12Mo1V1, W6Mo5Cr4V2 steel and base steel, etc., internal prestress The ring is usually made of 4Cr5MoVSi, 4Cr5MoV1Si steel (46~48HRC), and the outer prestressed ring is usually made of 4Cr5MoVSi, 5CrNiMo and other steels.\n2. Cold heading mold\nCold heading is a cold forging process, which relies on the upsetting die to process part of the blank metal into a specific cross-sectional shape under one or more impacts. The blank is mainly wire or bar. Cold heading is widely used in the production of fastening Parts, such as screws and rivets. Materials suitable for cold heading include low-carbon steel wire or bar (75~78HRB), copper and copper alloys, aluminum and aluminum alloys, stainless steel and medium-carbon steel wires with a carbon content of less than 0.44% ( Spheroidizing annealing). The cold heading mold is divided into a punch (or hammer) and a concave mold. The concave mold is divided into an integral concave mold and an open concave mold. The overall concave mold can be made of one material or two Two kinds of materials, the center cavity part is made of different materials to make the concave mold insert. The open concave mold is composed of two modules with grooves on the surface, and the two modules are combined to form a cavity. Slots on different surfaces of the module, and then Multiple new slots can be formed by turning the module.\nThe surface of the cold heading mold requires high hardness (≥60HRC), and the cold heading mold of hard materials should be hardened as a whole to prevent collapse; under the premise of ensuring no collapse, in order to make the mold have sufficient toughness and prevent cracking, cold heading The hardness of the core of the mold is preferably 40~50HRC.\nCommonly used cold heading die steels are T10A, 9SiCr, 9Cr2, Cr12MoV, etc., and the concave mold inserts can be made of Cr12MoV, W6Mo5Cr4V2, WC (containing 13%~25% Co), W18Cr4V steel, and punches with complex shapes and large impact can be used. Impact resistant steel 5CrW2Si, 60Si2Mn and base steel.\n3. Aluminum alloy cold extrusion die can be made of T7A, T10A, Cr12, Cr12MoV, GCr15, 9SiCr and CrWMn steel.\nMolds with excellent material, correct structural design, good cold and hot processing, and reasonable heat treatment may still fail early during service due to improper adjustment and use of the machine tool. Machine adjustment and operating factors include the accuracy, rigidity, clearance adjustment, and positioning of the machine tool Inaccurate and accidental overload, etc. Taking these factors seriously will help to find the real cause of mold failure. Large fluctuations in mold life in production are often related to machine tool adjustment and use operation factors, and sufficient attention must be paid.","The plastic is first heated in the heating barrel of the injection molding machine, and then under the push of the screw or piston of the injection molding machine, through the nozzle and the pouring system of the mold into the mold cavity, and finally in the cavity hardening finalize the design, this is the simple process of injection molding, and the mold used for injection molding is called injection molding mold.\nPlastic injection mold is a combined processing tool for compression molding, extrusion molding, injection molding, blow molding and low-foaming molding. The cavity-modifying die is a punch with a variable core, which is composed of a punch combination base plate, a punch component, a punch combination card board, a cavity cut-off component and a side section combination plate. Coordinated change of mold convex, concave mold and auxiliary forming system. Plastic injection molds can process a series of plastic parts of different shapes and sizes.\nA Plastic injection mold is a tool for producing plastic products. It consists of several groups of parts, and this combination has a molding cavity. During injection molding, the mold is clamped on the injection molding machine, the molten plastic is injected into the molding cavity, and cooled and shaped in the cavity, and then the upper and lower molds are separated, and the product is ejected from the cavity through the ejection system to leave the mold, and finally the mold is closed again. For the next injection, the entire injection process is cyclic.\nAccording to the different molding methods, the types of plastic processing molds corresponding to different process requirements can be divided, mainly including injection molding molds, extrusion molding molds, blister molding molds, and high-expanded polystyrene molding molds.\nIt is mainly a molding mold that is most commonly used in the production of thermoplastic parts. The processing equipment corresponding to the plastic injection mold is a plastic injection molding machine. The plastic is first heated and melted in the heating barrel at the bottom of the injection machine, and then the screw Or driven by the plunger, it enters the mold cavity through the injection machine nozzle and the pouring system of the mold, and the plastic is cooled and hardened to form, and demolded to obtain the product. Its structure usually consists of forming parts, pouring system, guiding parts, pushing mechanism, temperature regulation system, exhaust system, supporting parts and other parts. The manufacturing materials usually use Plastic injection mold steel modules, and the commonly used materials are mainly carbon structural steel, carbon tool steel, alloy tool steel, high-speed steel, etc. The injection molding process is usually only suitable for the production of thermoplastic products. The plastic products produced by the injection molding process are very wide, ranging from daily necessities to various complex machinery, electrical appliances, and transportation parts. It is the most widely used processing method in the production of plastic products.\nIncluding compression molding and injection molding two structural mold types. They are a type of mold mainly used to mold thermosetting plastics, and their corresponding equipment is a press molding machine. Compression molding method According to the characteristics of the plastic, the mold is heated to the molding temperature (usually 103°-108°), and then the measured compression molding powder is put into the mold cavity and the feeding chamber, the mold is closed, and the plastic is under high heat and high pressure. It is softened and viscous flow, and after a certain period of time, it will be solidified and shaped into the desired shape of the product. The difference between injection molding and compression molding is that there is a separate feeding chamber. Before molding, the mold is closed first. The plastic is preheated in the feeding chamber and is in a viscous flow state. Under the action of pressure, it is adjusted and squeezed into the mold cavity to harden and form. Compression molds are also used to form some special thermoplastics such as hard-to-melt thermoplastics (such as polyvinyl fluoride) blanks (cold pressing), resin lenses with high optical properties, slightly foamed nitrocellulose car steering wheels, etc. . The compression mold is mainly composed of cavity, feeding cavity, guiding mechanism, ejecting parts, heating system, etc. Injection molds are widely used in packaging electrical components. The materials used in the manufacture of compression molds are basically the same as injection molds.\nA type of mold used to produce continuous-shaped plastic products, also known as extrusion molding head, is widely used in the processing of pipes, bars, monofilaments, plates, films, wire and cable cladding, profiles, etc. The corresponding production equipment is a plastic extruder, the principle of which is that the solid plastic is melted and plasticized under the conditions of heating and the screw rotation of the extruder, and is made into the same cross-section as the shape of the die through a die of a specific shape. Continuous plastic products. Its manufacturing materials are mainly carbon structural steel, alloy tools, etc., and some extrusion dies are also inlaid with wear-resistant materials such as diamond on the parts that need to be wear-resistant. The extrusion process is usually only suitable for the production of thermoplastic products, which is significantly different from injection molds and compression molds in structure.\nIt is a mold used to form plastic container hollow products (such as beverage bottles, daily chemical products and other packaging containers). The form of blow molding mainly includes extrusion blow molding and injection blow molding according to the process principle. , Injection stretch blow molding (commonly known as \"injection stretch blow\"), multilayer blow molding, sheet blow molding, etc. The equipment corresponding to blow molding of hollow products is usually called plastic blow molding machine, and blow molding is only suitable for the production of thermoplastic products. The structure of the blow mold is relatively simple, and the materials used are mostly made of carbon.\nIt is a kind of mold that uses plastic plates and sheets as raw materials to form some relatively simple plastic products. In the case of heating and softening, it is deformed and attached to the cavity of the mold to obtain the desired molded product, which is mainly used in the production of some daily necessities, food, and toy packaging products. Due to the low pressure during molding, the mold material is mostly made of cast aluminum or non-metallic materials, and the structure is relatively simple.\nIt is a kind of mold that uses expandable polystyrene (bead material composed of polystyrene and foaming agent) raw materials to form foam packaging materials of various desired shapes. The principle is that expandable polystyrene can be steamed in the mold, including two types of simple manual operation molds and hydraulic straight-through foam Plastic injection molds, which are mainly used to produce packaging products for industrial products. The materials for making such molds are cast aluminum, stainless steel, bronze, etc.\n①Parting surface, that is, the contact surface where the die and the punch cooperate with each other when the die is closed. The selection of its position and form is affected by factors such as product shape and appearance, wall thickness, molding method, post-processing technology, mold type and structure, demolding method and molding machine structure.\n② Structural parts, that is, the sliders, inclined tops, straight top blocks, etc. of complex molds. The design of structural parts is very critical, which is related to the life of the mold, processing cycle, cost, product quality, etc. Therefore, designing the core structure of complex molds requires a higher comprehensive ability of the designer, and pursues simpler, more durable and more economical as far as possible. Design.\n③Mould accuracy, that is, avoiding jams, precise positioning, guide posts, positioning pins, etc. The positioning system is related to the appearance quality of the product, the quality and life of the mold. According to the different structure of the mold, different positioning methods are selected. The positioning accuracy control mainly depends on the processing. The internal mold positioning is mainly considered by the designer to design a more reasonable and easy-to-adjust positioning. Way.\n②Gating system, that is, the feeding channel from the injection molding machine nozzle to the cavity, including the main channel, the runner, the gate and the cold material cavity. In particular, the selection of the gate position should help the molten plastic to fill the cavity in a good flow state, and the solid runner and gate cold material attached to the product can be easily ejected from the mold and removed when the mold is opened (heat flow Except for Dao models).\n③ Plastic shrinkage and various factors that affect the dimensional accuracy of products, such as mold manufacturing and assembly errors, mold wear, etc. In addition, when designing compression molds and injection molds, the matching of process and structural parameters of the molding machine should also be considered. Computer-aided design technology has been widely used in Plastic injection mold design.\nThe working conditions of plastic injection molds are different from those of cold stamping molds. Generally, they must work at 150°C-200°C. In addition to a certain pressure, they must also be affected by temperature. According to the different use conditions and processing methods of Plastic injection molding molds, the basic performance requirements of steel for Plastic injection molds are roughly summarized as follows:\n1. Sufficient surface hardness and wear resistance\nThe hardness of the Plastic injection mold is usually below 50-60HRC, and the heat-treated mold should have sufficient surface hardness to ensure that the mold has sufficient rigidity. Due to the filling and flow of plastic, the mold is required to bear large compressive stress and friction during work, and the mold is required to maintain the stability of shape accuracy and dimensional accuracy to ensure that the mold has a sufficient service life. The wear resistance of the mold depends on the chemical composition of the steel and the hardness of heat treatment, so increasing the hardness of the mold is beneficial to improve its wear resistance.\n2. Excellent machinability\nMost Plastic injection molding molds require certain cutting processing and fitter repair in addition to EMD processing. In order to prolong the service life of cutting tools, improve cutting performance, and reduce surface roughness, the hardness of Plastic injection mold steel must be appropriate.\n3. Good polishing performance\nHigh-quality plastic products require a small roughness value on the surface of the cavity. For example, the surface roughness value of the injection mold cavity is required to be less than Ra0.1~0.25, and the optical surface is required to be Ra<0.01nm. The cavity must be polished to reduce the surface roughness value. The steel selected for this purpose requires less material impurities, fine and uniform structure, no fiber orientation, and no pitting or orange peel defects during polishing.\n4. Good thermal stability\nThe shape of the parts of the plastic injection mold is often complicated, and it is difficult to process after quenching. Therefore, it should be selected as far as possible with good thermal stability. When the mold is formed and processed after heat treatment, the linear expansion coefficient is small, the heat treatment deformation is small, and the dimensional change caused by the temperature difference. The rate is small, the metallographic structure and mold size are stable, and the processing can be reduced or no longer required to ensure the mold size accuracy and surface roughness requirements.\n5, 45, 50 grades of carbon steel have certain strength and wear resistance, and are mostly used for mold base materials after quenching and tempering. High carbon tool steel and low alloy tool steel have high strength and wear resistance after heat treatment, and are mostly used for forming parts. However, high carbon tool steel is only suitable for the manufacture of formed parts with small size and simple shape due to its large deformation during heat treatment.\nFor the manufacture of complex, precise and corrosion-resistant Plastic injection molds, pre-hardened steels (such as PMS), corrosion-resistant steels (such as PCR) and low-carbon maraging steels (such as 18Ni-250) can be used, all of which have better performance. Machining, heat treating and polishing properties and high strength.\n6. In addition, when selecting materials, it is necessary to consider preventing scratches and gluing. If there is relative movement between the two surfaces, try to avoid selecting materials with the same structure. with different surface structures.\nThe application of plastic injection molds can be said to be very extensive. From tea cups in daily necessities to forklifts used in industrial production and materials used in military and national defense, you can see parts and products produced by plastic injection molds.Here is some of their fields like household appliances, furniture, instruments, meters, building materials, fitness equipment, auto parts, auto parts, hardware, consumer electronics, medical equipment, etc.\nCNC machining and 3D printing are commonly methods of making prototypes.

{"question":"What parallels exist between hidden curriculum in medical education and surrealist views of reality?","answer":"Both concepts deal with layers of hidden truth beneath surface appearances. The hidden curriculum in medical education involves unwritten rules and informal learning that takes place outside the formal curriculum, similar to how surrealism posits two realities - the visible everyday reality where everything appears fragmented and disconnected, and a hidden true reality where everything is connected in wholeness. Both perspectives recognize that what is apparent on the surface differs from deeper underlying truths.","context":["Professor of Spanish Dr. Soledad Traverso gave a Faculty Address titled “Surrealism in Everyday Life” at the fall 2016 commencement in Junker Center.\nA native of Chile, Traverso began her teaching career at her undergraduate alma mater, the University of Antofagasta. She earned her doctoral degree in Latin American literature at the University of Maryland and taught at Bucknell University prior to joining the Penn State Behrend faculty in 1996.\nThe author of two books on the writings of Chilean novelist Juan Emar, Traverso most recently published \"Medical Spanish for Nurses: A Self-Teaching Guide.\" Co-written with Dr. Laurie Urraro, lecturer in Spanish, and Dr. Patty McMahon, director of the Health and Wellness Center, this textbook teaches medical professionals the vocabulary needed to take patient histories, assess pain, and conduct physical assessments of their Spanish-speaking patients.\nThe book and language courses for both professional and student nurses grew out of an offhand comment made to Traverso by a nurse who wished that she had some knowledge of Spanish.\nWhen was the last time that you had a surreal moment? Something like, “OMG, I can’t believe that this is happening! It’s surreal!”\nI am sure that it wasn’t too long ago. For some of your parents, who are thinking “I can’t believe my child finally is graduating,” right now might be a surreal moment.\nWell, behind that expression there is a cultural movement that can teach us how to deal with uncertainty, the unknown, and the unexpected—some things that you may be facing as you graduate today. Yes, we generally connect Surrealism with famous crazy people who painted weird things, like Salvador Dali’s melting clocks in The Persistence of Memory. But let me tell you that Surrealism is a world vision, a cultural movement born between the two World Wars, from 1918 to 1939. It emerged as a reaction against the mentality and politics that caused the horrors of World War I. This group of artists and writers felt that nothing had been solved and that the next war was imminent.\nSo the surrealists purposely wanted to shock. They wanted to wake people up from a state of conformity and lethargy. For this purpose they cut all obvious connections to reality and, instead, created something totally unusual, unexpected, with illogical relations. According to their movement there are two realities in life, and this is what the word surrealism implies. One of them is the true reality, but this is hidden to the naked eye. The other one is the reality of everyday life, where everything is fragmented, analyzed, classified, separated; each fragment is disconnected from the other. For example, Juan Emar’s literary work is very difficult to read because there is no coherent and logical plot; the reader needs to search and discover the thread that connects it all.\nIn the true reality, on the other hand, there is wholeness, everything comes together, and one can perceive that what seems fragmented on the surface is all connected. Moreover, each fragment on the surface contains the wholeness; each fragment in itself is a universe. In one famous short story of the Argentinean writer Jorge Luis Borges, the main character finds the Aleph in the most unexpected place – between the steps of the stairs to a cellar. The Aleph is a one-inch sphere that gives him access to the whole universe, where the secrets of the unimaginable universe are revealed. What is this story telling us? The Aleph represents a crack of the usual way of seeing things; it tells us that we need to be aware and attentive to new possibilities.\nSo, what can we learn from Surrealism? First of all, that uncertainty is part of life, and if you don’t believe me, just wait a little bit. Whenever you find yourself in one of those “surreal moments,” remember that fragmentation exists on the surface, but it is an illusion. There will be instances where you might feel disconnected, because the process of change is uncomfortable, unfamiliar, and uncertain. But this means that you are stepping into the unknown, where you have the possibility of discovering the real you. Don’t be afraid. Become a surrealist.\nOne can feel fragmented in so many occasions. For example, when moving to another culture where all seems unknown. Or when experiencing a natural disaster. Or when losing a loved one. Or when getting sick. For example, sometimes we have an experience that at the very moment seems terrible and surreal, but then, the outcome is unexpectedly positive. This is what happened to me when I ended up in the emergency room, and then, two years after, the outcome is a book on medical Spanish for nurses.\nSo when you experience a “surreal moment” and you find yourself totally surprised or caught off guard, take a deep breath, stop, and become a surrealist: Look for that wholeness within, reconnect with yourself. Your education at Behrend has contributed to who you are today, has given you the tools you need to go out there and be confident, brave, and imaginative. Look for the Aleph and shock the world with your fresh perception of reality. Becoming a surrealist will also remind you that humanity is not constituted of disconnected fragments but of an undivided totality. You will contribute to humanity in a very unique way.\nSo, if this is a “surreal moment” because, like your parents, you might be saying “I can’t believe I am finally graduating,” think as a surrealist. In the true reality there is wholeness!","The n e w e ng l a n d j o u r na l of m e dic i n e edi t or i a l Professionalism — The Next Wave Frederic W. Hafferty, Ph.D. In their Medical Education article in the October 26 issue of the Journal, Stern and Papadakis make a number of observations about professionalism and the learning environments in which medical training occurs.1 Like a growing number of medical educators, they recognize that considerable learning (some think most) takes place outside the domain of the formal curriculum and that such learning involves indoctrination in the unwritten rules of studenthood and medical practice. Some medical schools and residency programs have acknowledged the existence of alternative, or shadow, domains of learning, whose lessons are sometimes collectively called the “hidden curriculum,” and have accepted responsibility for both understanding and modulating the effects of these domains on students’ knowledge, skills, and values. Included in this broadened curriculum are the lessons students learn as they witness conflicts between the expectations and ideals articulated in professional codes2 and the behavior of individual physicians (particularly faculty members) and organizations as both go about the daily and concurrent work of medicine and education. As we work to define, instill, and appraise professionalism as a core standard and competency, it is critical that we keep three interrelated questions in mind. First, how do we effectively define and assess something that is transmitted in a variety of learning environments through a wide range of both formal and informal, even tacit, educational practices? Second, how do we effectively assess something that may be conceived as both practice and identity? And third, how do we design a system of evaluation that assesses both learners and their learning environments? There is much to be gained in simplicity and directness by highlighting behavior, as advocated by Stern and Papadakis. Nonetheless, an essential element of medicine’s claim to professional status lies in the development of what might be termed a “professional self” in students — the internalization of the values and virtues of medicine as a discipline and a calling. It is not sufficient for students to acquire the knowledge, skills, and outward behavior necessary for practicing medicine. Being a physician — taking on the identity of a true medical professional — also involves a number of value orientations, including a general commitment not only to learning and excellence of skills but also to medical behavior and practices that are authentically caring.3,4 These value orientations and motives are, in part, the product of professional learning and socialization, with medical schools and residency programs functioning as critical settings for the development of what Leach and colleagues have labeled the “habit of professionalism”3,4 — a professional self that is in accordance with the values that medicine has publicly identified as central to its organizational identity and to its contract with society.5 It is this underpinning that provides the necessary stability and generalizability when one has to step outside the realm of textbook medical practice and confront situations of uncertainty and ambiguity — which are, after all, the defining characteristics of real-world medical work. In addition to assessing behavior, we can and should evaluate trainees’ motives and their learning environments. There is a meaningful (and measurable) difference between being a professional and acting professionally. It is certainly possible to behave professionally without having authentically internalized core values. Even if trainees exemplify the behavioral standards of profession- n engl j med 10.1056/NEJMe068054 1 Downloaded from www.nejm.org on August 23, 2009 . Copyright © 2006 Massachusetts Medical Society. All rights reserved. The n e w e ng l a n d j o u r na l of m e dic i n e alism, we must attend to such inconsistencies between the inner self and outward appearance, sending a message that authenticity is a matter of great concern. There are several other reasons to assess factors other than students’ behavior.6 One of these factors arises from medicine’s compact with society: the profession’s desire for autonomy is predicated on its promise to police itself in the public’s interest.7 External controls, even within the occupation, have been deemed to be largely unnecessary because controls would be internalized as a core part of each practitioner’s self, through socialization. We should therefore be asking our students, our faculty, and our practitioner colleagues whether they are, in fact, committed to the core principles that we hold to be “professional.” Second, a focus on behavior may neglect our pedagogical responsibility to assess and transform the learning environments our students must navigate. Indeed, one might argue that we should begin by assessing learning environments and do so until we get it right. It makes little sense to assess the professionalism of students within learning environments that are hostile to its precepts. Third, personal reflection remains a core element of virtually all definitions of professionalism, and we should tap the products of this reflection, not just its behavioral manifestations. Medicine is a moral community, the practice of medicine a moral undertaking, and professionalism a moral commitment. We should bear these fundamental truths in mind as we design our learning environments and seek to measure their effectiveness.

Organizations that manage data and individuals who own it should not take data security and data privacy lightly.\nData security and data privacy are two different terms that looks almost similar in meaning.\nHowever, Data Security is a process of protecting data from unauthorized access, use, and corruption throughout the data lifecycle.\nWhile, data privacy means using sensitive data of organizations and individuals with the consent of its owner. The user informs upfront what data user will collect and how he’ll use it before using sensitive data.\nMoreover, there are few methods to protect data from unauthorized access, such as data encryption, Hashing, tokenization, and key management practices over the different platforms etc.\nEncryption: Converting data into different codes to protect it from unauthorized access.\nHashing: Passing information under a formula to produce a code called the hash.\nTokenization: Converting sensitive data into a unique identification symbol.\nFurther, encryption is the very secure method to protect data as it produce different codes for the same set of data. There are various types of data encryption techniques.\nThe Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is most secure and advance data encryption technique .\nLet us take a quick run through what is Advance Encryption Standard (AES)? What is AES encryption used for?\nWhat is AES encryption and how does it works to secure your data?\nWith the evolution of the internet and 5G technology, the world becomes more connected. Better connectivity increases the chance of data theft. Cybercriminals are always looking for weak links to crack.\nTo assure that the data is secure wherever it is located, Encryption is a common method to protect it.\nIn addition, Encryption is the process by which information or plain text is randomly converted into different codes. And these codes are set of random characters. Codes consist of alphabets, numbers, and symbols.\nBoth sender and receiver need this secret code to encrypt or decrypt the information. The decryption of information takes place at the receiver’s end, which the sender decides.\nConsequently, the Advanced Encryption System (AES) is a publically available encryption technique chosen by the US government to protect sensitive data.\nTherefore, AES encryption is important in government computers to protect government data and electronic information.\nThe AES encryption is used in both software and hardware to encrypt data.\nIn 1997 The National Institute of standards and technology (NIST) started the development of AES, when they realized the requirement of alternate data encryption standards due to rising brute force attacks.\nNIST stated that, this advance and newer encryption system is “Capable of protecting government information well in 21st century,” NIST stated.\nIt was intended to quickly implement in hardware and to provide decent security against various attack techniques.\nFurthermore, encryption is a process of converting data into different codes to protect it from unauthorized access. AES encryption has three Ciphers. AES-128, AES-192, and AES-256.\nAnd these three blocks use different key length to encrypt and decrypt the messages.\nIn addition, the AES-128 uses a key length of 128-bit to encrypt or decrypt block messages. AES-192 uses 192-bit key size to encrypt or decrypt messages. And AES-256 uses 256-bit key size to encrypt or decrypt messages.\nEach cipher encrypts or decrypts messages into 128-bit data blocks using cryptographic keys of 128-bit, 192-bit, and 256-bit, respectively.\nThese ciphers generate secret keys. This secret key is used for both encryption and decryption of messages. Therefore, both sender and receiver should know this secret key.\nAs a result, any cipher can be used to protect classified and secret messages. Top secret messages need 256-bit of Key length.\nThere are different processing, transposition, and mixing of input plain text etc. to generate the cipher code.\nIn AES-128, there are ten rounds of the 128-bit key; in AES-192, there are 12 rounds of the 192-bit key; and in AES-256, there are 14 rounds of 256-bit of the key.\nThe AES encryption algorithm performs a complex process to generate cipher code of a plain message. AES Algorithm Steps;\nFirst, the algorithm defines various transformations of the plain messages.\nAnd, it arranges the data into an array.\nThen, the cipher transformations are repeated number of rounds.\nThe first transformation refers to the transformation in AES encryption cipher and substitution of data using substitution table. Then it mixes the rows and columns. Then algorithm performs a transformation on each column and row using encryption code.\nLonger keys take more rounds to complete.\nLet us see this with an example\nSuppose the message you want to send is “Hello… we’re YourTechDiet”.\nFirst, The AES algorithm will put this message into substitution and generate different transformations of this text. Such as “we Hello your diet are tech”.\nSecond, the algorithm will arrange this transformed text into an array by mixing rows and columns using the substitution table.\nResult: [1*#4hj^41@ho02!?45df542g2to09j;3k ew.5e4epie-z88&09%489y]\nThird, the algorithm will transform this cipher in to number of rounds and will generate a cipher for this array.\nResult: [@ho02!?45df542g2to091*#4hj^41;3k %489yew12wer5658.5e4epie-z88&].\nThe same cipher code will be used to encrypt or decrypt the message.\nReceiver needs this same code to read the message.\nThe AES makes the system and data transfer more secure than any other method because of its algorithm. And so it is used in Government computers, Organizations, and various software.\nWe’re living in time where cyber attacks and data theft are common form of attacks individuals and organizations does. many real-life examples can be seen in our surroundings.\nTo protect sensitive and classified data, we need a strong and tamper-free system. AES does the same.\nDue to its flexible algorithm and Advanced data encryption standard AES has become the most commonly used data protection standard. The Process of encryption makes AES almost uncrackable and protects secret data.\nThere are many social media platforms that runs on the same data protection standard. AES holds much potential in the coming future.\nYou May Also Like\nSIGNAL PRIVATE MESSENGER VS WHATSAPP MESSENGER"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:d2209cff-0194-43a2-bb9d-31d75a86f323>","<urn:uuid:8549363d-7dfd-4c3b-a805-87c5d6b074b7>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the key differences between the digital twin implementations at NAVWAR and GE Research?","answer":"NAVWAR's digital twin (Digital Lincoln) focuses on modeling five interconnected information warfare systems for USS Abraham Lincoln, including DCGS-N, NITES-Next, MTC2, GCCS-M, and ACS, to identify capability gaps before installation. In contrast, GE Research's digital twins are being developed for smart warehouses at Navy and Marine bases, focusing on inventory management with real-time asset tracking and autonomous robots that can validate inventory every 15 minutes.","context":["SAN DIEGO (NNS) -- Naval Information Warfare Systems Command (NAVWAR) accomplished a significant milestone in the digital engineering transformation with completion of its first digital twin, a system-of-systems digital model, representing a set of information warfare capabilities that will be installed on USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN 72) in fiscal year 2020.\nAligned with the Department of Defense Digital Transformation Strategy, NAVWAR is shifting from a design-build-test methodology to a model-analyze-build methodology, enabling the ability to test and evaluate solutions in a virtual environment before delivery. This shift will increase system reliability and cybersecurity while decreasing risk for the warfighter.\n“Digital engineering is vital in modernizing how we design, develop, deliver, operate and sustain systems,” said NAVWAR Executive Director Pat Sullivan. “It enables the use of digital models throughout the life cycle of a system, increasing system cybersecurity, interoperability and resiliency. This provides a solid foundation to enable us to fight and win the conflicts of the future.”\nNAVWAR’s first digital twin, also known as Digital Lincoln, used NAVWAR’s model based systems engineering (MBSE) methodology, and its corresponding integrated dictionary, schema, and requirements framework to develop an end-to-end digital representation of five interconnected systems being installed on the USS Abraham Lincoln.\n“MBSE provides a consistent approach for developing and sharing engineering information across interrelated efforts,” said Sam Rix, NAVWAR MBSE implementation lead. “The integrated dictionary provides a list of parts engineers can use when building a digital model, the schema provides directions on how to put the parts together, and the requirements framework describes the traceability across digital models to track how and why the parts connect.”\nDigital Lincoln is a black box model; a digital representation that can be viewed in terms of its inputs and outputs, of the following five interconnected systems onboard USS Abraham Lincoln:\n- The Distributed Common Ground System-Navy (DCGS-N): A program that provides the Navy’s primary intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance and targeting-support capability. Afloat or ashore, DCGS-N tools are critical for the operational commander’s battlespace awareness and net centric operations.\n- Navy Integrated Tactical Environmental System-Next Generation (NITES-Next): A system that uses meteorology and oceanography data to help the warfighter with mission planning, mission execution, critical decision-making and situational awareness.\n- Maritime Tactical Command and Control (MTC2): A Navy command and control (C2) program that delivers battle management aids to dynamically plan, direct, monitor and assess maritime operations.\n- Global Command and Control System – Maritime (GCCS-M): A system that fuses, correlates, filters, maintains and displays location and attribute information on friendly, hostile and neutral land, sea and air forces.\n- Agile Core Services (ACS) - An element of Consolidated Afloat Networks and Enterprise Services (CANES) that gives CANES the infrastructure to support application migration.\n“Modeling complex systems in a digital environment is like working on a giant puzzle, where multiple people are working separate sections of the puzzle,” said Monique Harris, NAVWAR requirements management lead. “It is not until the people begin to communicate that they are able put their sections together to reveal the final image. These systems are like separate sections of the puzzle, and in the past we have waited until fielding to put the puzzle pieces together, but with digital engineering we are putting the pieces together before fielding, allowing us to address issues before we deliver the system to the warfighter.”\nBy developing a digital twin, or digital model, of these systems, NAVWAR was able to identify capability gaps and overlaps prior to installation.\n“For example, we found that some of the systems were making individual offshore calls for the exact same piece of information,” said Chris Ruffalo, NAVWAR digital products lead for digital engineering. “Digital Lincoln allowed us to identify the overlap and resolve the problem before delivery, so only one system was tackling the task, rather than two or three, reducing bandwidth used. That is very important in a bandwidth degraded environment.”\nIn addition to developing a digital twin of these systems, Digital Lincoln provides a standardized format for developing future digital models and a baseline for future installations.\nMoving forward, the NAVWAR Digital Lincoln team will leverage lessons learned and apply them to the development of a system-of-systems digital twin of USS Dwight D. Eisenhower (CVN 69), or Digital Ike.\nAs the Navy continues on its journey of digital transformation, the goal is to create digital models of all systems on all platforms to improve cybersecurity, enhance system capability, increase the speed of technology delivery and reduce time and cost of installation.\nNAVWAR identifies, develops, delivers and sustains information warfighting capabilities and services that enable naval, joint, coalition and other national missions operating in warfighting domains from seabed to space.

One of these projects will be for the Naval Base in San Diego, California, which houses resources and supplies for Naval unit operations. The other project will be for the Marine Corps Logistics Base (MCLB) in Albany, Georgia, which sends critical resource and supplies to Marines performing various missions around the world.\n20X faster than the current 4G or Advanced LTE networks, 5G is the next generation network that can achieve the speed and low latency at scale required to dynamically manage major projects like the smart warehouse transformations with the Marines and Navy\n“The superior network speed and capacity of 5G networks will allow us to take full advantage of a multitude of digital technologies to transform industrial assets and operations,” Hasan, Principal Investigator on the two projects, said. “Through our projects with the DOD, we will be demonstrating the ability to track and manage thousands of assets in real-time that support critical military missions on land and at sea. Operations that previously took several days or weeks could accurately and reliably be prepared and deployed in less than 24 hours.”\nDell’Anno, a co-principal investigator with Hasan on the DOD projects, says the two teams are pushing to develop a “just-in-time” inventory scenario, where new supplies are deployed as soon as they arrive. “The most efficient factory or ideal warehouse is one that is essentially empty, “ Dell’Anno says. “It would basically signal that you are able to time the delivery and shipping of supplies, so perfectly that inventory never sits.”\nTo build these smart warehouses at the Navy and Marines bases, Hasan and Dell’Anno’s teams will create digital twins, or digital replicas of these warehouses that can account for their entire inventory and floor footprints. They will integrate real-time asset tracking and autonomous robots that are able to “virtually walk” the warehouse floors to validate and inspect warehouse inventory.\n“We will be able to get a snapshot of the entire warehouse inventory every 15- minutes,” Hasan said. “What we are talking about is providing these bases with unprecedented visibility to their inventory that will allow them to be much more responsive and faster with decisions.”\nThese efforts have been sponsored by the U.S. Government under Other Transaction number W15QKN-15-9-1004 between the NSC, and the Government.

{"question":"How do dental crown materials differ between visible and non-visible areas, and what factors influence insurance coverage for different types?","answer":"In visible areas of the mouth, dental crowns are typically made of porcelain or resin to match the natural appearance of teeth in color and texture. Back-of-mouth crowns may be made of gold or stainless steel. Regarding insurance coverage, cosmetic procedures are very rarely covered by dental insurance plans. The coverage level depends on whether the crown is considered a basic procedure or major dental care, with different co-pay requirements. Patients should carefully review their insurance plan as coverage varies by provider.","context":["Patients with cracked, broken, or damaged teeth might be advised by their oral health professional to get dental crowns. This procedure can dramatically help patients when it comes to easing pain and discomfort, protecting teeth from further damage, and completing smile restoration or enhancement. This guide will give patients the information they need to know if they are considering dental crowns.\nWhat are Dental Crowns?\nDental crowns are artificial teeth installed in the mouth. They can be used to complete a dental implant or can be bonded to the top of an existing tooth. Dental crowns work to protect the tooth by covering any damage to it and preventing worse damage from occurring. There are many different types of dental crowns, and they can be made from different materials to fit each patient’s needs and budget.\nDental Crowns Before and After 1\nHow Long do Dental Crowns Last?\nDental crowns usually last between five and 15 years. It is important to note that the way a dental crown is cared for will dramatically impact its lifespan. Patients looking to get the most time out of their dental crowns should minimize sticky foods and be sure to brush and floss regularly, as well as visiting the dentist at least every six months for an examination and cleaning. Additionally, habits like chewing ice or fingernails, or using teeth to open a package can also reduce the lifespan of dental crowns.\nCan Anyone Notice Dental Crowns?\nDental crowns are usually designed to not be noticed. Crowns that go in the back of the mouth might be made of gold or stainless steel, but crowns in the visible areas of the mouth will usually be made of porcelain or resin that closely resembles the appearance, color, and texture of a patient’s natural teeth. As a result, someone you know well could have dental crowns and you might not ever realize it.\nWhat Kind of Results Can Patients Expect?\nPatients should always ask to see pictures of past results when they are talking to their dentist about dental crowns. This will give patients a good idea of what to expect when it comes to their dental crown procedure. Most patients are happy with their dental crowns, and have reported less pain and discomfort, a better smile, more confidence, an easier time chewing food, and fewer complications with their oral hygiene as a result of their dental crowns.\nDental Crowns Before and After 1\nHow Are Dental Crowns Cared For?\nDental crowns are cared for just like regular teeth. Patients should brush and floss regularly, and see an oral health professional at least every six months for routine cleaning and examinations. Patients can increase the lifespan of their crowns by avoiding very hard foods, sticky foods, and destructive oral health habits like smoking, eating sticky foods, chewing on finger nails, or opening packaging with teeth.\nAre there Any Alternatives to Dental Crowns?\nThere are some alternatives to dental crowns for some patients, but, for the most part, dental crowns are the least invasive procedure that will resolve many oral health issues. Alternatives include dental implants, dentures, fillings, and other options that might not be as effective or may be much more involved when compared to dental crowns.\nAs you can see, dental crowns are a safe, effective option for many patients suffering from broken, cracked, discolored, stained, or otherwise damaged teeth. The result is less pain and discomfort and an easier time eating food. Patients also report feeling better about their smile, and an increased sense of overall well-being. The flexibility when it comes to materials and the procedure means that there is a dental crown solution for many patients.","What Does Dental Insurance Typically Cover?\nOne of the most frequent questions about dental insurance is, “What does this insurance cover?” It is difficult to answer this question with specifics, because every insurance provider offers a slightly different kind of coverage. Luckily, there are a few basic guidelines that apply to most dental plans.\nWhat Is Typically Covered:\nMost dental plans will cover your care with different co-pay levels, which means that some procedures may be fully covered by your plan, while other procedures may require you to pay a part of the cost.\n• Diagnostic and preventive care – Most dental plans cover these procedures completely or require only a small payment from the patient. Diagnostic and preventive care typically includes checkups, X-rays, routine cleaning, fluoride treatment, and other procedures that detect or prevent tooth and gum disease. The list of procedures that falls into this category varies by provider; for example, a dental plan might consider fluoride treatment a “basic procedure” and require a larger co-pay.\n• Basic procedures – Many dental plans cover these procedures with a small co-pay. Basic procedures include tooth removal, cavity fillings, gum care and repairs to cracked or chipped teeth. Some providers even include surgeries such as root canals in this category.\n• Major dental care – If you expect to need major dental care, review your provider’s plan carefully to find out whether it will be covered. If it is covered, there may be a waiting period before the provider will cover the cost of the care. For example, dentures might not be covered until you have had your plan for at least six months. Procedures that fall into the category of major care can include surgery, braces, implants and dentures.\nWhat’s Not Covered:\nIt is very rare for a dental insurance plan to cover cosmetic procedures. For example, porcelain tooth veneers, tooth whitening or bleaching, and tooth bonding (to close gaps in teeth) are usually not covered by dental insurance.\nOrthodontics (such as braces) are not covered by most plans, but it is possible to find a dental plan that covers braces. If you are considering braces, check with your insurance provider to see if some or all of the cost will be assumed by the provider.\nAs you choose an insurance provider, there are a few important tips which will help you navigate the confusing variety of dental insurance plans.\n• “Full insurance coverage” does not mean that the plan covers everything that could ever happen to your teeth. It simply means that the plan covers more procedures than a cut-rate dental plan might cover.\n• Some plans require that you use a dentist in their network. If you want to keep your current dentist, ask if he or she is included in the list of acceptable dentists.\n• Some plans cover lots of procedures, but limit the maximum monetary benefit to a small amount per year.\n• Even the worst dental bills rarely exceed the cost of the highest medical bills. For example, an implant to replace a broken tooth would typically cost less than chemotherapy for cancer. For this reason, some patients “insure” themselves by saving money for emergencies instead of paying for dental insurance coverage.\n• If you have to pay cash for a dental procedure, ask your dentist if there is a discount for paying the cost of the procedure up front. Many dentists are glad to lower their fees, because they save money by not filing insurance paperwork.\nThe range of options with dental insurance plans can be overwhelming. Read your dental plan carefully to see what is covered, or call your insurance provider if you have questions about a specific procedure."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:eab99c28-06eb-465c-80c3-6f9567cdbdf9>","<urn:uuid:2257f805-d3ce-4298-bda7-b3742467c599>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How does DNA inheritance differ between binary fission and sexual reproduction?","answer":"Binary fission and sexual reproduction handle DNA inheritance differently. In binary fission, used by prokaryotes, DNA is simply replicated and split in half, creating identical copies. In sexual reproduction, the process is more complex - during meiosis, chromosomes undergo random assortment and DNA exchange between similar chromosomes (crossing over), creating unique combinations. This results in completely unique chromosomes that aren't identical to either parent or grandparent, contributing to offspring individuality. Additionally, meiosis produces gametes with half the normal DNA content, which then combine during fertilization.","context":["Why are children all so different?\nFirstly Love the show. A question that has been bugging me thought it might be good for Question of the Week\nI was wondering what mechanism causes children born to the same parents all have different characteristics from each other. I understand that half the Chromosomes come from the father and half the Mother so you'll always get a mixture of both parents characteristics. However, this simple understanding doesn't explain why they aren't all identical twins (albeit born at different times). So are the Chromosomes somehow jumbled further say chromosomes no. 2 from Mum and no. 4 from Dad? What mechanism controls individuality?\nTa Cameron Lapworth\nDr. Zegerman:: So to understand real individuality really have to understand how you and I were made. It really starts when a sperm from your dad and an egg from your mum got together and made you as an individual. Sperm and egg are made by a special form of cell division, which is called meiosis. Meiosis is special because it turns a diploid, which has two copies of every chromosome, into a haploid, which has one copy of every chromosome. So, when cells goes through the process of meiosis, you take this 46 human chromosomes and you turn it to a cell with one copy of every chromosome, which now means has only 23 chromosomes.\nAnd very importantly, this process of meiosis is random. Every cell that goes through meiosis will inherit one of every chromosome, but whether inherits one from your mother or father is random. So for example, when your father's cells went through meiosis to make sperm, it was random whether that you inherited chromosome 2 let's say, from his mother or chromosome 2 from his father. So now, you can see that when you get an egg and a sperm fusing together, as happened for you and your brothers and sisters, you now see this is now a random collection of chromosomes that aren't just from your parents but random collection of chromosomes they inherited themselves from their parents.\nBut it's actually much more complicated than just random assortment. During the process of meiosis, chromosome 2 will align next to chromosome 2 and chromosome 4 will align next to chromosome 4 and so on and so forth. And this process is absolutely essential to ensure that each haploid sperm or egg inherits exactly one copy of all the different chromosomes. More than just being essential for the inheritance of every single chromosome, it also allows a very special process to occur whereby chromosomes that are similar but not identical that line up can now exchange pieces of DNA. And this results in making completely unique chromosomes. So now you've swapped a bit of chromosome 2 that your father inherited from his mum with a bit of chromosome 2 that he inherited from his dad. And the end result is a chromosome 2 that is neither your dad's, nor is it your grandma's nor is it your grandfather's. It's completely unique. It's got a bit of both grandma's and granddad's and that is the chromosome that your sperm that made you inherited. It's completely unique to that sperm.","Cell Division Definition\nCell division is the process cells go through to divide. There are several types of cell division, depending upon what type of organism is dividing. Organisms have evolved over time to have different and more complex forms of cell division. Most prokaryotes, or bacteria, use binary fission to divide the cell. Eukaryotes of all sizes use mitosis to divide. Sexually-reproducing eukaryotes use a special form of cell division called meiosis to reduce the genetic content in the cell. This is necessary in sexual reproduction because each parent must give only half of the required genetic material, otherwise the offspring would have too much DNA, which can be a problem. These different types of cell division are discussed below.\nTypes of Cell Division\nProkaryotic Cell Division\nProkaryotes replicate through a type of cell division known as binary fission. Prokaryotes are simple organism, with only one membrane and no division internally. Thus, when a prokaryote divides, it simply replicates the DNA and splits in half. The process is a little more complicated than this, as DNA must first be unwound by special proteins. Although the DNA in prokaryotes usually exists in a ring, it can get quite tangled when it is being used by the cell. To copy the DNA efficiently, it must be stretched out. This also allows the two new rings of DNA created to be separated after they are produced. The two strands of DNA separate into two different sides of the prokaryote cell. The cell then gets longer, and divides in the middle. The process can be seen in the image below.\nThe DNA is the tangled line. The other components are labeled. Plasmids are small rings of DNA that also get copied during binary fission and can be picked up in the environment, from dead cells that break apart. These plasmids can then be further replicated. If a plasmid is beneficial, it will increase in a population. This is in part how antibiotic resistance in bacteria happens. The ribosomes are small protein structures that help produce proteins. They are also replicated so each cell can have enough to function.\nEukaryotic Cell Division: Mitosis\nEukaryotic organisms have membrane bound organelles and DNA that exists on chromosomes, which makes cell division harder. Eukaryotes must replicate their DNA, organelles, and cell mechanisms before dividing. Many of the organelles divide using a process that is essentially binary fission, leading scientist to believe that eukaryotes were formed by prokaryotes living inside of other prokaryotes.\nAfter the DNA and organelles are replicated during interphase of the cell cycle, the eukaryote can begin the process of mitosis. The process begins during prophase, when the chromosomes condense. If mitosis proceeded without the chromosomes condensing, the DNA would become tangled and break. Eukaryotic DNA is associated with many proteins which can fold it into complex structures. As mitosis proceeds to metaphase the chromosomes are lined up in the middle of the cell. Each half of a chromosome, known as sister chromatids because they are replicated copies of each other, gets separated into each half of the cell as mitosis proceeds. At the end of mitosis, another process called cytokinesis divides the cell into two new daughter cells.\nAll eukaryotic organisms use mitosis to divide their cells. However, only single-celled organisms use mitosis as a form of reproduction. Most multicellular organisms are sexually reproducing and combine their DNA with that of another organism to reproduce. In these cases, organisms need a different method of cell division. Mitosis yields identical cells, but meiosis produces cells with half the genetic information of a regular cell, allowing two cells from different organisms of the same species to combine.\nEukaryotic Cell Division: Meiosis\nIn sexually reproducing animals, it is usually necessary to reduce the genetic information before fertilization. Some plants can exist with too many copies of the genetic code, but in most organisms it is highly detrimental to have too many copies. Humans with even one extra copy of one chromosome can experience detrimental changes to their body. To counteract this, sexually reproducing organisms undergo a type of cell division known as meiosis. As before mitosis, the DNA and organelles are replicated. The process of meiosis contains two different cell divisions, which happen back-to-back. The first meiosis, meiosis I, separates homologous chromosomes. The homologous chromosomes present in a cell represent the two alleles of each gene an organism has. These alleles are recombined and separated, so the resulting daughter cells have only one allele for each gene, and no homologous pairs of chromosomes. The second division, meiosis II, separated the two copies of DNA, much like in mitosis. The end result of meiosis in one cell is 4 cells, each with only one copy of the genome, which is half the normal number.\nOrganisms typically package these cells into gametes, which can travel into the environment to find other gametes. When two gametes of the right type meet, one will fertilize the other and produce a zygote. The zygote is a single cell that will undergo mitosis to produce the millions of cells necessary for a large organism. Thus, most eukaryotes use both mitosis and meiosis, but at different stages of their lifecycle.\nCell Division Stages\nDepending upon which type of cell division an organism uses, the stages can be slightly different.\nMitosis starts with prophase in which the chromosome is condensed. The cell proceeds to metaphase where the chromosomes are aligned on the metaphase plate. Then the chromosomes are separated in anaphase and the cell’s cytoplasm is pinched apart during telophase. Cytokinesis is the final process that breaks the cell membrane and divides the cell into two.\nThe stages of meiosis are similar to mitosis, but the chromosomes act differently. Meiosis has two phases, which include two separate cell divisions without the DNA replicating between them. Meiosis I and meiosis II have the same 4 stages as mitosis: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. Cytokinesis concludes both rounds of meiosis.\nIn prophase I, the chromosomes are condensed. In metaphase I, the chromosomes line up across from their homologous pairs. When they are separated in anaphase I and telophase I, there is only one form of each gene in each cell, known as a reduction division. Meiosis II proceeds in the same manner as mitosis, which sister chromatids dividing on the metaphase plate. By telophase II, there are 4 cells, each with half of the alleles as the parent cell and only a single copy of the genome. The cells can now become gametes and fuse together to create new organisms.\nRelated Biology Terms\n- Chromosome – Strands of DNA which carry genetic information, multiple of which are needed for most organisms.\n- Mitosis – Cell division in eukaryotes.\n- Meiosis – The cell division process that creates gametes.\n- Binary Fission – The process of cell division in prokaryotes, which simply divides the cells contents.\n1.

{"question":"As a compliance officer, I need to understand the FCPA's historical impact and current third-party risks. What were the key developments in FCPA enforcement history, and what types of third-party risks should companies monitor today beyond just bribery?","answer":"The FCPA emerged from the 1970s Watergate scandal, which exposed widespread corporate bribery. After limited enforcement in the 1980s-90s, the FCPA was revitalized in the 2000s when the DOJ and SEC prioritized enforcement, increased penalties, and expanded jurisdictional scope. Today, beyond bribery and corruption, companies must monitor multiple third-party risks including sanctions compliance, modern-day slavery, human rights abuse, negative media coverage, environmental social governance, financial health, cybersecurity, and country/industry risks. A holistic risk management approach is essential as regulatory enforcement has increased significantly, with 11 companies paying over $1.92 billion in FCPA settlements in 2017 alone.","context":["“[W]e in the United States are in a unique position to spread the gospel of anti-corruption, because there is no country that enforces its anti-bribery laws more vigorously than we do.”\n— Lanny A. Breuer, U.S. Assistant Attorney General (Nov. 16, 2012).\nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act can be traced to the Watergate scandal of the 1970s that brought down President Nixon and subsequently revealed what was called at the time “corrupt capitalism” — widespread use of bribery and slush funds by the largest U.S. companies to win business at home and abroad, often undermining the official U.S. foreign policy in the midst of the Cold War.\nThe 1980s and 1990s saw infrequent targeted FCPA enforcement actions against U.S. companies and individuals, which were not widely publicized. Yet these occasional cases resulted in a push to “level the playing field,” which led to the two FCPA amendments in 1988 and 1998 and the adoption of the first international anti-corruption treaties: the Inter-American Convention Against Corruption (1996), OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions (1997), and Council of Europe Civil and Criminal Law Conventions on Corruption (1999).\nThe FCPA was reinvented, even reborn, in 2000s when the U.S. Department of Justice and then the Securities and Exchange Commission prioritized FCPA enforcement, ratcheted up the penalties and individual liability risks for executives, expanded the scope and understanding of the law and its jurisdictional bounds through numerous out-of-court settlements, whose details were posted online, widely publicized and carefully studied for clues of DOJ’s and SEC’s enforcement plans and trends. As a result, this born-again FCPA changed how international business is done around the world, propelling the FCPA to be among the top concerns for senior executives and corporate boards and ensuring job security for outside and in-house counsel, compliance officers and former enforcement officials.\nThe robust FCPA enforcement with its large penalties against a broad range of companies, many of which are based outside the United States, has met with numerous criticisms outside the United States ranging from the claims that the U.S. government (i) is arrogantly imposing its own sense of morality on the rest of the world, (ii) using the FCPA as a blunt political tool or a way to protect U.S. businesses from foreign competition, (iii) usurping enforcement authority of foreign law enforcement agencies, (iv) is oblivious to local cultures, norms, and customs, (v) addressing the supply but not the demand side of business corruption, (vi) to the law’s failure to effect true change in how business is done in corrupt jurisdictions, (vii) choosing formalistic compliance with its high economically unjustified costs over deep anticorruption reforms rooted in real behavioral changes and shifts in local cultural perceptions of corruption. And yet, the FCPA persists in maintaining rapt attention of business people in the United States and abroad, and has served as a catalyst for the adoption of similar legislation in other countries and numerous international conventions.\nIs there merit to the criticisms? Is there a better way? What does the future hold for the FCPA and the fight against international corruption?","A look at how increased globalization, outsourcing of non-core activities, regulatory pressure and consumer scrutiny are all contributing to a complex third-party risk landscape.\n- Professionals now need to navigate the increasingly complex third-party risk landscape.\n- What is third-party risk beyond regulation and the impact of reputational and operational risk?\n- How can a risk-based approach provide effective third-party risk management?\nJust ‘ABC’ or ‘XYZ’ too?\nThere are key regulatory drivers that demand any company’s attention when it comes to third-party risk, but is it only suppliers and bribery and corruption (ABC), or should other parties and wider risks be keeping third-party risk professionals up at night, too?\nThe phrase “Do you really know who you are doing business with?” should be applied not just to supplier relationships but to numerous other types including vendors, distributors, agents and subsidiaries — particularly when moving into new markets across geographies.\nRegulatory-driven risk assessment and monitoring is the minimum that should be undertaken in this complex environment where so many other risk-types are impacting global businesses.\nBut ABC is certainly a good place to start…\nOver the last few years, there has been a significant increase in the number of enforcement actions and fines for companies who have breached the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA).\nAlthough not the only anti-bribery and corruption legislation (or widest in terms of application), it has certainly been the most enforced to-date and in 2017 resulted in 11 companies paying just over US$1.92 billion to resolve cases.\nAnd while the majority were U.S. based, the remainder covered Europe, Asia and South America — a truly global spread.\n…as is sanctions\nDoing business — whether knowingly or unknowingly — with a sanctioned entity or individual poses a significant risk to organizations with narrative and sectoral sanctions directives adding another layer of complexity. The value of screening against accurate and trusted data for these risks cannot be emphasized enough. Here are some practical tips.\nSanction breaches are pretty much as industry-agnostic as it gets — as shown in the diagram below which highlights U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control-related industry penalties for doing business with sanctioned individuals and companies.\nBut don’t forget the ‘XYZ’…\nAs a leading defense lawyer in an FCPA case recently said: “Ignore the internet at your peril.” As mentioned in my introduction it’s not just about regulatory risk which is just the tip of the risk iceberg.\nReputational risk is equally important to effective third-party risk management and along with board-level exposure, robust governance and effective tools and processes, is a business priority.\nFinding out that your third-party has connections to human trafficking, forced labor, narcotics trafficking or a host of other illegal activities can do significant harm to your brand.\nNo organization wants to be front-page news for the wrong reasons and subject to PR efforts and brand remediation costs — all of which are unnecessary with effective third-party risk management.\nAdditionally, the significant rise in public pressure for companies to operate ethically and with transparency should not be underestimated.\nFinancial and operational risk\nIn fact, in addition to regulatory and reputational risk, a truly holistic view of a third-party risk might include:\n- Modern-day slavery and human rights abuse\n- Negative media\n- Environmental Social Governance\n- Financial health\n- Cyber security\n- Country and industry risk\n… the list goes on.\nThis is where a risk-based approach is critical to effective third-party risk management. Whether growing your business in new markets or developing partnerships, the ability to understand the risks, define your risk-based approach and assess and prioritize what are often limited risk resources is instrumental to success.\nKnowing when to go deeper…\nA robust risk-based approach across multiple risk types will allow you to better understand when to delve deeper through enhanced due diligence to get a better view of any risks which might pertain to your third parties.\nThis includes connections to politically exposed persons, the financial health of a company, information on the directors and any connections to sanctioned entities of those associated to financial crime activities.\nAlthough in this blog we have just scratched the surface of what may cause a sleepless night, we will dig deeper and continue the conversation in our second blog in the series later this month.\nWatch this space for issues raised in our customer insights survey, what makes a comprehensive third-party risk workflow and what is required to form a workable anti-bribery-corruption program.\nFor those interested in finding out how new technologies are helping compliance professionals work smarter do join our Webinar on 22 May at 2pm (GMT+1)."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"sensitive"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:9d7cab7a-008f-48f1-9200-f729092fc44c>","<urn:uuid:bd1f9c68-60b2-474c-9a94-23ef16ec2631>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the main differences between how IoT devices and gaming devices use bandwidth in 5G networks with flexible numerology?","answer":"In 5G networks with flexible numerology, IoT devices and gaming devices are treated differently based on their needs. IoT sensors that only need to trickle small amounts of data can be assigned a tiny slice of frequency (as small as 1/64th of a channel) for a short period. Meanwhile, gamers who need bursts of huge bandwidth can be given larger frequency allocations, with the possibility of separated send/receive paths and longer connection periods for efficient packet transmission. This is more efficient than LTE networks, where both types of devices would be given the same size narrowband channel regardless of their data needs.","context":["This is the last in a series that looks at the underlying technologies that will create improvements for 5G – I looked previously at MIMO antennas and network slicing. Today I look at flexible numerology. Flexible numerology, in a nutshell involves new techniques that allow for changing the width of data channels in a frequency band.\nThe easiest way to understand the issues involved is to think back at how we used wireless devices in the past. Anybody that ever fiddled with an older 802.11n WiFi router using 2.4 GHz remembers directing different devices in the home to channels 1,6 or 11. While the 2.4 GHz band has 11 separate available channels, most wireless router manufacturers limited the use to those three channels in order to avoid cross-channel interference. They knew that if a home only used these three channels they’d likely not see such interference and would get the maximum performance on each channel. However, the decision to use only those three channels limited the amount of bandwidth that can be utilized. In peak usage situations only 3 of the 11 channels of 2.4 GHz are carrying bandwidth – avoiding interference meant not using much of the available frequency.\nIt’s easy to think of the channels within a wireless frequency as separate channels, because that’s how they are defined at the FCC. Cable companies are able to create distinct channels of frequency within the controlled confines of a coaxial cable in way to limit interference between channels. But when transmitted in the wild through the air all sorts of interference arises. Anybody old enough to remember watching TV in the 50s can remember times when you could see ghosts of a nearby channel when you were watching one of the low channel numbers.\nOur cellular networks have been designed in a similar fashion to the WiFi channels. Within each of the frequencies used for cellular service are channels predefined by the FCC, with buffers between each channel. However, even with the buffers there is cross-channel interference between neighboring channels, and so the cellular carriers have selectively chosen to spread the actual use of frequency in ways similar to how we used channels 1,6 and 11 for WiFi.\nFlexible numerology is new goal for 5G that was published with the 3GPP Release 15 standard. Flexible numerology is part of a system for allocating frequency in a new way that is intended to get the most and best use of the spectrum.\n5G will use the same underlying method for modulating signals as 4G LTE – orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). The OFDM scheme is the current way to try to get the best use of frequency and with OFDM a data stream is split across several separate narrowband channels to reduce interference, much in the same way that we used the three channels of WiFi.\nFlexible numerology is going to give the cell site the option to create much smaller narrowband channels within the channels described in the OFDM standard. That’s the magic sauce that will enable 5G to communicate with huge number of devices without creating massive interference.\nConsider a situation of two users at a 5G site. One is an IoT sensor that wants to trickle small amounts of data to the network and the other is a gamer that needs bursts of huge amounts of bandwidth. In the LTE network both devices would be given a narrowband channel – the IoT device for perhaps a tiny amount of time and the gamer for longer bursts. That’s an inefficient use of frequency since the IoT device is transmitting only a tiny amount of data. For even the short time that the cell site communicates with that device, in an LTE network the device commands as much bandwidth as any other user.\nFlexible numerology will allow assigning a tiny slice of frequency to the IoT device. For example, the cell site might elect to assign 1/64th of a channel to the IoT device, meaning the remaining 63/64ths of the frequency can be assigned to some other purpose to be used at the same time that the IoT device is demanding bandwidth. In a 5G network the IoT device might grab a tiny slice of frequency for a short period of time and barely create a ripple in the overall use of frequency at the cell site.\nThe cellular network might treat the gamer the same as today but has numerous new options with flexible numerology to improve the gaming performance. It might separate sent and received data and size each path according to needs. It might create a connection for a longer time period than normal to efficiently transmit the needed packages. Essentially, flexible numerology lets the cell site treat every customer differently depending upon their specific needs.\nThis implementation of flexible numerology for 5G is complicated and will require new algorithms that ultimately get built into the chips for 5G devices. It’s always interesting to watch how new standards are implemented in the industry. I’ve seen numerous papers on the web over the last few months from labs and universities looking at the challenges of flexible numerology. These investigations will eventually get translated into lab trials of devices, and, if those trials are successful make it into the production for both cell sites and cellular devices. This is why a new standard like 5G can’t be implemented immediately. Standards define the problem, and then scientists, engineers and manufacturers take a shot at making the new ideas work (or sometimes find out that they don’t work).

Everyone did their part, everyone played defense, and that’s the main thing. Offense will come, but we play as a team and play defense, and that’s what wins games.”\nThe team just needs more unity to make it to the semi-finals on Saturday, Anderson says.\n“Most of us have already trained up during the year as far as getting our body physically prepared, but we just worked on a few plays, just worked on understanding each other so we know each other’s weaknesses and strengths,” Anderson says. “Our game philosophy here is to just enjoy. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for many of us, and to be on this platform is just amazing, so just work hard and leave everything on the court.”\nAnderson says the Invictus crowd doesn’t put any additional pressure on him to perform.\n“My team is my mental preparation,” he says. “We play as one unit, so we practice together, we stretch together, we play together, we enjoy afterwards together, so my main mental preparation is being with the team and making sure we’re in one accord.”\nBrandi Evans has played wheelchair basketball about a year and a half and is the only female on Team USA’s wheelchair basketball team. She has a knee replacement and pins in her left hip after being hit by a car in 2003 and got into wheelchair basketball through the Army’s adaptive reconditioning program.\n“When I first started, I didn’t think I’d make it this far,” she says. “My goal was Invictus.There’s so many great athletes in the military right now, and I’m just really lucky, I’m blessed to be picked to play with such great players.”\nWhile she’s the team’s only female, she says the men don’t give her a hard time.\n“We have some great players, playing in division teams, they have more experience, they have more time in the chair, and I was very nervous, especially being a girl, and with not as much experience,” she says. “They took me under their wing. I have no complaints about the team. They’ve helped me a lot. I think in the last two weeks that we’ve spent together, I’ve already become a better ball player because of them.”\nEvans also competed in track and cycling this week, but wheelchair basketball is her favorite because of her team.\n“I competed all week individually and there was a little bit of team effort yesterday [Wednesday] in cycling … we help each other out a little, to give each other a break,” she says. “But wheelchair basketball just has a different atmosphere. I’d rather win with a team than by myself. I really would. They’re like family.”\nWalter Groen of the Netherlands, who has a T11 spinal-cord injury, says the team trained once a week for a few months and hoped for more, but they enjoyed the atmosphere and had a good time.\n“The balls need to fall,” he says. “We need to grow in the tournament, communicate a little better.”\nTherry Duitman of the Netherlands agrees that communication is a key element in improving their team. However, he feels his team moved the ball well.\n“Winning may be a little important, but for me the focus is on the team play,” he says. “With each other, the same goals, and that’s to compete.”"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_synthesis"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:d6ea4194-f160-4d3b-935c-571b51103843>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What techniques did early glass art use compared to Lalique's later Art Deco works?","answer":"Early glass art primarily used techniques like glass blowing from the 1st century BC, which involved blowing air into liquid glass at around 2000 degrees to create forms. In contrast, Lalique became famous in the 1920s for his Art Deco style glassworks, developing innovative techniques like creating contrast between clear and frosted glass. While early glass makers focused on functional items like jugs and jars, Lalique expanded into decorative pieces including perfume bottles, vases, jewellery, chandeliers, and even automobile hood ornaments.","context":["The Art Of Glass Making\nWhen we think about art with a capital A, we think of ancient Greek sculptures or the world’s most famous baroque paintings, but works of glass don’t immediately come to mind. However, glass art has been around for much longer than oil painting has, with the added bonus that it’s not just decorative but it can also be a functional medium!\nDifferent Types of Glass Art\nGenerally speaking, glass art is the umbrella term used for all individual works of art that are substantially or completely made of glass. There are many types of glass art and the differences between them mainly relate to the techniques that are used in the manufacturing process. These different techniques can be divided into three categories: hot glass, warm glass and cold glass. “Hot” glass works are born through a process of melting, which requires a temperature of around 2000 degrees. On the other hand, “warm” glass works can be produced by simply heating glass in an oven or kiln to manipulate its form. Glass may also be “cold worked”, changing the surface of the glass by using techniques that involve tools or chemicals.\nRoman Gladiator Cup blown in a two-part mold, ca. A.D. 50-80 (The Met)\nOne of the oldest known and most traditional techniques is glass blowing, an example of a “hot” method. Using a blow tube (or pipe), the glassblower blows air into the liquid glass, inflating it to produce a specific form and then allowing it to gradually cool down and harden. The earliest evidence of glass blowing was found in the Eastern Mediterranean and on the edges of Western Asia, formerly known as Phoenicia, stemming from the 1st century BC. It was quickly adopted by the Romans and then spread across Europe and Northern Africa. The most common form of hot working is still glass casting, which is done by pouring molten glass into a mold. Glass artists that use this technique often also work with pâte de verre, a paste that is made up of grit granules and held together by a gum. It can be applied to the inner surface of a mold to create a rich effect on the skin of the glass.\nVase Pâte de Verre\nSlumping can be seen as a typical example of the “warm” glass technique and occurs at a maximum of 1400 degrees. At this temperature, flat plates or sheets of glass will start to bend. They may be placed over a mold or left to flow freely, allowing gravity to do its work. Separate pieces of glass can also be fused together at a slightly higher temperature of 1600 degrees. And if you have ever heard of frosted glass then it wasn’t intended as a pun, it is actually a very common “cold” technique. It refers to the surface of the glass being etched away (hence why it is also referred to as etched glass), which can be done using either acid or by sandblasting the glass. Cold techniques are often combined with hot and warm techniques to add texture to the skin of casted or molded pieces. Similarly, hot and warm techniques are sometimes combined by first blowing the glass and then placing it in the oven to shape it into the desired form.\nHistorical Examples of Glass Art\nThroughout history, there have been many fine examples of glass art that were both decorative and functional. First and foremost, the Roman mastering and perfecting of the glass blowing technique coincided with the rise of the Roman empire, resulting in an enormous production of glassware. Most of the elaborately shaped jugs and jars that remain today were actually used by merchants to transport and market their goods, whereas drinking vessels such as gladiator cups were made to be sold as collectibles or souvenirs.\nThe world famous Gothic stained glass windows at Sainte-Chapelle in Paris\nStained glass windows are by far the most emblematic example of glass art in the middle ages and still remain largely intact, another testimony to great craftsmanship. Less obvious is the fact that medieval church glass was almost always hand-blown, resulting in either cylinder glass or crown glass. In both cases, a bubble of air had to be blown into a gather of molten glass, which was then either manipulated into a cylinder to be cut in half and flattened, or spun around to allow the centrifugal force to cause the bubble to open up and flatten. The varying colours were created through adding different metallic salts during the manufacturing process.\nVenetian Murano Glass Chandelier\nIn 1291 the Venetian island of Murano became the epicenter of Venetian glass production and would continue to hold a monopoly over high-quality glass making for centuries to come, something that was largely due to its innovativeness. The skillful Murano glass makers developed and refined several different techniques and crafted anything from luxury tableware to jewellery. Around 1700 Murano introduced the first glass chandeliers, heavily decorated with garlands, flowers and leaves, calling them “bouquets”. These characteristic chandeliers instantly became a huge success and are still being produced today.\nArt Nouveau and Art Deco Glass Art\nDuring the Art Nouveau and Art Deco era’s (what's the difference?), glass making once more reached new heights thanks to manufacturers such as Daum and Lalique. The Daum crystal studio in Nancy was founded in 1878 by Jean Daum and became the market leader in Art Nouveau decorative glass around the turn of the century, under the leadership of his sons Auguste and Antonin. They were known for combining several techniques to create elaborate vases and for reviving the pâte de verre technique. In 1905, the Art Nouveau jeweller René Lalique opened a shop in Paris where he also started selling his handmade perfume bottles. The craft clearly suited him, as Lalique decided to devote himself entirely to glass making by establishing a factory in Alsace in 1921. There, he developed a technique of contrast between clear and frosted glass, whilst also applying more geometric designs, eventually leading to Lalique being crowned as the master of Art Deco glassworks at the 1925 International Exposition of Modern Industrial and Decorative Arts in Paris.\nDaum Frères Art Nouveau vase and an Art Deco vase.\nContemporary Glass Art\nNowadays, the rules of glass art have become much less strict and there are several artists that are reinventing the craft in their own, authentic ways. For example, the Yugoslavian artist Jelena Popadic (1964) creates glass objects that are decorated with symmetrical patterns which refer to cell structures, using different techniques. This glass-blown Amber Granate was further shaped through applying a deep sandblasting technique to create an amazing contrast between the more matted deep reliefs and the polished and transparent protruding elements.\nJelena Popadic, Amber Granate, 2011\nOn the contrary, Susan Hammond’s (UK, 1960) glass objects are more tranquil and free flowing, yet there is something monumental about them. Inspired by nature, the emptiness in and around these glass-blown structures also interacts with the piece, leaving its muted colour tones to serve only as an accent. Lastly, Bernard Heesen’s (NL, 1958) innovational aspirations fit well into the Dutch Leerdam glassmaking tradition. Fortuity plays a big part in the expression and the form of his glass-blown products, vases and arabesques that can often be found at the crossroads of craftsmanship and industry and art and kitsch, elements of irony that Heesen likes to play with in his work.\n(Left) Susan Hammond, NT, 2017 (Right) Bernard Heesen, Aiguière, 2017\nAt Gallerease you can find an extensive online collection of antique, modern and contemporary glass art.

At the age of two, his family moved to the suburbs of Paris, but traveled to Ay for summer holidays. These trips influenced Lalique' later on in his naturalistic glasswork. With the death of his father two years later, Lalique began working as an apprentice to goldsmith Louis Aucoc in Paris. He died on 1 May 1945, Paris. René Lalique was buried in Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris, France. His granddaughter, Marie Claude-Lalique (b. 1936), was also a glass maker. She died on April 14, 2003 in Fort Myers, Florida.\nIn 1872, when he was twelve, he entered the Collège Turgot where he started drawing and sketching. He attended evening classes at the Ecole des arts décoratifs. He worked there from 1874–1876 and subsequently spent two years at the Crystal Palace School of Art Sydenham, London. During that time, he also practiced as an apprentice goldsmith to leading Parisian art nouveau jeweller and goldsmith, Louis Aucoc. At the Sydenham Art College, his skills for graphic design were improved, and his naturalistic approach to art was further developed.\nArt Nouveau jewellery designer\nWhen he returned from England, he worked as a freelance artist, designing pieces of jewellery for French jewelers Cartier, Boucheron and others. In 1885, he opened his own business and designed and made his own jewellery and other glass pieces. By 1890, Lalique was recognized as one of France's foremost Art Nouveau jewellery designers; creating innovative pieces for Samuel Bing's new Paris shop, Maison de l'Art Nouveau. He went on to be one of the most famous in his field, his name synonymous with creativity, beauty and quality.\nLalique was best known for his creations in glass art. In the 1920s, he became noted for his work in the Art Deco style. He was responsible for the walls of lighted glass and elegant coloured glass columns which filled the dining room and \"grand salon\" of the SS Normandie and the interior fittings, cross, screens, reredos and font of St. Matthew's Church at Millbrook in Jersey (Lalique's \"Glass Church\"). His earlier experiences in Ay were his defining influence in his later work. As a result, many of his jewellery pieces and vases showcase plants, flowers and flowing lines.\nBoth unique and commercial works of René Lalique are in the collections of a large number of public museums around the world including the Museu Calouste Gulbenkian in Lisbon, the Lalique museum of Hakone in Japan, the Musée Lalique and the Musée des Arts Décoratifs in France, the Schmuckmuseum Pforzheim in Germany, the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, the Metropolitan Museum and the Corning Museum in New York State,and the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam.\nCicadas, Museu Calouste Gulbenkian\nDragonfly lady brooch, Museu Calouste Gulbenkian, acquired from the artist in 1903\nNecklace designed for Lalique's second wife, Alice Ledru, ca 1897–99, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York\n- Warmus, William (2003).

A well-designed kitchen can be the centerpiece of your home, a space for family gatherings, and a place to explore your culinary passions. However, DIY kitchen renovation can quickly become a nightmare if you don’t plan properly, budget wisely, or avoid common mistakes that many people make. In this article, we will discuss the top ten kitchen renovation mistakes that you should steer clear of.\nMistake #1: Not Setting a Budget\nThe first and most crucial mistake that many people make is not setting a budget for the renovation project. Without a budget, you could quickly overspend on items that you don’t need, or cut corners on critical features. To avoid this, you should spend some time researching the costs of various kitchen renovation items such as cabinets, flooring, appliances, and countertops to create a realistic budget.\nMistake #2: Ignoring Your Kitchen’s Layout\nA common mistake when renovating a kitchen is ignoring the existing layout. While you may want to change the flow of your kitchen, some changes may not be possible due to the location of pipes, electrical outlets, or load-bearing walls. So, before you get started, take the time to study your kitchen’s layout and plan accordingly. Think about the functionality of the space and how you can improve it.\nMistake #3: Choosing Inappropriate Materials\nChoosing inappropriate materials can lead to a costly mistake. For example, choosing a material that is not durable enough can result in frequent repairs, while choosing materials that are too high-end can be a wasteful expense. Additionally, choosing the wrong design style could limit the value that your remodel could return in the future. Before you buy, research the materials, durability, and style you are interested in.\nMistake #4: Inadequate Lighting\nLighting is a key element in any kitchen renovation project. Adequate lighting makes it easier to cook, clean, and adds to the overall ambiance of your space. However, inadequate lighting can lead to a poorly lit kitchen that is neither functional nor safe at night. To avoid this mistake, consider installing a combination of natural, ambient, and task lighting in your kitchen.\nMistake #5: Overlooking Storage Space\nWhen renovating the kitchen, people often overlook the importance of storage. Cabinets and shelves are essential in the kitchen as they help keep the space organized and clutter-free. However, it is easy to overdo it with too many cabinets that make the kitchen feel cramped or too few that don’t meet the storage needs of your family. Therefore, you should carefully plan your storage needs, considering the size of your appliances and how to make the best use of every inch of your kitchen space.\nMistake #6: Not Hiring a Professional\nSometimes, the urge to DIY your kitchen renovation project can get overwhelming. While DIY can be a budget-friendly option, it can also lead to costly mistakes that could have been avoided by seeking professional help. A licensed builder or designer could help you avoid the mistakes mentioned above and provide valuable insights into the renovation process.\nMistake #7: Ignoring the Importance of Appliances\nAppliances are an essential part of the kitchen and can make or break your renovation project. To avoid this mistake, research the appliances that will meet your needs, both functionally and aesthetically.\nMistake #8: Choosing the Wrong Contractor\nHiring the wrong contractor ( Ultimate Guide to Finding Trustworthy Kitchen Contractors ) can be a costly mistake. Low-cost bids can be tempting, but they could mean a less experienced contractor that cuts corners or uses lower quality materials. Therefore, it is essential to do your research and choose a reputable contractor with experience in kitchen renovation.\nMistake #9: Skimping on the Finishing Details\nThe finishing details in your kitchen renovation project are often the details that make the biggest impression. Skimping on the finishing details such as cabinet ( Revolutionize Your Kitchen with Genius Cabinet and Drawer Space Maximization Tips ) knobs and handles, backsplash, and paint or wallpaper could have a detrimental effect on the overall aesthetic.\nMistake #10: Not Considering Functionality\nWhile the kitchen’s aesthetics are important, functionality should be a significant consideration. After all, the kitchen is where you prepare and cook your meals. Consider the positioning of the stove, sink, and refrigerator to ensure convenience while cooking and workflow.\nBy avoiding the ten kitchen renovation mistakes listed above, you can save yourself time, money, and headaches during the renovation process. Take your time, plan carefully, and choose quality materials and professional contractors to ensure that your kitchen renovation project is a success. The result will be a beautiful, functional kitchen that you can enjoy for many years to come.\nFAQ: Common DIY Kitchen Renovation Mistakes\nWhat are some common DIY kitchen renovation mistakes?\nSome common DIY kitchen renovation mistakes include underestimating the budget, not planning the layout properly, skipping important steps like measuring and leveling, not hiring professionals when necessary, and choosing cheaper materials over quality ones.\nWhy is underestimating the budget a mistake?\nUnderestimating the budget can lead to running out of funds before the renovation is complete, compromising on important features, or using lower quality materials.

The majority of electrical fires are a result of old wiring and faulty outlets. Damage to appliance cables and extension cords and plugs can also lead to electrical fires in the home. To help prevent electrical fires in your home, it’s important to check your electrical appliances and wiring on a routine basis. Use the following information and tips to learn more about electrical fires, hidden hazards, statistics, circuit interrupters, and safety tips.\nFacts and Figures\n- More than 15 million appliances have been recalled in the last five years for defects that could result in a fire, including 1,942 incidents reported.\n- According to data analyzed by the National Fire Incident Reporting System (NFIRS), more than 69,000 fires were reported from 2002 to 2009 associated with appliances.\n- Residential appliance fires result in an estimated 9,600 fires, 525 injuries, 25 deaths, and $211 million in property loss annually.\n- Nationwide, there is a home fire death an average of every three hours.\n- According to the National Fire Protection Association, fire statistics data reported that 85 percent of fire deaths occurred in the home in 2009.\n- Each year fires started in electrical systems or lighting equipment result in damage to more than 24,000 homes and cause 830 civilian injuries and 320 civilian deaths.\nHidden Electrical Hazards\nExamples of unsafe home conditions that can lead to fire include:\n- Damaged extension cords, electrical conductors or plug wires\n- Short or overloaded circuits\n- Use of modified, unapproved or faulty electrical equipment\n- Insufficient clearance between combustibles and electrical heating equipment\n- Loose electrical connections\n- Running power cables through walls to a wall-mounted TV. This problem is quickly remedied with a recessed power outlet. Learn how to hide your TV cables safely.\nWarning signs of electrical dangers include:\n- Reoccurring or frequent issues associated with blowing fuses in appliances or tripping circuit breakers\n- Tingling sensation as you touch an electrical appliance\n- Sparks coming from an outlet or discolored or warm wall outlets\n- A continuous burning smell from a room or appliance\n- Lights that frequently flicker or dim\nElectrical Circuit Interrupters\nElectrical circuit interrupters protect against fires by monitoring electrical current. These devices respond to overloads and short circuits, such as with circuit breakers. Electrical circuit interrupters help to save lives and make homes safer by eliminating a significant source of electrical-related fires. When an electrical switch is opened or closed, a discharge of electricity occurs across the circuit, known as arcs. When arcs are unintentional, such as when wires or cords are loose or damaged, sparking can result in possible igniting of combustibles. These devices do not interfere with smoke alarms and other appliances and do not affect power supply reliability.\nWhen you run cable through any building you first need to consider plenum spaces. Plenum spaces are the open spaces above the ceiling or below the floor that are used for air circulation. Technically, any ductwork is considered a plenum space too. These spaces are important for air circulation in any building, but they also bring some problems if you ever have a fire because of the high oxygen content and lack of fire barriers. Using untreated cables in plenum spaces can spread the fire to other areas very quickly and spread noxious smoke throughout the building. Plenum cables are coated with flame retardant and made using special plastics that don’t smoke nearly as much as other plastics to help prevent this problem. Any cable that you run through plenum spaces must be plenum rated, even wiring used for information transfer, like Cat5 wiring.\nThe problem with plenum cables is that they are often more expensive, which is why people can become tempted to cut corners and use non-treated cables. An easy and far less risky solution is to use unterminated bulk cable and terminate it yourself. This process is fairly straightforward with most types of wiring, but Cat5 wiring can be a bit more complicated. To help you out we’ve made a Cat5 wiring diagram that shows you what you need to do.\n- Consider having the wiring inspected in your home if you live in a house that is over ten years old. If the house is over forty years old, an inspection should be immediate.\n- Always follow the usage instructions on all appliances.\n- Fix electrical or appliance problems right away. Use caution if fuses blow often, switches become hot or cause shocks, or circuit breakers trip often.\n- Never place electrical cords under bedding or rugs. Sparks or heat from the wiring can cause a fire.\n- Check labels on lighting fixtures and lamps to ensure you are using the right size bulbs. Check the label on the fuse box to ensure you are using the right size fuses.\n- Always cover unused electrical outlets with plastic plugs.\n- If a cable or cord has three-prongs, always use it properly. Do not remove the extra prong as the appliance must be grounded to reduce the risk of electrical shocks.\n- Do not overhaul electrical outlets. Extension cords should not be used as permanent cords in homes.\n- Routinely check your electrical appliances, electronics and wiring for signs of damage.\n- Replace all damaged, old, or worn appliance cords immediately and do not use appliances with frayed wiring.\n- Keep electrical appliances away from wet counters and floors. Be cautious when using electrical appliances in the kitchen and bathroom.\n- Do not allow children to play with or around electronics or electrical appliances, including hair dryers, space heaters, and irons.\n- Keep curtains, clothes, and other combustible items at least three feet away from heaters.\n- Some electrical appliances are designed to be left “ON” all the time. Check the manufacturer directions if you are unsure.\n- Learn the wiring colors and be sure to follow all instructions given by the manufacturer when fitting a plug.\n- Use proper rated cable, such as plenum HDMI, plenum Cat5e, and plenum siamese cable.\n- U.S. Fire Administration: Fact sheet from the U.S. Fire Administration on home electrical fire prevention.\n- Electrical Appliance Fire Safety: Learn what to check for on your electrical appliances to prevent fires.\n- Home Fire Statistics: Facts and figures associated with home fire statistics, including information on civilian home fires and fire-related deaths.\n- Electrical Safety Foundation International: Series of articles relating to fires caused by electronics and appliances.\n- Microwave Ovens Safety Issues: Learn about the common dangers associated with microwave ovens and how to use them safely.\n- Building and Fire Safety: Tips on how to identify electrical safety problems with this electrical safety check list.\n- The Danger of Electrical Shock: Information on how to stay safe from electrical shocks, injury, and death.\n- Kitchen Fire Prevention: Tips on how to prevent kitchen fires from fireproofing dangerous electrical appliances.\n- Electrical Safety: List of electrical hazards that can lead to shocks, burns, fire, or electrocution.\n- Plug into Electrical Safety: Information on fire-related accidents that can be prevented by taking a few electrical safety precautions.\n- Electrical and Fire Safety: Fact sheet on how to prevent fires and burns from electrical appliances.\n- Electrical Fire Safety: Tips for preventing electrical fires in the winter seasons in the home and workplace.\n- Fire Safety Tips: List of important fire safety tips to use in your own home to keep your family safe."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"format_constrained"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:6cf8c9ed-3d0a-43ca-8f62-04e833225c40>","<urn:uuid:37293d77-7439-4009-a43f-ad96782b95d1>"],"error":null}
{"question":"As an electrician trainee, I'm interested in understanding how to properly install electrical moldings and what code violations to avoid. What are the proper steps for installing electrical moldings, and what are the common wiring-related code violations to watch out for?","answer":"The proper installation of electrical moldings involves 7 key steps: 1) Prepare by starting from the switchboard and establishing routes according to NF C 15-100 standard, 2) Make precise cuts using a backsaw or framing saw, 3) Attach moldings using adhesive bonding on degreased surfaces, 4) Place base plates for switches and outlets, 5) Pull cables using correct wire cross-sections and standard colors, 6) Connect devices following proper wiring guidelines, and 7) Make final finishes and checks. Regarding code violations to avoid: never cram more than three wires through a 7/8-inch hole to prevent wire burning, ensure new lights aren't installed directly onto pre-1987 wiring without proper splicing, avoid using old knob and tube wiring as it's dangerous and ungrounded, maintain proper spacing between non-IC-rated recessed lights and insulation, and never make wire splices outside of junction boxes.","context":["This post is a continuation from Part 1 on How Do You Install Electrical Molding. Lately, we have gone through the choice of material.\nWe will now cover:\nStep 1: Prepare for installation\nStep 2: Make the cuts\nStep 3: Attach the electrical moldings\nStep 4: Place the pedestals\nStep 5: Pull the cables\nStep 6: Connect the devices\nStep 7: Make the finishes\nStep 1. Prepare for installation\n– Start at the right place\nIf you are installing a new power line:\n– Perform the installation from the switchboard.\n– Protect it with a circuit breaker of:\n– 16 A if it is a lighting circuit or sockets wired in 1.5 mm²;\n– 20 A in 2.5 mm².\nIn the case of an extension: transpose your installation to a junction box.\nGood to know: it is possible to start again from a socket to complete the same circuit, as long as the regulatory number of connection points is not exceeded: five for 1.5 mm2 wirings, eight for 2.5 mm2 wirings.\nEstablish the route\nYour electrical moldings can run vertically, horizontally (walls and ceiling), but never at an angle. Make sure they are as discreet as possible.\nLocate branches, switches, and outlets\nAccording to the NF C 15-100 standard, switches should be placed at a height of between 80 and 130 cm.\nFor conventional 16 or 20 A sockets, the axis of the cells (holes) must be at least 5 cm from the finished ground level.\n– Draw the location of the moldings that will house your cables.\nCaution: before working on your electrical installation, turn off the power!\nStep 2. Make the cuts\n– Measure the lengths of the molding or baseboard to be installed.\n– Leave the covers in place to make the necessary cuts.\n– Make the cut with a backsaw, preferably in a miter box, or with a framing saw.\n– Make the corner joints either directly at 45° or with straight cuts and with suitable fittings, either inward or outward. Connections are also provided for butt joints.\n– Take the precaution of deburring the cuts with a soft file or cutter and remove dust.\nStep 3. Attach the electrical moldings\nAdhesive bonding is the simplest and fastest method on a smooth surface.\n– Degrease the PVC, with methylated spirits for example, before gluing it.\n– After unclipping the cover, apply a bead of adhesive sealant in a zigzag pattern to the reverse side of the molding using the cartridge gun.\n– Apply the molding to the wall and press down firmly for the time indicated on the glue sealant cartridge, usually 20 to 30 seconds.\n– If necessary, reinforce the nail fastening at different points.\n– Take advantage of this opportunity to place clips to hold the electrical wires at the same time.\nNote: Use nails that are suitable for the material: made of hardened steel for concrete, twisted for a better hold in soft materials such as plaster.\nStep 4. Place the base plates\n– Clip the switch and outlet sockets to the desired locations.\n– Use a pencil to mark the fixing points through the holes in the bottom.\n– Remove the base to drill and anchor the wall.\n– Replace the base and screw it in place.\nStep 5. Pull the cables\n– Strip the ends of the conductors using the stripping pliers and connect them to your starting point: switchboard circuit breaker or junction box.\n– Use the correct wire cross-sections (or conductors) and observe the standard colors: phase in red or black, neutral in blue, earth in yellow/green stripes.\nThe wiring into a junction box can be done with dominoes or quick-connect strips.\nTip: if you are making several circuits (lighting, sockets, etc.), mark them by wrapping the corresponding wires with adhesive tapes of different colors.\nThen unroll your wiring by holding it with clips every 30 to 40 cm.\nDepending on the size of your installation and the model of molding, run the wires in the same compartment or unbundle them.\nDo not hesitate to multiply the clips to keep the wires inside the moldings. If they stick out a little bit everywhere, you will have trouble making changes in direction (outgoing or incoming angles, branches) and clipping the covers.\nGood to know: the NF C 15-100 standard recommends separating high currents (230 V power supply circuits) from low currents (low-voltage lighting, computers, telephone, TV…). They can run in the same molding but in separate compartments.\nStep 6. Connect the devices\nBefore you make your connections, you should know that:\n– Power outlets are powered by three conductors: neutral, phase, and ground.\n– Purple wire is commonly used for the shuttle, which is easy to distinguish from the others.\n– Switches do not connect to the ground. The number of wires required depends on the type of connection: two for single lighting, three for a shuttle, etc.\nTo make your connections:\n– Strip the ends of the conductors using the stripping pliers, over a length of 5 to 6 mm.\n– Connect the mechanisms of the devices by screwing the wires into the corresponding terminals with the screwdriver:\nOften L (line) for phase, N for neutral.\nThe ground wire of the sockets is connected to a central terminal marked with an international symbol.\nOn modern switches, the terminals reserved for the shuttles are generally identified by the numbers 1 and 2.\nStep 7. Make the finishes\n– Check that your connections are secure.\n– Finish assembling the equipment: covers, plugs, switches.\n– On the switches, the knob last fits on the mechanism.\n– On sockets, by convention, the ground pin of the sockets is placed over the holes (but if you do the opposite, it will still work).\nNote: To ensure a perfect joint, the molding covers should be retracted about 10 mm under the switch and socket covers.\nThank you for staying posted on our new blog posts.

It may be that your electrical system is outdated or perhaps you tried your hand at an electrical project yourself. When violations do occur, your home and family are at risk.\nBelow, you will find some of the more common electrical code violations that occur and why it is so important to have a professional, licensed electrician complete such projects in your home.\nCramming too many wires into a 7/8-inch hole\nIt’s a common temptation to shove four or five wires into a 7/8-inch hole. However, overcrowding of the wires can cause “burning.” This is wire damaged caused when another wire tears the insulation off when it’s dragged across it. It’s easy for burned wires to go undetected, which will increase your risk of fire because of exposed conductors.\nViolation correction: There should never be more than three wires that go through the same 7/8-inch hole. That way, there is enough room for the wires to move around without burning. An electrician should cut away any damaged wire, put in a junction box and replace the wiring to the outlet or fixture.\nInstalling new lights onto old wiring\nAnother common electrical violation is to install a new light fixture onto old wiring. Many of today’s light fixtures operate at a hotter temperature. For example, a light purchased today is supposed to be used with wires designed to withstand 90 degrees Celsius. The older wires were only designed to withstand 60 degrees Celsius.\nViolation correction: A new splice box should be installed if your home still has wiring installed prior to 1987. A new light should have three feet of new wiring at a minimum if it is to be connected to old wiring. The insulation jacket on the wiring will tell you when it was manufactured – as long as it was after 1987. If you don’t see a date, then it was manufactured before 1987.\nOld knob and tube wiring\nKnob and tube wiring in the late 1800s and early 1900s was considered to be state-of the-art technology. Today, however, it’s considered extremely dangerous. The reasons for this are that the circuits don’t support the higher amperage needed today, the wires are not grounded and the insulation used back then disintegrates after a while. If your home has knob and tube wiring, it’s possible that your insurance company won’t issue a policy on your home.\nViolation correction: If your home was built pre-1950, and its wiring was never updated, you should have a licensed electrician inspect your home. If knob and tube wiring is found, the home should be completely rewired. This may seem like an expensive task, but it’s really not considering your family’s safety is at risk.\nRecessed lights that touch insulation\nIf your home has recessed lights, then they must be IC-rated if they are in contact with insulation in the attic. If those lights are not IC-rated, there must be a space of three inches between the insulation and the light. If a recessed light is used that is not IC-rated and it touches the insulation, the light can quit operating because of overheating. The thermal protectors can eventually fail over time and could allow the light to remain on even with the extremely high heat. This can cause the insulation to catch fire.\nViolation correction: The attic insulation should be checked to make sure that any non-IC-rated lights are not in contact with recessed lights or those lights should be replaced with the correct IC-rated lights.\nThis is one of the worst code violations. A connection between two or more wires is a splice. It is illegal to use splices and they are dangerous if they aren’t put inside a junction box.\nViolation correction: The only time a splice should be used is for circuit troubleshooting or temporary lighting. If the splice is necessary, then an electrician should install a junction box, put the wires into the box, and complete the splice using wire nuts. Then a cover plate is installed over the box.\nIf you’re worried about electrical code violations in your home, our team is here to help.

{"question":"How do contemporary Chinese religious practices combine historical traditions with modern accessibility, particularly in terms of documentation and public engagement?","answer":"Contemporary Chinese religious practices maintain traditional elements while adapting to modern accessibility. The Chinese Religious Text Authority (CRTA) database, accessible at crta.info, collects and presents bibliographic information about religious texts produced before 1949, making historical religious documents available to researchers and the public. Meanwhile, in Taiwan, traditional practices remain actively accessible, with temples providing moon blocks for public use and maintaining traditional divination rituals that anyone can participate in, where people can seek divine guidance on both mundane and solemn matters.","context":["Student Reflection on the 2021 Spirit-Writing and the Study of Spirit-Written Literature in Early Modern and Modern China Workshop\nUniversity of Colorado Boulder\nOctober 27, 2021\nThe “Spirit-Writing and the Study of Spirit-Written Literature in Early Modern and Modern China” was a four-session online workshop as a part of the Frogbear Summer 2021 Training Sessions. The workshop was held separately on June 1, June 3, June 8, and June 10, 2021. Six professors, Barend ter Haar (University of Hamburg), Philip Clart (Leipzig University), Katherine Alexander (University of Colorado Boulder), Marcus Bingenheimer (Temple University), Gregory Scott (The University of Manchester), and Vincent Goossaert (École Pratique des Hautes Études), shared their knowledge and research on the history of spirit-writing techniques, the range of spirit-written literature, and some collaborative tools to locate and study this literature.\nTop row: Vincent Goossaert (École Pratique des Hautes Études) and Philip Clart (Leipzig University).

Before the session, we were assigned some readings and videos as preparation, which had already provided us with a taste of some modern spirit-writing practices and his research method. During his talk, Professor Clart introduced the implements people used in the rituals, types of halls where the rituals take place, how the rituals are executed, and the objectives and functions of certain halls, among other things. All of these largely expanded our understanding of a living practice of spirit-writing in Taiwan today.\nSpirit-writing ritual practices and publications in Taiwan.

Republished with permission.\nOn June 3, Professor Barend ter Haar (University of Hamburg) shared his reading on a specific text and some of its paratexts, Guan sheng di jun gan ying ming sheng jing zhu jie 關聖帝君感應明聖經註解. He first generally introduced the content of the scripture and its paratexts, such as the benefits of recitation of the text, Guan Di’s various tasks (such as overseeing morality), and its anti-Buddhist point of view. After that, Professor ter Haar stressed the significance of its prefaces as paratexts: prefaces will provide authority by virtue of their authors and the calligraphy of these authors. With a detailed reading of the prefaces, he presented his insightful analysis on the quality of the language, where and when the texts were produced, and the purpose of the prefaces. For the rest of this session, Professor Goossaert showed us a website where we can find information on those spirit-writing texts, which was also the main subject of the following two sessions, the Chinese Religious Text Authority (CRTA): https://crta.info/wiki/Main_Page. The session ended with an introduction to the collections and exemplary entries listed on the website, which are about Daoism, popular religions/sectarian traditions, and morality books.\nGuan sheng di jun gan ying ming sheng jing zhu jie 關聖帝君感應明聖經註解.

Republished with permission.\nThe third session on June 8 was an extensive introduction to the CRTA database given by Professors Katherine Alexander (University of Colorado Boulder), Vincent Goossaert (École Pratique des Hautes Études), and Gregory Scott (The University of Manchester). They discussed the purpose and mission of the CRTA, then showed us how we can use and contribute to it as researchers ourselves. We learned that the CRTA is a project that seeks to collect and present reliable bibliographic and scholarly information about religious texts in Chinese produced prior to 1949. It can be a starting point for scholars to discover basic information about certain texts. It is also a collaborative source, which means everyone can create and edit entries. We then learned about what the website looks like, what an entry looks like, and the type of information it includes, such as associated persons, publishers, publication dates, the main content, et cetera. Lastly, Professor Marcus Bingenheimer (Temple University) led us through the technical procedure, which was a little intimidating at first sight, especially for students in the humanities.\nHowever, when it came to creating an entry by ourselves during the fourth session on June 10, it was actually not as impossible as it seemed. During this session, we had a hands-on training in editing CRTA entries under the guidance of all the professors. We were assigned to several breakout rooms and guided by a professor to create our own entries about a Chinese religious text.\nCRTA website and a religious text entry.

Republished with permission.\nTo sum up, for those of us who are interested in Chinese culture, religion, and even literature, the workshop not only familiarized us with some spirit written texts and the practices of spirit writing, but also provided us with the ability to use and contribute to the CRTA database, a promising website of religious texts which will become increasingly useful during our own research in the future.\nHuizhi Wang is currently an MA student at the University of Colorado Boulder. Her research interest is mainly in medieval Chinese literature and culture, especially the interaction between literature and Buddhism.","Moon Blocks: What Are Taiwanese Casting In Temples?\nIf you have been to or are now in Taiwan, and you ask a local to recommend you some must-gos, chances you are urged to visit a local temple. If you complied to it, (or you just ended up visiting a temple for some other reason,) you might have seen locals in midst of a personal ritual, casting red wooden blocks in the air, letting them land on the ground with a big “clink!”, and checking out the results.\nThose crescent-shaped red blocks are most commonly called moon blocks, but they also come in the names divination blocks or Jiaobei. The mini ritual of casting the moon blocks itself is called Bwa Bwei in Taiwanese.\nWhat are moon blocks for?\nThey are used by Taoist as a form of divination, or talking to the gods. People most often cast them to get straightforward yes-or-no answers, such as “Will I meet my Prince Charming this year?”(yes, it can be as random as that.) But they are also used on more solemn occasions, for example asking if the soul of a passed away relative has come to the funeral site. They are not only performed in temples, but also in homes. If there are no moon blocks present, coins can be used instead. Personally, We even know a friend who will Bwa Bwei in his dorm room, seeking guidance from a so-called “God of the Dorm” he believes exists.\nHow do you cast moon blocks?\nPlenty pairs of moon blocks are provided at pretty much any temple. First of all, find yourself one of those. They are crescent shape of woods, plastic, or bamboo, and they come in a pair. Circle them on the top of the urn one or three times (can not be even number). Stand in front of the deity and briefly introduce yourself. People typically tell the deity their name, age, birthday, and address. Now you can ask a yes-or-no question, and toss them to the ground. To be really strict to the ritual, put your left foot and hand in the front to show respect. Watch how they land.\nWhat do they mean?\nThere are two sides to the block, one rounded side and one flat side. If the blocks both landed rounded-side up, it’s an “angry answer”. It means “no” or that the deity is angry. If the blocks both landed flat-side up, it’s a “laughing answer”. But it doesn’t mean a “yes”. It might symbols that the deity finds the question funny, the answer is obvious, or that the referent should know the answer.\nWhen casted a laughing answer, most parents will teach their children to cast again anyway. If the blocks landed one side up and one side down, then it’s a “divine answer”. This means “yes”! There is another rare occasion when one of the blocks might stand erect on the floor and falls on neither side. This symbols the deity does not understand your question, you should present it more clearly and cast again.\nAnything else I need to know?\nIf you’ll like to draw a fortune stick, you also need to cast moon blocks afterward to confirm if this fortune stick is the one for you. Even if the questions can be pretty random and mundane, Taiwanese people treat this process rather seriously. Please do not interrupt them in midst of the ritual. There are so much going on in a temple it’s hard to explain all of them in a single article. Casting moon blocks is only one of them. If you’ll like to visit a temple, make sure to have someone show you the wondrous customs people obey and explain to you the architecture and historical significance of the temple!"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:6d8ee350-6db6-48f8-9d9e-69493d3ad62c>","<urn:uuid:b13c4a18-07ba-4aea-81de-2299aca02291>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How has the evolution of logo designs historically reflected minimalism, and what are the key benefits of minimalistic approaches in modern graphic design?","answer":"Logo designs have evolved towards greater simplicity over time. Originally starting with complex designs in the 13th century by goldsmiths and potters, logos have progressively become simpler and more eye-catching. For example, companies like Apple went from a detailed illustration to a simple monochrome apple shape, while Shell simplified its pectin design over decades. Most modern logos are intentionally simple and easily identifiable from a distance. This evolution aligns with the benefits of minimalistic design, which include creating clear and concise messages, reducing distractions, increasing focus and attention, and establishing visual hierarchy. Minimalism in design helps make complex information more digestible and creates a sense of order and calm through the use of limited color palettes, simple shapes, and strategic use of white space.","context":["Logos have been in use from the time of the early Greek dynasties. It has been found that they have used logos on their coins. However, when one goes in search of the day the modern type of logos were designed for the first time, he will trace it back to the 13th century. It was the Goldsmiths, potters and those who made paper who have the honor of creating the first logo designs. From then onwards, logos improved with new designs and today they are better known than the companies and the products they represent.\nThere is hardly any logo that is being used with its original design. Most of the good logo designs have had very basic designs. If you go into details of how some of the best known logos today have been developed you will find that some of them have been added with improvements for a couple of generations. While the products improved in quality their logos also have improved with their appearance as well as their simplicity. Most of the logo designs of modern times are simple and eye catching.\nIn case you are going to design and manufacture a product it must be remembered that a good logo is a must for your products or the company that is going to produce it. People will not bother to read names printed on products but they will look at the logo and will come to know the brand of the product. It is also a good idea to find how some of the modern logo designs have been developed. The following are going to be some important details about them for you to read. These logos belong to well known brands of products and services offered by world renowned companies. With some of them the product and the company are identified with the same logo.\nWhen Apple inc. started its operations in 1976, its logo was designed by Ron Wayne, one of the founders of the company. But in 1977 the logo was changed to a simpler apple logo with rainbow colors. Later in 1997 it was converted to a monochrome logo. Today it has a still simpler white one.\nShell is a company that started its operations in early 1900s and its logo was a simple pectin in black and white. It was improved in 1904, 1909 and 1930 but its color was added only in 1948. The word “SHELL” also got incorporated. Even afterwards it was subjected to many changes before the present day version was established.\nPepsiCo is the company that manufactures and distributes this product. Its logo was designed at the same time the world famous drink was produced first in 1898 and it was a scribbled one. It was improved in 1905 and again modified in 1906. After undergoing changes in 1943, 1962, 1973 and 1991 the present logo design was created in 1998, then further modified recently few years back.\n4- Coca Cola\nThe first Coca Cola was served in 1886 but it didn’t have a script logo. However, in 1887 a script logo was designed. This was improved adding various new features up to date until we have started seeing the simple logo available today.\nIt was Carolyn Davidson who created the Nike logo in 1971. It changed 1978 and 1985 to bring in today’s logo design. Phil Knight didn’t like this logo but he kept it and it became a well known logo later.\nCanon logo was developed from a logo designed for the optical company established in 1933. It was first known as Kwanon, the name of a goddess but to make it acceptable to the entire world it was changed to Canon in 1935. The present logo evolved from that in 1956.\nIBM started as a company that produced tabulating machines. Its first logo was based on its name of Computing Recording Machine Corporation. Company changed its name in 1924 and the new logo carried the first letters of its name International Business Machines. Later it went through several changes and the present logo was adopted in 1972\nWal-Mart is one of the logo designs that have been subjected to least amount of changes. The logo was first used when the company was founded in 1962 and the present logo was designed in 2008.\nThough the company was established in 1865 it got the name of Nokia only in 1871. Logo developed in 1871 went through some drastic changes until the present logo was adopted in 1998. It has both the company’s name as well as their slogan.\nLogo of the playboy magazine has changed only once and that was also at the very beginning of the company in 1953. The present day logo of a rabbit was also developed in the same year.\nThe first Espresso café opened was named Il Gionarle and it had a logo of its own. Later Howard Shultz who owned it bought Starbucks and there was a logo for Starbucks as well. Shultz combined the two logos and created a new logo in 1987. It was modified in 1992 to bring up the present logo.\nDesigned at the company’s inception in 1998 Google’s logo has seen slight changes in1998 and 1999. The 1999 edition is the one you see today.\nThe first logo had the two words of “Federal Express” but later the company name was changed to FedEx and also the logo.\nAudi logo carried the four logos of car four brands in its first logo. That was in 1932. The present day logo is only four circles integrated together to form its logo.\nMicrosoft logo was created in 1975 and it has undergone a change in 1987. The present day logo has been developed in1994.\nLogo of the World Wildlife Fund has gone through only a little change after it was designed and used in 1961. Those changes have taken place in 1978 and in 1986.\nVolkswagen logo designs changed four times as that has been first developed in 1939 and it has been changed a bit before the Second World War. After the Second World War it has been changed again and the one you see today has been developed in the year 2000.\nAdobe logo designs did not bring many changes but it has only been changed once. The present day one is a bit simpler than the original one.\nFirefox logo designs passed through changes too. First was done in 2002 and it has changed in entirety in 2003.This is the logo in existence even today.\nBMW is also one of the logo designs that have changed only a bit for over 75 years. In 70s and 80s, it has had a more colorful logo but they have reverted to the simpler design in 2000 and that exists up to date.\n21- Mercedes Benz Logo Designs\nMercedes Benz logo has been designed in 1902. Then came the three prong star and those three prongs are still there. However, it is one of the logo designs that have undergone many changes during its stay but finally it has become one of the simplest and best known logos.\nWhen you look at these logo designs you understand that companies have given special care to keep their logos attractive and up to date. Often, they carry some details related to the company or the product. For instance, the three letters found in the logo of IBM means International Business Machines which is the company for which the logo stands.\nImportance of a good logo designs is that even if people forget the name of the company they will remember the logo as it has a visual impact. When they go to store to buy products customers will not bother to read the details of the manufacturers but when they see the logo they come to know what company produces the product. If they have placed some trust with the company for which the logo stands they will not think twice before purchasing the product.\nMost companies make logo designs but believe in simple logos. They are easy to identify from a distance. Therefore, customers are able to pick up the products of a company that has a logo well known to them. Even when it comes to colors most logos carry one or two colors to make them colorful without losing simplicity associated with their logo designs.\nEven the artists who develop logos prefer simple logo designs. This means they are also aware of the requirements of logos though they are not marketing people who know how customers react to product names and logos. All in all, it is interesting to know the history of logo designs and how they have improved over the years.","What is minimalism in graphic design?\nMinimalism in graphic design is a style that uses simple design elements and minimal colors to create a graphics that are easy to understand and visually appealing. This style is often used for web design but can also be used for various other applications, including logos, infographics, and even business cards.\nMinimalism had the greatest impact on the art and design world. The internet, user interfaces, video games, and movies have all been influenced by it. So why isn’t it more popular?\nSince minimalism is more of a principle than an esthetic style, the answer is simple. By limiting themselves to the most important elements, such as basic shapes and limited color schemes, minimalist designers create simple and memorable works.\n5 benefits of minimal design\n1. Helps to create a clear and concise message.\nClean and concise messages are essential in graphic design, especially with limited space. Minimalism helps to simplify a message and make it more easily understood.\n2. It makes a design more visually appealing.\nMinimalist designs are often more visually appealing than busy and cluttered designs. This is because they are more balanced and symmetrical and use negative space in the best possible way.\n3. Reduces distractions and clutter.\nToo much clutter in a design distracts and makes it difficult to focus on the key message. Minimalism can help to reduce distractions and make a design more focused.\n4. Increases focus and attention.\nBecause minimalism reduces distractions and clutter, it helps to increase focus and attention. This is especially important in designs where the message must be clear and concise.\n5. Can create a more modern look and feel.\nMinimalist designs often have a more modern look and feel than busy and cluttered designs. This is because they are more simplistic and clean. You can also do this with the use of stock photos.\n6. Establish a visual hierarchy\nThere are a few ways to establish a hierarchy in graphic design. The most important elements should be the largest, the least important elements should be the smallest, and use color to make things pop.\nFor example, use bright colors for the most important elements and more subdued colors for the less important elements. Contrast also makes key elements stand out, so use light colors on dark backgrounds or vice versa. Finally, use position to draw attention by placing the key elements in the center or at the top of the design.\n5 benefits of minimalism in graphic design\n1. Makes complex information more digestible.\nMaking complex information more digestible is one of the most important benefits of minimalism in graphic design. When presented with a lot of information, our brains tend to shut down and tune out. By reducing the amount of information on a page, designers make it more accessible and understandable.\n2. Creates a sense of order and calm.\nCreating a sense of order and calm is another benefit of minimalism in graphic design. A clean and uncluttered design can be a breath of fresh air in a world that is bombarding us with information and distractions.\n3. Focuses the viewer’s attention on the essentials.\nOne benefit of minimalism in graphic design is that it simplifies and clarifies the message by focusing the viewer’s attention on the essential. In a world where we are bombarded with messages, it is crucial to communicate clearly and concisely.\n4. Lends itself to elegant design solutions.\nAnother benefit of minimalism in graphic design projects is that it leads to elegant design solutions. By stripping away the unnecessary, designers can create simple yet beautiful designs.\n5. Works well with traditional and modern aesthetics.\nMinimalism is a versatile tool that is used in a variety of graphic design styles. While it is often associated with modern design, you can also use it in more traditional techniques. Using minimalism as a starting point, designers can create unique and stylish designs.\nHow to Achieve a Minimalist Style in Graphic Design?\nThe purpose of a minimalist design is to create clean, uncluttered designs that focus on the essentials. This means using a limited color palette, simple shapes, few typefaces, minimal text, and making use of white space. The goal is to create designs that are free of distractions and easy to understand.\nIn its simplest form, minimalist design is about stripping a design down to its core essentials. This can be done with both function and aesthetics in mind.\nThe purpose of minimalist design is to create a clean and uncluttered look that is still appealing to the human eye. This type of design is often used in modern and contemporary settings.\n1. Fewer colors\nWhen it comes to colors, less is more in minimalism. A limited color palette will help create a consistent look for your minimalist design. Limit yourself to a maximum of two or three colors and ensure they complement each other well.\nOne way to create a unified look with your limited color scheme is to use similar hues or values for each color. This creates a cohesive and appealing design. Another way to use colors in a minimalist design is to use a single color throughout the design with different hues and shades. This creates an eye-catching and unique look.\n2. Simple shapes\nWhen using simple shapes in your designs, try to use a variety of shapes and sizes to create interest and visual appeal. Use different stroke widths to create depth and dimension, and experiment with different colors to create contrast. Remember that less is more in minimalism, so don’t be afraid to use negative space to your advantage.\n3. Minimalistic and few typefaces\nIn addition to using a limited color palette, another way to create a minimalist design is to use fewer typefaces. Stick to one or two typefaces throughout your design and use them sparingly. Use simple fonts that are easy to read and avoid using excessive amounts of text. When in doubt, less is more.\nWhich fonts are the best for minimalism?\nThere is no definitive answer to this question, as many great typefaces are used for minimalistic graphic design. However, some popular choices include Helvetica, Arial, and Futura.\n4. Minimal text\nSome essential tips for using text in a minimalistic graphic design include choosing a simple typeface, using short phrases or single words, and ensuring the text is easy to read. Avoid using multiple typefaces or adding decorative elements to your text—keep it clean and straightforward. Additionally, you use white space to your advantage by ensuring your text is well-spaced and not overcrowded.\n5. Use white space to your advantage\nWhite space (= negative space) is an important visual element of graphic design. It’s used to create a sense of balance and visual stability. It also draws attention to certain elements of a design or invokes spaciousness. White space makes a design look clean and uncluttered when used with precision and thought.\n6. Keep your designs clean and uncluttered.\nTo keep designs clean and uncluttered means to keep them free of unnecessary and distracting elements. This allows the viewer to focus on the important aspects of the design and makes the overall design more aesthetically pleasing.\nHow to use photos in minimalistic graphic designs\n- Start with a blank canvas or background.\n- Choose a photo you would like to use as your minimalistic graphic design.\n- Using photo editing software, such as Adobe Photoshop, begin by removing any unnecessary elements from the photo. This may include removing people, objects, or scenery that would distract from the overall design.\n- Next, focus on simplifying the colors and tones within the photo. This is done by desaturating the colors or converting the image to black and white.\n- Finally, add any text or other graphic elements that you feel would complement the photo. Be sure to keep the overall design clean.\nHow to select a photo for a minimalistic graphic design\nWhen searching for the photos to use in a minimalistic design, pay attention to the following characteristics:\n- Choose a photo that has a simple composition with a few subjects. A simple composition means the basic rule of thirds or symmetry, which will help the viewer focus on the main subject.\n- Avoid photos with busy backgrounds or distractions. Ideally, your photo would have a one-color background or a gradient. Find a photo with a desaturated background.\n- Select a photo with clean lines and minimal details. This means no intricate textures or patterns.\n- Look for a photo that makes use of negative space. Negative space is the area around your subject. It should be simple and uncluttered.\n- Choose a photo that has a muted color palette. A muted color palette means there are not a lot of bright colors. The colors should be soft and subtle.\nThe following is an example of a birthday invitation that shows the importance of finding a minimalistic photo and then matching its hue.\nHow to use stock photos in minimalistic graphic designs\nAvoid using stock photos in minimalistic graphic designs. The lack of visual clutter is one of the defining characteristics of minimalism, so adding a busy or complex image will detract from the overall effect. If you do need to use a stock photo, try to find a picture with a simple composition.\nHowever, high-quality and minimalistic images take your design to a new level.\nBest stock photo sites for minimalistic designs\n1. Adobe Stock (paid)\nAdobe Stock is the best stock photo site for all graphic designers. In addition, its search filters let you browse photos based on their background and the number of people, which is ideal for minimalism.\nYou can also download premium stock photos suitable for commercial designs. Besides having a more broad licensing appropriate for large marketing campaigns, they look very professional.\nAdobe Stock is also integrated into the Creative Cloud, making it a superb choice for anyone already using Adobe’s apps.\nUse Adobe Stock’s free trial to get 10, 25, or 40 stock images for free.\n2. iStock (paid)\nYou also get a plugin to Creative Cloud, giving you similar functionality to Adobe Stock.\nUse iStock’s free trial to get 10 stock images free.\n3. Shutterstock (paid)\nShutterstock also has great pictures for minimalistic graphic design, but it doesn’t sell premium stock images. Regardless, it’s an excellent choice for any graphic designer.\nUse Shutterstock’s free trial to get 10 stock images free.\n4. Unsplash (free)\nUnsplash has 4 million stock photos licensed under a Creative Commons license. This means you may use them even for commercial projects without giving credit.\nWhile its stock photos are great, sometimes it isn’t easy to find quality images on specific topics.\nYou can also use Unsplash within other apps, thanks to their API, but you need to develop it yourself.\n5. Getty Images (expensive)\nGetty Images are the most expensive of the listed stock photo sites, but high-end designers and websites choose them anyway. However, most of the content at Getty Images is marked for editorial use, meaning you may not use it for commercial or edit it.\nWhat is neo-minimalism?\nNeo-minimalism is a movement in the late 20th century that sought to revive and redefine specific traditional artistic values in reaction to the perceived excesses of postmodernism.\nIn general, neo-minimalists sought to return to more traditional artistic values, such as simplicity, order, and clarity. This was in reaction to the perceived excesses of postmodernism, which they felt had led to a loss of focus on the actual artwork itself.\nNeo-minimalists also emphasized the artist’s idea as an individual creator rather than a collaborator or part of a larger collective.\nWhat is the difference between minimalism and neo-minimalism?\nA focus on simplicity and minimalism characterizes minimalism in art, music, and literature. This means that artists and writers in this movement focus on creating works that are simple and deliberately lacking in ornamentation or detail.\nIn contrast, neo-minimalism in architecture is characterized by a focus on functionality and simplicity. This means that architects in this movement focus on designing simple and efficient buildings without sacrificing aesthetic appeal.\nThe History of Minimalism in Graphic Design\n- The Bauhaus movement in the early 20th century is often cited for having begun minimalism in graphic design.\n- The Swiss Style of the 1950s and 1960s is another significant influence on minimalism in graphic design.\n- The rise of digital technology in the late 20th century has also been a significant factor in developing minimalism in graphic design.\n- In the early 21st century, minimalism in graphic design has become popular, with many designers embracing this style to create clean, modern designs.\n- Minimalism in graphic design is likely to continue to be a popular style in the years to come.\nMinimalism in Graphic Design FAQs\nWhat is a minimalist design?\nA minimalist design uses only the essential elements, including basic shapes and limited color palettes, to create something straightforward yet memorable.\nWho started minimalism in graphic design?\nAndy Warhol is often credited as the father of American minimalism. He was a thriving commercial graphic designer during the 1950s, winning awards such as the Art Directors Club and the American Institute of Graphic Arts.\nWhat is a flat design?\nFlat design is a minimalistic design approach that emphasizes usability. It is characterized by using simple, flat, 2D elements, icons, and limited use of gradients, shadows, and other 3D design elements.\nWhy did distinguished brands embrace minimalist design?\nFor various reasons, some well-known brands have opted for a minimalist design. If you choose a minimalist design, you can appeal to many customers. In addition, using minimalist principles can make a brand’s message more memorable. Minimalist design principles also give a brand a sense of sophistication and luxury."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:923cebdb-14b9-47fb-a1ef-84fdc597c4d3>","<urn:uuid:7a3e97f4-bf07-4e7c-a89a-a542ad2a95d6>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Can you compare social time and clock time in organizational contexts, explaining their key differences and impact on work behavior? Please structure the comparison in a clear format.","answer":"Clock time is characterized by quantified, invariant units used for day-to-day structured activities and formal organizational functions like coordination and integration. It represents linear, decontextualized measurements divorced from natural rhythms. In contrast, social time is contingent upon societal needs and opportunities, closer to subjective perceptions and natural/social rhythms. It reflects quality, complexity, and mediating knowledge rather than pure quantity. In organizational contexts, while clock time dominates coordination and control functions through schedules and deadlines, social time manifests in how work activities are actually experienced and structured based on group needs. Clock time has become increasingly dominant in business settings as speed and efficiency have become organizational obsessions, though both temporal frameworks continue to shape how employees experience and manage their work.","context":["- Jan 2019\nThe Phases Should Reflect Social Rather Than Objective Time Giddens (I 987), although not the first, makes an important theoretical distinction between social and objective time. Giddens defines clock time as the use of quantified units. Clock time represents \"day-to-day\" structured activities. Typically, studies refer to disaster phases with hours, days, weeks, or years. Social time, however, is contingent upon the needs or opportunities of a society.\nCites Giddens here to describe differences between social time (sturcturation) and clock time.\n- Aug 2018\nThese same requirements exist in distributed computing, in which tasks need to be scheduled so that they can be completed in the correct sequence and in a timely manner, with data being transferred between computing elements appropriately.\ntime factors in crowd work include speed, scheduling, and sequencing\nMajor societal transformations are linked to information and communication technologies, giving rise to processes of growing global interdependence. They in turn generate the approxi-mation of coevalness, the illusion of simultaneity by being able to link instantly people and places around the globe. Many other processes are also accelerated. Speed and mobility are thus gaining in momentum, leading in turn to further speeding up processes that interlink the move-ment of people, information, ideas and goods.\nEvokes Virilio theories and social/political critiques on speed/compression, as cited by Adam (2004).\nAlso Hassan's work, also cited by Adam (2004).\nDespite the apparent diversity of themes, certain common patterns can be discerned in empirical studies dealing with time. They bear the imprint of the ups and downs of research fashions as well as the waxing and waning of influences from neighbouring disciplines. But they all acknowledge 'time as a problem' in 'time-compact' societies (Lenntorp, 1978), imbued with the pressures of time that come from time being a scarce resource.\nOverview of interdisciplinary, empirical time/temporality studies from late 70s to 80s. (contemporary to this book)\nCites Carey \"The Case of the Telegraph\" -- \"impact of the telegraph on the standardization of time\"\nCites Bluedorn -- \"it is omnipresent indecision-making, deadlines andother aspects of organizational behaviour like various forms of group processes\"\nAnother strategy in dealing with sui generis time consists in juxtaposing clock time to the various forms of 'social time' and considers the latter as the more 'natural' ones, i.e. closer to subjective perceptions of time, or to the temporality that results from adaptations to seasons or other kinds of natural (biological, environmental) rhythm. This strategy, often couched also in terms of an opposition between 'linear' clock time and 'cyclical' time of natural and social rhythms devalues, or at least ques-tions, the temporality of formal organizations which rely heavily on clock time in fulfilling their coordinative and integrative and controlling functions (Young, 1988; Elchardus, 1988).\nby contrasting social time (as a natural phenomenon) against clock time, allows for a more explicit perspective on linear time (clock) and social rhythms when examining social coordination.\n- linear time\n- social coordination\n- clock time\n- social time\n- time as relationship\nIn other words, the idea of time as socially constituted depends fundamentally on the meaning we impose on 'the social', whether we understand it as a prerogative of human social organisation or, following Mead, as a principle of nature.\nIn a long prior passage about how time is conceptualized in nature and in social coordination, Adam argues that \"time\" as a social construct should be thought of holistically and not broken into dichotomies to be compared/contrasted.\nA brief expansion of these general social science assumptions about nature will clarify this point. Nature as distinct from social life is understood to be quantifiable, simple, and subject to invariant relations and laws that hold beyond time and space (Giddens 1976; Lessnoff 1979· ~yan 1979). This view is accompanied by an understanding of natural time as coming in fixed, divisible units that can be measured whilst quality, complexit~, ~nd mediating knowledge are preserved exclusively for the conceptuahsat10n of human social time. On the basis of a further closely related idea it is proposed that nature may be understood objectively. Natural scientists, explain Elias (1982a, b) and Giddens ( 1976), stand in a subject-object relationship to their subject matter. Natural scientists, they suggest, are able to study objects directly and apply a causal framework of analysis whilst such direct causal links no longer suffice for the study of human society where that which is investigated has to be appreciated as unintended outcomes of intended actions and where the investigators interpret a pre-interpreted world. Unlike their colleagues in the natural sciences, social scientists, it is argued, stand in a subject-subject relation to their subject matter. In a?ditio? to the differences along the quantity-quality and object-subject d1mens10ns nature is thought to be predictable because its regularities -be they causal, statistical, or probabilistic -are timeless. The laws of nature. are c?nsi~ered to be true in an absolute and timeless way, the laws of society h1stoncally developed. In contrast to nature, human societies are argued to be fundamentally historical. They are organised around :alues, goals, morals, ethics, and hopes, whilst simultaneously being mfl~enc~d by tradition, habits, and legitimised meanings.\nCritique of flawed social science perception of natural science as driven by laws, order, and quantitative attributes (subject-object) that are observable. This is contrasted with perception about social science as driven by history, culture, habit, and meanings which are socially constructed qualitative attributes (subject-subject).\nSince our traditional understanding of natural time e~erged as inadequate and faulty we have to recognise that the analysis of social time is flawed by implication.\nAdam states that \"social time\" theories should be contested since social science disciplinary understanding of \"natural time\" is incorrect.\nPast, present, and future, historical time, the qualitative experience of time, the structuring of 'undifferentiated change' i?to episodes, all are established as integral time aspects of the subJect matter of the natural sciences and clock time, the invariant measure, the closed circle, the perfect symmetry, and reversible time as our creations.\nAdam's broader definition of \"natural time\" which is socially constructed and not just a physical phenomena.\nSorokin and Merton (1937) may be said to have provided the 'definitive' classic statement on the distinction between social and natural time. They associate the physical time of diurnal and seasonal cycles with clock time and define this time as 'purely quantitative, shorn of qualitative variation' (p. 621). 'All time systems', Sorokin and Merton suggest further, 'may be reduced to the need of providing means for synchronising and co-ordinating the activities and observations of the constituents of groups' (p. 627).\nclassic definition of \"social time\" vs \"natural time\". This thinking is now contested.\nWhilst social theorists are no longer united in the belief that all time systems are reducible to the functional need of human synchro~is_ation and co-ordination they seem to have little doubt about the validity of Sorokin and Merton's other key point that, unlike social time, the time of nature is that of the clock, a time characterised by invariance and quantity. Despite significant shifts in the understanding of social time, the assumptions about nature, natural time, and the subject matter of the natural sciences have remained largely unchanged.\nAdam argues here that while the concept of \"social time\" has evolved, social scientists' ideas around \"natural time\" have not kept pace with new scientific research, and incorrectly continue to be described as constant and quantitative (aka clock time).\nFurther, \"natural time\" incorrectly incorporates other temporal experiences and seems to be used as a convenient counter foil to \"social time\"\n- Jul 2018\nIt shows thar irrespective of the diverse temporal uses of time in the political, scientific and economic spheres, a unified clock time underpins the differences in expressions. All other forms of temporal relations are refracted through chis created temporal form, or at least touched by its pervasive dominance\nClock-time dominates political, scientific and economic practices despite the very different ways temporality is represented in these fields.\nThis industrial norm, as I suggested above, is fundamentally rooted in clock time and underpinned by naturalized assumptions about not just the capacity but also the need to commodify, compress and control time.\n'Interconnectivity', Hassan suggests, 'is what gives the network time its power within culture and society.'32 It is worth quoting him at length here. Network time does not 'kill' or render 'timeless' other temporalities, clock-time or otherwise. The embedded nature of the 'multiplicity' of temporalities rbat pervade culture and society, and tbe deeply intractable relationship we have with rhe clock make this unlikely. Rather, the process is one of 'displacement'. Network time constitutes a new and powerful temporality that is beginning to displace, neutralise, sublimate and otherwise upset other temporal relationships in our work, home and leisure environments\nHassan advances Castells' work on network time and focuses on how the cultural impact/power comes from interconnectivity of the network, not Virilio's emphasis on communication speed.\nIn this view, culture and society have multiple temporalities that layer/modify/supercede as globalization, political/work trends, and new technologies take hold.\nNetwork time is displacing other types of temporal representations, like clock-time.\nIn a systematic analysis Castells contrasts the clock time of modernity with the network time of the network society.\nclock time vs network time\nDefinition of network time, per Hassan (2003): \"Through the convergence of neoliberal globalization and ICT revolution a new powerful temporality has emerged through which knowledge production is refracted: network time.\"\nWhile interest and credit had been known and documented since 3000 BC in Babylonia, it was not until the late Middle Ages that the Christian Church slowly and almost surreptitiously changed its position on usury,6 which set time free for trade to be allocated, sold and controlled. It is against this back�round that we have to read the extr�cts from Benjar1_1in Franklin's text of 1736, quoted at length m chapter 2, which contains the famous phrases 'Remember, that time is money ... Remember that money begets money.'7 Clock time, the created time to human design, was a precondition for this change in value and practice and formed the perfect partner to abstract, decontextualized money. From the Middle Ages, trade fairs existed where the trade in time became commonplace and calculations about future prices an integral part of commerce. In addition, internatio�al trade by sea required complex calculations about pote�ual profit and loss over long periods, given that trade ships might be away for as long as three years at a time. The time economy of interest and credit, moreover, fed directly into the monetary value of labour time, that is, paid employme�t as an integral part of the production of goo?s and serv_1ce�. However it was not until the French Revolunon that the md1-vidual (�eaning male) ownership of time became enshrined as a legal right\nHistorical, religious, economic, and political aspects of how time became a commodity that could be allocated, sold, traded, borrowed against or controlled.\nBenjamin Franklin metaphor: \"time is money ... money begets money\"\nThe task for social theory, therefore, is to render the invisible visible, show relations and interconnections, begin tbe process of questioning the unquestioned. Before we can identify some of these economic relations of temporal inequity, however, we first need to understand in what way the sin of usury was a barrier to the development of economic life as we know it today in industrial societies.\nCiting Weber (integrated with Marx), Adam describes how time is used to promote social inequity.\nTaken for granted in a socio-economic system, time renders power relationships as invisible\nMarx's principal point regarding the commodification of time was that an empty, abstract, quantifiable time that was applicable anywhere, any time was a precondition for its use as an abstract exchange value on the one hand and for the commodification of labour and nature on the other. Only on the basis of this neutral measure could time take such a pivotal position in all economic exchange.\nCiting Marx' critique on how time is commodified for value, labor and natural resources.\nClock time, the human creation, as I have shown, operates according to fundamentally different principles from rhe ones ��derpinning the times of tbe cosmos, �ature and the spmt�al realm of eternity. It is a decontextuahzed empty ume that nes the measurement of motion to expression by number. Not change, creativity and process, but static states are given a number value in the temporal frames of calendars and clocks. The artifice rather than the processes of cosmos, nature and spirit, we need to appreciate, came to be the object of trade, control and colonization.\nPrimer on how clock-time differs from natural world and spiritual expressions of time.\nClock-time as a socio-economic numerical representation is a guiding force for how power is wielded through colonialization/conquered lands and people, labor becomes a value-laden commodity, and\nThis is so because all cultures, ancient and modern, have established collective ways of relating to the past and future, of synchronizing their activities, of coming to terms with finitude. How we extend ourselves into the past and future, how we pursue immortality and how we temporally manage, organize and regulate our social affairs, however, has been culturally, historically and contextually distinct. Each htstorical epoch with its new forms of socioeconomic expression is simultaneously restructuring its social relations of time.\nSociotemporal reactions/responses/concepts have deep historical roots and intercultural relationships.\nCurrent ways of thinking about time continue to be significantly influenced by post-industrial socio-economic constructs, like clock-time, labor efficiencies (speed), and value metaphors (money, attention, thrift).\nthe Reformation had a major role to play in the metamorphosis of time from God's gift to commodified, comp�essed, colonized and controlled resource. These four Cs of mdustrial time -comrnodification, compression, colonization and control -will be the focus in these pages, the fifth C of the creation of clock time having been discussed already in the previous chapter. I show their interdependence and id�ntify some of the socio-environmental impacts of those parttcular temporal relations.\nFive C's of industrial time: Commodification, compression, colonialization, control, and clock time.\n- network time\n- social inequity\nFurthermore, and differentiating digital time from clock time, he suggests that a lack of adherence to chronological time is compounded by the fact that digital technologies connect with a flow of information that is al-ways and instantly available. He argues that continual change, which is bound up with web services such as social network sites, blogs and the news, is central to the experi-enced need for constant connectivity.\nQ: How does this idea of time vs information flow affect the data harvested during a digital crowdwork process in humanitarian emergencies?\nQ: How does this idea of time vs information flow manifest when the information flow is not chronological due to content throttling or algorithmic decisions on what content to deliver to a user?\nFor example, in his classic analysis of the his-tory of the machine, Lewis Mumford  notes that, “Abstract time became the new medium of existence. Or-ganic functions themselves were regulated by it: one ate, not upon feeling hungry, but when prompted by the clock: one slept, not when one was tired, but when the clock sanc-tioned it.” [p. 17]\nExamples of sociotemporality vs clock time by Mumford.\nEat when hungry not at Noon Sleep when tired not at prescribed time\nFor them, clock time is best understood as sets of practices, which are bound up with time-reckoning and time-keeping technologies, butwhich vary and are shaped by different times, places and communities. This view of clock time is quite different to that often de-picted in the literature, where it is positioned as abstract and mechanistic.\nAlternative clock time definition by Glennie and Thrift.\nWe then detail a position outlined by Glennie and Thrift , in which clock time is described as a series of practices rather than a concept created by new timekeep-ing technologies.\nLoop up Glennie and Thrift paper.\nNeed as many examples as I can get that offer concrete ways to describe sociotemporality beyond clock time. This lack of explicit examples seems to trip people up the most. Sociotemporality is still too intangible.","Role of Time in Organizational Studies\n- LAST MODIFIED: 28 March 2018\n- DOI: 10.1093/obo/9780199846740-0137\n- LAST MODIFIED: 28 March 2018\n- DOI: 10.1093/obo/9780199846740-0137\nTime is an inescapable, fundamental, and ubiquitous part of everyday life that is interwoven with every aspect of work behavior. As speed has practically become an obsession in the business world, time is an increasingly dominant facet of employees’ work experiences. Although its importance is largely undisputed, however, time has traditionally been woefully neglected in organizational behavior and organizational psychology research. One of the most prolific authors on this topic, Joseph McGrath was among the first to study the intersection between temporality and groups as well as organizations. The perfunctory “we need more longitudinal research” in the discussion section of articles has become cliché, as almost every area of research in organizational science can better integrate temporality into research conceptualization and measurement. Although the numerous calls to make time more explicit in theories and studies seemed to largely go unheeded for decades, interest and momentum regarding time has been building in recent years. We provide bibliographic support for research on time at the individual, team, and organization levels as well as discuss national temporal culture and methodological work.\nOverviews of the Role of Time in Organizational Studies\nMuch of the research on time has been conducted at the individual level, and a number of reviews nicely summarize this work. Joe McGrath was a pioneer in highlighting the literature’s neglect of time, calling attention to temporal problems, and overviewing conceptions of time, as seen in McGrath and Rotchford 1983 and McGrath and Kelly 1986. Following McGrath’s seminal work, Bluedorn and Denhardt 1988 provided a review of temporal research in the management literature, including both micro and macro organizational behavior studies. George and Jones 2000 as well as Mitchell and James 2001 argued for the need to incorporate time in theory building by explicitly specifying duration and when events happen. As the introduction to a 2001 special issue of the Academy of Management Review focused on time, Ancona, et al. 2001 called management research to actively incorporate a “temporal lens” instead of allowing time to be peripheral and implicit. Building upon their earlier temporal work, Bluedorn 2002 reviews the literature on time-based individual differences, and McGrath and Tschan 2004 provides a roadmap for researchers to consider temporality in methodological design. More recently, Roe 2008 illustrates that stability is the exception and change the rule in organization science, while Sonnentag 2012 organizes temporal research into broad categories to further empirical research.\nAncona, D.

{"question":"What are the characteristics of the global domestic work market, and what specific problems do migrant domestic workers encounter in UK visa regulations?","answer":"The global domestic work market has emerged as the largest labor market for women worldwide, characterized by workers performing cleaning, caring, and cooking duties, particularly in European households. It has led to the feminization of migration, with workers commonly moving from countries like the Philippines, India, and Indonesia. In the UK, these workers face significant challenges under the Overseas Domestic Worker visa system. Research has shown that workers under the tied visa system often work without days off, with some working 12-20 hours per day. The current six-month visa system, even with the theoretical ability to change employers, creates practical barriers to leaving abusive situations, as workers struggle to find new employment with such limited time remaining on their visas. Additionally, some workers identified as potential trafficking victims are denied permission to work while awaiting decisions on their status, potentially pushing them into destitution or informal work.","context":["Domestic work has become highly relevant on a local and global scale. Until a decade ago, domestic workers were rare in European households; today they can be found working for middle-class families and single people, for double or single parents as well as for the elderly. Performing the three C's - cleaning, caring and cooking - domestic workers offer their woman power on a global market which Europe has become part of. This global market is now considered the largest labour market for women world wide and it has triggered the feminization of migration. This volume brings together contributions by European and US based researchers to look at the connection between migration and domestic work on an empirical and theoretical level. The contributors elaborate on the phenomenon of 'domestic work' in late modern societies by discussing different methodological and theoretical approaches in an interdisciplinary setting. The volume also looks at the gendered aspects of domestic work; it asks why the re-introduction of domestic workers in European households has become so popular and will argue that this phenomenon is challenging gender theories. This is a timely book and will be of interest to academics and students in the fields of migration, gender and European studies.\nHelma Lutz is a Professor of Women's and Gender Studies.

Myra Marx Ferree, University of Wisconsin-Madison , USA 'The increasing presence of migrant domestic workers in European homes and societies has received surprisingly little research attention. This collection is invaluable in addressing that absence. It provides illuminating overviews of global care chains and case studies of the intimate relationships produced. It is essential reading for those interested in migration movements, care work or gender regimes, but anyone wanting to understand European societies will find fascinating insights here.' Ann Phoenix, University of London, UK 'The edited book Migration and Domestic Work draws together contributing authors from a range of different European countries to produce a fascinating read for those interested in migration, gender and family life. The authors invite us into the hidden lives of migrant women, who are often part of the less visible (domestic) sections of the societies in which they work and reside.

At t","This article is by Natalie Sedacca, a PhD Candidate and Teaching Fellow at UCL Faculty of Laws. Her research focuses on the intersection between labour rights and human rights in relation to domestic workers with two case studies, Chile and the UK.\nThe 16th of June is International Domestic Workers’ Day and marks the eight year anniversary of the International Labour Organisation’s Convention 189 on the rights of domestic workers (‘C-189’). This was a seminal date in the history of a sector marked by devaluation of work and a lack of labour rights. Yet the UK has not ratified C-189, a failing reflected by the fact domestic workers are, in some cases, exempt from some key labour rights applying to workers in other sectors. In addition, migrant workers in this sector are subject to a specific visa regime that increases their vulnerability to exploitation and abuse. The UK must pay close attention to the problems faced by these workers, including learning from countries which have ratified C-189 such as Chile, explored below.\nThe Overseas Domestic Worker visa – short term stays that encourage dependency\nMigrant domestic workers in the UK are often from non-EU countries such as the Philippines, India and Indonesia, and must obtain a specific type of visa for work in this sector – either a Diplomatic Visa for those working in a diplomatic household, or otherwise an Overseas Domestic Worker (ODW) visa. The worker must already have been working for that employer for at least a year before accompanying them to the UK (R159A of the Immigration Rules).\nReforms to the visa system in 2012 introduced a tie between the visa and the employer, making the worker’s right to work and remain in the UK dependent on the continued contract with their specific employer. This tie made it much more difficult for a worker to enforce rights at work and / or leave employment if conditions were poor. Research in 2014 by the migrant domestic worker organisation Kalayaan found that 45% of those working under pre-2012 non-tied visas had no day off, whereas, strikingly, all those surveyed working on the tied visa lacked a day off. Likewise, Mantouvalou’s study of migrant workers who had escaped their original employers found that they had been working 12-20 hours per day, and an independent review of the OWD visa in 2015 found that it lead to a lack of bargaining power, a sense of ‘being “owned” by an employer, or at least being trapped,’ and the risk of creating a large class of undocumented workers who lack legal protection.\nThis review therefore recommended, among other points, a right to change employer within the sector that was ‘not conditional upon claiming or proving any form of abuse.’ The government responded in 2016 by allowing those on an ODW visa ‘the ability to take alternative employment as a domestic worker with a different employer during the six month period for which they are originally admitted’ [emphasis added].\nIn practice, this does not implement the independent review’s recommendations in a meaningful way. As noted by Kalayaan and by Lord Hylton, without a right to renew the visa the same problem will remain: it is likely to be difficult or impossible for a domestic worker to find a new role when they have only months or even weeks remaining on their visa. This can leave them with little choice but to stay in abusive or exploitative employment situations. This highlights that it is not just the tied nature of the visa that poses a problem, but also crucially the fact that it is short-term and generally non-renewable, designed to deter long- or even medium-term residence, and therefore still tied in practice.\nSome Overseas Domestic Workers prevented from working after being found to be potential victims of trafficking\nThere is a limited exception to the non-renewable nature of the ODW visa when a domestic worker is identified as a (potential) victim of modern slavery or human trafficking in R159I-J of the Immigration Rules. The fact that a right which should be accessible across the board is restricted to these specific circumstances is problematic, and there are also serious shortcomings even for those that fit within this category. Empirical research I carried out for Kalayaan involving interviews with 21 workers, which is summarised in this blog post, demonstrates a particular flaw: the fact that some of those identified as potential victims of trafficking are denied permission to work while awaiting a final decision on their status, which can take months or even years. The research finds that the factor determining whether or not an individual in this position has permission to work is arbitrary and relates to factors that are generally outside the worker’s control, and that those who lacked permission to work reported being pushed into destitution and / or informal working, which was often degrading, exploitative and lacking in defined hours.\nBeyond these specific points on slavery and trafficking victims, there is an urgent need to reform the visa system more broadly, allowing all workers the possibility of extending their visa beyond the initial six month period – without which the removal of the tie to the employer is basically illusory. As highlighted in the recent FLEX report, short term and non-renewable visas make workers vulnerable to exploitation: having a high turnover of workers all with only short term stays has a number of negative implications, from making it more difficult to join a union to impeding possibilities for family reunification.\nThe labour law position – a lower standard of protection for domestic workers\nAs well as the visa scheme making it more difficult for domestic workers to access or enforce rights, there are also deficiencies in the level of rights protection formally available to such workers. At present the National Minimum Wage can be disapplied in relation to ‘work relating to the family household’ – the definition of such work includes that the worker lives at their employer’s family home and is treated as a member of the family ‘in particular as regards to the provision of living accommodation and meals and sharing of tasks and leisure activities’ (s57 of the National Minimum Wage Regulations). This shocking exemption, which reflects the devaluation of work carried out by women in the private sphere, is subject to an ongoing legal challenge.\nWorkers ‘employed as a domestic servant in a private household’ are also excluded from a number of the key limitations on working time, including the maximum average working week of 48 hours (s19 Working Time Regulations) and from provisions on workplace inspections that apply in other settings (s51 Health & Safety at Work Act). And while labour regulation in the UK suffers more broadly from a lack of labour inspection and enforcement, these issues are particularly stark in the domestic work sector when taken together with other factors: the isolation of being in a workplace usually consisting of one person, low levels of unionisation and – for migrant workers – the difficulties enforcing rights as a result of visa restrictions.\nWhile the UK lags behind, other countries are improving their standards\nIn December 2012, a joint letter from Anti-Slavery International, Kalayaan, Justice for Domestic Workers (now Voice of Domestic Workers) and the Trade Union Congress called on the UK government to ratify C-189, but more than six years later there is no sign of this being realised. In the meantime, it has now been ratified in total by 28 countries, many of which are in Latin America. My PhD research, in part, is exploring the situation in Chile which ratified C-189 in 2015. While Chile had previously seen a number of relevant reforms from 2008 onwards, substantial legislative changes were made alongside ratification, including on the area of working time, deduction of accommodation and food costs from salary, and uniforms worn in public.\nThese reforms are an improvement to the former situation and were supported by the domestic workers’ union federation who were involved in campaigning in their favour. That said, some difficulties remain – for example, although live-in workers are now entitled to rest on Saturdays (subject to accumulation, splitting or changing for another day with agreement) as well as on Sundays, they are not subject to the same limits and set hours as live-out domestic workers. Chilean sociologist Fernández has described shortcomings in the new law as giving ‘continuity to the culture of servitude’ despite also recognising it as an achievement. Likewise, limitations on inspection remain – entry to a private home is only permitted if the employer agrees, and they otherwise have the option of attending labour offices with required documentation. The union is campaigning for further reform including in the area of inspection.\nRatification of C-189 is needed but it should be seen as a floor not a ceiling\nThe 2012 joint letter to the UK government seeking ratification of C-189 pointed to the convention’s ‘considerable degree of flexibility.’ The Chilean example reflects this flexibility, given that rights have not been entirely equalised. On one hand, this demonstrates that concerns about ratifying the convention because of the burden it would impose are unfounded. On the other hand, it shows how C-189 can be interpreted in a way that is perhaps too flexible, meaning challenges beyond ratification remain. As recently noted by Blackett, an expert on domestic labour who was involved with the agreement of C-189, ‘despite the tremendous amount that has been accomplished… the depth of the challenge may still be underestimated.’\nIn this sense, ratifying C-189 and incorporating its provisions into domestic law should be seen as a starting point – a floor rather than a ceiling – and the process of ensuring that such rights are enforced as an ongoing process, in which domestic workers and their organisations must play a central role. To begin this course, the UK should urgently ensure that all domestic workers are entitled to the minimum wage and subject to defined limits on their working time, as well as fundamentally revising the visa scheme to allow for the possibility of renewal and fully removing the tie to the employer. International domestic workers’ day should bring a renewed impetus to end the current situation, in which an overwhelmingly female and migrant section of the working population can be denied the most basic working rights and further exposed to exploitation through unfair visa conditions.\nWith thanks to Natalie Sedacca for authoring this blog.

{"question":"How do the treatment approaches differ between astigmatism and lazy eye in terms of corrective methods and timing considerations?","answer":"The treatment approaches for these conditions differ significantly. Astigmatism is typically treated with corrective lenses (glasses or contacts) that require both spherical power and cylinder lens power, or through various laser surgery options like LASIK, PRK, or LASEK. In contrast, lazy eye (amblyopia) treatment involves a combination of approaches including spectacles or contact lenses, patching, and eye exercises. While astigmatism can be treated at any age, early treatment is particularly crucial for lazy eye, though recent research suggests treatment may still be possible in adults. Furthermore, laser surgery for astigmatism has specific age restrictions, being unsuitable for patients under 18 years or those whose vision is still changing.","context":["Astigmatism is a disorder in which the surface of the eye, or cornea, is not normally curved, resulting in blurred vision.\nThe irregular curve of the cornea means it is not correctly centered on the retina when light enters the eye, resulting in an ambiguous image.\nAn irregularly shaped lens, situated behind the cornea, can also cause astigmatism.\nChildren and adults may be affected. It is normally congenital, or present at birth, but can develop after an eye surgery or an eye injury.\nIt is one of a group of disorders in the eye called refractive errors. This arise when the cornea or lens isn’t completely smooth and curved evenly.\nOther refractive errors include near- or far-sightedness and presbyopia, which happens with aging.\nRefractive errors affect approximately half of all adults aged 20 years and over in the United States ( U.S.).\nImportant facts about astigmatism\nHere are some key points about astigmatism. More information is in the main article.\n- Astigmatism is a type of refractive error.\n- It is a common condition.\n- It is caused by an abnormal curve of the cornea or lens.\n- Laser surgery can often correct astigmatism.\nWhat is astigmatism?\nAstigmatism is a term used to describe the irregular shape of the surface of the eye called the cornea.\nThe abnormal curve of the cornea means that when the light enters the eye, it is not correctly focused on the retina, resulting in a blurred image.\nA cornea without astigmatism has a perfectly round shape, much like a ball ‘s surface.\nWith astigmatism, the surface of the eye is shaped more like soccer.\nIt focuses light on the back of the eye in two places, and this causes blur.\nAstigmatism may also be caused by an irregularly shaped lens, which is located behind the cornea inside the eye.\nMany children born with astigmatism will not realize that they have it until they have an eye test.\nReading and concentrating at school can be affected if the child has undiagnosed astigmatism, so regular eye tests are important.\nAn eye specialist may use the following tools to examine the eye:\n- Visual acuity test: This involves reading letters on a chart. The letters become progressively smaller on each line.\n- Astigmatic dial: A chart showing a series of lines that make up a semi-circle. People with perfect vision will see the lines clearly, while those with astigmatism will see some more clearly than others.\n- Keratometer, or ophthalmometer: This device measures the reflected light from the surface of the cornea. It measures the radius of the curvature of the cornea and can assess the degree of abnormal curvature.\n- Corneal topography: This process gives more information about the shape and curve of the cornea.\nFor children, the American Optometric Association (AOA) recommends eye tests:\n- at 6 months\n- at 3 years\n- before first grade\n- every 2 years after that\nFor high-risk children, an eye exam is recommended every year.\nThe following are common signs and symptoms of astigmatism:\n- blurred or distorted vision at all distances\n- excessive squinting\n- eye strain, especially when the eye has to focus for long periods, as in reading from paper or a computer monitor\n- difficulty driving at night\nAstigmatism may not be present in a person with these symptoms, but it is a good idea to get an eye test.\nAstigmatism occurs when the cornea, lens, or both are irregularly curvatured.\nA translucent layer of tissue that protects the front of the eye is the cornea. It transmits light into the back of the eye and focuses it while shielding the eye from infection and injury.\nA perfectly curved cornea as it reaches the eye will bend, or refract, light properly.\nIn an individual with astigmatism, the cornea is always egg-shaped rather than completely round, with two distinct curves. Often this is called corneal astigmatism.\nThe light rays will concentrate on two points on the retina instead of one because of the two different curves. This causes fuzzy vision and, if the astigmatism is serious, sometimes double vision.\nExactly why certain people are born with a cornea that does not curve properly, is unknown, but a genetic component could be present.\nCompared with those born prior to their due date, a larger percentage of babies who are born preterm have astigmatism.\nSome forms of surgery or damage to the eyes that cause corneal scarring can cause astigmatism.\nKeratoconus is a degenerative eye disease in which the cornea slowly diminishes and changes to a more conical form. This can trigger a disorder referred to as irregular astigmatism.\nThe doctor may recommend no treatment at all if the astigmatism is mild.\nOtherwise, the normal solution is the corrective lenses and certain people can benefit from laser surgery.\nFor astigmatism, corrective lenses\nCorrective lenses bend the incoming light rays in such a way that the error caused by defective refraction is compensated for. Thus images are correctly projected onto the retina.\nIt may be in the form of contact lenses or glasses. To correct the vision, a standard prescription for near- or far-sightedness requires spherical control.\nLenses for astigmatism will need:\n- a spherical power, to correct the near or far-sightedness\n- a “cylinder” lens power, to correct the astigmatism\n- an axis designation that describes the positioning of the cylinder correction\nFor children under the age of 12 years, glasses might be safer.\nTo of the risk of eye infection, anyone using contact lenses must be conscious of good lens hygiene.\nOrthokeratology, or corneal refractive therapy\nThis requires, for example, wearing a specially fitted, rigid contact lens overnight to reshape the cornea. This does not permanently improve vision, but after wearing these, the person can find they can see better the whole day after.\nThere is a huge selection of spectacles to choose from.\nAside from the most common type of corneal astigmatism, there are other types that astigmatism can take.\nThis is similar to corneal astigmatism but it affects not the cornea but the lens.\nThe lens has variations that allow images to imperfectly hit the back of the eye, or retina, instead of a smooth curve. The majority of patients with lenticular astigmatism have a normal-shaped cornea.\nOther ways of classifying astigmatism\nAstigmatism can also be classified according to other established refractive errors.\nMyopic astigmatism happens when astigmatism is combined with near-sightedness and the two curves are focused in front of the retina.\nHyperopic astigmatism is when astigmatism is associated with distance-sightedness and the two curves are concentrated behind the retina.\nMixed astigmatism is when one curve is far-sighted and the other is near-sighted.\nEven astigmatism may be regular or irregular.\nThe two curves are at a 90-degree angle to each other if they are normal, but the angle is not 90 degrees if they are irregular.\nTrauma, surgery, or an eye condition known as keratoconus, where the cornea gradually becomes thinner, may result in irregular astigmatism.\nLaser eye surgery, the most common of which is laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK), can treat certain people with astigmatism.\nLASIK: The doctor makes a small, round hinged cut into the cornea using a device called a keratome.\nThe surgeon raises the flap, and under the flap, an excimer laser sculpts the shape of the cornea.\nLASIK induces less discomfort than most treatments, and after a few days, the patient will regain his or her vision.\nSome choices for lasers are:\nPhotorefractive keratectomy (PRK): This eliminates some of the cornea ‘s outer protective layer. By removing tissue an excimer laser changes the appearance of the cornea.\nIt typically has a more regular and spherical curve as the cornea heals. This can cause pain that is mild to extreme.\nLaser epithelial keratomileusis (LASEK): The surgeon removes a thin corneal layer and uses a laser to alter the form of the cornea. It then removes the corneal tissue.\nCompared with PRK, a much thinner layer is affected, making the eye less vulnerable to damage or injury. When anyone has a thin cornea and is unable to have Lasik, this surgery is often preferred. Usually it is more painful though than LASIK.\nWho should avoid laser surgery?\nLaser eye surgery may not be suitable if:\n- the patient is aged under 18 years.\n- the patient’s vision is still changing, for example, in older people. Vision should be stable for at least one year before laser surgery.\n- the patient has diabetes, as surgery may worsen abnormalities in the eye caused by diabetes.\n- a woman is pregnant or breast-feeding, because fluctuating hormones may cause the result to be inaccurate.\n- the person has an immune condition, such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, or HIV, because it may be harder to recover after surgery.\n- the person has another existing eye condition, such as cataracts and glaucoma, as these will need treating first.\n- the person is taking certain medications such as Accutane or oral prednisone.\nThe risks of surgery can include:\n- Refractive errors: The surgeon removes the wrong amount of tissue, and the patient’s vision worsens.\n- Regression: Vision defects recur after surgery\n- Visual loss: Some people’s vision might worsen after surgery\n- Dry eyes: This is a common problem after laser eye surgery.\nThe risk of complications is low in most countries.\nPatients should ensure that their surgeon is trained and knowledgeable and that an accurate examination is conducted in advance.","What is Lazy Eye?\nWhat is “Lazy Eye”?\n“I think I have a lazy eye”, “I think my child has a lazy eye” or “his eye is a bit lazy”. Lazy Eye is a commonly used phrase or description but it can mean different things to different people. Regardless of the condition it is used to describe, early detection and treatment is recommended. However it’s good to understand what lazy eye means.\nLazy eye is used to describe:\n- One eye that doesn’t see as well as the other ie things look blurrier through one eye – AMBLYOPIA\n- An eyelid that tends to droop or close particularly as the person gets tired – PTOSIS\n- One eye that wanders in or out – STRABISMUS\n- One eye just doesn’t feel right, particularly when doing concentrated close work – CONVERGENCE INSUFFICIENCY/CONVERGENCE EXCESS\nOptometrists tend to use the term “lazy eye” to describe the first one in this list, AMBLYOPIA. This describes a situation where one eye has reduced vision compared to the other one, even when the person is wearing their best sight correction. The following information will discuss this specifically. However, anyone experiencing or noticing any of the signs or symptoms on this list should have a vision examination.\nUnderstanding Amblyopia (Lazy Eye)\nPrimarily amblyopia is diagnosed when one eye does not see as well on a distance letter chart compared to the either eye, even when the best correction is in place, and there is no sign of eye disease. Up to 1 in 20 people are affected1.\nAmblyopia is often associated with a higher prescription like hyperopia or astigmatism in one eye, although both eyes can often need correction to see clearly. Sometimes amblyopia is associated with an eye that turns, usually an inward turning eye. Often it is an eye-turn or STRABISMUS that alerts parents that something amiss. Children who have amblyopia but no eye-turn may not be consciously aware that anything is wrong as the other eye provides clear vision.\nLazy Eye is not a “One Eyed” Problem\nAmblyopia is often talked about that it makes it seem that there is a problem with the eye itself and that it is somehow “weak” or has weak muscles. While it is true that the amblyopic side often has a higher degree of prescription, the eye itself is healthy and the eye muscles usually work fine.\nFor many years, some have questioned the notion that amblyopia is a problem with one eye, and instead have looked at amblyopia arising out of a problem of the two eyes working together. Recent research in “two-eyed” methods of amblyopia treatment, help confirm aspects of this alternative theory2,3. Essentially, the poor vision results from an active process of shutting down vision in one channel, a process called suppression to avoid confusion. An eye-turn can also be considered as a process of “pushing” one eye out of the way to assist in this shutting down process. Not all of the information is shut down, so the eye is not “useless” or “lazy” but is operating at a reduced level function.\nLazy Eye is not just an “Eye Problem”\nWhen one eye is not seeing well or turning, it is easy to get overly focused (no pun intended) on just those aspects of the situation. However, there are often other visually-related skills and abilities that are affected when amblyopia or lazy eye is present that need to be considered as they impact on other aspects of quality of life. There is an increasing body of evidence that indicates even when the unaffected side is “in charge”, some other skills are not as good as expected. These include:\n- eye-hand co-ordination\n- eye tracking\n- reading speed\n- depth judgement\n- visual perception\nHow Is Lazy Eye Treated?\nEvery case is different, but broadly amblyopia treatment involves one or more of the following – spectacles or contact lenses, patching and eye exercises.\nHow Do I Know If My Child Has a Lazy Eye?\nOften a child might not show strong outward signs and it is during a screening that a problem is found. Other signs might include:\n- excessively clumsy\n- squinting one eye, particularly in bright light\n- one eye turns\n- shutting one eye or head turning\n- one pupil looks different in photo’s compared to the other\nOptometry Australia recommends routine eye exams at 6 months, 3 years and before school. This is a good way to detect problems early. A family history of eye problems would be another reason to consider having a precautionary examination.\nWhat to Do If You Think that You or Your Child has a Lazy Eye\nWhile it appears that treatment is possilble even in adults, the key message is that early treatment is best. While we now know that age is not necessarily a barrier to treatment, treatment is considered to be better and more effective the younger you are. The first step is to have a comprehensive assessment with an optometrist.\n1. Carlton J and Kaltenthaler E. Amblyopia and quality of life: a systematic review. Eye (2011) 25, 403-413.\n2.

{"question":"Do the black hole and Ouchi illusions create similar types of perceived motion?","answer":"No, they create different types of motion perception. The black hole illusion creates an expanding or forward movement sensation due to softened edges that create motion blur, making observers feel they're moving toward a dark space. The Ouchi illusion, on the other hand, causes the circle and background to appear to shift independently of each other when observers move their heads back and forth, creating a different type of motion perception.","context":["Expand the image above to fill your screen and stare at the black blob in the centre. (You can also find the original version here.) Most people perceive the blob as expanding or feel that they’re falling toward the hole. This new-to-science illusion has given researchers some more insight into how human vision works, and it shows how our perception of the world is shaped by predictions our brain makes.\nUnlike other black hole illusions that have resulted in someone literally falling into a big hole, this black blob — created by Akiyoshi Kitaoka as part of research published earlier this week — is set against a pattern of smaller black dots on a white background and is a completely static image. It creates a false sense of movement that also causes the observer’s pupils to expand, according to the study. The physical reaction happens no matter where the observer is, even if they’re looking at the illusion in a well-lit room where pupil adjustments aren’t needed. There’s seemingly no reason for the physical response to occur, but the researchers believe this illusion demonstrates how our brains compensate for the processing time needed to visually perceive the world around us in real-time, and that certain involuntarily reflexes aren’t necessarily controlled by someone’s physical reality.\nIt’s a type of optical illusion that has come to be known as “perceiving-the-present,” which was first named back in 2008. As fast as we think our brains are at processing what we perceive, it can actually take around 100 milliseconds to make sense of the data generated when light hits our retinas. Someone walking slowly can cover as much as 10 centimeters during that time, which is not insignificant, and demonstrates why our brains have needed to develop these compensation mechanisms and frequently make predictions as to what we’re perceiving and what we will be perceiving momentarily.\nAnother image that demonstrates this phenomenon is Akiyoshi Kitaoka’s “Asahi” illusion of brightness. Our brains perceive the white at the middle of the illusion as being much brighter than the white surrounding it, when in reality they both have the exact same RGB values, and the brightness of the image is completely uniform. Researchers have also found that a subject’s pupils will contract when observing this illusion, even when the lighting in the environment they’re physically in doesn’t change.\nIt’s believed that this illusion causes a physical pupil reaction because the brain is attempting to protect the retina from the sudden glare of a bright light, which can not only temporarily inhibit our ability to see but also potentially damage the retina. The centre of the Asahi illusion is no brighter than its other white areas, but the arrangement of shapes and the dark-to-light gradients create a perceptual correlation to walking through a forest dense with trees and occasionally catching glimpses of the bright sun through the leaves. Even though the observer isn’t actually at risk of looking at the sun, this is what the brain is predicting will happen, and the pupils react accordingly.\nIn the case of the back hole illusion, researchers found that observers’ pupils expanded when looking at the image, as their brains likely perceived them to be physically moving toward a space that was considerably darker than their current environment. The brain was preemptively compensating by making the eyes ready to gather more light. The illusion of forward movement is thanks in part to the black blob’s softened edges, which create the appearance of motion blur; that’s why observers see the black blob as growing, the same thing one would see when walking towards a dark cave, for example.\nIt’s slightly disconcerting that, at any given time, what we think we’re really seeing could be just an educated guess that our brain is making about what we might be seeing 100 milliseconds from now — and that those educated guesses can trigger involuntarily physical responses. What’s also intriguing is that roughly 86% of the people the team studied had the physical pupil response, and they’re not exactly sure why 14% did not. What makes those people different, and does that put them at a disadvantage when it comes to navigating the world?","MacKay RaysThis illusion, created in 1957 by neuroscientist Donald M. MacKay (then at King's College London in England), shows that simple patterns of regular or repetitive stimuli, such as radial lines (called \"MacKay rays\") can induce the perception of shimmering or illusory motion at right angles to those of the pattern. To see the illusion, look at the center of the circle and notice the peripheral shimmering.\nBBC WallboardThis illusion has its origin as a chance observation. MacKay first observed this effect on the wallboard of a BBC studio: the broadcasting staff had been annoyed by illusory shadows running up and down blank strips between columns of parallel lines.\nThe Enigma IllusionOp artist Isia Leviant unknowingly combined the MacKay Rays and the BBC wallboard illusion in the now classic Enigma illusion.�Several original Leviant paintings illustrating this effect hang in the San Francisco Exploratorium, including its very first version (known as the Traffic Illusion). As you view the Enigma image, notice how the concentric purple rings appear to fill with rapid circular motion, as if millions of tiny and barely visible cars were driving hell-bent-for-leather around a track. But does the illusion originate in the mind or in the eye? The evidence was conflicting until we found, in collaboration with our neuroscientist colleagues Xoana G. Troncoso and Jorge Otero-Millan, at the Barrow Neurological Institute in Phoenix, Arizona, that the illusory motion is driven by microsaccades: small, involuntary eye movements that occur during visual fixation. The precise brain mechanisms leading to the perception of the illusion are still unknown, however. One possibility is that microsaccades produce small shifts in the geometrical position of the peripheral portions of the image. The reversals in contrast that these shifts produce could then create the illusion of motion. Neuroscientist and artist Bevil Conway and his colleagues at Harvard Medical School recently showed that pairs of stimuli of different contrasts can generate motion signals in visual cortex neurons, and proposed that this neural mechanism may underlie the perception of illusory motion in certain static patterns.\nOp Art Is Alive and WellVision scientist Akiyoshi Kitaoka at the Ritsumeikan University in Kyoto, Japan, follows on the footsteps of the great op artists of some decades ago. Waterway Spirals is a compelling and powerful version of Leviant's Enigma. Notice the strong illusory motion along the blue spiraling stripe.\nChristmas LightsThe Christmas Lights illusion, by visual illusion artist Gianni A. Sarcone, is also based on Leviant's Enigma. Notice the appearance of a flowing motion along the green-yellow stripes.\nEnigmatic EyeLook at the center of the pupil and you will see the surrounding purple rings fill with rapid illusory motion. Neuroscientist and engineer Jorge Otero-Millan's tribute to Leviant features the illusory motion seen in Enigma, and it also reflects the role of eye movements in the perception of the illusion.\nBridget Riley's Motion IllusionsMost of the motion illusions featured in this slide show are potentially triggered by eye movements, both large and small. This pattern, by op artist Bridget Riley, gives the impression of fast spiraling motion as observers move their eyes around the image.\nBridget Riley's Motion IllusionsIn another tribute to Riley, vision scientist Nick Wade of the University of Dundee in Scotland created an example that features both streaming and shimmering motion, and it is reminiscent of various famous Riley artworks.\nThe Ouchi IllusionThis illusion is by op artist Hajime Ouchi. Move your head back and forth as you let your eyes wander around the image and notice how the circle and its background appear to shift independently of one another. Vision scientist Lothar Spillmann at the University of Freiburg in Germany stumbled upon the illusion while browsing Ouchi's book on Japanese Optical and Geometrical Art. Spillmann then introduced the Ouchi illusion to the vision sciences community, where it has enjoyed immense popularity.\nThe Ouchi IllusionThis illusion is a contemporary variation on the Ouchi pattern, by Kitaoka.\nMore of Kitaoka's Op ArtHatpin Urchin, by Kitaoka, dramatically demonstrates the importance of eye movements in the perception of this kinetic illusion.\nThe Rotating-Tilted-Lines illusionThe Rotating-Tilted-Lines Illusion, by vision scientists Simone Gori and Kai Hamburger, then at the University of Freiburg in Germany, is a novel variation of the Enigma effect and Bridget Riley's Blaze. To best observe the illusion, move your head closer and then farther away from your computer screen. As you approach the image, notice that the radial lines appear to rotate counterclockwise. As you move away from the image, they appear to rotate clockwise. This illusion was featured in the first edition of the Best Visual Illusion of the Year Contest (held August 23, 2005, in A Coru�a, Spain;).\nThe Rotating-Tilted-Lines illusionArtist Miwa Miwa's variant of the Rotating-Tilted-Lines illusion pays homage to \"Vertigo,\" the classic film by Alfred Hitchcock.\nCombination of the Rotating-Tilted-Lines and EnigmaGori and Hamburger's combination of the Rotating-Tilted-Lines and the Enigma illusion is both visually arresting and a powerful demonstration of illusory motion from a static pattern. The Enigma illusion, almost three decades after its creation in 1981 by Leviant, continues to inspire visual science as well the visual arts"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"opinion_recommendation"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:2295c093-f63b-4213-a878-62783e0b5c32>","<urn:uuid:762d5559-11bf-4b92-9396-ef0731a0a8fc>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do matte finishes compare between paper and stainless steel surfaces in terms of their resistance to fingerprints and smudges?","answer":"Matte finishes on both materials are more forgiving of fingerprints. For paper, matte finish is flat with little or no shine and is more forgiving of fingerprints, smudges and dust compared to glossy paper. Similarly, for stainless steel, a matte coating (fingerprint-resistant) requires less maintenance than regular stainless steel and is specifically treated to be less susceptible to fingerprints and smudges.","context":["What is the difference between Text, Book, Bond, Offset, Cover, Bristol, Index, Tag, and Card paper?\nPaper can be grouped into two main grades based on weight and thickness: Text and Cover.\n\"Text\" is a generic name for a variety of lighter, thinner paper stocks\nthat includes Book, Bond, Writing, Ledger, Offset paper. Text paper is\nflexible, can be easily rolled and folded and is used for printing\nflyers, handouts, letterheads, book pages, etc. The paper used in ink\njet printers would be considered Text.\n\"Cover\" is a generic name for a variety of heavier and thicker paper\nstocks that includes Bristol, Index, Tag, and Card paper. It is more\ndurable than Text paper. Cover paper is more rigid and must be scored\n(i.e., dented or creased) before it can be folded. This type of paper is\nusually smooth, but can have a texture. It can have either a matte or\nglossy appearance. Cover/Card stock is often used for mass mailed\npostcards, business cards, playing cards, invitations, program covers,\ngreeting cards, door hangers, catalogue covers, presentation covers,\nscrapbooking, etc. At its heaviest, Card stock would be similar to\nmaterial used for a cereal box.What's the difference between gloss and matte paper?\nPaper with a gloss finish is smooth and shiny while matte paper is flat\nwith little or no shine. Gloss stock makes colors look smoother, deeper,\nricher, with great color-contrast. Photo's and graphics tend to look\nbetter on gloss stock, while text heavy documents and artwork are often\nuse matte stock.\nText is more easily read on paper with a matte finish. The softer\nlooking dull surface of matte paper provides color contrast and clarity.\nUnlike glossy paper, matte stock is more forgiving of fingerprints,\nsmudges and dust.What's the difference between lb, #, gsm, g/m2 and g/m2?\nBesides a generic \"Text\" weight or \"Cover\" weight, descriptions often\ninclude a number to refer to the weight of the paper. The higher the\nnumber, the heavier the paper. Heavier paper is typically thicker as\nThere are two systems for indicating the weight of paper; an\ninternational metric system and a North American system. The North\nAmerican system for paper weight uses pounds (expressed as either # or\nlb) while the metric system uses grams per square meter (gsm or g/m2 or\n), often called \"grammage\". The North American pound\nrating is based on the weight of 500 sheets (a.k.a. a ream), while the\nmetric rating is based on the weight of a 1 meter by 1 meter sheet.\nThe U.S. system is a bit confusing because the same pound number can be\nused for both lighter (Text) paper and heavier (Cover) paper. For\nexample, 80# Text paper and 80# Cover paper have the same pound number\neven though the Cover stock is almost twice as heavy! The metric system\nin comparison is more straight forward. For example, 80# Text Paper\nweighs 104 g/m2\nwhile 80# Cover Stock weighs 218 g/m2\n. The Cover stock is clearly more than twice as heavy as the Text stock.\nThe reason actual weight of Text and Cover stock of the same pound\nrating will be different is due to the way the pound rating is\ndetermined. Both use the weight of 500 sheets for the pound rating, but\nthey use a different size sheet. For Text stock, 500 sheets measuring\n25\" x 38\" are used.

Wiping them off with a dry cloth doesn’t seem to get the job done.\nIt is why you go for fingerprint-resistant stainless steel. The matte coating on these kitchen wares requires extra care when cleaning.\nKnowing how to clean fingerprint-resistant stainless steel in the kitchen is, therefore, necessary.\nStill, the good news is that fingerprint-resistant stainless steel requires less maintenance than regular stainless steel.\nThis informative guide will show you just that.\nHow To Clean Fingerprint Resistant Stainless Steel In Kitchen – What You Need\nFingerprint-resistant stainless steel, also known as smudge-proof steel, is a type of stainless steel that has been treated to make it less susceptible to fingerprints and smudges.\nEven though they are more durable than other types of coatings, they still require some maintenance to keep them looking good and lasting longer.\nThere are a few Dos and Don’ts for cleaning solvents for these wares. You cannot use all cleaning agents when cleaning fingerprint-resistant stainless steel in your kitchen.\nHere are a few that works best.\nBaking Soda Cleaner\nThis cleaning solution comes in a powdery form. The powder has a smooth texture.\nThis smoothness makes it easy to use on the stainless steel without scratching the surface.\nAsides from removing grease, the degreaser also removes stains from stainless steel surfaces. It causes no harm or irritation to the skin or exterior.\nA mild soap removes stains from kitchen stainless steel without causing any harm to the surface.\nWhen choosing this type of cleaning agent, ensure it doesn’t have ammonia (a colorless gas with an irritating odor that can cause skin burn).\nA microfiber cloth is a non-abrasive tool that makes cleaning easy. It is usually thick enough to absorb water and clean dirt.\nThe water you mix with your cleaning solution should be lukewarm. If you use cold water, it will make the cleaning agent less efficient.\nIf you use hot water, it won’t be easy to dip the kitchen towel.\nHow To Clean Fingerprint Resistant Stainless Steel In Kitchen – What You Shouldn’t Use\nYou don’t just use any material or tool you find to clean stainless steel. Some do not work well on stainless steel surfaces in the kitchen and can cause extreme damage if used.\nBleach is very toxic to surfaces because it is corrosive. Its aggressive nature reduces the quality of the stainless steel and makes it look dull.\nAside from that, it scratches the surface and makes it easy for stains to stick to.\n2. Steel Brushes\nWhen you use a wet cloth to clean stains off your kitchen stainless steel, the iron teeth scratch the surface and make it easy for rust to form.\n3. Scouring Powder\nScouring powder is a mixture of detergent and abrasive powder. If you use this cleaning solution to clean your stainless steel surface, it will scratch the surface.\n4. Highly Concentrated Detergent\nUsing a highly concentrated detergent to wipe the stainless steel surface in your kitchen could cause damage. Detergents contain harmful chemicals that can damage the stainless steel surface.\nThese steps are versatile. You can apply them on any stainless steel surface in your kitchen – your stainless pots, refrigerator, sink, kettle, plates, etc.\nMethod 1 – Glass Cleaner Kitchen Cleaning Solution\n- Ensure your glass cleaner does not contain ammonia because it can easily damage the stainless steel surface.\n- Get a clean bowl and pour in warm water.\n- Put three drops of your glass cleaner on the surface of your microfiber cloth.\n- Use the part you added the glass cleaner to clean the stainless steel surface that has fingerprints on it.\n- Next, soak your clean microfiber cloth in and allow for three minutes.\n- Pick it out and begin to wipe the surface again.\n- After cleaning the entire surface, dip another clean microfiber cloth into another bowl of warm water without a glass cleaner. This part is the rinsing stage.\n- Finally, use a dry microfiber cloth to wipe off the water on the stainless steel surface.\nMethod 2 – Mild Soap Kitchen Cleaning Agent\n- Get a bowl of warm water.\n- Put the mild soap inside and shake slightly to make it foam.\n- Dip the microfiber cloth inside, pull it out and squeeze out the water a little.\n- Use the wet cloth to clean the stainless steel surface.\n- Once done, dip another microfiber cloth inside another bowl of warm water that’s not soapy. Then, use it to wipe the surface.\n- Use a dry cloth to dry the surface.\nMethod 3 – Degreaser Cleaning Solution\n- Put drops of the degreaser on your microfiber cloth, then use it to clean the stainless steel surface at intervals(put a little drop and clean, then put another drop and clean till you’ve completed the process.\n- Dip the cloth into a bowl of warm water. Take it out and squeeze the water, then use it to wipe the surface.\n- If the stains do not go, apply the grease again and wipe. (ensure not to put the grease directly on the stainless steel surface).\n- Once the entire surface is clean, dip the microfiber cloth into non-grease warm water, then use it to wipe the stainless steel surface.\n- Finally, use a dry cloth to dry the exterior.\nMethod 4 – Baking Soda Kitchen Cleaner\nCleaning your kitchen stainless steel with baking soda is preferred if the stain is tough (mostly oil stain). For this process, you won’t use a microfiber cloth but foam.\n- Wear gloves to protect your hands.\n- Wet the stainless steel surface with water to enable the baking soda cleaner to stick.\n- Sprinkle the cleaning soda on the wet surface, then use the foam to scrub.\n- Next, dip the foam into a bowl of warm water and use it to wipe the surface.\n- Repeat the process till the fingerprint is gone.\nMethod 5 – Vegetable Or Olive Oil Cleaning Agent\n- Wipe the stainless steel surface dry.\n- Dip your microfiber cloth into a bowl of warm water.\n- Apply the vegetable or olive oil to the dry stainless steel surface, then use the wet microfiber cloth to wipe the surface.\n- Mix mild soap into the bowl of warm water, then dip in the cloth and use it to clean the stainless steel surface.\n- Get warm water.

{"question":"What are the different types of transported soil, and what health risks do they pose when combined with pesticides?","answer":"There are four main types of transported soil: 1) Water transported soil, which moves through rivers and streams as suspended particles, forming alluvial and lacustrine soils, 2) Wind transported soil, common in arid regions where fine-grained soils are moved by wind, forming dunes in desert regions, 3) Glacial deposits, which form when glaciers melt and transport soil materials, and 4) Gravity deposits, also known as colluvial soil, which moves soil short distances through gravitational force. When these soils combine with pesticides, they can pose significant health risks. Pesticides can be carried inside homes on shoes and mix with house dust, potentially harming children who crawl on the ground. Additionally, rain and irrigation can wash pesticides from these soils into streams, harming aquatic life. Some pesticide residues may remain in soil from weeks to over a year, sometimes breaking down into toxic and persistent chemicals.","context":["What Is Transported Soil?\nSoil is formed through the process of weathering of the rocks, and it’s essential to understand how are soils transported. Soil is a natural resource which is present on our earth. Weathering of the soil is the physical breakdown and chemical alteration of the earth materials at the surface level. In the process of weathering the rocks get breakdown into the smaller particles when they come in contact with the air-water or any other agent.\nIt is very important for Civil Engineers to study the different types of soil and their mode of transportation from one place to another place. Because Civil engineer has to deal with Foundation Engineering while constructing the structures.\nIn this article, you will get to know all about the residual and transported soil and the Difference between the Residual soil and transported soil.\nAlso, Read: 10 Best Cement Companies In India\nOn the basis of the method of forming the soil get classified into the following types\n- Residual soil\n- Transported soil\nTransported Soil Definition\nTransported soils are those materials that have been moved from their place of origin, by gravity, wind, water, glaciers, or human activity either singularly or in combination.\nThe method of transportation and deposition has a great effect on the properties of the resulting soil mass.\nTransported soil is a type of soil which is formed by the deposition of the weathered soil which is transported from one place to another place with the help of natural agents like water, wind and glaciers\nTransported soil is formed at one place but transported and deposited at another place. Transported soil is developed by weathering of the sediment.\nClassification of Transported Soil\nThe transported Soil is classified depending on the mode of transportation of the soil which is listed are as follows\n- Water transported soil\n- Wind transported soil\n- Glacial deposits\n- Gravity Deposits\n1. Water Transported Soil\n- The water formed transported soil is transported by the flowing water through the river, valleys, and streams.\n- Soil may be transported in the form of suspended particles through stream and rivers.\n- When the velocity of the flowing water is more, then the large size of particles move from one place to another.\n- The soil which is Transported and deposited by the rivers are known as alluvial soil. The soil which is transported by the lake is known as Lacustrine soil.\n2. Wind Transported soil\n- The soil particles which is transported with the help of wind from one place to another is known as wind transported soil.\n- In arid regions, fine-grained soils such as silt and clay are Transported by the wind.\n- In the desert regions, there is the formation of dunes due to deposition of soil like coarse sand.\n3. Glacial Deposits\n- Glacial deposits from a very large group of Transported soil. Due to the melting of the glacier which causes deposition of all materials.\n- The Glacial soil has good shear strength and it can be compacted as required density. The Glaciers are the huge mass of ice which moves towards land due to melting.\n- This glaciers also Transported soil with them from one place to another place due to the melting of ice.\n- This type of soil which is transported by the Glaciers is known as Glacial soil.\n4. Gravity Deposits\n- The soil, including types like talus is the soil transported by, can also be transported by means of gravity. Gravity can transport the soil only at a short distance.\n- The soil which is Transported with the help of gravity is known as Talus. This includes the deposits by the landslides.\n- It is also known as Colluvial soil which is deposited by the gravitational force. It generally consists of the coarse grained particles.\n- The Soil transported by the gravity contains different size and shape of grain particles. The movement in the case of gravity Deposits soil is less due to no external forces to move soil at a long distance.\nWhat Is Residual Soil?\nWhen we define residual soil, it is the material resulting from the in situ weathering of the parent rock. Residual soils are distributed throughout many regions of the world, such as Africa, South Asia, Australia, Southeastern North America, Central and South America, and considerable regions of Europe\nHow Is Transported Soil Is Different from Residual Soil?\nThe characteristics of the residual soil depend on the type of parent rock. Residual soil stays at its parent rock whereas the transported soil moved away from its parent rock.\nResidual soil has better engineering properties as compared to the transported soil. The soil which is deposited in its original parent rock is known as the residual soil.\nResidual Soil and Transported Soil\n- Soil is formed by the weathering action and get transported from one place to another by the various transportation agencies by wind, water, glacier and gravity. This soil gets deposited at one place and known as transported soil.\n- Residual soil mostly found at the location where it formed. Generally, the residual soil depth varies from 5 m to 20 m. residual soils comprise of the wide range of the particles, shapes and composition.\n- Residual soil is the weathering product of the rocks which are found under unsaturated conditions.\n- The residual soil is formed from the weathering action of the Bedrock present below. The texture and the composition of the residual soil reflect in their parent rock.\n- The ‘transported soil’ the name itself suggests it’s meaning that it is a soil which is transported from one place to another place.\n- The method of transportation and deposition of the transported soil greatly affects its properties. Wind transported soil also formed Dunes. The sand which is deposited by the wind in the desert on the beach areas known as dunes.\nWhat Is the Difference Between Residual Soil and Transported Soil?\nTo distinguish between transported and residual soil, the differences are as follows\n|Sr.No.||Residual Soil||Transported soil|\n|1||Residual soil is a type of soil which remains at the location of its formation.||Transported soil is a soil which moves from one place to another place|\n|2||Residual soil does not move away from its parent rock.||Transported soil move away from its parent rock.|\n|3||Residual soil contains different types of grain particles.||In the Transported soil weak grain particles are get omitted.|\n|4||Mineral composition in the residual soil will remain the same.||The soil mineral composition will vary in the Transported soil.|\n|5||The parent material is the original rock in the residual soil.||Different parent material has been mixed in the Transported soil.|","The Grow Smart, Grow Safe® consumer guide to lawn and garden products is a project of Thurston County Environmental Health in Olympia, Washington. The information below comes directly from the Grow Smart, Grow Safe website.\nHow can we reduce the danger of pesticides?\nIncreasing the demand for safer products will encourage manufacturers to make products that are safer and more environmentally sound. You can have an attractive landscape without using hazardous pesticides. Use effective non-chemical methods and less-hazardous products instead.\nLearn about pesticide ratings, how to choose safer products, and ways to care for your lawn and garden naturally at growsmartgrowsafe.org.\nPesticides, human health and the environment\nPesticides include some of the most hazardous chemicals commonly used in and around the home. Products that kill insects, weeds, bacteria and fungi may be hazardous to children, pets, birds, fish, other wildlife, and also to beneficial insects like bees and lady bugs. Pesticides used in the yard or at the workplace can be carried inside on shoes and work clothes and mix with house dust. Young children, who crawl on the ground and put objects in their mouths, can then ingest the chemicals. Rain and irrigation wash pesticides off of yards and carry them to streams, sometimes in amounts that can harm salmon or the aquatic organisms that are their food.\nPesticides and children\nIn 2009, United States poison centers had over 90,000 incidents related to acute exposures to pesticides - about 45% involved children under the age of six. Children are vulnerable to repeated, very small, unintended exposure to pesticides. Per pound of body weight, pesticides have a greater effect on children’s growing bodies and developing nervous and hormonal systems and organs.\nDanger to pets\nMany pesticide products are toxic to dogs, cats and other pets. The risks can be similar to the human health risks. Pets with access to treated landscapes may pick up pesticide residues on their paws and fur, licking it or tracking it into the house. Slug bait containing metaldehyde poses a special risk because dogs are attracted to it and may eat enough to be seriously injured or even die.\nToxicity to birds and bees\nMost insecticides are toxic to beneficial insects, bees and other pollinators, and some insecticides are toxic to birds. Insecticides can kill bees directly when they eat or even just land on treated plants. Foraging bees can carry pesticides back to their hives, threatening the entire colony. Some researchers believe that pesticide use may be implicated in honey bee colony collapse disorder.\nMany insecticides and herbicides are toxic to fish, amphibians and other aquatic organisms. Aquatic organisms come into contact with pesticides and fertilizers through irrigation or stormwater runoff from yards and other landscapes. Pesticide ingredients that don’t bind well to soil and are persistent in the environment pose the greatest risk to water pollution. Monitoring studies in the Puget Sound region have found common pesticides and fertilizer nutrients in many of our waterways.\nThe longer a pesticide remains in the environment, the more likely it is to do damage. Older products, like DDT, are still in the environment and in our bodies almost 40 years after their last uses were banned. Many modern pesticides breakdown faster, however most pesticides are not gone after a month or two, and may not be harmless just because the treated area has dried. Some pesticide residues may remain in soil, sediment or water from weeks to over a year or more, and sometimes they breakdown to chemicals that are toxic and persistent.\nHow do I know which products are safer?\nLearn how to read a pesticide label, which chemicals are lowest risk, how to handle and dispose of pesticides, and how to avoid the need for pesticides altogether at www.growsmartgrowsafe.org."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"opinion_recommendation"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:e4645780-e5ce-4db8-adde-3850b3f7a85c>","<urn:uuid:ecd62e19-7b14-4024-93f6-ba091430d7c5>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the legal liability aspects and operating agreement requirements for LLCs?","answer":"For liability purposes, individual members of an LLC are generally not personally liable for lawsuits against the LLC. While an operating agreement is not required to be filed with state registrars, it is crucial for protecting members from liability through its liability and indemnification clause. Without an operating agreement, the LLC could be viewed as a partnership or sole proprietorship, potentially exposing members to personal liability. The operating agreement must include six primary articles covering organization, management and voting, capital contributions, distributions, membership changes, and dissolution. This document sets verbal agreements in writing, protects members from liability, and ensures the business isn't governed by state default rules.","context":["When you decide to start a business, you have many decisions to make. Arguably the most important decision you will make is which form of a business entity to establish. There are many entities to choose from and each will have its own advantages and disadvantages. Evaluate each option from a tax standpoint and assess any legal liability considerations when determining which will best fit your business.\nCreating a Sole Proprietorship\nThe Sole Proprietorship is a very common business structure because it is the easiest to form and to create. A sole proprietor is an individual that owns an unincorporated business by himself. All of the profits and losses of the sole proprietorship are treated as the income or losses of the individual owner for tax purposes, and must be reported on the owner’s income tax return. Since the sole proprietorship is an unincorporated business, there is no corporate tax.\nFrom a legal standpoint, the sole proprietorship does not exist as a separate entity from the owner of the business, whereas other business structures (such as corporations) exist as separate legal entities. The main area of concern with regard to a sole proprietorship is with liability. With a sole proprietorship, if someone wishes to file a lawsuit against the business, they are essentially suing the business owner, and the business owner will be personally liable for the lawsuit. In contrast, with a corporation, if someone wishes to sue the corporation, that person is suing only the corporation, and generally the shareholders will not be personally liable for the lawsuit.\n1Consider writing a business plan. A business plan details how your business will run. While this step is not required to operate a sole proprietorship, it will help you to plan your business.\n2File for a “Doing Business As” (DBA) Certificate. If you wish to conduct business under a name that is not your own, you must obtain a certificate to do so. You may file for a DBA at your local county clerk’s office building by filling out a form and paying a fee. If you are doing business under your given name (not giving your business a separate name) you do not need a DBA.\n3Begin conducting business. As a sole proprietor, your business does not technically exist from a legal standpoint, and therefore you need not file any paperwork to get it started.\n4Report your business profits and losses on your personal tax return.\nCreating a Limited Liability Company (“LLC”)\nAn LLC is an unincorporated business, but has more protections (hence the limited liability) than the sole proprietorship. To create an LLC, a business owner must file documents and pay fees in the state where it wishes to form. Note that not every state has the LLC as an available business structure.\nAs with the sole proprietorship, the profits and losses of the business pass through to the members of the LLC, thus avoiding corporate taxes. Each member of the LLC will report the income and losses of the LLC on their individual tax return and be taxed at their individual tax rate.\nAccording to the federal government, the LLC does not exist separately from the individual members. For liability purposes, however, individual members of the LLC will generally not be personally liable for a lawsuit against the LLC. This is the main advantage over the sole proprietorship.\n1Consider writing a business plan.\n2File organizational documents with your state. Not all states offer the LLC as a business entity, so be sure to check with your state’s Department of State before deciding on this structure. Then determine which documents you will be required to file. Generally the documents include Articles of Organization and some states may also require you to publish notice of your business formation in local newspapers. You will also likely have to pay a fee.\n3Draft and adopt an Operating Agreement. An operating agreement is generally an internal document that is not filed with the state, however you may be required to have one by your state. Even if not required, it is a good idea to draft an operating agreement because it details exactly how your business will run, from the type of business you decide to operate to handling payroll and who will receive what share of profits and losses.\n4Operate your business.\n5Report your business profits and losses on your personal tax return.\nCreating a Corporation\nA corporation is an incorporated business where shareholders put money and/or property into the business in exchange for shares of the corporation’s stock. A corporation is often a large business with several different shareholders. Forming a corporation requires filing documents with the state and the federal government. A disadvantage of a corporation is that this business structure requires the owners to comply with many state- and federally-mandated corporate formalities.\nFor tax purposes, the corporation is taxed twice: once at the corporate level and again at the individual level. This double taxation is often viewed as the main disadvantage of the corporate business structure. The federal government recognizes a corporation as a separate legal entity, which can be an advantage of the corporation business structure.\nFor legal liability purposes, the corporation structure enjoys the benefits of being a separate legal entity, and thus the shareholders of the corporation are generally not liable for lawsuits against the corporation.\n1Choose a name for your corporation. States generally place restrictions on the words that may or may not be used in the name of a corporation. Generally the name must include the word ‘incorporated’ or ‘inc.’ or some other indicia that the business is a corporation.\n2Determine who will be the initial directors of the corporation. The initial board of directors is composed of those individuals in charge of getting the corporation up and running. They will authorize the issuance of stock and pick officers of the corporation, two of the most important decisions the corporation will make.\n3File incorporation documents with your state. These are usually called articles of incorporation and are generally accompanied by a filing fee. Your state’s secretary of state or department of state office will likely have an approved form that you may fill out or you may draft your own. Articles of incorporation generally include the name of the corporation, its address, and the name and contact information for a person to whom members of the public can contact regarding that corporation.\n4Draft corporate bylaws. These are analogous to the operating agreement that an LLC operates under. Corporate bylaws will include additional information such as how shares of stock will be voted, how directors are chosen, etc. Usually you may use a template for the bylaws or draft your own.\n5Hold an initial board meeting and adopt the bylaws. At this meeting the initial board of directors will adopt the bylaws, elect officers, authorize the issuance of stock, and determine how to handle certain financial or tax issues such as the corporation’s fiscal year.\n6Issue shares of stock. In order to officially be a corporation you must issue stock, as this formalizes the division of the ownership of the business.\nCreating a Subchapter S Corporation\nThe S Corporation is a tax election that an existing corporation makes. Essentially, it avoids the double taxation of regular corporations by electing to have the taxes pass through the corporation to the shareholders. Each shareholder will report the S corporation’s profits and losses on their own individual tax return. The S Corporation has a number of restrictions on the type of business the corporation can engage in, the number of shareholders, and the type of stock issues.\nThe S Corporation enjoys the same legal liability status of other corporations.\n1Form a corporation. Since a Subchapter S Corporation is a tax election that a corporation makes, the first step to creating an S Corporation is to create a corporation. Follow the steps outlined above.\n2File Form 2553 with the IRS. The form is available on the IRS website.\n3Approve the S Corporation tax election at the initial board meeting. There must be unanimous consent by the board in order to make the S Corporation tax election.\n- Always check with your state regarding the requirements for forming a business in that state. Most states’ Department of State or Secretary of State websites will contain information about the process.","If you’re creating a new company, the business structure you choose impacts your personal liability, taxes, paperwork, and your ability to raise capital. For example, a limited liability company (LLC) is a less formal business structure that increases personal protection from liability.\nBut selecting a business structure is not as simple as declaring your company as an LLC; there are legal documents and paperwork that must be filled out and signed by the key members of the company.\nThis brings us to the operating agreement (OA), which outlines the company’s leadership structure, ownership, rules, regulations, and provisions. Once signed, it binds members to its terms.\nCurious why an operating agreement matters and what needs to be included for it to be legitimate? We’ll break it down for you.\nWhat is an operating agreement?\nAn operating agreement is an official contract, enforced by law, that addresses many of the situations that could happen to the company, and lays out the proper actions to take should those circumstances occur.\n- What if a member leaves? What happens to their ownership stake?\n- What if a member doesn’t want to be involved in day-to-day management?\n- What if a member is sued?\nThus, an operating agreement establishes several aspects of the LLC membership, including their:\nAlthough no state in the country legally requires an LLC to file their operating agreement with the state registrars’ office, certain states dictate that you need to have an operating agreement for your business records.\nFor example, California states,1 “Operating Agreements are to be maintained by the limited liability company and are not filed with the California Secretary of State. Please do not submit Operating Agreements for filing; if they are submitted, they will be returned unfiled.”\nWhat does an operating agreement include?\nAlthough operating agreements vary, most will contain six primary articles, including:\n- Article I – Organization – Covers the creation of the business. It addresses the whos, whats, whens, whys, and wheres. This will cover:\n- The LLC’s name\n- Details about the Articles of Organization, which will be filed with the state registrar\n- Address of the LLC’s principal office\n- Duration of the LLC, which will either be until a specific date or “until dissolved”\n- Stated purpose of the business\n- Name and address of the registered agent, who will be receiving legal notices and correspondences\nIt will cover membership in detail, including ownership and how profits, losses, and taxes will be dispersed between members. It will also spell out how new members can be added.\nArticle II – Management and voting – Addresses how the company will be managed and how its members can vote on business issues. Members may appoint a single (or multiple) manager(s), and then the OA establishes their authority.\nAnother option is to have all company decisions made by a voting process. In this case, the OA would stipulate how the voting process works, how much a person’s vote counts, or how many votes are required for an action to take place.\nArticle III – Capital contributions – Highlights which members have provided capital to help start the LLC. It also covers how new money can be raised by members.\nArticle IV – Distributions – Details how the business’ profits, losses, and other assets will be dispersed between members.\nArticle V – Membership changes – Clearly explains how members can be added or removed. It also handles how ownership can be transferred.\nArticle VI – Dissolution – Lists the reasons or times when the company may or must be dissolved.\nWhy an operating agreement matters\nAt its essence, an operating agreement is all about providing clarity. Getting into business with others can be messy, complicated, and lead to internal disagreements. An operating agreement clearly states the rules and provisions so that every member is on the same page. Once it’s signed by the members, it officially binds them to its terms.\nSo, what are the benefits of an operating agreement?\nSets verbal agreements in stone – In the early stages of a business, many of the plans are based on handshake agreements. Because miscommunication can happen, this can lead to misunderstandings or disagreements (where one side thinks they were promised something and the other side disagrees). When put in writing, the agreements are clearly stipulated and can be referenced if a conflict comes up.\nProtects the members from liability – It’s important to note that all operating agreements must include a liability and indemnification clause, which includes legal language stating that members of the company have limited liability for the actions they take on behalf of the company.\nWithout the specific formality of an operating agreement, members might not have coverage since the LLC could be viewed as a partnership or sole proprietorship.\nMake your business agreement official in the eyes of the government – Although you’re not legally required to file an OA with the state, having one ensures that your agreement isn’t managed by the state’s default rules—which govern LLCs that lack an OA.\nPut simply, it’s a risky decision to run a business without a signed, physical operating agreement. Without it, you are personally exposed to liability and several other potential headaches surrounding ownership and member’s rights. So, work with an experienced attorney to ensure that everything is in place and that you have all of your bases covered.\nBusiness liability coverage\nOnce your operating agreement is set in stone, the next step you can take to protect both yourself and your business is to purchase the right insurance. So, if you need general liability insurance or professional liability insurance, you’re in the right place.\nThimble offers our customers on-demand policies that go by the hour, day, or month.

{"question":"How will knowledge-based manufacturing evolve in smart factories, and what are the primary safety inspection considerations for automated systems?","answer":"Knowledge-based manufacturing in smart factories will require enhanced understanding at three levels: the plant as a whole, end-to-end production processes, and automation supporting each process. This evolution emphasizes industrial education and training, with companies investing in technical training programs for electronics, electrical, and mechanical engineering. Regarding safety inspections, OSHA inspectors are being specifically trained to identify hazards around industrial robots. During inspections, they primarily check for compliance with Lockout/Tagout regulations (1910.147), Machine Safeguarding (1910.212), and the General Duty Clause. Inspectors typically request recent risk assessments and may contact original equipment manufacturers to verify safety standards, particularly during non-routine operating conditions.","context":["Festo invests in future smart factory vision\nSmart Factory, Industry 4.0, Smart Manufacturing: these and other largely vendor-driven collaborations around the world have the same overriding objective – to develop smart manufacturing technologies that take plant-wide productivity to new heights.0\nThe excitement being generated by this movement has some manufacturers concerned that change is coming too fast. Dr. Eberhart Veit, CEO of global automation giant Festo, offers this reassurance: Change is going to be evolutionary, not revolutionary, and very customer-centric. Only those smart technologies offering “true customer benefits” will succeed.\nFesto expects to be workIng more closely than ever with customers tailoring these technologies to their needs. “Customers expect more and more customer-specific solutions,” says Dr. Veit. “They are not willing to take standard ones, and they will not wait.”\nFesto is participating in Germany’s Industry 4.0 initiative while making major investments to reap its benefits. The company is building two facilities at a total cost of €108m ($153 million) that will increase its capability to design and test future automation technologies and processes, often in collaboration with customers.\nThough only partially completed, the high-rise Automation Centre already is the most visibly striking structure on the Festo campus in Esslingen, near Stuttgart. Nearby in Ostfildern-Scharnhausen, the Technology Plant will benchmark new products and processes.\nIn Festo’s vision of the future factory, control functions now residing at the top level of the automation pyramid will shift downwards, with intermediate components given the functionality to process orders dispatched from above. Such adaptive components will function collaboratively to form their own networks.\n(One example of how Festo is preparing for this: The company has embarked on a multi-year program to develop its existing CPX modular electrical terminal series into a common platform for electrical and pneumatic automation with a common software infrastructure for both technologies. This CPX will control all automated processes, while still interfacing perfectly well with top-level host systems.)\nFuture smart production technologies will be more economical, flexible and adaptable, faster to set up and more energy efficient. Yet workers won’t disappear from the shop floor. In fact, there will be increased opportunities for closer collaboration between humans and technology in the manufacturing environment through concepts such as collaborative robotics.\nCreating and commercializing these and other smart factory concepts will require changes of mindset. Greater inter-disciplinary collaboration will be paramount. “Closer collaboration will be required between the hardware designer and software programmer as devices become more intelligent,” says Dr. Veit, a mechatronic engineer himself.\nFuture manufacturing technology will be more knowledge-based, necessitating better knowledge management. It will be critically important to understand the factory on three levels – the plant as a whole, the end-to-end production processes within and the automation supporting each process.\nThat will place added emphasis on industrial education and training, an area in which the company already has a global presence through Festo Didactic, its industrial education division. Festo Didactic was further strengthened by the recent acquisition of North American-based Lab-Volt, a specialist in technical training and continuing education for electronics, electrical and mechanical engineering and telecommunications. The former Lab-Volt facility in Quebec City, which employs over 200, will play a major role in developing and producing training systems and education programs for the future factory.\nThis focus on education and training underscores Festo’s belief that the smart factory is a journey, not a destination. It will be continually evolving, and operators should take a long view about change. Festo has taken such a long view in product development through its unique Bionic Learning Network and Futures Concept.\nVisitors to major trade shows have seen Festo’s experimental SmartBird fly and Bionic Kangaroo jump, but what it really gets out of the Bionic Learning Network is greater understanding of how nature achieves perfection in areas important to future product development goals, such as lightweight design, functional integration, enhanced connectivity and energy efficiency. This knowledge is being applied to prototypes of products that will enable future factories to achieve new levels of proficiency or efficiency.\nFor example, developing a mechanical kangaroo is providing Festo with deeper knowledge about energy recovery and storage. In the wild, a kangaroo recovers and stores energy each time it lands, then utilizes it on the next jump. The Bionic Kangaroo’s jumping capability combines pneumatic and electric automation storage – including electrical drives for precise movements, pneumatic actuators for dynamic jumping, Achilles tendons to store energy and re-use it again for the next jump, valve sensors, CECC control system and a mobile energy supply.\nIf this research seems esoteric, some products based on these mechanical imitations of nature are being incorporated into commercial applications, or will be shortly.\nFesto’s award-winning Bionic Handling Assistant, inspired by the elephant trunk, is being adapted for use in robotic automation solutions. Its NanoForceGripper, inspired by the gecko, can grasp smooth-surface, fragile objects like drinking glasses or smartphone display modules with almost no expenditure of energy, making it a potential tool for enhanced pick and place systems.\nFesto sees products that owe their origin to the Bionic Learning Network effort becoming catalysts for major gains in manufacturing productivity that can make the smart factory of tomorrow an even smarter investment for plant operators.","- This editorial is filed under:\n- Automotive Component\n- Consumer Goods/Appliances\n- Life Sciences Pharma Biomed Medical Devices\n- Rubber & Plastics\n- Off-Road/Heavy Equipment\n- Robot Manufacturing\n- Building Products/Materials\n- Fabricated Metals\n- Printing & Publishing\n- Arc Welding\n- Wood Products\nAre You at Risk of OSHA Citations for Robot Safety?\nConversion Technology Posted 03/12/2019\nRobots have been a part of the industrial landscape for decades.

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is training their inspectors to be aware of these regulatory changes and become familiar with industrial robot use. Not being aware of your facility’s requirements or of the changes in robot regulations could cost you.\nRecently, CTI attended the annual International Robotics Safety Conference, hosted by the Robotics Industries Association (RIA). At the conference, we spoke with representatives from OSHA, who explained the plans and actions put in place to train inspectors to better identify the hazards around industrial robots, as well as a plan to work on updating regulations to better protect employees from these identified hazards.\nRobots are machines, and as such must be safeguarded in ways like those presented for any hazardous remotely controlled machine. As with any other machine, there are countless hazards that could be present in and around a robot system. These hazards could vary depending on the design of the robot cell, placement inside the facility, level of interaction with employees, program or software being run, or end effector being used. Some common hazards are slip, trip, and fall inside the cell, contact with moving parts, dropped parts or end effectors, being pinned by the robot arm, etc. These hazards could be magnified while in Teach mode, unless mechanical and engineering safeguards are in place. The most effective way of identifying hazards is by conducting a comprehensive risk assessment before the system is operational, and after all parts, guards, and work practices are in place.\nARE THERE ANY REGULATIONS FOR ROBOTS?\nWhile there is currently no OSHA standard specifically covering industrial robots, there are several consensus standards, that OSHA refers to, covering safeguarding performance criteria, risk assessment methodologies, and general safety requirements. Consensus standards are voluntary standards developed through the cooperation of multiple parties, typically governing agencies and industry groups, who have an interest in participating in the development and/or use of the standards. OSHA commonly refers to consensus standards when there is no specific regulation covering the topic (e.g. NFPA standards on combustible dust). OSHA is very aware that they do not know everything about every subject for every industry. RIA and the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) have put together the current robot safety standards and have partnered with the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) to further promote and update regulations on the topics related to robot safety.\nIf OSHA were to arrive at your facility and inspect a robot or robot system, the first thing the inspector would ask for is a copy of the last risk assessment conducted on the system. If a risk assessment has not been conducted on the system, they could push for a willful violation, as the risk assessment is required by law. Despite no standard in 29 CFR 1910 governing industrial robots, violations and citations can and have been issued on robot system. The primary regulations to be cited for violations with a robot system are Lockout/Tagout and the Control of Hazardous Energy (1910.147), Machine Safeguarding (1910.212), and the General Duty Clause (Section 5(a)(1)). OSHA does also regularly contact original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and robot system integrators to determine the level of safety provided at installation of the equipment as compared to the hazards present at the time of the inspection or injury. As is the way of industrial safety, the employer is the party with the legal responsibility to recognize and mitigate hazards in the workplace.\nHOW DOES OSHA SEE ROBOT SAFETY?\nOSHA’s view on robot safety is that if the employer is meeting the requirements of the consensus standards, specifically ANSI/RIA R15.06 – Safety Requirements for Robots and Robot Systems, then there will not be any issues. However, one of the primary findings from inspections is that, while machine safeguarding and the control of hazardous energy are typically front of mind for employers, comprehensive risk assessments are not being conducted or revised after the installation of new equipment. A risk assessment is required by R15.06 and specified further in ANSI/RIA B11.0 – Safety of Machinery – General Requirements and Risk Assessment. Some facilities have them done by the robot integrators and installers, but fail to conduct them after changes to equipment, policies or procedures, or tooling and layout specifications.\nMany robot accidents and violations do not usually occur during normal operation and practices. These incidents typically occur during non-routine operating conditions (e.g. programming, maintenance, setup, part/tool changes, and while in Teach mode). It is imperative to select an effective safety system for your robots that is based on all jobs and tasks conducted by the robot and within the robot system. This can be done through safety controls, limiting boundaries, safeguards, etc. Through a comprehensive risk assessment all tasks and corresponding hazards can be identified, hazard ratings applied, and corrective actions can be determined and prioritized.\nHOW TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE\nCTI has years of experience conducting both qualitative and quantitative risk assessments on robots and robot systems. CTI is also a member of the R15.06 rule making committee and is in contact with OSHA representative on how the updating of rules and regulations impact employers and industry sectors. Contact CTI for more information on risk assessments and how to ensure your facility’s industrial robots and robot systems are in compliance with all governing standards and regulations."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:82583fb5-9c9e-44fb-a18d-ab7fa6c4aa99>","<urn:uuid:19933ddd-652b-4e96-a35c-746807e8197e>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What was Frank Morgan's musical legacy as a saxophonist and how did his time in San Quentin prison shape his career?","answer":"Frank Morgan was considered Charlie Parker's protégé and one of the greatest alto sax players of his generation, known for his tender, melancholic tone and clarity. During his 30-year period of incarceration, much of it at San Quentin, he became a celebrity within the prison, performing in a 16-piece band called the San Quentin All-Stars alongside other notable musicians like Dexter Gordon. They wore prisoner-made tuxedos and performed for paying visitors, making the prison an entertainment destination. After his release and rehabilitation in the mid-1980s, Morgan experienced a remarkable career revival that lasted until his death in 2007.","context":["The late jazz saxophonist Frank Morgan’s tale of redemption from drug addict, conman and convict to beloved elder statesman of jazz. Produced by Michael Connelly.\nPacked with thrilling music, Sound of Redemption: The Frank Morgan Story is an absorbing documentary about a gifted alto sax player and Charlie Parker’s protégée, Frank Morgan. Morgan fell hard into heroin and got to be almost as good a conman and thief as he was a musician in order to feed his habit. The habit cost him 30 years of his life in and out of prison, most of it at San Quentin, where he performed in a big band with fellow junkie jazz musicians that grew famous in the Bay Area. To bring the past into the present, director NC Heikin brought an all-star band together into the “Q” for a concert. This hyper-emotional event forms the backbone of this riveting film.\n“2015 has been a great year for music docs, with films about Amy Winehouse, Nina Simone, Kurt Cobain and the Wrecking Crew all scoring with audiences and critics. And here, at year’s end, comes “Sound of Redemption” — as good as any.” – Los Angeles Times\n“it’s a fond and forgiving tribute to the man, filled with music that moves beyond happy and sad, and toward something like brilliance.” – New York Times\n“N.C. Heikin’s hurtin’ beauty of a doc”- The Village Voice\n“the film has a strong feel for the emotion behind Frank Morgan’s acclaimed bebop.” – The Hollywood Reporter\n“Heikin’s best inspiration is to stage and film a tribute concert at San Quentin. Grace Kelly’s tender “Over the Rainbow” solo might stir tears, and Heikin, unlike so many impatient directors, knows that in a doc about musicians, the music should breathe.” – LA Weekly\n“Sound of Redemption is a great documentary that paints a fascinating picture of a talented musician whose music helped him get through the most difficult years of his life.” – RedCarpetCrash.com\n“N.C. Heikin’s terrific music documentary interweaves a great concert by the late jazzman’s admirers and acolytes at the Bay Area prison with a stirring history of both the L.A. music scene and mid-century, African American show business in general. But really, the kickiest part is when it recounts the ingenious criminal schemes Morgan dreamed up to support his gargantuan heroin habit.” – Los Angeles Daily News\n“If you’re a Jazz fan but unfamiliar with the Charlie Parker protege Frank Morgan, “Sound of Redemption: The Frank Morgan Story” will school you on a saxophone virtuoso and convict who lived what sounds like four adventurous, glamorous, tragic lives while earning the title “the new Bird.” “Redemption” traces how deep the comparisons cut into Morgan’s psyche.” – RogerEbert.com\n“Morgan’s “redemption” came at a high price, and the film effectively balances realism and optimism in portraying his deeply troubled yet fulfilling life.” – Victor L. Schermer, All About Jazz\nA Note From Michael\nMy involvement in Sound of Redemption is purely an effort to honor an artist who inspired me and had a life message that is worth sharing around the world.\nI can’t say that Frank and I went way back as was the relationship with many of the people we have interviewed for the film. Though I first saw Frank on the stage about twenty years ago, it wasn’t until the last few years of his life that I started to personally get to know him. He was in his 70s, hunched over by time, but still playing and persevering. He had overcome many difficulties, from drug addiction to incarceration to the debilitating effects of a recent stroke. He had been through all of that and still had a beautiful smile and a beautiful sound. To me he was amazing.\nI would say the connection I had with Frank came down to one song. “Lullaby,” the short and somehow sad song written by pianist and longtime Frank Morgan collaborator George Cables, seared me from the first time I heard it more than twenty years ago. At the time I was putting together a character for a book I was writing. The character was a detective who was a loner and liked to listen to and draw inspiration from jazz. The character – I would name him Harry Bosch – had a particular affinity for the saxophone. Its mournful sound, like a human crying out in the night, was what he was drawn to. The detective saw the worst of humanity every day on the job. He found solace every night in the sound of the saxophone.\nAt the time, Frank Morgan had just put out his album Mood Indigo. It got solid reviews and a lot attention in the jazz world and beyond. I read about it and read about him. It was a perfect set up because Harry Bosch did more than simply listen to the music. He identified with the musicians. I wanted him to listen to musicians who had overcome the odds to make their music because Harry had overcome great odds himself. Frank, with his history, was a perfect candidate. I went out and got the album and as they say, the rest is history. I don’t think I had ever been so emotionally moved by a record. It begins and ends with a cut of “Lullaby.” The song is short but its message is strong. It contains everything about Frank and everything about Harry. Sad and mournful, yet strong and resilient. The song is relentless in Frank Morgan’s hands. The song pierced my heart. I knew I had found Bosch’s anthem. I started playing the song each day before writing. It inspired me as well as Harry Bosch.\nMany years later I got to tell Frank Morgan about the process I went through and how I discovered his sound and what it meant to both me and Harry Bosch. We were sitting in a restaurant in a hotel we were staying at in Boston. We had come in to appear together at the Berklee College of Music. Frank was going to give a master class to the saxophone students and then after we would be on stage together to talk about the symbiotic relationship between words and music. Frank was tired but happy. He talked about wanting to give back for what he considered a blessed life. He wanted to tell young musicians not to make the mistakes he had made.\nThe day after, as we rode in a car to the airport, Frank said he loved being with the young musicians and that he wanted to do it again. He said there were wonderful programs for young musicians in Indiana and New Orleans and other places. He wanted to go to them. He wanted us to go there and asked me to set it up. He said he already had a European tour scheduled but after that he’d be ready to go.\nWell, Frank did go to Europe but he got sick. We never made it to Indiana or New Orleans. He died shortly after he got back. I feel bad about what could have been, about the musicians Frank could have reached with his unique story. My hope is that this film will capture the essence of that story and spread Frank’s message further than he ever thought.\n– Michael Connelly","- Share this article on Facebook\n- Share this article on Twitter\n- Share this article on Email\n- Show additional share options\n- Share this article on Print\n- Share this article on Comment\n- Share this article on Whatsapp\n- Share this article on Linkedin\n- Share this article on Reddit\n- Share this article on Pinit\n- Share this article on Tumblr\nThe musical career of saxophonist Frank Morgan, who died in 2007 at 73, is notable on several counts, not least the 30-year gap between his first and second albums. With artistic flourishes, N.C. Heikin’s documentary portrait fits the exceptional life story into a biographical boilerplate that covers the general trajectory and turning points. Sound of Redemption: The Frank Morgan Story, which had its world premiere at the Los Angeles Film Festival, collects evocative archival material, including interviews with Morgan, and new commentary from friends and admirers that’s often incisive. But what makes the film memorable, and a must for jazz fans, is its deep feeling for Morgan’s playing and, especially, the 2012 concert that frames the story—in which six jazz luminaries paid tribute to Morgan at San Quentin, the California state prison where he spent a significant portion of three decades.\nPlaying professionally when still in his teens, Morgan was a spiritual son and artistic heir to bebop virtuoso Charlie “Bird” Parker, and considered by many the greatest alto sax player of his generation. But instead of picking up the mantle that seemed so clearly his, Morgan fell into a life of drug addiction, crime and incarceration.\nTelling the story of his promise, self-destruction and renewal, Heikin explores the jumping art-and-music scene of Los Angeles in the late ’40s and ’50s. Morgan had come out to the coast to join his father, guitarist Stanley Morgan, a member of the popular vocal group the Ink Spots. (Frank Morgan’s half-sister notes pointedly that their father had another, illicit occupation as well.) In the heyday of Central Avenue clubs, the young Morgan quickly drew attention, backing such major talents as Billie Holiday and winning a TV talent show whose prize, an engagement with an orchestra at the Palladium, was denied him because he wasn’t white.\nThe film’s interviewees acknowledge the painful effects of segregation and racism on many African American artists of the era. Some of Morgan’s fellow musicians discuss how they, as black males, were discouraged from attending college or even taking academic, rather than vocational, high school classes. Heroin’s role as an extreme analgesic is acknowledged too. For Morgan, the heroin use of his friend and idol Bird became something to emulate, along with his groundbreaking bebop (Bird disapproved).\nWith Parker’s death in 1955, Morgan lost not just his mentor but his sense of musical purpose, and the expectations surrounding the release of his debut album apparently scared more than excited him. He put his creative energies into larceny, robbing banks and kiting checks to maintain an expensive habit—represented in the film by faceless, soft-focus junkie enactments that are more conspicuous than helpful.\nMany of the details of his life remain out of focus as well. One interviewee is identified as Morgan’s eighth wife, but the only romantic relationship described is his marriage to painter Rosalinda Kolb, who appears in the film and was a crucial figure in his mid-’80s rehabilitation and career revival. That amounted to a remarkable second chance that kept him working for the remainder of his life.\nHeikin offers generous audio selections of Morgan’s playing—his tone is one of tender melancholy and clarity—but skimps on video performance clips. It’s disappointing that she doesn’t turn off the talking-heads commentary long enough to let a performance of Morgan’s play out in full, or at least at greater length than what’s offered here. It’s especially frustrating when she includes footage of his 1986 Village Vanguard show—an engagement that marked his comeback after 30 years and his New York debut—and cuts away from Morgan to include utterly unnecessary descriptions of how important the gig was and how well it went, rather than trusting the audience to experience it.\nBut in the tribute concert at San Quentin, intercut throughout the documentary, music does the talking. In a plain cinder-block room, a sextet headed by pianist George Cables and trombonist Delfeayo Marsalis plays songs that Morgan recorded, including tunes by Dizzy Gillespie, Thelonious Monk and McCoy Tyner. Saxophonist Grace Kelly, a protege of Morgan’s, brings down the house with a soulful “Over the Rainbow.” The musicians, who also include Ron Carter, Mark Gross and Marvin “Smitty” Smith, express love and admiration in every note, and as the prisoners respond to the music, their faces indicate that they second the emotion.\nIt was in that very penitentiary that Morgan became something of a celebrity during his “lost” years. In prisoner-made tuxes, he and his fellow San Quentin All-Stars, a 16-piece band whose members included Dexter Gordon, performed for paying visitors. The prison was an entertainment destination—one of the fascinating aspects of Morgan’s story and Heikin’s film: in the bleakest of circumstances, the transcendent, intricate beauty of great music.\nProduction companies: Hieronymus Pictures, Green Garnet Prods., Wild at Heart Films\nWith: Delfeayo Marsalis, George Cables, Ron Carter, Mark Gross, Grace Kelly, Martin “Smitty” Smith, Clora Bryant, Ed Reed, Rosalinda Kolb, Gary Giddins, Michael Connelly\nDirector: N.C.

{"question":"As someone sensitive to medications, I'm wondering which has more documented side effects that require immediate medical attention - Torsemide or Indapamide?","answer":"Both medications have several serious side effects requiring immediate medical attention. Torsemide's serious side effects include rapid or irregular heartbeat, allergic reactions (hives, rash, itching, chest tightness, swelling), hearing loss, unusual bleeding/bruising, and severe stomach pain. Indapamide's serious side effects include allergic reactions (skin rash, itching, hives, facial swelling), irregular heartbeat, blurred vision, severe muscle cramps, redness/blistering of skin, and unusual weakness. Both medications require prompt medical attention if these effects occur.","context":["Torsemide is a generic name for the main name brand Demadex. Not to be confused though, because both of these are the same thing and will work the same way if you use them. The only major difference is if you purchase it under the brand name you’ll end up spending more money on it. Torsemide is used mainly to help people who suffer from high blood pressure problems. Not only does it treat high blood pressure, but it can also treat swelling caused by the heart, kidney or because of liver disease.\nTorsemide is a part of a class of medications called diuretics. The way thee work is that they help the kidneys to eliminate excess water and salt from the body. When this happens the body has an easier time keeping blood pressure under control. The excess salt is eliminated through the urine. Of course, one way to assist this medication with working better would be for a person to reduce their intake of high salty foods. This would mean they have to do the following:\nStay away from overly processed foods that are known to contain high levels of sodium. This would include any kind of processed lunch meat, canned meats or even canned vegetables, because these have a lot of sodium inside them. Also stay away from various sauces.\nYou would have to stop using seasoning that have salt inside them. This shouldn’t be tough, because all you have to do is look for no salt added alternatives. These are not only healthier, but also tend to taste better overall.\nYou would want to stay away from doing things that make it hard for your body to eliminate salt. This means staying away from drinking such things as sodas, alcohol and sugary drinks. These things take water in order to expel from your body, which makes it harder to keep blood pressure under control.\nIf you decide to make use of Torsemide, then what are some of the possible side effects you might end up facing as a result?\nDizziness or lightheadedness when standing or sitting up\nThe above are higher probability side effects, but their usually minor in nature. You have the highest chance of experiencing any one of these when you first start taking Torsemide. Once your body has had a chance to adjust, then you should stop experiencing these at all. If this doesn’t happen or you find that these side effects become worse, then you’ll want to stop use and let your doctor know right away.\nWhat are some of the more serious side effects you might be at risk at by taking Torsemide?\nRapid or irregular heartbeat\nSigns of an allergic reaction (may include hives, rash, itching, chest tightness, or swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat)\nFever, chills, or a sore throat that doesn’t go away\nHearing loss or ringing in the ears\nLoss of appetite or rapid weight loss\nRed, swollen, or blistered skin\nUnusual bleeding or bruising\nPain that begins in the stomach area, but may spread to the back\nUnusual weakness or fatigue\nIf you experience any other side effects not mentioned above, then don’t be afraid to let a doctor know or even a pharmacist.","(℞) Prescription required.

{"question":"Compare the legal documentation requirements for real estate verification between disclosure schedules and Middle Eastern due diligence processes","answer":"In disclosure schedules, real property owned or leased must be listed as part of the standard documentation requirements, with details about lease terms, landlord information, title of lease, and lease dates. In contrast, the Middle Eastern due diligence process for real estate verification is more complex, as public title searches are not possible since records are not publicly available. A buyer must obtain a valid power of attorney from the sellers or target to conduct property investigations. Additionally, for properties in master communities, buyers need authorization to confirm service charges and community fees payments, and must obtain a master developer's no objection certificate to complete the resale.","context":["What Is A Disclosure Schedule\nDisclosure schedules are a key part of complex mergers and acquisitions transactions. They are so crucial to M&A transactions that any error in these schedules could lead to litigation. This is because disclosure schedules are documents that provide fact-specific disclosures that support and supplement a seller’s warranties and representations.\nFor this reason, sellers and stockholders should prepare disclosure schedules carefully to avoid lawsuits and other risks. For example, a disclosure schedule must list all liabilities because if a liability shows up after the closing, the buyer could sue for damages.\nSome liabilities that are often listed include tax issues, OSHA problems, an employee claim, vendor claim, and more. Talk to an experienced lawyer to help review your disclosure schedules. To learn more about disclosure schedule contact a trusted experienced business law attorney near you.\nWhat Are Disclosure Schedules?\nDisclosure Schedule Example\nIn M&A transactions, the disclosure schedule has to be attached at the end of the agreement. This happens for many transaction agreements such as a merger agreement, stock purchase agreement, and asset purchase agreement.\nThe disclosure schedule is documented to prove assertions of facts and warranties made by sellers or stockholders. Some of the information included in these documents include:\n- A list of stockholders\n- Outstanding debts\n- Intellectual property\n- Employee benefit plans\n- Permits insurance policies\n- Real property owned or leased\n- The disclosure schedule may also contain details about warranties.\nDisclosure Schedule Preparation Tips\nSample Disclosure Schedule\nDisclosure schedules are important in M&A transactions but they are not easy to prepare. To draft disclosure schedules the right way, do the following:\n- Start preparing these documents very early on in the deal. Do not wait until the last minute\n- Sellers must inform their management team about how important and critical the disclosure schedules are\n- Understand that the due diligence process and the disclosure schedules in the purchase agreement are not the same things\n- Ensure you have revised each draft of the disclosure schedule\n- Work with a lawyer that has experience in mergers and acquisitions.\nMistake People Make When Preparing Disclosure Schedules\nImportance Of Disclosure\nSome of the mistakes that parties make when preparing disclosure schedules include:\n- Making an incomplete list of material contracts\n- Not satisfactorily describing the material contracts. For example, they may leave out the jurisdiction of incorporation.\n- Failing to update the employee roster such that names of former employees still appear in the roster\n- Presenting incomplete financial statements\n- Making an incomplete list of the software and the information technology used in the company\n- Missing information about leases such as lease terms, landlord, the title of the lease, date of the lease, and so on\n- Failing to completely disclose intellectual property such as patents, trademark,s and so on\n- Incomplete disclosure about litigation, investigation, and other government proceedings\n- Incomplete disclosure of taxes\nWhy You Need A Lawyer\nDisclosure Schedule Template\nBusiness transactions are always complex especially when they involve drafting and signing contracts. A lawyer can help identify any error in an agreement and propose remedies to these errors before they cause major problems.

This type of due diligence is undertaken by industry experts retained by the buyer;\n- Financial Due Diligence: this process enables the buyer to assess all financial aspects (i.e. indicators such as cash flows, balance sheets etc. of the target) of a potential acquisition to determine the benefits, liabilities, risks and opportunities. This type of due diligence is undertaken by financial experts usually also retained by the buyer or any lenders involved in the acquisition; and\n- Legal Due Diligence: this entails a review of the target’s business to identify potential legal exposure and non compliance issues that could be inherited by the buyer as a result of its purchase of a stake in the business. This type of due diligence includes a review of the company’s:\n- constitutional documents;\n- employee benefits and labour arrangements;\n- material contracts;\n- real estate assets;\n- intellectual property owned and used by the company;\n- insurance policies;\n- regulatory compliance (i.e., environmental and health and safety);\n- tax compliance; and\n- any litigation involving the company.\nLegal due diligence is undertaken by legal practitioners retained by the buyer.\nWhy is Due Diligence indispensable in the Middle East?\nUndertaking a legal due diligence process assists the buyer in evaluating the target’s business to determine a suitable purchase price for procuring a stake in the said business. Doing a due diligence is also helpful for the buyer to understand the nature of the target’s business and to assess where this business fits in with its own growth strategy and enterprise.\nIncreasingly, international clients question the need to commence the legal due diligence process when contemplating a potential acquisition. Whilst it is tempting to skip the due diligence process (which can be time consuming and costly if not managed efficiently) and go straight to the preparation of the transaction contract, this is not advisable, particularly in the Middle East.\nSome clients argue that they can rely on publicly available information on the target’s business. In the case of any potential exposure (not identified due to the absence of a due diligence), these can be protected against by the inclusion of broad representations and warranties by the seller’s and/or the target, as well as the inclusion of broad indemnities in favour of the buyer in the transaction documents. This approach is not recommended because enforcement of these protections in a court of law, particularly local courts where proceedings are conducted in Arabic, can be time consuming, with very different processes and rules for assessing financial damages. Resolution could take years.\nFurthermore, in the Middle East there are almost no corporate records publicly available. In the case of the Dubai International Financial Centre (‘DIFC’) there is some limited information available on the public register. In other jurisdictions, the names of directors of a company, its shareholders and the solvency status of a company is publicly available information; however, this is not the case in the Middle East. This information must be specifically requested from and supplied by the sellers or the target.\nWith respect to litigation, no definitive public searches can be done on target entities in the Middle East courts. While it is possible to do an unofficial search in the courts of Dubai, the results are not detailed or always accurate. Usually a valid and formally notarised power of attorney from the sellers or the target permitting the buyer or its counsel to do a litigation search on the target is required.\nMoreover, when acquiring real estate or verifying ownership, a title search would need to be carried out. However, public title searches are not possible in the Middle East as these records are not publicly available. It will not be possible for the buyer to do this search without a valid power of attorney from the sellers or the target authorising the buyer to carry out the investigation.\nSimilarly, if the business you are seeking to acquire has properties located in master communities, a buyer would be advised to confirm that all service charges and community fees have been paid to date. However, such investigation will not be possible without presenting a valid power of attorney to the master developer from the seller or the target authorising the buyer to carry out the investigation. This is also important because without the master developer’s no objection certificate (which will only be provided once all dues owed to the developer are cleared) the resale will not be not be able to be completed.\nDepending on the type of business forming the subject of the potential acquisition, investigations with special government authorities may be required. For example, if the acquisition involves the purchase of a regulated business (e.g. a clinic or a school), investigations need to be carried out with the regulatory authorities to ensure that the requisite approvals for the operation of the clinic or school premises are in place. To make such inquiries the consent and support of the sellers and/or the target will be required as this information is not publicly available.\nConducting legal due diligence enables the buyer to make an informed decision to proceed with a prospective acquisition. It also enables the buyer to identify and mitigate risks by including tailored protections in the transaction documents. The two reasons which make due diligence indispensable in the Middle East are:\n- the almost complete unavailability of useful information about the target from public sources; and\n- the problem of relying on an unfamiliar litigation system not geared towards resolving commercial cases quickly.\nIf a buyer does not do due diligence in this region, that buyer flies blind and flies towards risk.\nAl Tamimi & Company’s corporate commercial team regularly undertakes legal due diligences and prepares/advises on the transaction documents in the context of M&As in the region and internationally.

{"question":"What's the difference between endovascular treatment and carotid endarterectomy for strokes?","answer":"Endovascular treatment and carotid endarterectomy are quite different procedures. Endovascular treatment is a minimally invasive procedure where a catheter is inserted into a blood vessel and guided to the aneurysm site, where a coil is used to block it off. It offers shorter recovery time and less pain. In contrast, carotid endarterectomy is a surgical procedure that removes plaque build-up from the carotid artery to restore blood flow to the brain. It's considered a more invasive procedure used as a last resort due to added risks and complications.","context":["Subarachnoid hemorrhage is a type of stroke\nthat occurs when there is bleeding in the space surrounding the brain. This bleeding can lead to severe headaches, neck pain, nausea, confusion, and even loss of consciousness. It is a life-threatening condition that requires prompt medical attention and treatment. In this article, we will provide an overview of subarachnoid hemorrhage, including its symptoms, causes, diagnosis, and available treatments, including endovascular treatment and surgical clipping.\nSymptoms of Subarachnoid Hemorrhage\nThe symptoms of a subarachnoid hemorrhage can vary depending on the severity and location of the bleed, but common symptoms include:\n- Severe headache: This is often described as the \"worst headache of my life or thunderclap headache\" and is the most common symptom of a subarachnoid hemorrhage.\n- Neck pain: This is often accompanied by stiffness or tenderness in the neck.\n- Nausea and vomiting: These symptoms may be present in the early stages of the condition.\n- Confusion: This can range from mild disorientation to severe confusion and loss of consciousness.\n- Loss of consciousness\nCauses of Subarachnoid Hemorrhage\nThe most common causes are\n- Ruptured aneurysm, which is a weak spot in a blood vessel that bulges and can burst.\n- Head injury: A head injury can cause bleeding in the space surrounding the brain and lead to a subarachnoid hemorrhage.\n- Blood disorders: Certain blood disorders, such as an inherited bleeding disorder, can increase the risk of a subarachnoid hemorrhage.\n- Certain medical procedures: Some medical procedures can cause bleeding in the space surrounding the brain.\nDiagnosis of Subarachnoid Hemorrhage\nDiagnosing a subarachnoid hemorrhage typically involves a combination of a physical exam, imaging tests, and laboratory tests. Imaging tests, such as a CT scan\n, can help to identify the presence of bleeding in the space surrounding the brain. A spinal tap, also known as a lumbar puncture, can be used to test for the presence of blood in the fluid surrounding the brain.\nTreatment for Subarachnoid Hemorrhage\nTreatment for a subarachnoid hemorrhage typically involves controlling the bleeding and managing symptoms. This may include medication to reduce swelling, prevent seizures, and manage pain. In some\ncases, surgery may be needed to repair the ruptured aneurysm. Surgical options include Endovascular treatment and Surgical clipping.\nEndovascular Treatment for Subarachnoid Hemorrhage\nEndovascular treatment is a minimally invasive alternative to traditional surgery for repairing a ruptured aneurysm. During this procedure, a small catheter is inserted into a blood vessel and guided to the site of the aneurysm. A device, such as a coil, is then used to block off the aneurysm and prevent further bleeding.\nEndovascular treatment has several advantages over traditional surgery, including a shorter recovery time, less pain, and a lower risk of complications. However, it may not be suitable for everyone, and your doctor will be able to advise you on the best treatment option for your individual needs.\nSurgical Clipping for Subarachnoid Hemorrhage\nSurgical clipping is another treatment option for a ruptured aneurysm that is causing a subarachnoid hemorrhage. During this procedure, a neurosurgeon will make an incision in the skull and remove a small section of the skull to access the aneurysm. A metal clip is then placed around the base of the aneurysm to prevent it from rupturing and bleeding.\nSurgical clipping is a more invasive procedure than endovascular treatment, but it can be necessary for larger or more complex aneurysms. The recovery time for this procedure can be longer than for endovascular treatment, and there may be a higher risk of complications. However, it can be a highly effective treatment for a subarachnoid hemorrhage, and your doctor will be able to advise you on the best treatment option for your individual needs.\nIn conclusion, a subarachnoid hemorrhage is a life-threatening condition that requires prompt medical attention and treatment. The most common cause is a ruptured aneurysm, and treatment options include endovascular treatment and surgical clipping. Your doctor will be able to advise you on the best treatment option for your individual needs, based on the severity and location of the bleed, as well as your overall health and medical history. If you experience any of the symptoms of a subarachnoid hemorrhage, it is important to seek medical attention immediately.\nBy Dr. Pavis Laengvejkal\nFor more information please contact:","The brain demands a constant supply of nutrient rich and oxygenated blood throughout life. The cerebral arteries accomplish the delivery of blood to all of the structures of the cerebrum. Thus, the cerebral arteries are absolutely imperative to survival. During our lifetimes, these cerebral arteries are prone to trauma, blockages and disease. Stroke pathophysiology is related trauma or blood clot formation in the brain. There are two different types of an acute stroke: an ischemic stroke and a hemorrhagic stroke. Ischemic strokes are far more common than hemorrhagic strokes as they make up roughly 85% of all acute strokes. An ischemic stroke results when a blood clot forms in one of the arteries of the brain. Ischemic strokes are very serious as permanent brain damage and death may result due to the blockage. The other type of acute stroke, a hemorrhagic stroke, results when a blood vessel ruptures and subsequent brain bleeding occurs. Hemorrhagic stroke etiology is related to aneurysms or arteriovenous malformations. They are less common and usually constitute roughly 15% of acute strokes. There are many risk factors associated with the development of an acute stroke. These can include hypertension, aging, genetics, abnormal cholesterol levels, heart complications, and alcohol consumption.\nIt is important to minimize these risk factors to avoid an acute stroke. Symptoms of strokes include the sudden onset of muscle weakness or numbness, cognitive decline, vision loss, loss of muscle coordination, and migraines. It is important to monitor for the sign and symptoms of an acute stroke, as treatment must begin immediately. The prognosis of strokes greatly improves when treatment is administered as fast as possible after the onset of stroke complications. Stroke diagnosis can also involved the use of numerous tests and procedures. These can involve cerebral computed tomography (CT) scans, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasounds and cerebral angiograms. If the detection of brain bleeding or blood clot is confirmed, treatment is begun immediately to improve the prognosis of a stroke. Treatment of a stroke can involve lifestyle changes, medications and if needed, emergency surgery. Lifestyle changes commonly recommended are quitting smoking and exercising regularly, while medications used are anticoagulants and thrombolytics. Surgery is used as a last resort in the treatment of an acute stroke. This is due to the added risks and complications surgery may present. The most common surgical procedure is a carotid endarterectomy. This procedure involves the removal of plaque and restoration of blood flow through the carotid artery to the brain.\nAn ischemic stroke is the most common type of acute stroke. Ischemic strokes can be further subdivided into thrombotic and embolic strokes. Stroke etiology differs between the two. In a cerebral thrombotic stroke, a blood clot forms directly in one of the cerebral arteries and remains there. It blocks blood flow to the respectively area of the brain which the artery was supplying. In a cerebral embolic stroke, a blood clot forms elsewhere in the body, usually in the chest or neck regions. This blood clot then dislodges and travels via the circulatory system into the brain. The symptoms related to an embolic stroke depend on which area of the brain is affected by the clot and subsequent blockage. Prognosis of stroke after suffering from an ischemic event is more positive than a hemorrhagic event.\nHemorrhagic strokes are less common than ischemic strokes. Hemorrhagic strokes are often extremely severe and life threatening. Stroke pathophysiology is caused by aneurysms and arteriovenous malformations. An aneurysm results when a weakened blood vessel eventually ruptures and blood begins to pool in the surrounding region. Arteriovenous malformations (AVM) can also trigger hemorrhagic strokes. Arteriovenous malformations are a group of abnormal blood vessels that are prone to rupture and bleeding. Stroke complications are severe in hemorrhagic strokes. Brain bleeding can cause severe pressure on the surrounding regions of brain tissue and cause permanent tissue death. Prognosis of a stroke involving brain bleeding is relatively poor, especially if immediate treatment is not sought to relive the bleeding and pressure.\nRisk factors for the development of an acute stroke are associated with the increased likelihood of vessel hardening and narrowing. Both of these can trigger blood clot formation and rupture. Common risk factors include hypertension, diabetes, heart irregularities, smoking, aging, genetic history of clotting or rupture, alcohol consumption, obesity, lack of exercise, poor diet and abnormal cholesterol levels. These risk factors have the ability to compound and exponentially increase your risk for an acute stroke as well. It is important to mitigate the risk of developing an acute stroke. Speaking with your physician is imperative in minimizing the above risk factors.\nSymptoms of strokes can be very severe and life altering. In many cases, symptoms can be permanent as brain damage can result from an acute stroke. It is extremely important to be proactive in monitoring for the symptoms of strokes as immediate treatment can be life saving. Common symptoms associated with an acute stroke are facial paralysis, muscle weakness throughout the body, cognitive decline or confusion, vision difficulties, speech difficulties, trouble with motor movement, and migraines or headaches. Depending on where the blood clot or rupture occurs, patients can also suffer from a left-sided stroke or right-sided stroke. Patients suffering from damage in the right side of the brain, suffer from a life-sided stroke and vise versa. The left-sided stroke involves inability to speak, and language impairments, as while a right-handed stroke involves general cognitive decline and vision problems. These strokes are directly related to the left and right sides of the brain having distinct and different functions in everyday life.\nThe quick and accurate diagnosis is imperative in prognosis of strokes. If treatment can begin immediately, the chances of a full recovery greatly improve. If stroke complications are present, several diagnostic tools and procedures are often used to confirm the presence of brain bleeding or clotting. This can include the use of blood tests, cerebral computed tomography (CT) scans, computed tomography arteriograms, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetic resonance arteriograms, carotid ultrasounds, carotid angiograms, electrocardiograms, and echocardiograms. These tests can provide information on how blood is flowing through the cerebral arteries, help detect brain bleeding and clotting, examine for pressure buildups and heart irregularities. It is important to discuss with your physician on what is the best diagnostic procedure for the detection of an acute stroke.\nStroke treatment must begin immediately following the detection of stroke complications and symptoms. The prognosis of an acute stroke greatly diminishes if treatment is not sought immediately. Treatment is also dependent on the size and severity of blood clot or blood vessel rupture. Treatment options include lifestyle changes, medications and, if needed, emergency surgeries to relieve the blood clot or cranial pressure build up.\nThe lifestyle changes commonly recommended are directly correlated with the risk factors associated with developing an acute stroke. These lifestyle changes aid in general health as well. Lifestyle changes can include dietary changes (avoidance of foods high in saturated and Tran’s fats, sugars), exercising regularly, and losing weight, quitting smoking and avoiding alcohol. All of these things can reduce the likelihood of blood vessel hardening and narrowing. It may also revere the development of atherosclerosis. It is important to seek advice from your doctor on how to best make lifestyle changes to decrease the risks associated with an acute stroke.\nMedications are often vital in the treatment of an acute stroke. Common medications used are anticoagulants, antiplatelet and thrombolytics. Warfarin and Aspirin are the most common anticoagulant and antiplatelet respectively. They are used to help decrease the likelihood of blood clot formation in the future and also can limit the size of the present blood clot. Other medications used in the treatment process involve medications to control blood pressure and cholesterol. Managing blood pressure is vital in the avoidance of hemorrhagic strokes and thus, medications such as diuretics and ACE inhibitors are used. In terms of cholesterol, statins are commonly used to control low-density lipoprotein (LDL or bad cholesterol) levels to avoid atherosclerosis development. The most important medication for in the treatment of an acute stroke is thrombolytics. The most common thrombolytic medication is tissue plasminogen activator, or tPA. Tissue plasminogen activator works to dissolve the present clot entirely to restore blood flow to areas of the brain. Tissue plasminogen activator needs to be administered within 3-4 hours of stroke onset and thus, is the reason treatment must be sought immediately to improve prognosis of stroke. Patients on tPA must be monitored regularly as severe bleeding is a side effect of the medication. Searching for a natural vasodilator? Recent studies have found that medical marijuana may have some weight in this arena.\nIn terms of both ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes, emergency surgery may be used if deemed necessary. It is commonly used as last resort as due to the added complications and risk it poses. Carotid endarterectomy is a common procedure used to remove plaque build up from the carotid artery. This ensures adequate blood flow is flowing to the brain and the surrounding structures. Also, surgeons may perform a craniotomy. A craniotomy involves drilling into the skull to help ease cranial pressure and blood pooling.\nIt is important to discuss with your doctor what the best treatment procedure is for the recovery from an acute stroke."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:7eb835d9-b1ec-4872-9ca4-f1268c386c28>","<urn:uuid:81d2382f-6c1b-48dc-ae39-fd36050b43f2>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do wildlife conservation agencies adapt to climate change impacts, and what methods do they use to restore damaged coral reefs?","answer":"Wildlife conservation agencies adapt to climate change through multiple strategies, including acquiring and protecting a network of conserved lands and waters as buffers and corridors, restoring lost ecosystems, reducing non-climate pressures like invasive species and pollution, and implementing new management options such as maximizing stream flow and prescribed burning. The FWC has incorporated climate change into Florida's Wildlife Action Plan and created a Guide to Climate Change Adaptation for Conservation. For coral reef restoration, agencies like NOAA employ specific techniques including stabilizing rubble fields, placing limestone and large boulders over damaged areas, and transplanting corals. They work underwater using cement, nails, and rebar to reattach broken corals to the seafloor. Coral nurseries are also crucial for regrowing and rehabilitating coral for restoration projects. In one case, NOAA reattached around 10,500 corals during emergency restoration actions.","context":["Florida is home to an incredible diversity of native fish and wildlife including 386 species of birds, 86 species of mammals, 90 species of reptiles, 136 species of fish and 56 species of amphibians. Rising temperatures and sea level will likely change the makeup of entire ecosystems, forcing wildlife to shift their ranges or adapt. Adaptation involves minimizing the impacts of climate change already set in motion.\nClimate change is proceeding at a pace in which there will be unavoidable impacts to natural systems and fish and wildlife habitat. The effects of climate change are already being felt by wildlife and natural systems, and even with immediate action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions those effects will continue for decades to come. Florida's natural resource managers are just coming to grips with what this means for the state's fish, wildlife and habitats.\nClimate change effects include changing rainfall patterns, rising temperatures and sea level, changing ocean chemistry, more wildfires, stronger hurricanes and increased droughts. These and other effects are predicted to intensify in the coming decades and significantly impact wildlife and ecosystems. Some uncertainty remains regarding exactly how these impacts will occur, but there is enough information now to begin planning and adapting to these changes.\nTo prepare for the anticipated impacts of climate change, the FWC has further incorporated climate change into Florida's Wildlife Action Plan (previously known as Florida's Comprehensive Wildlife Conservation Strategy) using guidance provided by the Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies in a document called \" Voluntary Guidance for States to Incorporate Climate Change into State Wildlife Action Plans and other Management Plans.\"\nThe FWC has recently completed their \"Guide to Climate Change Adaptation for Conservation\" to provide resources to learn about modeled climate impacts to Florida, ecological consequences to species and habitats, vulnerability assessments and adaptation strategies. This document will be a living document with adaptation strategies being added as new strategies are developed.\nThe FWC partnered with Defenders of Wildlife and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to evaluate select species using the NatureServe Climate Change Vulnerability Index (CCVI) and spatial simulation modeling. These assessments provided the FWC and partners with information on how the species may be affected by climate change and how much of their habitat they may lose to predicted sea-level rise. That information was then used to begin identifying adaptation strategies that could help reduce climate change impacts on Florida's wildlife. This research was summarized and compiled into a revised chapter in Florida's Wildlife Action Plan called \"Florida Adapting to Climate Change.\" For complete details of the assessments, please see MIT's report \"Considering Climate Change in Florida's Wildlife Action Planning: A Spatial Resilience Planning Approach\" and Defenders of Wildlife's report \"Integrating Climate Change Vulnerability Assessments Into Adaptation Planning.\"\nThe purpose of this work is to help reduce the risk of adverse outcomes to Florida's wildlife communities. This will be done by implementing adaption strategies that have been identified and increasing resilience of natural ecosystems to climate change stressors such as increased temperatures, sea level rise, decreased or increased seasonal rainfall and higher carbon dioxide levels.\nAdaptation strategies may include:\n- Acquisition, protection and management of a statewide network of conserved lands and waters that will serve as buffers, corridors, and habitable areas necessary to make natural systems more resilient to the impacts of climate change\n- Restoration and rehabilitation of ecosystems that have been lost or compromised\n- Reduction of other non-climate pressures such as invasive species, pollution and habitat fragmentation that hinder the ability of species and ecosystems to withstand climatic events\n- New or improved management options such as maximizing stream flow, prescribed burning and other efforts to protect key ecosystem features.\nTo learn more about climate change adaptation, read the survey summary from Climate Change Adaptation Across the Landscape: A survey of federal and state agencies, conservation organizations and academic institutions in the United States by authors Katie Theoharides, Gerald Barnhart and Patty Glick.\nTo help explain climate change adaptation, Nature.org spoke with Jonathan Hoekstra, The Nature Conservancy's director of emerging strategies, to get the details.\nVisit the National Wildlife Federation's Climate-Smart Conservation section to learn more about adaptation and assessing species vulnerability.","Growing less than a quarter inch per year, the elaborate coral reefs off the south coast of Puerto Rico originally took thousands of years to form. And over the course of two days in late April 2006, portions of them were ground into dust.\nThe tanker Margara ran aground on these reefs near the entrance to Guayanilla Bay. Then, in the attempt to remove and refloat the ship, it made contact with the bottom several times and became grounded again. By the end, roughly two acres of coral were lost or injured. The seafloor was flattened and delicate corals crushed. Even today, a carpet of broken coral and rock remains in part of the area. This loose rubble becomes stirred up during storms, smothering young coral and preventing the reef’s full recovery.\nNOAA and the Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources have been working on a restoration plan for this area, a draft of which they released for public comment in September 2014 [PDF]. In order to stabilize these rubble fields and return topographic complexity to the flattened seafloor, they proposed placing limestone and large boulders over the rubble and then transplanting corals to the area.\nThis is in addition to two years of emergency restoration actions, which included stabilizing some of the large rubble, reattaching around 10,500 corals, and monitoring the slow comeback and survival of young coral. In the future, even more restoration will be in the works to make up for the full suite of environmental impacts from this incident.\nCaribbean Cruising for a Bruising\nUnfortunately, the story of the Margara is not an unusual one. In 2014 alone, NOAA received reports of 37 vessel groundings in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. About half of these cases threatened corals, prompting NOAA’s Restoration Center to send divers to investigate.\nAfter a ship gets stuck on a coral reef, the first step for NOAA is assessing the situation underwater. If the vessel hasn’t been removed yet, NOAA often provides the salvage company with information such as known coral locations and water depths, which helps them determine how to remove the ship with minimal further damage to corals. Sometimes that means temporarily removing corals to protect them during salvage or figuring out areas to avoid hitting as the ship is extracted.\nOnce the ship is gone, NOAA divers estimate how many corals and which species were affected, as well as how deep the damage was to the structure of the reef itself. This gives them an idea of the scale of restoration needed. For example, if less than 100 corals were injured, restoration likely will take a few days. On the other hand, dealing with thousands of corals may take months.\nNOAA already has done some form of restoration at two-thirds of the 18 vessel groundings with coral damage in the region this year. They have reattached 2,132 corals to date.\nWhat does this look like? At first, it’s a lot of preparation. Divers collect the corals and fragments knocked loose by the ship; transport them to a safe, stable underwater location where they won’t be moved around; and dig out any corals buried in debris. When NOAA is ready to reattach corals, divers clear the transplant area (sometimes that means using a special undersea vacuum). On the ocean surface, people in a boat mix cement and send it down in five-gallon buckets to the divers below. Working with nails, rebar, and cement, the divers carefully reattach the corals to the seafloor, with the cement solidifying in a couple hours.\nProtecting Coral, From the Law to the High Seas\nNearly a third of the total reported groundings in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands this year have involved corals listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. In previous years, only 10 percent of the groundings involved threatened corals. What changed this year was the Endangered Species Act listing of five additional coral species in the Caribbean.\nAnother form of protection for corals is installing buoys to mark the location of reefs in areas where ships keep grounding on them. Since these navigational aids were put in place at one vulnerable site in Culebra, Puerto Rico this summer, NOAA hasn’t been called in to an incident there yet.\nBut restoring coral reefs after a ship grounding almost wouldn’t be possible without coral nurseries. Here, NOAA is able to regrow and rehabilitate coral, a technique being used at the site of the T/V Margara grounding. Stay tuned because we’ll be going more in depth on coral nurseries, what they look like, and how they help us restore these amazingly diverse ocean habitats.

An over-sized air conditioner is actually less effective and wastes energy at the same time. Air conditioners remove both heat and humidity from the air. If the unit is too large, it will cool the room quickly, but only remove some of the humidity. This leaves the room with a damp, clammy feeling. A properly sized unit will remove humidity effectively as it cools.\nHere is a more in depth guide.\nSizing Your Mini Split Air Conditioner: What’s The Right BTU Rating to Effectively Cool or Heat Your Room?\nWhen buying a ductless mini split system, getting the right size matters—a lot. Keep in mind that size, in this respect, means capacity or BTU rating.\nWhile many other things have to be considered prior to a purchasing decision, making sure that you have chosen a properly sized unit should be on top of your checklist. To err on this aspect will have a huge impact on the level of comfort that you’ll be getting from your mini split unit and the amount of money that you’ll be paying for your energy bill in the long-term.\nSuffice to say, the correctness of the size, capacity, or BTU rating of the mini split system that you use determines the success or failure of your space cooling project.\nTo help you make a smart buying decision, this article discusses the important things that you should know, consider, and be aware about when it comes to proper sizing of a mini split air conditioner.\nAC Size Also Means Cooling Capacity\nWhen it comes to mini split air conditioners, size refers to the capacity of the unit to heat or cool a specific space or room.\nNow, here’s what you need to know:\nThe size of air conditioners is measured based in tons or expressed in British Thermal Units (BTUs). To better understand these concepts, it is best to take note of the following:\n- BTU is a measurement of heat, which by definition really means the amount of energy that is required to increase the temperature of water by one degree Fahrenheit.\n- One ton is equal to 12,000 BTUs per hour.\n- Basically, when we’re talking about tons, what we mean is the amount of heat (or BTU) that an air conditioner can remove in a space every hour.\nBased on the statement, it follows that a 1-ton air conditioner can remove in a span of one hour an amount of heat that is equal to 12,000 BTUs. Meaning to say, if you have a 5-ton mini split air conditioner at home, for example, you can be assured that your unit will be able to remove an amount of heat that is equal to 60,000 BTU per hour.\nWe can safely deduce that the bigger the ton means the bigger the BTU; and the bigger the BTU that an air conditioner can remove every hour, the bigger an air conditioner is considered in terms of size.\nAll Ductless Mini Splits Are Built with a Specific Size\nAir conditioners, including ductless mini split systems, are built in different sizes. Each unit is practically made for a specific size of a space.\nWith ductless mini splits, the indoor and outdoor units have varying sizes or rated capacities. Knowing the size of each unit will guide you to properly install a correctly sized system.\nWhen installing a ductless AC solution to your home, your sizing consideration should factor in the size of the room for single-zone application or each of individual rooms for a multi-zone configuration. To put it simply, your outdoor unit may have a different but enough size to complement the size of each indoor air handler that are installed in different rooms inside the house. Because it’s more likely that each room in your home may have different sizes, the size or rated capacity of individual air handlers may also vary.\nBigger Size Doesn’t Always Mean the Right Size\nContrary to popular belief, bigger doesn’t always mean better when it comes to air conditioners. This means that having a unit with a higher rated capacity or higher BTU rating doesn’t assure you that you’re actually getting the right size.\nThe truth is, the size of your unit must be proportionate to the size of the space. So, when choosing a ductless mini split, it is important to make sure that its BTU rating is suitable to the size of the room where you will install the system.\nThe rule of thumb is, the larger the space means the bigger size of a unit is required; conversely, the smaller the space, the smaller size of the unit that is needed. The key is just to make sure that your chosen mini split system is properly sized for the specific space that you need to heat or cool.\nWhy Proper Sizing for Your Mini Split Unit is Important?\nBecause your comfort and energy-savings are stake, it is imperative that your mini split system is properly sized for the room that you will heat or cool. To put this another way, it is important that your system is not too big or too small for your specific space.\nNow, what would happen if you installed a mini split with a BTU rating that does not match the size of the room? What would happen if the system is oversized or undersized?\nWell, let’s say that your air conditioner is too big for your space. Based on what was discussed earlier about tons and BTUs in relation to the size of an air conditioner, this could also mean that your air conditioner packs more tons than necessary to cool a smaller space.\nWhat happens is your oversized air conditioner might quickly cool your home or a small room inside your house. The problem is it might undergo a process called short cycling, which is bad.\nIn short cycling, your oversized air conditioner turns itself on, blows some good blast of air, then quickly shuts down only to run again. This cycle continues because your system, in this case, is trying to maintain the temperature that you specifically set in the thermostat.\nWith your air conditioner turning itself on and off means it is only running for a short period of time. The immediate result is discomfort because the humidity from the air will not be sufficiently removed.\nWorse, short cycling forces your system to use more energy and sustain stress. When kept this way, your system will only be using more energy than necessary and the extra wear-and-tear can result to system breakdown. Obviously, wasted energy and system malfunction can translate to higher energy bills and maintenance costs.\nNow, what if your air conditioner is too small? Again, take this in the context of tonnage or BTU as units to measure the size or your unit or determine its capacity.\nUsing an undersized air conditioner to cool a big space would not make any sense. It is downright impractical because it would not even be able to cool much of the space in your home even if it runs longer. The wasted energy, in this case, would be substantial and you can expect your electricity bill to skyrocket.\nSo, what’s the best size for your air conditioner to achieve more efficiency? Obviously the right fit is always the best fit.\nYour Mini Split System Sizing Guide\nDetermining the size of a space to figure out the right BTU rating of the unit to be used is usually done by taking into consideration the square footage of the room.\nBut there’s a caveat.\nWhile you can accurately measure the size of the room based on the square footage, determining the right size of a mini split would be a little bit challenging due to several factors, such as the height of the ceiling, insulation, the climate in the area, and even the level of the room’s exposure to sunlight.\nThe aforementioned variables normally affect or influences the size of the unit that you need to use. So, what does this imply?\nIt means, that the BTU ratings are just general estimates, which are determined based on these factors. This doesn’t mean, however, that proper sizing cannot be established. By considering the environmental or external factors, we can still effectively determine the right size of a mini split unit that is needed for a specific space.\nWhile the requirements look a bit too much, it’s not as hard to handle as it looks. In fact, sizing guides are now very common.\nFor your guidance, here’s a sample of a sizing chart that you can use when buying a mini split unit:\nMini Split System Sizing Guide\n6,000 BTU 150 – 300 ft\n9,000 BTU 300 – 500 ft\n12,000 BTU 400 – 650 ft\n15,000 BTU 500 – 800 ft\n18,000 BTU 600 – 1,000 ft\n24,000 BTU 800 – 1,300 ft\n30,000 BTU 1,000 – 1,650 ft\n36,000 BTU 1,200 – 2,000 ft\n42,000 BTU 1,400 – 2,300 ft\n48,000 BTU 1,600 – 2,650 ft\n56,000 BTU 1,850 – 3,100 ft\nWhen the external factors are present, the amount of BTU that is needed are normally increased to compensate for the extra strain or energy needed to cool or heat the space. For accurate sizing, you can always tap the help of an HVAC expert who will calculate your cooling or heating requirements and determine the right size of the mini split air conditioner for your home.\nSizing Means Load Calculation\nSizing an air conditioner or a mini split system is conducted through the so-called load calculation. Calculating the load means determining the correct amount of cool or warm air that is needed to establish a comfortable temperature or maintain that desired that temperature inside the room.\nWhen HVAC experts conduct a load calculation for a specific space, what they normally come up with is the estimated amount of BTU that is needed to cool or heat the room. This is the same data that is used to determine the right BTU rating for the unit that will be used for that particular space."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"format_constrained"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:57484408-bb91-48cc-8926-72eff398d91a>","<urn:uuid:3812d8d7-d096-4451-8568-2b17e45b0bc4>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Do Halal dietary rules and ethnic subcultures both influence food consumption patterns?","answer":"Yes, both Halal dietary rules and ethnic subcultures influence food consumption patterns. According to Islamic Halal practices, Muslims must follow specific dietary rules throughout the year, particularly regarding meat preparation. Similarly, ethnic subcultures strongly influence food preferences, as seen in how immigrants often maintain their ancestral food habits - for example, Bangladeshi immigrants in the UK continue to consume traditional Bangladeshi foods even after becoming British citizens.","context":["Subculture is a part of culture containing the important features of the main culture. Culture includes what we have learned, our history, values, morals, customs art and habit. Marketing takes place within a given culture requiring different marketing programs. Not everyone in the same country or society shares the same behavioral pattern of the dominant or main culture. It clearly indicates that there are subcultures. The identification of a subculture may provide a firm with a segment of a market that it can develop. For example, products have been developed in great quantity for the teenage subculture and advertising has been directed to these consumers. Each subculture like a larger culture has distinctive values, beliefs and attitudes that the marketer must understand if he is effectively to exploit them.\nEvery culture contains subculture, defined as a group that share the values and artifacts of the larger society, but also have distinctive practices, preferences and beliefs. Again, subculture can be defined as patterns of behavior which contains important characteristics of the dominant society but provides values and life styles of its own.\nMajor sub-cultural categories:\nEthnic (based on the ancestors birthplace)\nEnglish, Chinese, Arab\nMuslim, Hindu, Christian\nNorthern, Southern, Central\nTeen, Middle aged, Elderly\nTeachers, Doctors, Engineers\nUpper, Middle, lower\nThe ethnic subculture is based on the nationality of one’s ancestors who have migrated to a new country .Ethnic subculture is usually found in affluent countries where people migrate from other parts of the world with the hope of a better life and livelihood. Though ethnic groups may lose their nationality over time, but in fact ethnic identification is held from one generation to the next through a number of institutions. As people migrate to another country leaving their home country, they slowly accept the new culture as their own over time. But they frequently exhibit the culture of their ancestors. This ancestral pride is manifested most strongly in the consumption of ethnic foods, in travel to homeland and in the purchase of numerous cultural artifacts (ethnic clothing, art, music, foreign-language newspapers). For example, in UK, there are many Bangladeshi immigrants who have now become British citizens, but they display consumption behavior in many occasions that resembles with that of someone living here in Bangladesh. They buy and use Bangladeshi foods, wear “lungi” & “sharee” & go to mosque on Fridays. This is a glaring example of how ethnic subculture affects consumer behavior.\nEach of the ethnic subculture has unique traditions and behaviors that have potential influence on product preferences and consumption behavior. A particular market consisting of ethnic subcultures may be the focus of a marketer. But it is not very easy to reach effectively a particular ethnic subculture with a particular type of products. The reason is that not everyone in the same ethnic subculture will consume the same type of product nor will lead the same life style. So a marketer living in cosmopolitan city should realize the ethnic group and should further segment this group on the basis of demographic and other aspects and different offers should be made for different sub segment.\nReligious subculture based on people’s religious beliefs. Some may be very pious and some may be relax. Members of a particular religion constitute religious subculture. Religious beliefs rituals may dictate the use of certain items and may discourage the consumption of others. For example, Islam discourages its followers the consumption of certain items such as alcoholic beverages, pork etc. An individual’s religious affiliation influences to a great extent his consumption pattern. It is expected that the members of a particular religious subculture will display similar behavioral patterns in their purchases and consumption. But differences may be found among the members of a particular religious subculture in terms of their consumption and lifestyle. A devout member of “Islam” may consider it immoral to be materialistic, where another member of the same religion may find nothing wrong in becoming materialistic. A marketer of cine-magazine will have no problem in reaching the later person, where it will be almost impossible for him to penetrate the market consisting of people of the other mentality and religious beliefs. Marketers should be tactful when considering religious subculture in their marketing strategies. As people are emotionally charged by their religion, so marketers should consider religious thinking of people in their marketing strategies.Marketers should not hurt the religious beliefs rather every marketing policies should keep consistence with religious beliefs of the people to get success in business.As most of the people in Bangladesh are muslim, they prefer purity in each item. That’s why “AROMATIC” soap became successful with the idea of halal soap when it was introduced. As Bangladesh is religious neutral country, marketers should not take any extreme policy.\nThe way people lead their lifestyle may also vary according to where they live or from which pat of the country they have moved to the other part of the country. People from a particular part of the country or people living in a particular part constitute what we call regional or geographic subculture. On this basis there could be two type of regional or geographic subculture. One could be based on geographic region of the county and other could be based on urban, suburban or rural distinction. Different geographic area of the country poses different climatic conditions which influences home construction, clothing requirements and recreational opportunities. In addition, different regions of the country have different age distribution and different social histories. These variables in combination with the climatic variables have produced differing values and lifestyles which newcomers to a region generally acquire after a period of time. These regional variation influences of the particular media, the types of products used and the product attributes considered important as well as they are produced and used. Bangladeshis, for example, live in the hill district display different patterns in food consumption, housing & recreation than those of the people living in other parts of the country. The people of Chittagong region of Bangladesh prefer hot & spicy food, where as people living in other parts may not like it. Again, fish is consumed by everybody here in Bangladesh, but dry fish is consumed heavily by people living in the southern and coastal areas of Bangladesh.\nRegional subcultures clearly influence many aspects of consumer behavior. The consumption process also is influenced by the urban, suburban and rural distinctions. The urban and suburban people prefer ready food, prefer eating out and enjoy their leisure in a way different from rural people. So marketers should consider regional subculture specially when they operate the business region wise, as people of different region show totally different consumption Pattern.\nSubculture based on age:\nSubculture may also be based on age differences of people living in the same country and belonging to the same main culture. It I likely that those who belonging to the teen age group will behave quite differently than those of middle age or elderly. Because the outlook, experiences, attitudes and other aspects are likely to vary. The teenagers are more materialistic in their lifestyles. The youth market is very lucrative for the marketers, as they start their carrier in this age are flaunt with more luxury items. Since they have little obligation in this stage, they can spend whatever they are. Their consumption patterns lean toward personal care & luxury items.\nThe middle age groups, on the contrary are matured, worried about the future, they are likely to be conservative in buying many material goods and are found to spend money on protective investments.\nThe elderly people who have gone on retirements or whose regular income generating activities have ceased display quite different consumption behavior. Most of them live with their children, their health condition gradually deteriorate, have emotional difficulties, have minimum amount of money to spend, are price/value conscious, are deal prone, like to shop as it has special meaning, are tuned in to the mass media, and read direct mail, package labels and package inserts. These few characteristics make them behave quite differently than other groups.Because of their differences with other groups; they also need different types of products.\nThe elderly people, because of deteriorating health, will require more fat free foods, tonic item, medical advices and medication as well as hospitalization. Since they have limited incomes, they prefer comparison shopping. Because of their maturity and different attitudes, they are skeptical of advertising claims and are influenced more by informed sources. The emergence of elderly market has created a need for many different types of products such as old people’s home, health clubs and a number of other products and services. Marketers face lot of problems and challenges in reaching elderly market. The communication strategy for elderly market should be well thought. The most successful communications are those that show a mixture of age groups using the products. Smart marketers have been attuned to the needs of elderly consumers &have been quickest to realize their value as customers. As demand of people of different age are different, so marketing policies to reach each group of people should be different.Marketers should offer their product considering the needs of each groups and in the way they want to. Single subculture:\nThe single subculture consists of unmarried as well as individuals who were married before but are now divorced or separated or widow and live independently. This subculture is found to be increasing particularly in urban and semi-urban areas. The size of this subculture is gradually becoming prominent to call a special marketing attention. The singles have some special needs, which can’t be met through normal social interaction. Marketers who can recognize their specific needs and can develop products aimed at meeting those specific needs can reap a considerable benefit. Single night clubs exotic telephone talk services, dating services, bachelor hostels/mess, convenience foods, restaurants, sports equipments etc. could be some of examples of products & services aimed at the subculture of singles. In our country single subculture is growing prominent in the urban areas and a result lot of hostels for both males & females have been established aiming to provide accommodation services to singles.\nSubculture based on gender differences:\nSubculture may also be formed based on gender difference, such as subculture of males & subculture of females. They are likely to behave differently, consume different types of products & respond differently to marketing appeals. Men for example are influenced more by aggressiveness, competitiveness, independence, self-confidence and masculinity. Women on the other hand, are influenced by neatness, gentleness, tactfulness, talkativeness and feminity. There are products which are equally used by men & women, but different appeals are needed for these groups. Cosmetics, perfumes, clothing, bicycles etc. are used both by men & women. But different designs, colors, sizes, shapes & fragrances are provided for by the marketers to appeal people of different sex. Bicycle, for example, is designed differently for men & women. Again, among females, those who are professionals, behave differently than those of non-professional. The working woman, particularly those, who are married, will again require different types of products and services that may not be bought by unmarried working women. The shopping patterns of these two groups will also vary. Since characteristics, attitude and needs vary between these two groups they may be considered as two different market segments.\nPeople display different patterns of purchase behavior according to their occupational involvement. People of different occupations may constitute occupational subcultures, such as subculture of the doctors, subculture of the lawyers, subcultures of the teachers, subcultures of the engineers, subculture of the defense personnel. A defense officer, for example, will show different behavior than someone belonging to the civilian’s society. Doctors for example may look at the nutritional aspect while baying a food item. Marketers should recognize the difference in attitude and behavior among people of different occupations and formulate marketing strategies accordingly to be successful in each specific subculture.\nSubculture of social class:\nSocial class may be used as a determinant of sub cultural differences. There could be subculture of the well-offs, subculture of the middle class & subculture of the poverty. People belonging to the subculture of the rich will display different buying behavior than those of the middle class & poor. Rich people are very selective in their purchase, people of the middle class will have substantial control over their consumption decisions; poor on the other hand will be very careful & cautious in taking their purchase decisions. Rich people are conscious about quality & uniqueness when purchasing a product but poor is not. They spend huge amount of money on recreation & luxury goods. They go selective shops for their purchasing where they get quality goods at pleasant environment. Subculture of the poverty consists of those people who live below the poverty level. One important characteristic of such people is that they spend significant portion of their money on basic necessities. Most of them are very price sensitive. So they avoid pre-packed, instant frozen food items as they are costly. As they have limited educational opportunities, they develop different attitudes, outlooks and motivation resulting in different buying behavior. They spend only small portion of their income on clothing, transportation, recreation, and luxury. They basically look at low cost items, favor shops where they get credit facilities & are attracted by different inducements offered by the marketers. To reach the rich, marketers should supply quality product & better environment where as they should try to keep the price low to get the poor customers. Conclusion:\nAny culture is again divided into many subcultures. These subcultures posses some distinct characteristics. As there can be broad differences between the cultures of various societies, there can also be differences within the same culture. Every culture, Contains subcultures, defined as groups that share the values and artifacts of the larger society, but also have distinctive practices, preferences & beliefs. Because of the important differences within any culture, marketers must be aware of diverse subcultures. Marketers must recognize that even though their operations are confined to a particular country or a division or district or even to one city, sub cultural differences may dictate considerable variations in what, how and when people buy. To deal with these differences effectively, marketers may have to alter their product, distribution system, price or promotion to satisfy members of particular subcultures. A particular subculture takes on importance in marketing if it constitutes a significant part of the population & specific purchasing patterns can be identified with it. Marketers need to be aware of how sub cultural characteristics influence buying behavior. Moreover, they should also bear in mind that one sub cultural background may interact with other aspects such as social class, personality, life-style & so on during the buying decision process. Marketers should also keep in mind that, like culture, subculture also changes. Therefore, continuous monitoring of sub cultural characteristics may help marketers bring appropriate and timely changes in their marketing strategies to make them more market oriented.","The summer season is high time for good eats. Whether it’s a good barbecue, a tasty cold treat or tempting your palate with adventurous delicacies from your latest travel destination, summer time is a fantastic season for succulent spreads.\nWhile many here in Houston, and throughout the nation, are preparing for an August of barbecued burgers and brats many Muslims are preparing for Ramadan, a month long dawn to dusk religious fast beginning today, August 1 and ending with Eid al-Fitr on August 31. The Ramadan fast is held in honor of the prophet Muhammed’s reception of the first parts of the Quran in 610 C.E. when, according to Muslim teachers, he did not eat or drink from sunrise to sunset. While the vast majority of Muslims beyond puberty will refrain from consuming food and drink during the day they will enjoy special night-time mini-meals (Iftar) that will sustain them through the long hours of abstention during daylight.\nOf course, Ramadan is not only about what Muslims are not eating, but the significant meaning of items they do eat. Ramadan is a rich time of spiritual formation for Muslims in which food such as dates at the beginning of each Iftar and the many delights of Eid al-Fitr are sweet not only to the tongue, but to the soul of the faithful who devoutly deviate from their normal eating routine to learn patience, continue to submit to Allah and remember to give generously to others.\nThis reminds religious students and careful observers just how important food is in religion. Religious eats (and don’t eats) help us learn more about a religion. All religion is more than belief, religion is also very much about ritual, and food often features in important religious rites. As Corrie Norman points out in a Harvard Pluralism Project forum paper from 2003 religion, and its ritual, is experienced in the body, experienced in community and often experienced beyond the bounds of a temple, synagogue or mosque. Food is oft involved with this religious experience outside of confessions, creeds and churches. Indeed, by using our taste buds and our tongues we can stand to learn a lot about other religions.\nHoustonians, and other Americans, may be surprised at the diversity of religious eats available for them to experience and learn from. Below are examples of religious eats from several traditions, each with links and opportunities for foodies and interested religious adventurers to learn more about each religion and its culinary cultus:\n+When I think of religious eats and the importance of food for religious ritual, my first thoughts are of the many foods of Judaism. Whether it’s grabbing a chunk of braided challah bread on Shabbat, enjoying some Hamentaschen on Purim, chomping on some Kosher chips and salsa with a good Jewish friend or solemnly remembering the night through the ritual foods of the Passover Seder, Judaism is rich with religious eats. The next time you’re in the store, check the Kosher section and enjoy a “set apart” snack or try making your own braided challah for a relaxing Friday evening Shabbat meal with friends. Not only will you be blessed by the company and the time for rest, you will learn a little more of the rhythm and ritual of Jewish life.\n+Although many are familiar with the concept of Kosher foods in Judaism, others are either ignorant or oblivious to the Halal practices of Islam. As discussed above, there are many important symbolic foods (such as dates) that are eaten during the Iftar of Ramadan or at Eid al-Fitr. However, Muslims continue to pay attention to what they eat throughout the year as they live out their lives in submission to Allah by following the Halal rules. Halal regulations most often appertain to meat and its preparation, but also apply to many other foods. To learn more, and live a little, check out one of the many Halal markets or restaurants in Houston or your metro area.\n+Ever since my wife and I moved to Houston we have a new less-than-guilty pleasure – the delights of our local Udipi Cafe. Offering an all vegetarian spread, Udipi has become our Indian joint of choice. While it is easy to forget the religious significance of the baingan bharta I am devouring along with a healthy dose of malai kofta, Udipi cafes owe their cuisine to a Dvaita school of Hinduism that highlights ahimsa (non-violence) as a prime practice of Hinduism. Thus, devout Udipi Hindus eat, and serve (to our delight) only vegetarian dishes. Of course, Hinduism’s religious eats aren’t all vegetarian, there are many meat-eating Hindus hailing from places like Andra-Pradesh and Punjab province in India. A good way to learn more about Hindu eats is to visit a local Hindu temple and observe the practice of prasadam, where Hindus offer food to their deities and enjoy the leftovers.\n+A very similar devotional practice can be observed in Buddhist temples where oil and rice offerings are given for the monks or left in honor of lost loved ones. Such practices are alive and well in the Vietnamese Buddhist community, whose active Quan-Am temple in Southwest Houston can regularly be seen filled with fruits and oils left to honor the departed. Certainly, any discussion of Buddhist eats is not complete without reference to the intricate and spiritually significant Zen tea ceremony. There are local opportunities in Houston for interested individuals to learn about Zen tea ceremonies or experience a demonstration.\n+Coming from a Lutheran-Christian background, the food I think of when I think “church” is often found at a potluck. Usually potato “themed,” the dishes of a Christian potluck are not exactly culinary “delights” (although you’ve not lived until you’ve tried green jello with carrots). Jokes aside, Christians have important religious eating traditions as well. Foremost among them is the sacrament of Holy Communion where Christians partake of bread and wine in remembrance of Christ’s sacrifice and his final meal with his disciples. In addition to this practice, many pagan cultural practices were translated into Christian traditions by various cultures. Whether its the lamb cakes of the Czechs, the hot cross buns of the Brits, the Tarta de Santiago of Spain or the rich-with-meaning Slovak Christmas meal (velija) that my family enjoys each year, Christianity has its spiritually significant meals.\nAs evidenced above, when it comes to religious eats there are thousands of delicious avenues for the inquisitive to enjoy. So dive in, get your fill and along the way learn a little more about ancient faith and practice in the modern world through religious eats. All the while, as mom would say, remember you manners, be respectful and always learn the hows, whos, whys and whats.

{"question":"What are the key differences between how scientific theories emerge versus scientific laws when comparing examples from geology and evolutionary biology?","answer":"Scientific theories and laws serve different functions in science. A scientific law, as exemplified in geology's plate tectonics, is not an explanation but rather an inductive result that tells us how to predict - like how Earth's plates move at a rate of one to two inches per year. In contrast, a theory like evolution provides explanatory frameworks and is the highest level to which a scientific idea can be promoted. Theories are based on data from specific domains and are continually tested with new evidence. They can be modified or expanded when new data doesn't match, as seen in both geological and biological sciences. The theory of plate tectonics explains how Earth's surface moves through convection in the mantle, while evolutionary theory provides a framework for understanding life sciences. Both undergo extensive peer review and cross-checking among scientists, but neither claims absolute certainty, as measurement precision can always improve.","context":["By Harry Keller\nEditor, Science Education\nFor nearly 150 years since Darwin first published The Origin of Species in 1859, the controversy has continued. Despite mountains of evidence collected from many branches of science, some still fight vigorously against teaching evolution in our school science classes.\nI maintain that those fighting against this teaching are harming our society but may just be helping out science education. I refer here to what’s happening in the United States, which seems to be the country most affected by this controversy as well as being the one in which I live.\nAnswering why the anti-evolution forces are harming our society and how they might end up helping improve science education requires some digging. Society depends on technology to support our standard of living and on the creation of new technologies for export to fund our ability to buy technology. More and more of these technologies are biological in nature. Research into biology and medicine moves forward best when we understand the underlying principles of life. A framework upon which to set ideas and to imagine new ideas helps immensely in both research and development of new technologies and new products.\nIf you study well the advances in biology and medicine in recent decades, you will see that the concepts inherent in evolution have played an important role. If our students leave school without this important framework, then they are ill-prepared to participate in the advancement of science. If, even worse, they leave school opposing science and its precepts, then they may work to retard scientific advances. Evolution, as a concept and framework, has become the underpinning, tying together previously disparate aspects in all of our life sciences.\nRight now, the world is on the verge of eradicating polio. One of three strains has already been destroyed, and only a few countries still harbor reservoirs of the remaining two and possibly only one. While this effort has been largely one of vaccinating everyone, development of new vaccines rests on medical research that depends on understanding how life works. Evolution is a crucial component. The speed with which we find cures for cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, and Parkinson’s disease are likely to depend on scientists who use evolutionary theory in their work.\nOur society suffers directly from not having more scientists who understand and use evolution in their work. It also suffers indirectly from a populace in which many have been educated to be suspicious of science. Science is just a way of thinking, of going about the business of finding out. No one should be suspicious of science. You can suspect individual scientists as they’re just as human as the rest of us, but do not lump all who seek enlightenment in our natural world through time-tested processes together. Know that most scientists seek knowledge, not power.\nBefore discussing the impact on science education, I’ll detour through some thoughts about the evolution controversy itself. Too many people characterize it as science against religion. They have it exactly backward. Science does not fight religion, although some scientists have seen fit to do so. They do not represent science. Actually, no one does.\nScience is a process, a way of thinking that has been proven to work well when we seek to extract nature’s secrets. Finding out about how the universe works is hard work. We are often fooled by our desire to see patterns even when they don’t fit all the facts. Changing attitudes and long-held beliefs can take a long time. Few people realize today that in 1980 half of geologists did not accept the theory of plate tectonics. Yet, this theory is routinely taught in today’s classrooms without controversy.\nWhat actually happens in the evolution-religion controversy is that religion attacks science, never the reverse. Science does not attack — it explains. Some scientist makes some discovery and publishes it. Some person somewhere reads about it and decides that the discovery is a heresy. It’s not as though God speaks to us and says that. It’s a fallible human being who makes the decision. Generally, it involves the interpretation of some sacred work. We wouldn’t have so many denominations of Christianity (most of the anti-evolutionists in the U.S. are Christians) if the sacred works were unambiguous. Indeed, we see many different translations of the Bible, which also indicates a certain ambiguous nature to this work.\nA small minority of Christians have decided that teaching evolution undermines their religion. They have become very vocal and very influential. Many say they agree just to avoid the wrath of those few who are so incensed. Many actually are swayed by the fervor of those who have taken it upon themselves to interpret their Bible.\nBut science doesn’t care. The words of Sergeant Friday, “Just the facts, ma’am,” are all that science cares about. Like good detectives, scientists follow the evidence and are not supposed to allow their prejudices to interfere. They’re human, too, and do get confused on occasion by what they expect. However, the system of science is self-correcting. When scientists publish, others check their publications. They can review the evidence. They can even collect their own data for comparison. Science is not dogmatic, cannot afford to be dogmatic. Science has no sacred works that cannot be challenged.\nSome say that evolution is “just a theory.” Yes, but it’s a scientific theory. What they miss is that, in science, a theory is the pinnacle, the top level, to which an idea can be promoted. Once a scientific idea becomes a theory, it has no higher level to achieve. Over time, such theories will be buttressed by more and more data, evidence that the denotation of theory is appropriate. Sometimes, as with Newton’s theory of universal gravitation and the precession of Mercury’s orbit, data do not match up. The error, in this case, was very small and required many repeated measurements with improved precision before scientists were certain something was awry. They sought many explanations within Newton’s law without success. Only Einstein, with his general relativity theory, was finally able to explain the discrepancy. However, Newton’s theory is still used widely for almost everything.\nSimply, we base theories on data that necessarily originate in some domain. Scientists collect more data from within that domain and also seek data from outside of the domain to see whether the theory holds there too. If so, all’s good. If not, then, as with Mercury’s precession, some new theory must be found to explain the new data. The old theory still holds for data in the old domain. However, the new theory may profoundly affect our view of the universe.\nIf theories are at the top, what’s a scientific law? It’s a horse of a different color, a totally different concept. A law is not an explanation but rather an inductive result that tells us how to predict. The universal gravitation law tells us that the attraction between two masses is proportional to each of the masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. The universal gravitation theory says that all masses, whether on the Earth or in the heavens, obey the same law. We cannot be sure that this theory is correct for extremely distant objects, billions of light-years away, but it seems to be. Some data suggest that it may not be so, but without more data and more precision, we cannot be certain one way or the other.\nPlate tectonics attracted much opposition. So did the meteor theory of dinosaur extinction. Yet, these now have become accepted, although much science is being done to ferret out the details.\nAll of these ideas lead naturally to the nature of science. Some statements above hint at it. Science uses data from the real world to induce ideas. These ideas then are used to deduce conclusions about what will happen in a given situation. The process involves much cross checking among scientists because they are taught to trust no one when it comes to scientific data, hypotheses (what an idea becomes before becoming a theory), and theories. Use your own brain and, if possible, your own data before accepting any idea.\nAll scientists know, as a part of their very being, that measurement is imprecise. No matter how well you make a measurement, you can always do better. You never reach absolute precision. You also never reach absolute certainty. This is an enormous strength of science. However, as with Jiujitsu, people seek to use it as a weakness. You’ll hear some say that scientists don’t know everything, and scientists are the first to admit it because they’ve learned over long experience that it’s true. This, however, does not mean that they know nothing. Others say that scientific measurements are subject to error. Of course, they are. Scientists are trained to estimate and report the errors inherent in their measurements. These are included in their analyses before making conclusions. And so it goes.\nAll of these ideas lead to my initial statement regarding the evolution controversy possibly helping science education. Today, many recognize that our science classes are doing an inadequate job of teaching the nature of science. It’s not really possible to discuss the theory of evolution in the face of religious objectors without understanding the nature of science. Students in the classroom must be acquainted with the nature of science before discussing the major theories — including evolution.\nAfter all, I’m sure that an excellent case could be made for a religious objection to plate tectonics. Some would maintain that it’s simply contrary to the Bible. Others would sidestep the issue by saying that continents may move, but God moves them or decides how they’ll move.\nEvolution controversy could help science education by convincing teachers, and those who teach them, that learning about the nature of science is crucial to learning science. Bringing the nature of science into every discussion of scientific theory and every laboratory investigation will improve the quality of science education considerably. You may not find questions on state tests about it, but understanding the nature of science comprises an important part of scientific thinking skills that will become, for those who have them, a valuable thinking tool throughout life.\nFor more on this topic, look up Carl Sagan’s “baloney detection kit” on your favorite search engine.\nFiled under: Uncategorized","What is plate tectonics?\nPlate tectonics explains the movement of Earth's surface.\nFrom the deepest ocean trench to the tallest mountain, plate tectonics explains the features and movement of Earth's surface in the present and the past.\nDeveloped from the 1950s to the 1970s, the theory of plate tectonics is the modern update to continental drift, an idea first proposed by scientist Alfred Wegener in 1912 which stated that Earth’s continents had \"drifted\" across the planet over time. Wegener didn't have an explanation for how continents could move around the planet, but researchers do now: Plate tectonics.\nPlate tectonics is the theory that Earth's outer shell is divided into large slabs of solid rock, called “plates,” that glide over Earth's mantle, the rocky inner layer above Earth’s core. Earth’s solid outer layer, which includes the crust and the uppermost mantle, is called the lithosphere. It is 100 km (60 miles) thick, according to the Encyclopedia Britannica. Below the lithosphere is the asthenosphere — a viscous layer kept malleable by heat deep within the Earth. It lubricates the undersides of Earth's tectonic plates, allowing the lithosphere to move around.\nRelated: Plate tectonics are 3.6 billion years old, oldest minerals on Earth reveal\nNicholas van der Elst, a seismologist at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory in Palisades, New York, considers plate tectonics to be the “unifying theory of geology.”\n\"Before plate tectonics, people had to come up with explanations of the geologic features in their region that were unique to that particular region,\" said Van der Elst. \"Plate tectonics unified all these descriptions and said that you should be able to describe all geologic features as though driven by the relative motion of these tectonic plates.\"\nHow plate tectonics works\nThe driving force behind plate tectonics is convection in the mantle. Hot material near the Earth's core rises, and colder mantle rock sinks. \"It's kind of like a pot boiling on a stove,\" Van der Elst said.\nMeanwhile, geologists imagine the plates above this roiling mantle as bumper cars; they repeatedly collide, stick together, then rip apart. Geologists refer to the places where segments meet and divide as plate boundaries. They're thought to wrap around the Earth like seams on a baseball.\nRelated: The Alps are still growing faster than they're eroding\nThere are three ways in which plate boundaries meet, and each one triggers a unique geological feature.\nConvergent boundaries occur where plates collide into one another. Where those plates meet, Earth's crust crumbles and buckles into mountain ranges. For example, India and Asia came together about 55 million years ago to create the Himalaya Mountains. As the mash-up continues, those mountains grow higher and higher. Geologists have discovered the Swiss Alps are being lifted faster than they are being lowered through erosion—and are thus growing every year, according to a 2020 study in the journal Earth-Science Reviews. However, when a mountain’s mass becomes too large to resist gravity, it will cease to grow. Erosion also hinders growth by wearing mountains down, but because mountains can grow at a relatively fast rate, erosion typically doesn’t win out, according to the University of Hawai’i at Manoa.\nBut converging plates don't always collide upward. Sometimes, an ocean plate (which is made of denser rock than landmasses) collides with a continental plate, in which case it \"subducts\" or dives beneath the other plate. It then descends into the Earth's mantle, the layer underneath the crust, melts in the mantle's hot magma, and is spewed out in a volcanic eruption. Many spectacular volcanoes are found along subduction zones, such as the \"Ring of Fire\" that surrounds the Pacific Ocean.\nWhen two oceanic plates converge, a deep trench forms, such as the Mariana Trench in the North Pacific Ocean which is believed to be the deepest point on Earth. These types of collisions can also lead to underwater volcanoes.\nAs the name suggests, divergent boundaries are tectonic boundaries where plates \"diverge\" or are tugged apart. This motion creates giant troughs on land, such as the East Africa Rift. In the ocean, this same process creates mid-ocean ridges. Hot magma from Earth’s mantle wells up at these ridges, forming new ocean crust and shoving the plates apart. Underwater mountains and volcanoes can rise along this seam, in some cases forming islands. For example, the Mid-Atlantic Ridge runs directly through Iceland.\nThe final type of plate boundary, transform boundaries, exist where plates move sideways in relation to each other. It’s the slip-sliding motion of plate boundaries that triggers many earthquakes. California's San Andreas Fault, where the North American and Pacific tectonic plates grind past each other with a mostly horizontal motion, is one famous example of a transform boundary.\nTectonic plates move at a rate of one to 2 inches (3 to 5 centimeters) per year, according to National Geographic. That's about as fast as your fingernails grow!\nHow many plates are there?\nBecause Earth is spherical, its tectonic or lithospheric plates are fractured into dozens of curved sections. (Imagine it like a cracked egg shell.) Each plate ranges from a few hundred to thousands of kilometers in size, according to the U.S. Geological Service (USGS), and depending on its size, is categorized as \"major,\" \"minor\" or \"micro.\"\nAccording to World Atlas, seven major plates exist: the North American, Pacific, Eurasian, African, Indo-Australian, South American and Antarctic tectonic plates. However, according to a 2012 article in Nature, earthquakes over the last few decades are evidence that the Indo-Australian plate has cracked over the last 10 million years, creating a separate Indian Plate and Australian Plate which will increase the number of major plates to eight.\nWhether that new divide counts as a boundary or not, the Pacific Plate is still the largest of all tectonic plates. It measures 39,768,522 square miles (103,000,000 square kilometers) in size, and lies hidden beneath the ocean.\nThe list of Earth’s minor plates includes the Arabian Plate, Caribbean Plate, Cocos Plate, Nazca Plate, Philippine Plate, Scotia Plate, and more. There are also many smaller plates throughout the world.\nWhen did plate tectonics start?\nWhile the Earth is estimated to be 4.54 billion years old, oceanic crust is constantly recycled at subduction zones. That means the oldest seafloor is still only about 200 million years old. The oldest ocean rocks are found in the northwestern Pacific Ocean and the eastern Mediterranean Sea. Fragments of continental crust are much older, with large chunks at least 3.8 billion years old found in Greenland.\nWith clues left behind in rocks and fossils, geoscientists can reconstruct the past history of Earth's continents. Most scientists think modern plate tectonics took over from earlier planetary development about 3 billion years ago, based on ancient magmas and minerals preserved in rocks from that period. However, researchers have found evidence that plate tectonics could have been active for as long as 4 billion years, according to a 2020 article in Discover Magazine.\n\"We don't really know when plate tectonics as it looks today got started, but we do know that we have continental crust that was likely scraped off a down-going slab [a tectonic plate in a subduction zone] that is 3.8 billion years old,\" Van der Elst said. \"We could guess that means plate tectonics was operating, but it might have looked very different from today.\"\nAs the continents jostle around the Earth, they occasionally come together to form giant supercontinents or a single landmass. One of the earliest big supercontinents, called Rodinia, assembled about 1 billion years ago. Its breakup is linked to a global glaciation called Snowball Earth.\nA more recent supercontinent called Pangaea formed about 300 million years ago. Africa, South America, North America and Europe nestled closely together, leaving a characteristic pattern of fossils and rocks for geologists to decipher once Pangaea broke apart. The puzzle pieces left behind by Pangaea, from fossils to the matching shorelines along the Atlantic Ocean, provided the first hints that the Earth's continents move.\nDiagram of plate tectonics\n- Delve deeper into plate tectonics with this USGS online booklet.\n- Watch \"How Do We Know Plate Tectonics Is Real?\", courtesy of the PBS It’s Okay to Be Smart YouTube channel.\n- Model the process of plate tectonics using graham crackers with the U.S. Space & Rocket Center!\nLive Science newsletter\nStay up to date on the latest science news by signing up for our Essentials newsletter.\nTiffany Means is a meteorologist turned science writer based in the Blue Ridge mountains of North Carolina.

{"question":"How do reading books and playing video games compare in their ability to develop empathy in children?","answer":"Both reading books and playing certain video games can develop empathy in children, though they work in different ways. Books help children step into characters' shoes and experience life from another person's perspective, especially through first-person narratives that share characters' thoughts. Meanwhile, prosocial video games that include elements of helping others have been shown to increase empathy, helpfulness, and cooperativeness in children over time, as demonstrated in a study of 2,300 children in Singapore. Games like Animal Crossing and Sims, which involve helping neighbors and managing virtual communities, can provide these benefits.","context":["How to Instill a Love for Reading in Your Child\nThese are some of the highlights from our discussion.\n“A nation that does not read much does not know much. And a nation that does not know much is more likely to make poor choices in the home, the marketplace, the jury box, and the voting booth. And those decisions ultimately affect the entire nation… the literate and illiterate.” – Jim Trelease\nWhy should we encourage children to read and why is it so important to instill that love for reading?\n- Children who read are smarter\n- Reading builds empathy\n- It builds creativity and innovation\n- There is an inverse relationship between reading and crime\nGetting Kids to Love Reading\nEncouraging children to read, especially to develop that love for reading, has always been challenging even before technology came along. Now, with so much clamouring for our children’s attention, it seems almost impossible. So what can we do?\n- Set the example – if you want to raise a reader, you need to be a reader because if you’re not reading, why should they? Don’t just read with your children but make sure that they see you enjoy reading as well.\n- Create the environment – you can’t raise a reader if they have nothing to read so make sure you offer them lots of reading material. It doesn’t have to be just books, you can have magazines, newspapers, or comics as well. It doesn’t matter what it is as long as your child wants to read it.\n- Follow their interests – what does your child like? There are books on every topic under the sun. For instance, Minecraft novels are great for reluctant readers who are Minecraft fans.\n- Capture their curiosity – start reading the story together and pause at a cliffhanger. Save the rest of the story for the next reading session. Your children may be so eager to find out what happens next that they will continue reading the rest of the book without you.\nReading vs Technology\nTwo of my favorite benefits of reading to babies and toddler aged-children is that you build their attention span, something I think has suffered because of fast-paced, fragmented content that is so readily available now – I read somewhere that we are actually raising the most distracted generation in history, and I believe books have the ability to nurture attention to detail and narrative, in ways that digital learning just can’t do. – Michelle Lim-Chua\nSince technology is in our lives, let’s be smart about how we use it.\n- Read-along stories and interactive storybook apps are great for encouraging reluctant readers.\n- Audio stories are useful for increasing your “read aloud” story time with your children even when you don’t have time to read to them. Just make sure you reserve some reading time together as a parent-child bonding session to reinforce the value of reading.\n- Phonics: Encouraging Literacy at Home\n- Helping Your Child with Reading\n- Jeff Gunhus’ Tips for Reaching the Reluctant Reader\n“Great books help you understand, and they help you feel understood.” – John Green, YA Author\n- Helping through the use of books.\n- A process that leads an individual towards good health through the medium of literature.\n- Using books to help children think about, understand, and work through social and emotional concerns.\nHow can we use it?\n- Stories can help us talk about difficult topics we find difficult to discuss with our children, for instance, religion, racism, and death. Books can help young children understand abstract concepts, such as death, which can be difficult for young children to grasp.\n- Bibliotherapy can be useful for helping children deal with difficult emotions and experiences, for instance, bullying, puberty, discrimination.\n- Bibliotherapy and Philosophical Discussions Through Stories\n- Recommended Books for Kids – What Do We Do All Day\n“The books we read spark our imagination, turn on our creativity, and get us thinking in a deeper way than ordinary.” – Jody Hedlund, Author\nCreativity is the most important quality we have and it is one that our children will need to be successful in life. As Ken Robinson says – children are born creative, the question is how we keep them that way. Stories are one way of keeping that creative flame alive.\n- Creativity doesn’t exist in a vacuum, it is comes from the ideas we are exposed to. Books provide that access to an unlimited imagination – the more we read, the more ideas we have.\n- Books spur the imagination as we convert the words we read on a page into the images we see in our heads. Reading is an exercise of the imagination.\n“Reading fiction not only develops our imagination and creativity, it gives us the skills to be alone. It gives us the ability to feel empathy for people we’ve never met, living lives we couldn’t possibly experience for ourselves, because the book puts us inside the character’s skin.” – Ann Patchett, Author.\nIf we want children to embody the virtues that we believe in, we need to teach them. One way to do that is to use stories because they can help us start that conversation about important topics our children need to be aware of, such as racism and embracing diversity.\n- Books can teach children empathy. It allows them to step into the character’s shoes and experience what it is like to live a day as another person. This is especially powerful with books in the first person that tell the story from the “I” perspective.\n- Stories often share the thoughts of different characters that can help children to see how differently other people think. It helps them to see things from another person’s perspective.\n- Stories allow children play out the consequences of actions without having to experience it in the real world.\n- Great books for character building: “Help Me Be Good” by Joy Berry and “The Value Tale Series”.\n- Five Life Lessons for Character Development\n- Nurturing the Heart – Building Character\n- Character Building Stories from Real People\n- Emotional Intelligence: Why Children Need Empathy\n- The Benefit of Perspective Taking\nIn the era of Fake News and misinformation, we need to raise thinking children.

We need children who can navigate the grey issues.\n- In philosophy, there are no “right” or “wrong” answers. Children can explore different lines of thoughts and perspectives.\n- The more we get children thinking, the better off they will be in future when they are faced with challenging issues.\n- Stories allow us to introduce philosophical discussions with children as we explore ideas from the books they love.","Believe it or not, playing video games really is good for your brain. Certain games may make you show more empathy, helpfulness, and cooperativeness.\nSince the 1980s, researchers have debated whether or not video games have negative effects on people who play them. Yet a recent spate of research suggests playing video games — even so-called first-person shooter games — is good for you, too.\nIn one study, video games were linked to increased cognitive skills, such as spatial awareness, mental sharpness, reaction time, and creativity. Those skills, researchers say, may even transfer to settings outside the game — perhaps one reason why the U.S. Army has used video games to train and recruit for decades.\nA new crop of video games goes further: they’re designed to improve mental health. There are even versions for adults.\n“I think that maybe we’re finally getting to the point where we’re starting to get smarter about this,” says psychologist Douglas Gentile, PhD. “Designers have realized just how valuable their games can be, and have started to … dream bigger than they have before. I’m hoping that finally we’re starting to catch up to the promise that gaming has always had.”\nGentile, an associate professor of developmental psychology at Iowa State University, is an expert on the effects of video games. While violent video games have been connected to an increase in aggressive thoughts and behavior, he says — such as playground bullying in children — more cooperative games have overtly positive benefits, too.\nIn a study of more than 2,300 children in Singapore, Gentile and a team of researchers found children who played prosocial games — those that included an element of helping others — showed more empathy, helpfulness, and cooperativeness over the two years of the study. Meanwhile, children who played violent video games demonstrated a decrease in such useful behaviors in the same period, and an increase in less helpful behavior.\nGaming can absolutely affect behaviors, Gentile says. “And, really, there should be no surprise. Because what we’re talking about here… is learning. And anything you practice, you learn, right? There’s no way to stop your brain from learning.”\nThe catch, Gentile says, is that “games for good” have to be fun to play. “That’s the problem — gamifying something doesn’t immediately make it work. Why is it educational games don’t have a really good track record in school? It’s because they suck. It’s because they’re not fun to play. Just making it a game doesn’t actually make it work.”\nResearchers at the University of California–San Francisco’s new Neuroscape lab, opened in March 2014, are working on developing mental health and cognitively skills games for a larger audience.\nIn the past two years, game creators and investors have also met for a “NeuroGaming” conference in San Francisco to explore games directed toward a range of applications, from mental health and wellness to improving cognitive function.\nIf you’re interested in playing video games for good health, you may have to wait a few years. Most games are still in the prototype stage.\nIn the meantime, some existing games can provide mental health benefits. For children, Gentile recommends the game series Sims, in which players create and then manage and organize a virtual community. Another, Animal Crossing, involves helping neighbors around the user’s recently purchased home. (The appeal of both games is longstanding: Sims is one of the best-selling games in history, and Gentile’s teenage daughters, he says, still play Animal Crossing.) Video games can even be modified to suit cooperative, prosocial ends: one researcher customized the popular game Minecraft to create a world in which users are required to interact cooperatively to achieve certain goals.\nFor adults, try these cutting-edge mental health games, developed by gamers and psychology researchers:\n- SuperBetter aims to increase personal resilience. Created by veteran game designer Jane McGonigal to help herself recover from a severe concussion, it claims to develop physical, mental, emotional, and social strength via games that help you tackle tough challenges while receiving support and developing resilience.\n- In Mindbloom’s Life Game — tagline: “Grow the life you want” — players are encouraged to pursue meaningful activities of their own choosing. They then receive rewards for performing those activities in everyday life. Other gamelike apps from the company focus on improving quality of life, gaining momentum, tracking energy, and other positive goals.\n- The well-designed app Happify uses the principles of positive psychology to focus on increasing happiness, personal meaning, and social engagement in interactive games and assignments.\nUsed frequently, such games retrain the brain, Gentile says — in essence serving as a form of self-therapy. “I think apps like this can help slow down the pattern of habitual response. … That’s what a good therapist does.”\nIf you’re interested in furthering the science of good gaming, consider taking part in a study that aims to separate what makes a successful mental health app from the 40,000 or so health apps available. The online study, conducted by the University of California–San Francisco’s Brighten Center, takes just 5 minutes. The center is also conducting a study of apps designed to treat depression.\nMarch 05, 2020\nJanet O’Dell, RN"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"format_constrained"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:d85edeb3-038e-48f8-a42b-8b4c4edfb0c3>","<urn:uuid:3b17e7f8-eecb-4fa8-b576-2873288420ee>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What is the historical significance of GMT, and how does MonetDB/SQL handle historical time calculations before the standardization of time zones?","answer":"GMT was established at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, London, and became the global standard at the International Meridian Conference in 1884, which established 24 different time zones. Before this standardization, different cities used their own local times. For historical time calculations, MonetDB/SQL implements the Gregorian Calendar system, though values before 1752 (when the calendar was widely adopted) may not correspond to dates actually used at the time.

The starting point are SQL 92 and the ODBC time-related data types. There are six basic types and operations on them:\n|DATE||a date in the Gregorian calendar YYYY-MM-DD, e.g. 1999-12-31|\n|TIME [ '(' posint ')' ]||time of day (HH:MI:SS.sss) with precision (default 0)|\n|TIME [ '(' posint ')' ] WITH TIME ZONE||time of day (HH:MI:SS.sss) with precision (default 0) and time zone information|\n|TIMESTAMP [ '(' posint ')' ]||date concatenated with unique time, precision|\n|TIMESTAMP [ '(' posint ')' ] WITH TIME ZONE||date concatenated with unique time, precision and time zone information|\n|INTERVAL interval_qualifier||a temporal interval such as: INTERVAL SECOND or INTERVAL MONTH|\nA timestamp is a combination of date and time, indicating an exact point in time (GMT). GMT is the time at the Greenwich meridian without a daylight savings time (DST) regime. Absence of DST means that hours are consecutive (no jumps) which makes it easy to perform time difference calculations.\nThe local time is often different from GMT (even at Greenwich in summer, as the UK also has DST). Therefore, whenever a timestamp is composed from a local date and time a timezone should be specified in order to translate the local time to GMT (and vice versa if a timestamp is to be decomposed in a local date and time). To adjust the local time can issue a command such as SET TIME ZONE INTERVAL '1' HOUR TO MINUTE.\nWe provide predefined timezone objects for a number of timezones (see below). Also, there is one timezone called the local timezone, which can be set to one global value in a running MonetDB server, that is used if the timezone parameter is omitted from a command that needs it (if not set, the default value of the local timezone is plain GMT).\nThe value ranges and lexical denotations are defined as follows:\nMin and max years. The maximum and minimum dates and timestamps that can be stored are in the years 5,867,411 and -5,867,411, respectively. Interestingly, the year 0 is not a valid year. The year before 1 is called -1.\nDates. Fall in a valid year, and have a month and day that is valid in that year. The first day in the year is January 1, the last December 31. Months with 31 days are January, March, May, July, August, October, and December, while April, June, September and November have 30 days. February has 28 days, expect in a leap year, when it has 29. A leap year is a year that is an exact multiple of 4. Years that are a multiple of 100 but not of 400 are an exception; they are no leap years.\nTime. The smallest time is 00:00:00.000 and the largest 23:59:59.999 (the hours in a time range between [0,23], minutes and seconds between [0,59] and milliseconds between [0:999] ). Time identifies a valid time-of-day, not an amount of time (for denoting amounts of time, or time differences, we use here concepts like \"number of days\" or \"number of seconds\" denoted by some value of a standard integer type).\nTimestamp. A valid timestamp is formed by a combination of a valid date and valid daytime. When creating a timestamp from a date and daytime, a timezone should be specified (if timezone is omitted, the local timezone is assumed). If a timezone is specified, it is used to convert the date and time in that timezone to GMT, which is the internal timestamp representation. One problem here is that the first hour after DST has ended (some Sunday night in autumn, generally), the time is set back one hour, so the same times occur twice. Hence two translations to a timestamp are possible for such date and time combinations. In those case, we act as if it was the first occurrence (still within DST).\nFor difference calculations between dates (in numbers of days) we use signed integer. Hence, the valid range for difference calculations is between -2147483647 and 2147483647 days (which corresponds to roughly -5,867,411 and 5,867,411 years).\nFor difference between timestamps (in numbers of milliseconds) we use 64-bit bigint. These are large integers of maximally 19 digits, which therefore impose a limit of about 106,000,000,000 years on the maximum time difference used in computations.\nThe basics of the Gregorian calendar stem from the time of Julius Caesar, when the concept of a solar year as consisting of 365.25 days (365 days plus once in 4 years one extra day) was introduced. However, this Julian Calendar, made a year 11 minutes long, which subsequently accumulated over the ages, causing a shift in seasons. In medieval times this was noticed, and in 1582 Pope Gregory XIII issued a decree, skipped 11 days. This measure was not adopted in the whole of Europe immediately, however. For this reason, there were many regions in Europe that upheld different dates.\nIt was only on September 14, 1752 that some consensus was reached and more countries joined the Gregorian Calendar, which also was last modified at that time. The modifications were twofold: first, 12 more days were skipped. Second, it was determined that the year starts on January 1 (in England, for instance, it had been starting on March 25). Other parts of the world have adopted the Gregorian Calendar even later.\nMonetDB implements the Gregorian Calendar in all its regularity. This means that values before the year 1752 probably do not correspond with the dates that people really used in times before that (what they did use, however, was very vague anyway, as explained above). In solar terms, however, this calendar is reasonably accurate (see the \"correction seconds\" note below).\nThe basic timezone regime was established on November 1, 1884 in the International Meridian Conference held in Greenwich (UK). Before that, a different time held in almost any city. The conference established 24 different time zones defined by regular longitude intervals that all differed by one hour. Not for long it was that national and political interest started to erode this nicely regular system. Timezones now often follow country borders, and some regions (like the Guinea areas in Latin America) have times that differ with a 15 minute grain from GMT rather than an hour or even half-an-hour grain.\nAn extra complication became the introduction of daylight saving time (DST), which causes a time jump in spring, when the clock is skips one hour and in autumn, when the\nclock is set back one hour (so in a one hour span, the same times occur twice). The DST regime is a purely political decision made on a country-by-country basis. Countries in the same timezone can have different DST regimes. Even worse, some countries have DST in some years, and not in other years.\nTo avoid confusion, this temporal type module stores absolute points of time in GMT only (GMT does not have a DST regime). When storing local times in the database, or retrieving local times from absolute timestamps, a correct timezone object should be used for the conversion.\nApplications that do not make correct use of timezones, will produce irregular results on e.g. time difference calculations.\nOnce every such hundred years, a correction second is added on new year's night. This rule would seriously complicate the temporal type module (as then the duration of a day, which is now the fixed number of 24*60*60*1000 milliseconds, becomes parametrized by the date), it is not implemented. Hence these seconds are lost, so time difference calculations in milliseconds (rather than in days) have a small error if the time difference spans many hundreds of years.\nWe cannot handle well changes in the timezone rules (e.g., DST only exists since 40 years, and some countries make frequent changes to the DST policy). To accommodate this we should make timezone_local a function with a year parameter. The tool should maintain and access a timezone database. Lookup of the correct timezone would be dynamic in this structure. The timezone_setlocal would just set the string name of the timezone."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:de0388e1-d561-47bf-b91f-92086b853fb6>","<urn:uuid:e5f03371-bcd1-46c6-bd81-4675e8dbf889>"],"error":null}
