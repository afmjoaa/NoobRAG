{"question":"What are the minimum wage requirements under state vs federal law, and what records must be kept regarding employee compensation?","answer":"Under Minnesota law, businesses grossing $625,000 or less must pay minimum $5.25/hour, with a possible $4.90/hour training wage for new employees under 20 during first 90 days. However, under federal FLSA (applying to businesses grossing over $500,000 or engaging in interstate commerce), minimum wage is $7.25/hour. The higher standard must be followed when both laws apply. Regarding recordkeeping, employers must maintain detailed records of time tracking, daily/weekly earnings, hourly rates including overtime, total overtime pay, wage deductions, and total wages paid each period. These compensation records, including payroll journals and employee earning histories, must be retained for at least 10 years.","context":["Having employees is one of the most challenging aspects of running a business. There are many complicated laws governing when workers are considered employees, how they should be treated, how much they must be paid, and much more. Having an attorney may be very helpful in assuring your business is compliant with the myriad of laws and administrative rules. Attorney Patrick McGuiness has extensive experience in many facets of employment law and is a frequent author and lecturer on employment law topics.\nEmployees or Independent Contractors\nHow a business classifies workers is not the final determination about the workers’ status. If the Department of Labor audits a business, they apply the provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act to the employer-worker relationship which exists. Then they make a determination based on the total activity of the situation and how much the employer controls the workers activities.\nAmong the factors which the Court has considered significant are:\n1) The extent to which the services rendered are an integral part of the principal’s business. If they are, then the relationship looks more like that of an employer-employee.\n2) The permanency of the relationship. The more permanent and exclusive a relationship is, the more it looks like that of an employer-employee.\n3) The amount of the alleged contractor’s investment in facilities and equipment. If the business provides the worker with the facilities and tools with which to do their work, it looks like an employer-employee relationship.\n4) The nature and degree of control by the principal. When a business controls the time, place and methods of the workers work, it looks like an employer-employee relationship.\n5) The alleged contractor’s opportunities for profit and loss. When a worker is paid on an hourly basis, and cannot gain a profit by working more efficiently it looks like an employer-employee relationship.\n6) The amount of initiative, judgment, or foresight in open market competition with others required for the success of the claimed independent contractor. If a worker is allowed to hold themselves out as being “for hire” by others then they appear to be an independent contractor.\n7) The degree of independent business organization and operation. If a worker has a business entity such as a Limited Liability Company (LLC) or Corporation, and operate it independently of the company being audited, then they appear to be a legitimate independent contractor.\nNone of these factors alone proves a worker should be classified as an employee or independent contractor. The relationship in total is looked at and a determination is made. It is often helpful to have the assistance of an attorney when looking at the relationship a company has with workers.\nUnless there is a contract which states otherwise, employment in Minnesota is considered to be “At-Will”. This means that an employer can terminate or fire an employee at any time and for any reason as long as that reason is not illegal. Illegal reasons for termination in Minnesota include discrimination based on race, creed, color, sex, national origin, ancestry, religion, age, disability, sexual orientation or marital status.\nThere is also a common misconception that a “2 week notice” must be given before an employee can quit, or be laid off. Under Minnesota law, there is no need for any notice to be given in order to leave a position or be terminated.\nCompensation is important to every employee. How much a business must pay their employees depends on a number of factors, including figuring out what law applies to the business. It is also important to consider if any exemptions to overtime and minimum wage laws apply to any categories of workers at the business.\nMinnesota law and the Fair Labor Standards Act differ on overtime requirements. Some small businesses may only fall under Minnesota law, which requires overtime be paid at time and one half rate after 48 hours in each 7 day work week. Most Minnesota business fall under the Fair Labor Standards Act, this applies to businesses that gross more than $500,000 per year, OR “avail themselves of interstate commerce”. The Fair Labor Standards Act requires employees be paid time and one half rate overtime for all hours worked over 40 hours in a 7 day work week.\nA “7 day work week” is a period of 7 consecutive days which is designated by a business as their work week. There is no requirement that it be Sunday – Saturday, it can be whatever works best for the business. The work week can be changed from time to time, so long as the change is not designed to avoid paying overtime to employees.\nOnce again, Minnesota law and Federal Law differ on minimum wage requirements. Minnesota law requires employees of businesses grossing $625,000 or less be paid a minimum of $5.25 per hour. Further, an employer may pay $4.90 an hour as a “Training Wage” to new employees who are younger than age 20 during their first 90 consecutive days of employment. Permanent or current employees may not be displaced by new employees covered by the training wage.\nHowever, most business fall under the Fair Labor Standards Act, which requires workers be paid a minimum of $7.25 per hour. Generally speaking, if both Federal and State law apply to a given situation, it is safest to follow the law which is more protective of employees.\nEmployers are free to offer incentive pay such as “double time” pay for nights, however, neither State nor Federal law requires any additional pay for holidays, nights, or weekends. There is also no limit on the total number of hours an employee can work in a work week as long as the employee is compensated properly for overtime.\nThere is a common misconception that employees can be paid a salary in order to avoid the need to pay them overtime. This is not always the case. Under the law, the presumption is that employees must be paid overtime unless their position qualifies for an exemption to overtime requirements.\nTo qualify for the executive employee exemption, all of the following tests must be met:\nTo qualify for the administrative employee exemption, all of the following tests must be met:\nLearned Professional Exemption\nTo qualify for the learned professional employee exemption, all of the following tests must be met:\nCreative Professional Exemption\nTo qualify for the creative professional employee exemption, all of the following tests must be met:\nComputer Employee Exemption\nTo qualify for the computer employee exemption, the following tests must be met:\n1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional specifications;\n2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and related to user or system design specifications;\n3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer programs related to machine operating systems; or\n4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which requires the same level of skills.\nOutside Sales Exemption\nTo qualify for the outside sales employee exemption, all of the following tests must be met:\nHighly Compensated Employees\nHighly compensated employees performing office or non-manual work and paid total annual compensation of $100,000 or more (which must include at least $455 per week paid on a salary or fee basis) are exempt from the FLSA if they customarily and regularly perform at least one of the duties of an exempt executive, administrative or professional employee identified in the standard tests for exemption.\nBlue Collar Workers\nThe salary exemptions as outlined above, apply only to “white collar” employees who meet the salary and duties tests. The exemptions do not apply to manual laborers or other “blue collar” workers who perform work involving repetitive operations with their hands, physical skill and energy. Non-management employees in production, maintenance, landscaping, construction and similar occupations such as carpenters, electricians, mechanics, plumbers, iron workers, craftsmen, operating engineers, longshoremen, construction workers and laborers are entitled to minimum wage and overtime pay .\nFluctuating Work Week\nAnother method of compensating employees is called the Fluctuating Work Week method. The Fluctuating Work Week involves paying a worker the same base rate each week they work (similar to a salary), but there is still an overtime payment that must be made when the worker works more than 40 hours in a work week. In order to properly compensate an employee using the Fluctuating Work Week method, four criteria must be met:\nThese criteria may seem straightforward, but it is best to speak with an attorney when assessing whether paying employees using the Fluctuating Work Week is compliant for a business’s employees.\nEmployee handbooks are a great way of explaining company policies and procedures. They can provide employees with an overview of the company, the working practices & environment. A good handbook can also provide a business with a layer of legal protection by setting clear standards and expectations which employees must comply with. In short, a good handbook is essential to running a good business.\nOn the other hand, a poorly done employee handbook can cause a lot of harm. Business managers and owners tend to want very rigid policies in place that address almost every fathomable situation. Having policies in place that are too specific can make it hard for employers to be flexible in dealing with real situations. Policies that are too broad can have the opposite effect and make it hard for businesses to hold employees accountable. These seem like two sides to the same coin, and in a way they are.\nWhen drafting your handbook, it is important to include information on the following topics:\nA Contract is an agreement between two or more parties who agree to exchange something. Contracts are the way we document what is agreed upon between the parties. Every contract is different and may require specific assistance during drafting. The goal when drafting a good contract is to use plain language and meaningfully convey the shared understanding the parties have about their agreement.\nThere are many types of contracts. It could be a contract for the purchase of goods, for the purchase of services, or for purchasing real estate. Whatever type of contract is involved, it is important to make sure everything that has been agreed upon is addressed in the contract documents. This may result in a document that is lengthy and potentially confusing, underscoring the need to use plain language.\nFailing to draft a contract well and accurately express the agreement of the parties can result in a dispute. Contract disputes usually arise because one party feels that the other party failed to perform as outlined by their agreement.","The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) requires all employers to maintain accurate records of their employee’s wages, hours worked, and more. As the United States Department of Labor (DOL) ramps up its efforts to pursue contractors in violation of the FLSA, it’s becoming clear that contractors must be proactive in their efforts to maintain compliance.\nIn this editorial, a Chattanooga construction lawyer from Cotney Construction Law will detail some important recordkeeping tips for contractors. As a bonus, we’ll also discuss some tips pertaining to OSHA’s regulation 29 CFR 1904, which involves recordkeeping for employee injuries.\nTip #1: Understand the FLSA Recordkeeping Requirements\nAs a contractor, your workload doesn’t always give you the time you need to deftly handle your own recordkeeping, but you can’t afford to be caught in possession of incomplete financial records. Our Chattanooga construction lawyers can review your books and help you avoid a violation of the FLSA. We can ensure that your records include all the employee information required by the FLSA including:\n- Time tracking (hours per week)\n- Daily and weekly earnings\n- Hourly rate (including overtime)\n- Total overtime pay\n- Total wage deductions\n- Total wages paid every pay period\nTip #2: Develop a Comprehensive Document Retention System\nRegardless of the size of your firm, developing a comprehensive system for document retention is the most effective way to maintain compliance with FLSA recordkeeping requirements. As you take on multiple projects, the size of your workforce will fluctuate and change, so you need to work closely with employees in managerial roles to ensure that you are receiving accurate employment records.\nDocument retention involves the preservation of employee records, including time cards and work time schedules. If a government inspector requests these documents and you fail to produce them or provide access to them, you could be issued additional penalties for wage violations. You should never, under any circumstances, destroy employee records without first speaking to a Memphis contractor lawyer. Willful destruction of recordkeeping data can result in a fine of up to $10,000.\nWhen it comes to document retention, your safest bet is to, as long as space permits, keep records indefinitely to protect yourself from any potential issues with the FLSA down the road. In fact, your recordkeeping efforts should go above and beyond what FLSA requires. Contractors should maintain records in accordance with the following guidelines:\nRetain for a minimum of two years:\n- Daily Sales Summary\n- Accounts and Notes Receivable Trial Balance\n- Prepaid and Accrued Expense Journal\n- All Other Trial Balances\nRetain for a minimum of four years:\n- Employment Applications\n- Petty Cash Vouchers and Summary\n- W-4 Forms\nRetain for a minimum of seven years:\n- Vendor Invoices\n- Purchase Orders\n- Customer Invoices\n- Credit Memos\n- Office Receipts\n- Register Sales Slips\n- Receiving Reports\n- State and Local Sales and Gross Receipts Tax\n- Income Tax Returns\n- Safety Records\n- Inventory Records\n- Employee Personal Records (after termination)\nRetain for a minimum of ten years:\n- Insurance Records and Policies\n- Vendor Invoices\n- Bank Drafts and Paid Notices\n- Bills of Lading\n- Bank Statements and Reconciliations\n- All Correspondence and Customer Files\n- U.S. and State Unemployment Tax Returns\n- Social Security and Withholding Tax Returns\n- Duplicate Deposit Tickets\n- Employee Earning and History Records\n- Subsidiary Ledger\n- Journal Vouchers\n- Notes Receivable Ledger\n- Accounts Receivable or Payable Ledger\n- Financial Statements\n- Property Records\n- Capital Stock Books\n- Cash Received Journal\n- Audit Reports\n- Cash Disbursement Journal\n- Canceled Checks\n- Depreciation Schedules\n- U.S. Revenue Agents Reports & Related Papers\n- Purchase Journal\n- State Franchise Tax Returns\n- Interdepartmental Sales Journal\n- State Annual Reports\n- Payroll Journal\n- Corporate Minutes Book\n- General Journal\n- Government Contracts and Supporting Records\n- General Ledger\n- Construction Contracts and Supporting Records\n- Expense Ledger\n- Employment Contracts\n- Sales and Cost of Sales Ledger\n- Papers Pertaining to Litigation\n- Deeds, Mortgages and Bills of Sale\nTip #3: Don’t Mix Business and Personal Finances\nClearly, the recordkeeping needs of a contractor require an exhaustive effort from more than one person, especially in medium- to large-sized firms. With multiple revenue streams, a revolving door of workers, and numerous clients, the cash flow of a contracting business is fluid and continuous. You don’t want to further confuse matters, so never mix your business and personal finances. This is one of the most effective ways to avoid a compliance issue, and by keeping these finances separate, you actually help simplify your books.\nTip #4: Embrace New Recordkeeping Practices\nLet’s face it, as your company grows, you will need to adopt new procedures for keeping your business running smoothly. This could mean a number of things for your business. It could mean hiring an accountant or dedicated bookkeeper to maintain your records, or it could mean partnering with a Memphis construction attorney to review your records and represent you in cases pertaining to FLSA violations. What matters most is that you are proactive in safeguarding your business against avoidable disputes and litigation. This may require an investment of time and money, but it will only help elevate your bottom line as time goes by.\nTip #5: Don’t Forget About OSHA\nIn addition to the recordkeeping requirements outlined in the FLSA, contractors must also be cognizant of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) recordkeeping requirements outlined in 29 CFR 1904. As previously discussed in our article Record Keeping Mistakes, this regulation “requires employers with more than 10 employees, unless exempt, to record, report, and post illnesses and injuries that occur on job sites.”\nWhile the documentation pertaining to illness and injury records is markedly different than the documents related to your company’s finances, the same level of diligence is required to prevent a violation.\nIt’s imperative that contractors know which forms are utilized for reporting and recording workplace injuries and illnesses. You should be familiar with Forms 300, 300A, and 301. Form 300 is a “Log of Work-Related Injuries and Illnesses.” Form 300A is a “Summary of Work-Related Injuries and Illnesses” that must be posted in the workplace between February 1st and April 30th. Contractors should keep these two forms for a minimum of five years. Form 301 is an “Injury and Illness Incident Report” that is also the first form you should fill out in the incident of a work-related injury or illness.\nAnother important distinction that contractors must consider is the difference between injuries and illnesses that are reportable and recordable. Only report and record work-related incidents that result in death, loss of consciousness, days off, limited work activity, change of position, and medical treatment (excluding first aid).\nYou may also have to record certain conditions that can only be diagnosed by a medical professional. This includes cancer and irreversible diseases, bone injuries, hearing tests and eardrum punctures, contaminated needlestick injuries or cuts, and tuberculosis infections. If you need legal advice about what recordkeeping practices are best suited for your company, consult one of our Memphis contractor lawyers.\nDisclaimer: The information contained in this article is for general educational information only.

{"question":"How did the Gulf states end their boycott of Qatar in 2021, and what's their current role in the Horn of Africa's geopolitics? 🤔","answer":"The Gulf states ended their Qatar boycott through a diplomatic breakthrough in January 2021, when Saudi Arabia, UAE, Egypt, and Bahrain signed a declaration in Al-Ula, Saudi Arabia, marking the end of a 3.5-year embargo. This resolution was mediated by the Trump administration and Kuwait. As for their role in the Horn of Africa, Gulf states are now major players using economic investments, military bases, and strategic political alliances to influence the region. They operate in two competing camps: UAE and Saudi Arabia (supported by Egypt) on one side, versus Qatar and Iran (supported by Turkey) on the other. These states provide unconditional financial aid and investments in exchange for political loyalty and access to resources like minerals, energy, and harbors.","context":["Gulf Leaders Sign Deal to End three-Year Doha Boycott After Saudi Crown Prince, Qatar Emir’s Embrace\nGulf Arab leaders signed an assertion on Tuesday in Saudi Arabia to mark a brand new web page in members of the family following the dominion’s selection to give up a three 1/2-yr embargo of Qatar, easing a rift that deeply divided local U.S. safety allies and frayed social ties throughout the interconnected Arabian Peninsula. The Saudi selection to open its airspace and borders to Qatar became the primary predominant step in the direction of finishing the diplomatic disaster that started in 2017, simply because the Trump management became elevating strain on Iran. The Saudi circulate became introduced Monday night, at the eve of the collection of Gulf Arab leaders in Saudi Arabia’s historical barren region metropolis of Al-Ula.\nIt became doubtful what, if any, full-size concessions Qatar had made earlier than the summit. Still, a direct shift in tone became palpable as certainly considered one among Qatar’s Al Jazeera Arabic information Twitter debts shared pictures of the Riyadh and Abu Dhabi skylines on Tuesday following years of important coverage.\nThe diplomatic step forward observed a very last push with the aid of using the outgoing Trump management and Kuwait to mediate the dispute. It additionally got here as Saudi Arabia seeks to unify Arab ranks beforehand of the incoming management of President-spot for Joe Biden, that’s predicted to take a less attackable stand in the direction of the dominion and re-interact with Iran.\nDania Thafer, government director of Gulf International Forum, stated Saudi Arabia is involved approximately whether or not Biden will draw down America army presence within side the Persian Gulf that had accelerated below President Donald Trump and input lower back into nuclear negotiations with Iran. “If this is the case, then the (Arab) states want to reply with a local option to safety. And I assume resolving the Gulf disaster is one leap forward in the direction of that direction,” she stated.\nSaudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who embraced Qatar’s emir upon his arrival on the summit, stated the area had to unite and face demanding situations posed with the aid of using Iran’s proxies and its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. He stated the assertion signed with the aid of using Gulf leaders and Egypt “emphasizes Arab and Gulf cohesion and stability, and reinforces the continuity of friendship and brotherhood among our international locations.”\nThe 4 international locations that mutually boycotted Qatar — Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain — had been hoping their embargo and media blitz could strain it to give up its near members of the family with Turkey and Iran. Egypt and the UAE view the help with the aid of using Qatar and Turkey of Islamist companies just like the Muslim Brotherhood as a safety threat. Saudi Arabia and Bahrain are generally involved approximately Qatar’s ties with Iran.\nThe boycott did not alternate Doha’s stance, however, as a substitute buoying its younger ruler regionally as patriotic fervor swept via Qatar in help of his remedy. It additionally driven Qatar towards Turkey and Iran, which rushed to help the ultra-rich Gulf nation because it confronted scientific and meals deliver shortages with inside the first days of the embargo.\nWhile the Saudi selection to give up its embargo marks a milestone in the direction of resolving the dispute, the direction in the direction of reconciliation is some distance from guaranteed. The rift among Abu Dhabi and Doha has been deepest, with the UAE and Qatar at sharp ideological odds. The UAE’s Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Anwar Gargash, tweeted past due Monday that his u. s. became eager to repair Gulf team spirit however cautioned: “We have extra paintings to do.”\nThe struggle in Libya stays a contentious issue, with Egypt and the UAE helping army commander Khalifa Hifter, who released a 2019 attack on a Tripoli-primarily based totally bloc subsidized with the aid of using Turkey and Qatar. Thafer stated the troubles that sparked the row have not been eliminated.\n“The center tensions are nevertheless lingering, and that leaves a main query mark on how will they circulate forward,” she stated. The summit and the assertion signed in Al-Ula to help Gulf team spirit “had been confidence-constructing mechanisms extra than they had been a complete reconciliation.” The presence of Qatar’s Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani on the summit marked the primary time he is attended the Gulf Cooperation Council assembly in Saudi Arabia for the reason that boycott started. He despatched an ambassador to the beyond summits there.\nThis yr., Egypt’s overseas minister additionally attended the assembly of the six-state Gulf Cooperation Council, which accommodates Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman and Qatar. The assembly became chaired with the aid of using the Saudi crown prince as opposed to his father, King Salman. Meanwhile, Qatar’s finance minister arrived to Cairo Tuesday for the outlet of a luxurious resort at the Nile, advanced with the aid of using Qatar’s Diar. It is the primary go to Egypt with the aid of using a senior Qatari reputable for the reason that disaster started. Officials at Cairo’s airport stated the Qatari minister flew at once from Doha via Saudi airspace.\nThis yr.’s GCC summit is the primary on account that Washington brokered normalization offers among Israel and the UAE, Bahrain, Sudan and Morocco in speedy succession, marking a main shift in local alliances. Trump adviser and son-in-regulation Jared Kushner, who spearheaded the ones offers, became on the summit for the signing of the Gulf assertion.\nThe dispute had pitted local US allies in opposition to each other at a time whilst the Trump management became operating to strain Iran. It additionally separated households who had intermarried with Qataris and ended years of visa-unfastened tour for Qataris in elements of the Gulf.\nThafer stated the dispute became visible as “low-placing fruit” that the Trump management felt it had the leverage to try and remedy quickly.\nSaudi Arabia’s selection to give up the embargo now no longer simplest underscored the dominion’s declaration of its heavyweight function amongst Arab states, however additionally its local leadership, which has been challenged at instances with the aid of using the UAE’s unilateral and politically clever moves.\nQatar’s simplest land border with Saudi Arabia, which it depended on for the import of dairy products, production substances and different goods, has been often closed on account that June 2017.\nThe boycotting international locations made a listing of needs on Qatar that yr, together with that it shutters its flagship Al-Jazeera information community and terminate Turkish army presence in Qatar, which is likewise domestic to a main U.S. army base. Qatar rejected the needs and has denied help of extremists.","The Gulf States are looking for new allies in the Horn of Africa, in a battle for hegemony in the Middle East. With their deep pockets and big appetites these countries are using economic investments, new military bases, and strategic political alliances to change geopolitics on both sides of the Red Sea.\nThis could mean new risks, which major actors haven’t seen coming. Getting all the countries around the Red Sea seated at one table in a dialogue about the way forward is needed. Nobel Peace Prize winner Abiy Ahmed has a unique opportunity to make it happen.\nWhen Ahmed, Prime Minister of Ethiopia, accepts the Peace Prize December 10 at Oslo City hall, it is unlikely that Eritrea’s President Isaias Afewerki will be there. There is no doubt that Ahmed deserves the prize – he took the initiative and reached out an olive branch to his counterpart in a desire to end the conflict, frozen for the last almost 20 years.\nBut what is less known is the role of the United Arab Emirates, which helped facilitate the process. Saudi Arabia, a friend of the UAE, got the honor of hosting the signing ceremony for Eritrea and Ethiopia’s peace agreement.\nWhy? Both Gulf States are allies of Eritrea, whose strained relations with many stakeholders internationally are well known.\nThe UAE and Saudi Arabia, supported by Egypt, are on one side, while Qatar and Iran, supported by Turkey, are on the other.\nThis illustrates a new trend in the Horn of Africa: the influence of the Gulf States, not only economically, but through political operations, military investments, and infrastructure. They are not traditional aid actors, despite their vast resources. They deal in money transfers and investments without strings attached. In return they expect political loyalty and access to resources like minerals, energy, harbors, arable land and other areas.\nThe starting point for this increasing involvement is primarily the geopolitical competition. The UAE and Saudi Arabia, supported by Egypt, are on one side, while Qatar and Iran, supported by Turkey, are on the other.\nIn addition, both groups see the Horn of Africa as an area with huge potential for economic growth. China sees it too and has gone full speed ahead with the Belt and Road initiative. The Gulf States don’t want to lose out.\nWar of Influence\nCompetition between these two camps in the Middle East mostly plays out in their own region, especially in the conflicts in Yemen, Libya, and Syria. The Muslim Brotherhood was one of the major players in the Arab Spring, supported by Qatar and its allies.\nPushback came from their competitors, the UAE and Saudi Arabia. Several countries tightened their grip, with more authoritarian regimes coming to power. Spring turned instead to winter, bringing war and conflict.\nNow this power struggle has made it to the Horn of Africa, across the Red Sea. The Gulf States have engaged for quite some time and nurtured their allies on the Horn: UAE and Saudi Arabia with Sudan (until president Bashir’s fall) and Eritrea; Qatar and Turkey deep in Somalia: UAE in Somaliland and Puntland, while Djibouti leans toward Saudi Arabia, although it’s open to overtures from Qatar.\nEthiopia has tried to strike a balance between the two sides. Sudan shifted from Iran to Saudi Arabia in 2015/16 when the economic crisis hit. In exchange for economic support one of their deliverables was providing thousands of soldiers to Saudi Arabia’s war in Yemen, many of them only teenagers. That is also why the country, together with the UAE, supported a counterrevolution in Sudan. It didn’t succeed.\nThe Gulf States are not only engaging with petrodollars, military bases, harbors and infrastructure investments to buy loyalty. They are also trying to prevent opponents from gaining a foothold in any corner of the region. In that sense they are being more aggressive than ever, while also trying to position themselves as mediators and negotiators.\nIn addition to the Ethiopia-Eritrea conflict, Saudi Arabia has had success with talks between Djibouti and Eritrea. Rather than going the more traditional route, and using lengthy negotiations to resolve fundamental conflicts, their approach is better described as transaction-based, not too dissimilar from a political market place. That said, the UAE and Saudi Arabia might be the only ones in a position to push Eritrea to follow through on the peace agreement with Ethiopia. TPLF’s position on the border is another important factor.\nThis is an intense power struggle characterized by deep pockets and large appetites.\nThere are also mounting fears in the African Union about the Gulf States’ activities, not only in the Horn, but in other areas of Africa as well. The Qatar-Gulf crisis in 2017 when Saudi-Arabia, the Emirates, Egypt and several other countries severed diplomatic relations with Qatar, divided the Gulf States, and accelerated their power struggle and respective expansion politics.\nThat expansion is now spreading over the whole content. But while most of that expansion is about competition over resources and economic influence, especially as it relates to China, the Horn of Africa is somewhat different. This is an intense power struggle characterized by deep pockets and large appetites. Their maneuvering is often based on short-term goals for strategic positioning. And the consequences can be significant.\nPotential for More Conflict\nPolitical leaders trying to stay in power might find useful allies in the wealthy Gulf States. Many observers are now concerned that the Gulf States’ involvement could lengthen or increase conflicts, rather than reducing them.\nWhy? The two competing camps in the Middle East see this as a zero-sum game. They push countries to choose a side, in some cases supporting opposition players and leading them to power, and at times even when local leadership does not want to participate in the game. That kind of influence is possible because of the power asymmetry between the Gulf States and the countries in the Horn of Africa. Such conditions do not spell political stability.\nWhen compared to the Gulf States and Turkey, Western countries have not put up these types or volumes of aid or investments. OECD countries’ private sector are, for example, often hesitant to take that kind of risk with their investments. For individual Western donors it is not possible to give such large amounts of unconditional aid. The assistance comes with certain requirements – for good reason; they are held responsible by tax payers and national governments.\nThat makes Western aid and other traditional development contributions less attractive. Assistance from the Gulf is altogether different and doesn’t even have to be reported.\nAsleep at the Wheel\nThe Horn of Africa and the Red Sea are in constant flux; the situation is highly dynamic. We saw this unfolding in Sudan, where local military allies of the UAE and Saudi Arabia were trying to keep their power and control and were given the green light to crush the protests. They didn’t succeed. The involvement of the Gulf was counterproductive and a new transitional government in Khartoum was formed. They may, however, still engage to retain the status quo, as they have done elsewhere. The question is whether they will continue to engage in retaining old allies, or whether Sudan could serve as a lesson, taking a different approach.\nWhatever the case may be, the international community, and especially the Western countries, have been asleep at the wheel. This is the new reality. If a strategy isn’t developed soon, the new foreign policies of the Gulf States could yield serious consequences. Although competition and rivalry might meet short-term political and commercial goals, they can also affect the long-term stability of a highly vulnerable regions. It could even hit the Gulf States themselves, just on the other side of the strait.\nThe UN has just appointed a Special Envoy to deal with the Horn of Africa, Parfait Onanga, expected also deal with some of the Red Sea-issues, while the UK has appointed a Special Envoy for the Red Sea and the Horn of Africa, Julian Reilly. That’s a start. The Americans, however, have had a hands-off policy in relation to these issues for too long. This has geopolitical implications. Someone, and in this case the Gulf, will fill the void soon unless Western and African actors become more pro-active.\nA first step would be to form regional forums where Gulf States and countries in the Horn of Africa can discuss common solutions to several of the challenges they face in the region. Multilateral action is often the best solution to avoid countries only looking out for their own interests.\nNobel Peace Prize laureate Abiy Ahmed has more than enough challenges at home. Still, taking the initiative to discuss the formation of a regional forum for countries on both sides of the Red Sea would be an excellent first step following on the Peace Prize.\nThis piece originally appeared in Norwegian in Bistandsaktuelt.

{"question":"How does the Spanish immersion program at Castle Heights ensure student progress, and what challenges does it face in coordinating language instruction across different levels?","answer":"The Castle Heights Spanish immersion program ensures student progress through a structured 90/10 model, starting with 90% Spanish instruction in kindergarten and gradually increasing English instruction until reaching 50/50 by 5th grade. Students stay with the same cohort throughout K-5, receiving instruction from BCLAD-certified teachers while following the same curriculum standards as English-only programs. However, like other language programs nationwide, it faces coordination challenges across instruction levels. Research shows that non-articulated programs lead to high attrition rates, with approximately half the students dropping out each successive year. The lack of coordination between elementary and secondary levels can result in ineffective teaching and student frustration, particularly affecting minority students who change schools frequently.","context":["spanish world language immersion program\nAt Castle Heights Elementary School, we are committed to the principle that all students can become bilingual and biliterate during the elementary school years, while participating in a balanced educational program that promotes academic, social, physical and psychological growth. The vision for the World Language Program at Castle Heights is to help students develop to their fullest potential as they become bilingual and biliterate to meet the demands of the global workforce. Students receive rigorous academic instruction in both English and Spanish to reach academic proficiency, while gaining an appreciation for the diverse cultures of the Spanish-speaking world in a nurturing and supportive learning environment.\nWHAT IS A WORLD LANGUAGE IMMERSION PROGRAM?\nA World Language Immersion Program is an educational program that falls under the Dual Language Education umbrella offered by LAUSD. In Dual Language Education, students receive instruction in all content areas in both English and a second language (referred to as the target language) beginning in kindergarten. At the elementary level, students spend a minimum of 50% of each instructional day in the target language.\nIn contrast to “One-Way Immersion” programs (designed for English-learners) and “Two-Way Immersion” programs (designed for classrooms evenly split between English-learners and English-speakers), “World Language Immersion” programs are designed for classrooms comprised predominantly of native English speakers who are learning a new language.\nThe goals for all students in World Language Immersion programs are: bilingualism and biliteracy, grade-level academic achievement in English and in the target language, and positive cross-cultural competencies.\nWHEN WAS THE CASTLE HEIGHTS WLI PROGRAM ESTABLISHED AND HOW DOES IT WORK?\nCastle Heights introduced a Spanish World Language Immersion Program in Fall 2018 with one kindergarten class and one 1st grade class. The program expanded to Grade 2 in August 2019. The program will continue to grow every year until each grade level (K-5) has one Spanish dual language classroom.\nThe dual language strand at CHES serves only one classroom of students per grade level. Thus, as the dual language strand moves from one grade to another, the same group of children will remain together from grades K-5.\nStudents in the WLI Program benefit from the many community and enrichment opportunities available at Castle Heights.\nWHAT IS THE ACADEMIC MODEL?\nThe program starts in Kindergarten as a 90/10 model: 90% of the instructional minutes are in Spanish and 10% are in English. Every year the instructional minutes in Spanish will decrease and instructional time in English will increase. By 5th grade, 50% of instruction will be in Spanish, and 50% will be in English.\nWith input from parents, teachers, and district specialists, the Castle Heights school community chose to adopt the 90:10 instructional model for our nascent program, feeling it would be most beneficial for our predominantly English-speaking student population. Research shows that foreign language acquisition is most effective through full immersion; a 90/10 model sets a strong foundation for developing bilingualism and biliteracy.\nWHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES IN DUAL LANGUAGE PROGRAMS?\nThere are many published studies of dual language programs that have been implemented in elementary schools across the United States over the past several decades. The research overwhelmingly indicates that such programs are beneficial to students of all kinds. Extensive data has been collected and longitudinal studies of learning outcomes among students who have completed such programs have been conducted. These studies were recently validated through an analysis of millions of student records in 16 states in this article, published by Thomas and Collier in 2017.\nWhile dual language immersion programs have been studied most extensively among English-learners, a number of studies have also demonstrated the advantages foreign language immersion for native speakers of English as well.\nDOES IT MATTER IF NOBODY AT HOME SPEAKS SPANISH?\nNo. The program is comprised of students with all levels of language exposure.\nIS THIS PROGRAM RIGHT FOR MY CHILD AND MY FAMILY?\nThere are a few things to consider when enrolling your child in any dual language education program:\nIn order to see the benefits of the program, the child and family need to commit to continuing in the program from K-5th grade. This is important both for the child and for the program to continue to thrive.\nHomework will be assigned in Spanish and English; this may require a bit more effort for the family to support their child in completing those activities. There are resources to help support parents in this. Parents DO NOT need any background in Spanish in order for the child to be successful in the program.\nYour child will matriculate with the same cohort of ~24 students from K-5th\nHOW DO I ENROLL MY CHILD?\nPlease visit http://echoices.lausd.net/.\nIf you miss the application window, there is a late application period and students will be placed in the program in the order that the applications are received, and based on space availability. Please consider that each year there will be only 25 students accepted into the Kindergarten class. Students in higher grade levels may be accepted to fill slots that open up when enrolled children move from the program.\nPriority is given to students who have siblings at CHES and live within the attendance boundaries for CHES.\nThen students who live within the school attendance boundaries.\nThen, students applying for permits are considered for the program in order\nto fill the class.\nIn some cases, a new student who has grade-level proficiency in the target\nlanguage, Spanish, may be enrolled into the WLIP program beyond grade 1, depending on space availability.\nWHAT ARE THE ATTENDANCE BOUNDARIES FOR CASTLE HEIGHTS ELEMENTARY?\nVisit the LAUSD Resident School Identifier. Please enter your residential address to verify Castle Heights Elementary as your designated resident school.\nDO WLI STUDENTS ACCESS THE SAME CURRICULAR EXPERIENCES AND ENRICHMENT OPPORTUNITIES AS THE REST OF THE STUDENT BODY (MUSIC, ART, THEATRE, SCIENCE, COMPUTER LAB, SAS, IEP, ETC.?)\nYes. The standards and curriculum for the WLI Program are the same as those for Castle Heights and all LAUSD English-only programs. The difference is the language of instruction. Additionally, most of the enrichment activities at Castle Heights are offered to WLI students.\nThe advanced studies program is accommodated within dual language classrooms with differentiated learning opportunities. IEPs are accommodated and children of all abilities are welcome in the World Language Immersion Program.\nHOW IS THE WORLD LANGUAGE IMMERSION PROGRAM INCORPORATED INTO THE SCHOOL AS A WHOLE?\nThe Program has dedicated Spanish-speaking, BCLAD-certified teachers at each grade level where the program has been implemented and students move between classes with the same cohort of classmates each year. However, WLI students will interact with the rest of the student body for recess, lunch, and school-wide activities. Teachers also collaborate within and across grade levels.\nThe World Language Program hosts school-wide events including celebrations of Día de los Muertos and Día de los Niños.\nHOW CAN WORLD LANGUAGE PARENTS SUPPORT THEIR CHILDREN'S EDUCATION AND THE CASTLE HEIGHTS COMMUNITY AT LARGE?\nAt Castle Heights, we are proud of our remarkable levels of family engagement and volunteerism. We strongly encourage parents to give of their time and talents to enrich the educational, social, and cultural opportunities offered to all students at our school.\nAs a fledgling program, the World Language Program depends on even greater levels of family support. Thanks to the participation and contributions of every World Language family, our inaugural year was a great success and we were lauded as a robust, model program within LAUSD! Parents, teachers, and administrators are all active partners as we continue to build and grow an exemplary World Language Immersion Program at Castle Heights.\nWe invite you to invest in our program by volunteering your time and offering material support whenever possible. Here are some ways you can get involved:\nVolunteer to help organize or chair a school-wide or WLP-specific event.\nHelp us with ideas or resources you may have for fundraising.\nServe on the World Language Committee, Friends of Castle Heights, the Governance Council, the PTA, or ELAC!\nWHERE CAN I FIND MORE INFORMATION?\nExtensive information about dual language education in general is available at this website.\nThis LAUSD echoices webpage provides an overview of the different immersion models offered by LAUSD, including the difference between dual two-way immersion programs vs. world language programs.\nThis “Multilingual FAQ” on the California Department of Education website is also a good source for general information.\nInformation about LAUSD Biliteracy Awards and the district’s “Seal of Biliteracy” for eligible students in dual language education programs is available here.\nHere are a couple other useful links:","What is Articulation?\nAmong second language educators, articulation is\n\"the interrelationship and continuity of contents, curriculum, instruction, and evaluation within programs which focus on the progress of the student in learning both to comprehend and communicate in a second language\" (Lange, 1988).\nThis definition focuses on content, curriculum, instruction, and evaluation of students' ability both to comprehend and communicate in a second language.\nSince passage of the National Defense Education Act in 1957, one of the major challenges facing second language teachers in our nation's schools has been the lack of coordination of second language learning at all levels of instruction. Another persistent challenge faced by our teachers has been to ensure that students enrolled in different courses on the same level (level being defined as a year in school) are exposed to similar teaching methods, text materials, and testing procedures that are linked to similar outcomes. The articulation of second language programs from level to level and across offerings at the same level is a crucial element of language programming that assures replicable and predictable student outcomes (see Byrnes, 1990; Lafayetee, 1980, and Lange, 1988).\nSecond language instruction can be horizontally articulated; that is, similar instruction can be delivered across courses on the same level. It can also be vertically articulated between elementary and secondary schools, between secondary schools and postsecondary schools, and between elementary immersion programs and secondary non-immersion programs. Discussions and debates among education professionals relating to the articulation of second language instruction have not, historically, adequately focused on students' performance outcomes for comprehension and communication, and the means by which articulation of instruction is usually managed have already focused on students' actual demonstrated proficiency in using the target language in real-world contexts.\nCurrent literature on articulation suggests several approaches to articulation which focus more on method, materials, seat-time, and testing of language features than on the performance of the student. In the first of these approaches, an all-consuming search for a superior method of teaching and learning languages (e.g., audio-lingual, cognitive code, communicative approaches) has driven attempts to assure articulation. Several attempts to find such a method have proven inconclusive, suggesting that the \"search for the Holy Grail is fruitless\" (Higgs, 1983).\nThe second approach to articulating second language instruction has focused on the selection or development of text materials. According to this approach, students working with articulated materials will work with the same language, read the same texts, know the same vocabulary, learn the same grammar, and demonstrate the same level of proficiency. This second approach is flawed, however, in light of human variability in learning, which dictates that students do not communicate and comprehend in the same ways. Students read and interpret texts variably, process grammar differently and learn at different paces. The search for the \"right\" text or materials which will effectively control language learning -- where all learners process the same language simultaneously -- clearly has proven illusory.\nSeat-time is the third approach by which articulation of second language instruction is achieved. Seat-time is an old style of measurement that has traditionally been used in elementary, secondary, and post-secondary institutions. According to this tradition, it is assumed that there exists a basic and definable relationship between time spent on task, prior instruction, and current knowledge or ability. Knowledge and ability are perceived as stable commodities over time, and learning is seen as a linear, cumulative process. Evidence of this approach can be seen most clearly in the establishment of prerequisites for courses and in equivalency formulas (e.g., one year of secondary school French equals one quarter of college work) which determine the transfer of credits or the fulfillment of degree requirements. This concept is also problematic because all students do not learn at the same pace, and students' knowledge and ability vary over time, thus making attempts at articulation by using seat-time both artificial and contrived.\nFinally, traditional tests featuring multiple-choice, true-false, fill-in-the-blank, CLOZE, and short-completion exercises drive the curriculum to focus on linear features of the language. Such tests ignore the processing, comprehension, and communication of information in the target language -- skills which second language educators have usually sought to develop in their students. As a result, traditional tests do not correspond in a meaningful way to the goals of language competence. Their use as a tool in articulating second language instruction is therefore wholly inappropriate.\nThe above argument has been strongly supported by attempts which have been undertaken to examine articulation from an empirical or data-driven perspective. Spencer and Flaugher (1967) have shown that discrete-point testing is only marginally effective in accurately placing students in college-level second language programs. Examining the scores of 3,500 students who took proficiency tests, Lange, Prior, and Sims (1992) found that prior experience using equivalency formulas accounted for only 7.2% of the pass tests, thus calling into serious question the concept of seat-time.\nSecond language programs which are not vertically articulated lead not only to ineffective teaching and unnecessary frustrations for students at all levels, but also to high attrition rates among students who might otherwise continue to study a second language at more advanced levels. Research has demonstrated that the number of students continuing to pursue second language study beyond the first year of instruction is reduced by approximately half for each successive year of the language. This national phenomenon -- which is even more pronounced in the critical languages -- results in a significant waste of resources, as our nation's elementary and secondary schools tend to produce students who have only an introduction to a second language and little or no demonstrable proficiency in that language.\nThe considerable dearth of students at the elementary and secondary levels who persevere to pursue advanced study of second language is especially acute among our nation's minority youth. Concentrated in urban settings characterized by high mobility, these students on average change schools and programs more often than their majority counterparts. In so doing, they lose critical momentum in their study of second languages and they are often placed into programs in which they find themselves underprepared. This lack of horizontal articulation in language instruction therefore discourages these at-risk students and they consequently often do not continue studying foreign languages -- an incalculable loss to a nation which needs to use all of its intellectual resources in an increasingly competitive international environment.\nThe various articulation projects that have been conducted through the Center for Advanced Research on Language Acquisition have addressed the many issues raised by the challenges of articulating curriculum. The ultimate goal of these projects is to provide students with the opportunity for continuous language study that is coordinated between levels and across institutions to encourage student persistence in language learning.\nBack to Articulation."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:f5e58157-17c2-40a0-83bc-ca164514c3d9>","<urn:uuid:91cfcb2d-f75d-43db-84e9-206b3f1b42a8>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do the effects of heat stress differ between exercise in cold environments and hot workplaces in terms of body temperature regulation?","answer":"In cold environments (10°C), as shown in exercise studies, the body's temperature regulation is primarily affected by depletion of glycogen stores rather than heat stress. In contrast, in hot environments, the body struggles to maintain its internal temperature of 37°C through mechanisms like increased blood pumping to the skin and sweating. When environmental temperature rises above 30°C, the rate of heat gain exceeds heat loss, causing the body temperature to rise and potentially leading to various heat illnesses. The body's ability to cool through sweat evaporation becomes limited in hot and humid conditions because the air cannot accept more moisture, while in hot and dry conditions, it's limited by the amount of sweat the body can produce.","context":["|Appears in Collections:||Faculty of Health Sciences and Sport Journal Articles|\n|Peer Review Status:||Refereed|\n|Title:||The effects of substrate and fluid provision on thermoregulatory, cardiorespiratory and metabolic responses to prolonged exercise in a cold environment in man|\n|Author(s):||Galloway, S D|\nMaughan, Ronald J\nelectrolyte blood level\nglucose blood level\nlung gas exchange\n|Citation:||Galloway SD & Maughan RJ (1998) The effects of substrate and fluid provision on thermoregulatory, cardiorespiratory and metabolic responses to prolonged exercise in a cold environment in man.

This has lead many authors to hypothesize that the carbohydrate (CHO) content of fluids ingested in cool environments should be high, yet this hypothesis has not been specifically examined. In the present study, six healthy males cycled to exhaustion at approximately 80% of their maximum oxygen consumption (V2O,max) with either no drink (ND), a 15% CHO-electrolyte drink (15% CHO) or a 2% CHO electrolyte drink (2% CHO). Dietary intake and exercise were replicated 2 days prior to each trial. Mean (S.D.) ambient temperature was 10.0 (0.3) degrees C with a relative humidity of 72 (2) % and an air velocity of approximately 0.7 m s(-1) on all trials. Weighted mean skin temperature was calculated, and rectal temperature and heart rate were recorded at rest, during exercise and at exhaustion. Venous samples were drawn before and during exercise and at exhaustion for determination of haemoglobin, haematocrit, blood metabolites and serum electrolytes and osmolality. Expired air was collected for calculation of VO2 and respiratory exchange ratio which were used to estimate rates of fuel oxidation. Ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) were also obtained. Exercise capacity was not different (P=0.49) between trials, with median (range) times to exhaustion of 90.6 (66.8-106.0), 97.7 (60.9-112.0) and 102.0 (77.1-170.7) min for the ND, 15% CHO and 2% CHO trials, respectively. The 15% CHO drink significantly (P < 0.05) elevated blood glucose concentration and total CHO oxidation compared with the ND trial. The 2% CHO drink significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the estimated change in plasma volume and resulted in a lower serum osmolality than the other two trials. No differences were observed in any thermoregulatory or cardiorespiratory responses between trials. These data suggest that maintenance of blood-borne substrate and/or plasma volume does not influence exercise capacity in the cold, as is commonly reported during this type and intensity of exercise in warmer environments.|\n|Rights:||The publisher does not allow this work to be made publicly available in this Repository.

Cincinnati, Ohio: American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists, 2016. p.214.] Other heat-related terms are defined at the end of this document in the Glossary of Terms.\nHeat may come from many sources. For example:\n- In foundries, steel mills, bakeries, smelters, glass factories, and furnaces, extremely hot or molten material is the main source of heat.\n- In outdoor occupations, such as construction, road repair, open-pit mining and agriculture, summer sunshine is the main source of heat.\n- In laundries, restaurant kitchens, and canneries, high humidity adds to the heat burden.\nIn all instances, the cause of heat stress is a working environment which can potentially overwhelm the body's ability to deal with heat.\nMost people feel comfortable when the air temperature is between 20°C and 27°C and when the relative humidity ranges from 35 to 60%. When air temperature or humidity is higher, people feel uncomfortable. Such situations do not cause harm as long as the body can adjust and cope with the additional heat. Very hot environments can overwhelm the body's coping mechanisms leading to a variety of serious and possibly fatal conditions.\nThis OSH Answers document contains information about the health effects of hot environments. Please see Hot Environments - Control Measures for information about the prevention and control for heat exposure.\nHow does the human body react to hot environments?\nThe healthy human body maintains its internal temperature around 37°C. Variations, usually of less than 1°C, occur with the time of the day, level of physical activity or emotional state. A change of body temperature of more than 1°C occurs only during illness or when environmental conditions are more than the body's ability to cope with extreme heat.\nAs the environment warms-up, the body tends to warm-up as well. The body's internal \"thermostat\" maintains a constant inner body temperature by pumping more blood to the skin and by increasing sweat production. In this way, the body increases the rate of heat loss to balance the heat burden. In a very hot environment, the rate of \"heat gain\" is more than the rate of \"heat loss\" and the body temperature begins to rise. A rise in the body temperature results in heat illnesses.\nHow does the body control heat gain and heat loss?\nThe main source of heat in normal conditions is the body's own internal heat. Called metabolic heat, it is generated within the body by the biochemical processes that keep us alive and by the energy we use in physical activity. The body exchanges heat with its surroundings mainly through radiation, convection, and evaporation of sweat.\nRadiation is the process by which the body gains heat from surrounding hot objects, such as hot metal, furnaces or steam pipes, and loses heat to cold objects, such as chilled metallic surfaces, without contact with them. No radiant heat gain or loss occurs when the temperature of surrounding objects is the same as the skin temperature (about 35°C).\nConvection is the process by which the body exchanges heat with the surrounding air. The body gains heat from hot air and loses heat to cold air which comes in contact with the skin. Convective heat exchange increases with increasing air speed and increased differences between air and skin temperature.\nEvaporation of sweat from the skin cools the body. Evaporation occurs more quickly and the cooling effect is more noticeable with high wind speeds and low relative humidity. In hot and humid workplaces, the cooling of the body due to sweat evaporation is limited because the air cannot accept more moisture. In hot and dry workplaces, the cooling due to sweat evaporation is limited by the amount of sweat produced by the body.\nThe body also exchanges small amounts of heat by conduction and breathing. By conduction, the body gains or loses heat when it comes into direct contact with hot or cold objects. Breathing exchanges heat because the respiratory system warms the inhaled air. When exhaled, this warmed air carries away some of the body's heat. However, the amount of heat exchanged through conduction and breathing is normally small enough to be ignored in assessing the heat load on the body.\nWhat are the effects of heat on the body?\nWhen the air temperature or humidity rises above the range for comfort, problems can arise. The first effects relate to how you feel. Exposure to more heat can cause health problems and may affect performance.\nAs the temperature or heat burden increases, people may feel:\n- Increased irritability.\n- Loss of concentration and ability to do mental tasks.\n- Loss of ability to do skilled tasks or heavy work.\nIn moderately hot environments, the body \"goes to work\" to get rid of excess heat so it can maintain its normal body temperature. The heart rate increases to pump more blood through outer body parts and skin so that excess heat is lost to the environment, and sweating occurs. These changes place additional demands on the body. Changes in blood flow and excessive sweating reduce a person's ability to do physical and mental work. Manual work creates additional metabolic heat and adds to the body heat burden. When the environmental temperature rises above 30°C, it may interfere with the performance of mental tasks.\nDoes everyone react to heat the same way?\nThe risk of heat-related illness varies from person to person. A person's general health influences how well the person adapts to heat (and cold).\nThose with extra weight often have trouble in hot situations as the body has difficulty maintaining a good heat balance. Age (particularly for people about 45 years and older), poor general health, and a low level of fitness will make people more susceptible to feeling the extremes of heat.\nMedical conditions can also increase how susceptible the body is. People with heart disease, high blood pressure, respiratory disease and uncontrolled diabetes may need to take special precautions. In addition, people with skin diseases and rashes may be more susceptible to heat. Other factors include circulatory system capacity, sweat production and the ability to regulate electrolyte balance.\nSubstances -- both prescription or otherwise -- can also have an impact on how people react to heat.\nThe National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) reports that several studies comparing the heat tolerances of men and women have concluded that women are less heat tolerant than men. While this difference seems to diminish when such comparisons take into account cardiovascular fitness, body size, and acclimatization, women tend to have a lower sweat rate than men of equal fitness, size and acclimatization. This lower sweat rate means that there can be an increase in body temperature.\nWhat are the illnesses caused by heat exposure?\nHeat exposure causes the following illnesses:\nHeat edema is swelling which generally occurs among people who are not acclimatized to working in hot conditions. Swelling is often most noticeable in the ankles. Recovery occurs after a day or two in a cool environment.\nHeat rashes are tiny red spots on the skin which cause a prickling sensation during heat exposure. The spots are the result of inflammation caused when the ducts of sweat glands become plugged.\nHeat cramps are sharp pains in the muscles that may occur alone or be combined with one of the other heat stress disorders. The cause is salt imbalance resulting from the failure to replace salt lost with sweat. Cramps most often occur when people drink large amounts of water without sufficient salt (electrolyte) replacement.\nHeat exhaustion is caused by loss of body water and salt through excessive sweating. Signs and symptoms of heat exhaustion include: heavy sweating, weakness, dizziness, visual disturbances, intense thirst, nausea, headache, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle cramps, breathlessness, palpitations, tingling and numbness of the hands and feet. Recovery occurs after resting in a cool area and consuming cool drinks (e.g., water, clear juice, or a sports drink).\nHeat syncope is heat-induced dizziness and fainting induced by temporarily insufficient flow of blood to the brain while a person is standing. It occurs mostly among unacclimatized people. It is caused by the loss of body fluids through sweating, and by lowered blood pressure due to pooling of blood in the legs. Recovery is rapid after rest in a cool area.\nHeat stroke is the most serious type of heat illness. Signs of heat stroke include body temperature often greater than 41°C, and complete or partial loss of consciousness. Sweating is not a good sign of heat stress as there are two types of heat stroke - \"classical\" where there is little or no sweating (usually occurs in children, persons who are chronically ill, and the elderly), and \"exertional\" where body temperature rises because of strenuous exercise or work and sweating is usually present.\nHeat stroke requires immediate first aid and medical attention. Delayed treatment may result in death.\nWhat are symptoms and first aid steps for heat exhaustion?\nSymptoms of heat exhaustion may start suddenly, and include:\n- Nausea or irritability.\n- Muscle cramps or weakness.\n- Feeling faint.\n- Heavy sweating.\n- High body temperature.\nFirst aid for heat exhaustion includes:\n- Get medical aid. Stay with the person until help arrives.\n- Move to a cooler, shaded location.\n- Remove as many clothes as possible (including socks and shoes).\n- Apply cool, wet cloths or ice to head, face or neck. Spray with cool water.\n- Encourage the person to drink water, clear juice, or a sports drink.\nWhat are the symptoms and first aid steps for heat stroke?\nHeat exhaustion may quickly develop into heat stroke. Symptoms of heat stroke include:\n- Hot, dry skin or profuse sweating.\n- Loss of consciousness.\n- Very high body temperature.\nFirst aid for heat stroke includes:\n- Call 911 immediately. Heat stroke is a medical emergency.\n- Stay with the person until help arrives.\n- Move to a cooler, shaded location.\n- Remove as many clothes as possible (including socks and shoes).\n- Wet the person's skin and clothing with cool water.\n- Apply cold, wet cloths or ice to head, face, neck, armpits, and groin.\n- Do not try to force the person to drink liquids.\nWhat are the illnesses caused by long-term (chronic) heat exposure?\nNIOSH reports that certain heart, kidney, and liver damage are thought by some researchers to be linked to long-term heat exposure. However, the evidence supporting these associations is not conclusive.\nChronic heat exhaustion, sleep disturbances and susceptibility to minor injuries and sicknesses have all been attributed to the possible effects of prolonged exposure to heat.\nHeat exposure has been associated with temporary infertility in both women and men, with the effects being more pronounced in men. Sperm density, motility, and the percentage of normally shaped sperm can decrease significantly when the temperature of the groin is increased above a normal temperature. Workers exposed to high heat loads should inform their family doctors of their exposure.\nLaboratory study of animals has shown that exposure of the pregnant females to high temperatures may result in a high incidence of embryo deaths and malformations of the head and the central nervous system (CNS). There is no conclusive evidence of teratogenic effects of high temperatures in humans. The NIOSH criteria document (Draft: 2013) recommends that a pregnant worker's body temperature should not exceed 39-39.5°C during the first trimester of pregnancy.\n(Reference: Criteria for a Recommended Standard: Occupational exposure to heat and hot environments. Revised Criteria 2013. Cincinnati, Ohio: National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Draft, 2013)\nWhat are some of the terms used in this document (Glossary of Terms)?\nAcclimatization - Physiological changes which occur in response to several days of heat exposure and make the body accustomed to a hot environment.\nConvection - Process of heat exchange between the body and the surrounding air or fluid as a result of bulk flow of that air or fluid.\nDehydration - Loss or deficiency of water in body tissues caused by sweating, vomiting or diarrhea.

{"question":"How do GDPR compliance requirements affect data portability rights at Indras Web versus typical data harvesting practices?","answer":"Under GDPR compliance, Indras Web provides users with specific data portability rights - users can generate and download a customizable export of their data in JSON format through the Account Settings section, choosing which specific data elements to export. This contrasts with typical data harvesting practices, which involve broad collection methods where computer programs extract data from various digital sources like social media and behavioral data, often without giving users control over their information. Indras Web's approach aligns with GDPR's aim to give EU individuals control over their personal data, while general harvesting practices typically focus on collecting maximum data with minimal user oversight.","context":["User Data and Privacy –\nEven though we try our best not to collect personal data on our users, some information is collected in order for you to be able to login to our website and post content. Some users and some of our critics have raised valid concerns as to what data we are collecting and what we are doing with that. To improve in transparency we wanted to discuss some of those questions here.\nQ: What type of data is collected by the Indras Web system?\nA: Indras Web stores user’s data on our site. Our site is encrypted by SSL. SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is the standard security technology for establishing an encrypted link between a web server and a browser. This link ensures that all data passed between the web server and browsers remain private and integral. SSL is an industry-standard and is used by millions of websites in the protection of their online transactions with their customers. In addition, Indras Web Scripts also stores the info of the session. It includes the login history with info on the browser, device, IP address, action, and timestamp. This applies on top of all data that a user-entered manually to Indras Web by its users into the site.\nQ: How do you collect my data and where is it stored?\nA: The data that you provide us is located in a database with the company that we host with. Only one individual has access to that data. That information stays on the server and is only accessed for technical issues that may occur if an error in the database occurs. There is also a backup of that data which is collected every 24 hours. Your data stays on that server until you decide that it should be removed. Our app and our website is GDRP compliant and allows our users to delete in full all data on their profile at any time. The collection of this form of data is typical for any website such as a forum or any other site that has personal posts, blogs, etc. Without the collection of this data, we would be unable to allow you to comment or post.\nQ: Do you use my data to advertise to me or sell my information?\nA: Indras Web does not advertise to its users through the network or outside of the network based on data collected in the network. The main site at IndrasWeb.org does collect user data to remarket to those users to join Indras Web. We do not use that data to sell you additional products or services outside of Indras Web. We do not display ads from outside services or products to you while in Indras Web or on the mobile app. We do not allow for marketing outside of the Merchant area in Indras Web. We do not sell your personal information or give your information away. We also do not have any possible way to build a profile around each user to determine their interests desires or needs to market to the individual.\nQ: Does Google or Facebook collect my data from your site?\nA: We specifically restrict Facebook from collecting data from our users in the Indras Web Network area. We do however promote our website to Facebook users which collects data due to how Facebook’s advertisement system works. This means that on www.indrasweb.org Facebook’s pixel system is implemented, but once you use our network at www.indrasweb.org/social your data is not collected. Google systems are used by our website due to fonts, and data that is sent to each user through their browser. Unfortunately, there is no way to get around this based on how our system operates and how typical websites operate.\nWe do not collect analytical data on our users once they login to our system. We also use Google Firebase systems to transmit information to our users through the mobile app and for our messaging system. If you are using Google Play to use our app your data is submitted through google systems as well as Apple if you use iTunes. For having an app on their networks there is no possible way to get around this.\nQ: What is GDPR?\nA: GDPR stands for General Data Protection Regulation is EU’s new privacy law which came to effect recently on 25th May 2018 to replace the 1995 Data Protection Directive (Directive 95/46/EC).\nIt aims to give control back to any individual in the EU over their personal data and to simplify the regulatory environment for international businesses.\nQ: What are my rights to access my data?\nA: Indras Web allows users to access, view, and edit their personal information upon login. You can access this section for viewing and updating by selecting on profile > Account Settings.\nThis personal information that a site collects varies from site to site. They can define custom fields to collect additional data. However, as a default requirement, Indras Web saves user information such as the Full name, Email, Password, Language, Timezone, and Currency.\nQ: Do I have the right to erasure/right to be forgotten?\nA: In Indras Web, any user can choose to cancel their account. It can be easily accessed by selecting Cancel Account in the Account Settings section.\nA user can use the option to delete all their data by canceling an account. It includes personal information in the user’s profile, posts, comments, photos, music, video, tags… The user might need to fill out the form to provide some information before processing on to account deletion.\nQ: Do I have the right to data portability?\nA: Yes, you have the right to export and receive all of their personal data in a machine-readable format.\nTherefore, a user can now generate a customizable export of data with this new build 3 functionality. You can access this feature by selecting Download a Copy of your Data in the Account Settings section.\nUsers can choose which data they wish to export from the next page\nA zip file will be downloaded which includes all data entities you select to export before in JSON format.\nOur overall goal is to provide our users with the safe experience they can have while using our systems. With any use of electronic systems or data, there is a level of risk that each user takes when they log on to a system and post their private data. That data in one form or another is collected. Indras Web is as safe to use as any other internet forum that millions of people use daily to share and exchange information. This means each user should protect themselves by not providing information that they desire others to know about them. We do not require our users to provide us anything besides their email, username, and IP address when registering so that we can log who that user is. You can use a VPN, fake email address, fake name when registering and we would have no way of proving that you are in fact who you say you are. That is not our goal. Our goal is to make it so you have a safe place to discuss things that you are passionate about.\nIf you don’t feel that we have fully answered your questions or you would like to know more you can email us directly by clicking on our contact us page and ask specifically what type of data you are wanted to know about or system and we will respond. We also will be updating our users shortly as well as this article with our technical data for the mobile application.","Image credit: Markus Spiske\nAd-targeting: This is when, say, Facebook uses a combination of human discretion and automated processes to create an ad category corresponding to a particular subject (a process Facebook declines to describe). From there:\nFacebook users then effectively sort themselves into the targeting category by liking and visiting certain pages on the social network and through other activities they engage in on the service. Facebook has said that liking a page is one signal among many that helps it place users into the categories that advertisers can target.\nAnonymising data: The process of making your location history anonymous by removing your name from the data record. Of course, “that is totally inadequate because you’re probably the only person who lives in your house and who works in your office, and it’s easy for any researcher or data scientist to look at a location trace and figure out who it belonged to”.\nAutomotive telematics: Allegedly benign beacon systems of tracking and monitoring vehicles that have been found to have astonishingly intrusive surveillance and commercial capabilities, i.e. data about where you are, where you’re going, how you’re feeling, what you’re saying, the details of your driving, and the conditions of your vehicle.\nBeacons: These little devices are placed at various points around a store to track you. If you have an app on your phone that accepts that particular beacon, the beacon will send out a signal. Your phone will accept the beacon and send a message to a company to tell it who you are, exactly where you are within the range of the beacon, and perhaps send you a discount coupon based upon how valuable the company has determined you are.\nBehavioural biometrics: Data relating to uniquely identifiable and measurable patterns in human behaviours, which can be used for security verification or tracking methods such as keystroke dynamics, gait analysis, voice ID, mouse use characteristics, signature analysis and cognitive biometrics.\nContact chaining: A technique used by Facebook. If two different people have your email address or phone number in their phones’ contact information, that indicates to Facebook that they could possibly know each other, too. It doesn’t even have to be an address or phone number that you personally told Facebook about.\nCookies: A small text file that a site saves to your web browser. Cookies make the personalisation of your web experiences possible as they help sites remember items in your shopping cart, your log-in name and your preferences. Other cookies may be placed in your browser by third-party advertising companies to help deliver the ads you see online. These “third-party cookies” may be used to “remember” parts of your online activities to deliver ads tailored to your interests.\nDark patterns: Tricks used by websites and apps to make you buy or sign up for things you hadn’t meant to. Examples in the “Dark Patterns Hall of Shame” include Tumblr forcing users to untick 350+ boxes in order to prevent each individual ad company from using their data, Facebook using coercive boxes to get users into accepting facial recognition software, and American Express making it look like an email is essential for free wi-fi when it is not.\nFace recognition: Biometric identity system where your face is identified and archived for surveillance, security and advertising purposes. The Australian government is going ham on this right now.\nGeo-fencing: Location targeting software that allows organisations to trigger an action, from coupons, notifications, engagement features, security alerts, when a device enters a set location.\nGrey market operator: Refers to goods that, while manufactured by or with the consent of the original brand owner, are sold outside of a brand owner’s approved distribution channels — which may or may not be perfectly legal.\nHarvesting: Almost interchangeable with “scraping,” but generally relates to the superset of all data collection methods, whereas scraping is a specific method of harvesting.\n“I agree”: We hand over the right to track us, to profile us, to scan our email and chat content; to remove, edit, or share and sell our content without giving us a cut of the revenues. Facebook “likes” alone can reveal an individual’s gender, age, race, sexuality, political, and religious views.\nIP address: An IP address (Internet Protocol address) is a unique identifier assigned to each connected device on a network. Allows marketers to build larger audiences from smaller audience segments by finding other people who also show similar behaviours as their core target customers. In theory, they will reflect similar characteristics to a benchmark set of characteristics from the original audience segment.\nLocation History: Allows Google to track every move you make with an Android phone.\nThe “long click”: “Click an online ad to shop for a pair of shoes. Close the browser and like magic, the ad appears on your Facebook page when you open it, and follows you across the internet as you surf several days later.”\nNetworked privacy: “All the people who know you and who choose to share their contacts with Facebook are making it easier for Facebook to make connections you may not want it to make — say if you’re in a profession like law, medicine, social work, or even journalism, where you might not want to be connected to people you encounter at work, because of what it could reveal about them or you, or because you may not have had a friendly encounter with them.”\nProbabilistic matching: “The study of millions of web users to determine who is likely to be the same person across devices. For example, Drawbridge, which specialises in matching users across devices, says it has linked 1.2 billion users across 3.6 billion devices — up from 1.5 billion devices just a year ago.”\nScraping: A technique in which computer programs extract data from other digital programs, such as social media websites or behavioural data.\nShadow profile: Non-user data collection systems by which companies such as Facebook target people who are not actually subscribed to that program, without their knowledge or permission.\nThird-party data: “Consumer information collected and packaged by a vast ecosystem of companies. This information powers the advertising-driven model of the modern internet.”"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:b7547fcf-d81e-40dc-9f8c-633c0e64ffae>","<urn:uuid:1a3a2151-1c68-4b49-8bb9-90ffb8c08a45>"],"error":null}
{"question":"In the context of modern cybersecurity threats, how do cyber defense skills compare to ethical hacking abilities when it comes to protecting organizations?","answer":"Cyber defense skills include the ability to identify and prevent cyber attacks, as well as respond to and recover from them, focusing on protecting networks and systems from unauthorized access. Ethical hacking abilities, on the other hand, involve using hacking methods to help companies identify possible entry points into their infrastructure, serving as IT experts who test system vulnerabilities through simulated attacks. While cyber defense emphasizes protection and response to threats, ethical hacking takes an offensive approach by actively probing systems to find weaknesses. Both skill sets are crucial as cyber threats evolve - cyber defense provides the foundational security measures, while ethical hacking helps organizations stay ahead of potential attacks by identifying vulnerabilities before malicious actors can exploit them.","context":["Cyber attacks can include attempts to access data or systems, destruction of data or systems, or interference with normal operations. Cyber defense strategies may include detection and response to attacks, prevention of attacks, and damage control after attacks.\nCyber attacks can have a wide range of consequences, from minor inconvenience to major business losses.

Cyber Defense skills include the ability to identify and prevent cyber attacks, as well as the ability to respond to and recover from them.\nCybersecurity is one of the most important aspects of business today. The global economy is increasingly dependent on the internet and cyber crime has become a major threat to companies and the public. Cybersecurity is essential to protect our information and our systems from being compromised.\nCyber security is a critical part of business today. Many companies have been victims of cyber crime, and cyber crime costs businesses billions of dollars each year. Cybersecurity is not only important for companies that are targets of cyber attacks, but it is also important for companies that are simply vulnerable to cyber attacks. Cybersecurity helps protect data, protects against online fraud, and helps protect against other types of attacks.\nCybersecurity is an important part of any organization. It helps to protect against cyber attacks, which can damage or destroy data, disrupt operations, and expose confidential information. Cybersecurity also helps to protect employees and customers from identity theft and other online scams. By taking steps to protect your organization’s data and operations, you can ensure that your business remains safe and competitive.\nCybersecurity is an important issue for students, as cyber crime is on the rise. According to the National Cyber Security Alliance, cyber crime costs businesses and individuals more than $400 billion each year. Cybersecurity is not just about protecting yourself online; it’s also about protecting your data and networks. If you’re a student, make sure you’re up to date on your cyber security skills.\nCyber security professionals work to protect organizations’ information systems from cyber attacks. They use a variety of methods to detect and prevent cyber attacks, including monitoring networks, conducting research, and developing defensive strategies. Cyber security professionals must have a strong knowledge of computer security concepts and techniques, as well as the ability to analyze data and assess risks. They must also be able to communicate effectively with other members of an organization’s security team and with customers.\nCybersecurity is important in the digital world because it helps protect businesses and individuals from cyber attacks.

Cybersecurity can help protect businesses from financial losses caused by cyber attacks, and it can protect individuals from identity theft and other types of cyber crime.\nCyber Defense is the process of protecting computer networks and systems from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. Cyber Defense may involve the use of defensive measures such as firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems, and countermeasures against viruses and other malware. Cyber Defense also may involve the detection, investigation, and prosecution of cyber crime.","What is a pen test?\nA penetration test, also called a pen test or ethical hacking, is a cybersecurity technique organizations use to identify, test and highlight vulnerabilities in their security posture. These penetration tests are often carried out by ethical hackers. These in-house employees or third parties mimic the strategies and actions of an attacker in order to evaluate the hackability of an organization's computer systems, network or web applications. Organizations can also use pen testing to test their adherence to compliance regulations.\nEthical hackers are information technology (IT) experts who use hacking methods to help companies identify possible entry points into their infrastructure. By using different methodologies, tools and approaches, companies can perform simulated cyber attacks to test the strengths and weaknesses of their existing security systems. Penetration, in this case, refers to the degree to which a hypothetical threat actor, or hacker, can penetrate an organization's cybersecurity measures and protocols.\nThere are three main pen testing strategies, each offering pen testers a certain level of information they need to carry out their attack. For example, white box testing provides the tester all of the details about an organization's system or target network; black box testing provides the tester no knowledge of the system; and gray box penetration testing provides the tester partial knowledge of the system.\nPen testing is considered a proactive cybersecurity measure because it involves consistent, self-initiated improvements based on the reports generated by the test. This differs from nonproactive approaches, which lack the foresight to improve upon weaknesses as they arise. A nonproactive approach to cybersecurity, for example, would involve a company updating its firewall after a data breach occurs. The goal of proactive measures, like pen testing, is to minimize the number of retroactive upgrades and maximize an organization's security.\nWhat is the difference between pen testing and vulnerability assessment?\nPen tests are not the same as vulnerability assessments, which provide a prioritized list of security weaknesses and how to amend them, but they are often performed together. Pen testing is often conducted with a particular goal in mind. These goals typically fall under one of the following three objectives:\n- identify hackable systems\n- attempt to hack a specific system\n- carry out a data breach\nEach objective focuses on specific outcomes that IT leaders are trying to avoid. For example, if the goal of a pen test is to see how easily a hacker could breach the company database, the ethical hackers would be instructed to try and carry out a data breach. The results of a pen test will not only communicate the strength of an organization's current cybersecurity protocols, but they will also present the available hacking methods that can be used to penetrate the organization's systems.\nWhy is pen testing important?\nThe rate of distributed denial-of-service, phishing and ransomware attacks is dramatically increasing, putting all internet-based companies at risk. Considering how reliant businesses are on technology, the consequences of a successful cyber attack have never been greater. A ransomware attack, for instance, could block a company from accessing the data, devices, networks and servers it relies on to conduct business. Such an attack could result in millions of dollars of lost revenue. Pen testing uses the hacker perspective to identify and mitigate cybersecurity risks before they are exploited. This helps IT leaders implement informed security upgrades that minimize the possibility of successful attacks.\nTechnological innovation is one of, if not the greatest, challenge facing cybersecurity. As tech continues to evolve, so do the methods cybercriminals use. In order for companies to successfully protect themselves and their assets from these attacks, they need to be able to update their security measures at the same rate. The caveat, however, is that it is often difficult to know which methods are being used and how they might be used in an attack. But, by using skilled ethical hackers, organizations can quickly and effectively identify, update and replace the parts of their system that are particularly susceptible to modern hacking techniques.\nHow to do penetration testing\nPen testing is unique from other cybersecurity evaluation methods, as it can be adapted to any industry or organization. Depending on an organization's infrastructure and operations, it may want to use a certain set of hacking techniques or tools. These techniques and their methodologies can also vary based on the IT personnel and their company standards. Using the following adaptable six-step process, pen testing creates a set of results that can help organizations proactively update their security protocols:\n- Preparation. Depending on the needs of the organization, this step can either be a simple or elaborate procedure. If the organization has not decided which vulnerabilities it wants to evaluate, a significant amount of time and resources should be devoted to combing the system for possible entry points. In-depth processes like this are usually only necessary for businesses that have not already conducted a complete audit of their systems. Once a vulnerability assessment has been conducted, however, this step becomes much easier.\n- Construct an attack plan. Prior to hiring ethical attackers, an IT department designs a cyber attack, or list of cyber attacks, that its team should use to perform the pen test. During this step, it is also important to define what level of system access the pen tester has.\n- Select a team. The success of a pen test depends on the quality of the testers. This step is often used to appoint the ethical hackers that are best suited to perform the test. Decisions like these can be made based on employee specialties. If a company wants to test its cloud security, a cloud expert may be the best person to properly evaluate its cybersecurity. Companies also often hire expert consultants and certified cybersecurity experts to carry out pen testing.\n- Determine the stolen data type. What is the team of ethical hackers stealing? The data type chosen in this step can have a profound impact on the tools, strategies and techniques used to acquire it.\n- Perform the test. This is one of the most complicated and nuanced parts of the testing process, as there are many automated software programs and techniques testers can use, including Kali Linux, Nmap, Metasploit and Wireshark.\n- Integrate the report results. Reporting is the most important step of the process. The results must be detailed so the organization can incorporate the findings.\nLearn more about the massive SolarWinds hack and how it affects chief information security officers' agendas."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:065ceb4f-e0fa-4fab-995a-43dd55e1c9a7>","<urn:uuid:5ac85247-0d72-4a8c-9ad2-ab55cac2244f>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How does Photorhabdus luminescens generate bioluminescence, and what are the key differences between bioluminescence and fluorescence in scientific applications?","answer":"Photorhabdus luminescens exhibits bioluminescence in its phase I variant, though the exact role of this bioluminescence is not well understood. Regarding the differences between bioluminescence and fluorescence, bioluminescence is generated through an enzymatic reaction, while fluorescence requires a light source for excitation. Bioluminescent reporters offer greater sensitivity and a wider dynamic range compared to fluorescent reporters. Additionally, while cellular components have autofluorescent properties that increase background noise, they have no inherent bioluminescence, allowing for better sensitivity in bioluminescent assays. However, fluorescent reporters are more useful for visualizing targets in live cells since they don't require cofactors or external substrates and are more stable than bioluminescent reporters.","context":["From MicrobeWiki, the student-edited microbiology resource\nDomain: Bacteria, Phylum: Proteobacteria, Class: Gammaproteobacteria, Order: Enterobacteriales, Family: Enterobacteriaceae, Genus: Photorhabdus, Species: luminescens\nDescription and Significance\nPhotorhabdus luminescens also known as Xenorhabdus luminescens is a bioluminescent microbe (Figure 1). The role of bioluminescence in Photorhabdus luminescens is not well known.It might be used to warn other insects or mammals or to work as lure to attract insects for nematodes in which they live. The most important function of this microbe is the symbiotic relationship with soil entomopathogenic nematodes(family: Heterorhabditidae).They are also pathogenic to a wide range of insects (Figure 2).When the nematode infects an insect, P. luminescens is released into the blood stream of the insect and kills it by producing toxins. It also secretes enzymes that are responsible to break down the body of the infected insect and convert it into nutrients.These nutrients are later utilized by both nematode and bacteria. In this way, both organisms gain enough nutrients for further reproduction & replication. P. luminescens is the only organism found so far which exhibit dual phenotype (symbiotic within one insect, and pathogenic with another) (Figure 3).P. luminescens produces antibiotics and toxins to prevent invasion of the insect by bacterial or fungal competitors and it becomes visibly even in notocurnal environment due to the bioluminescence. There have been number of reported cases of human infection by Photorhabdus luminescens too.\nPhotorhabdus luminescens genome sequence comprises of around 5,000 K base pairs and contains 5000 protein-coding genes (Duchaud et al.(2003)(Figure 4). The encoded genes consist of large arrays of adhesins, toxins, hemolysins, proteases and lipases. These proteins play vital role in killing competitors, host colonization, invasion and bioconversion of the insect cadaver.Thereby making this bacteria a very good model for the study of symbiosis and pathogensis.Genes that account for symbiotic relationships are also encoded on geneome sequences.Since the genome of P.luminescens is already sequenced (Duchaud et al. 2003)the next challenge is to identify genes involved in symbiosis which in future could be used to increase the production of the worms for controlling insects on plant. In on of the prototype experiments, Photorhabdus luminescens reduced Colorado potato beetles and sweet potato whitefly by 100 percent in lab conditions (Blackburn et al.(2005)). The potato beetle is notorious for developing resistance to insecticides, so scientists are seeking non-chemical controls as possible natural insecticides.\nCell Structure, Metabolism and Life Cycle\nThe life cycle of Photorhabdus luminescens is dependent on its symbiotic relationship with Heterorhabditis nematodes (Figure 3).Photorhabdus luminescens can be thought of as starting in the intestine of these nematodes. Once the nematode finds a suitable host insect the bacteria are released into the insect. While there they reproduce as do the nematodes. Once the infection stage is complete the bacteria find their way back into the intestine of the nematodes and the nematodes with their bacteria counterparts leave the old host in search of a new host to repeat the cycle. Photorhabdus luminescens exists in two distinct phases called phase I and phase II variants. The two variants have several differences in their cell expression. Phase I variants occur in infective-stage nematodes while Phase II variants occur after sustained growth in vitro. The phase I variant of Photorhabdus luminescens produces an extracellular protease, an extracellular lipase, antibiotic substances, and intracellular protein crystals while the phase II variant does not produce these substances. The phase I variant also has the remarkable trait of bioluminescence. The intracellular protein crystals are expressed as a result of the cipA and cipB genes which are present in the genome. The phase II variants do not express the cipA or cipB gene.Photorhabdus luminescens can be classified as an anaerobic organoheterotroph. The chemical processes responsible for metabolism occur in the absence of oxygen and organic carbon is used as the food source.\nEcology and Pathogenesis\nThe Photorhabdus luminescens bacterium is involved in a complex symbiotic relationship with certain entomopathogenic nematodes. But before the symbiosis can be understood the parasitic nature of the nematodes must be stated. These nematodes are parasitic for many types of insects, so much so that they are often used as a form of insect control across the world. Insects infected with these nematodes usually do not survive. But the nematode could never be lethal or proliferate on its own. It owes its continued existence to the symbiotic relationship it has with Photorhabdus luminescens which live in the intestine of these nematodes. Once inside the insect the nematodes systematically release Photorhabdus luminescens cells into the insect. Releasing as few as 10 cells into the insect is usually fatal. The process by which these bacteria avoid the insects natural defense mechanisms are currently unknown. The Photorhabdus luminescens cells inside the insect produce toxins and proteins which damage the host insect. One such toxin is the Mcf(makes caterpillars floppy) toxin (Figure 5).

Luminescence is light emission as a result of a chemical reaction without the production of heat or any thermal changes. This type of light is clearly different from incandescence, which generates heat and is why incandescent light bulbs get hot during use. Luminescence can be separated into two types:\n- Bioluminescence – light emitted from a biological source\n- Chemiluminescence – light emitted from a non-biological source due to a chemical reaction\nBioluminescence vs. Fluorescence\nFluorescence is another type of emitted light commonly used in biological research and is the product of a fluorophore, a molecule that absorbs the energy from a light source and then emits light at a different wavelength. Bioluminescence, on the other hand, differs from fluorescence in that the excitation energy is supplied by an enzymatic reaction rather than from a source of light. While both bioluminescence and fluorescence are widely used in scientific applications, bioluminescent reporters display an ultrasensitive detection capacity and have a wider dynamic range compared to fluorescent reporters because of the enzymatic nature of the bioluminescent reporter.\nFluorescent reporters are susceptible to photobleaching, provide low quantum yields and have greater protein stability in cell-based assays compared to bioluminescent reporters, which make them less amenable for use as real-time reporters. Cellular components also have autofluorescent properties, which increases the non-specific background and decreases the sensitivity of fluorescent detection in cell-based assays. Conversely, cellular components have no inherent bioluminescence, allowing for greater sensitivity with bioluminescent assays.\nHowever, fluorescent reporters are more useful for visualizing targets in live cells than bioluminescent proteins, because fluorophores do not require cofactors or exogenous substrates for activity and are more stable than bioluminescent reporters.\nBioluminescence in Nature\nUses of bioluminescence in nature are quite diverse and are exhibited by both unicellular organisms like bacteria and dinoflagellates and higher-order organisms such as fish and insects. Bioluminescence is used by both terrestrial and aquatic organisms, although it is more commonly seen in marine animals, especially those living in the extreme depths of the ocean. Bioluminescence serves many natural purposes for these organisms.\nDefense: A strong bioluminescent signal can be used by prey to temporally blind an attacking predator, giving the prey a chance to escape. The light produced by the prey also puts the potential predator at risk of being detected by other predators.\nCamouflage: Animals that normally dwell in oceanic dark zones, including firefly squids, krill, dogfish sharks and hatchet- and lanternfish, come to the surface to feed at night. These animals use counter-illumination to blend into surrounding areas illuminated by moonlight. Similar camouflage is also used by certain species of shallow-water squid that give off light to blend in with the moonlight.\nFeeding: Predators often use bioluminescence to attract prey. The anglerfish, for example, lures prey using an elongated dorsal spine that supports a light-producing organ that houses bioluminescent bacteria. Also, some octopi, including Stauroteuthis syrtensis, have suckers that are lined with organs that produce blue-green light that are also used to attract prey.\nMating: Terrestrial animals such as fireflies and glow worms and marine animals like the octopod Japetella diaphana use bioluminescence to attract a mate.\nTwo agents are essential for the bioluminescent reaction to occur: luciferase, the enzyme that catalyzes the reaction, and the luciferase substrate. A wide variety of luciferase enzymes have been discovered, although the general mechanism of the light-producing reaction for all of the enzymes is the oxidative decarboxylation of the luciferase substrate in the presence of O2 to yield photon emission (light).\nLuciferases likely evolved at multiple stages during the course of history to yield enzymes that differ in expression pattern, substrate specificity, cofactor requirement and enzyme kinetics. The result of these evolutionary changes is that some organisms, such as bacteria and fungi, can emit light continuously, while other organisms emit bioluminescent flashes with varying duration and intensity. For example, the luminescence from a dinoflagellete is short, lasting 0.1 seconds, while that from jellyfish can last tens of seconds.\nThe variation in bioluminescent output by different luciferase enzymes has allowed scientists to classify them based on their output kinetics to accommodate different experimental designs. Luciferase enzymes with flash kinetics have maximum sensitivity because of high signal intensity, although the emitted light also rapidly decays. Conversely, enzymes with glow kinetics are less sensitive but stably emit light for at least 60 minutes.\nLuciferase enzymes are active in their native state and lose activity upon unfolding or denaturation, a property that has been utilized to study factors that influence proper protein folding. Also, luciferases such as Gaussia, Metridia and Cypridina are naturally secreted and therefore have been used to study the mechanisms and regulation of the secretory pathway.\n|Photinus pyralis||North American firefly luciferase||61||D-luciferin||Mg, ATP||No|\n|Luciola cruciata||Japanese firefly (Genji-botaru ) luciferase||64||D-luciferin||Mg, ATP||No|\n|Luciola italica||Italian firefly Luciferase||64||D-luciferin||Mg, ATP||No|\n|Luciola lateralis||Japanese firefly (Heike) luciferase||64||D-luciferin||Mg, ATP||No|\n|Luciola mingrelica||East European firefly luciferase||64||D-luciferin||Mg, ATP||No|\n|Photuris pennsylvanica||Pennsylvania firefly luciferase||64||D-luciferin||Mg, ATP||No|\n|Pyrophorus plagiophthalamus||Click beetle luciferase||64||D-luciferin||Mg, ATP||No|\n|Phrixothrix hirtus||Railroad worm luciferase||64||D-luciferin||Mg, ATP||No|\n|Renilla reniformis||Renilla luciferase||36||Coelenterazine||N/A||No|\n|Rluc8 (mutant of Renilla luciferase)||36||Coelenterazine||N/A||No|\n|Green Renilla luciferase||36||Coelenterazine||N/A||No|\n|Gaussia princeps||Gaussia luciferase||20||Coelenterazine||N/A||Yes|\n|Cypridina noctiluca||Cypridina luciferase||62||Vargulin/Cypridina luciferin||N/A||Yes|\n|Cypridina hilgendorfii||Cypridina (Vargula) luciferase||62||Vargulin/Cypridina luciferin||N/A||Yes|\n|Metridia longa||Metridia luciferase||23.8||Coelenterazine||N/A||Yes|\nBioluminescent Experimental Applications\nLuciferase has gained tremendous popularity in the study biological systems, because the bioluminescence is sensitive and the reagents are easy to use. Examples of areas where bioluminescence is routinely used include:\n- In vivo imaging\n- Cell proliferation assays\n- Protein folding/secretion analyses\n- Reporter gene assays\nIn vivo Imaging\nIn vivo imaging is a relatively new, non-invasive method that is gaining fast acceptance in biomedical research because of the ability to track molecular events in live animals such as mice and rats. In animal disease models, cells, pathogens, proteins or other molecules are labeled with bioluminescent luciferases and visualized after the localized or systemic addition of substrate. Low-level light is able to pass through tissue, and the level of penetration is dependent upon the wavelength of the emitted light. Therefore, although bioluminescence emitted from deep within an experimental animal can be detected with a sensitive detection system, luciferases that emit light at wavelengths >600 nm have the greatest sensitivity for in vivo imaging applications (2).\nCell Viability Assays\nBioluminescent assays have also been developed to monitor cell viability and proliferation. Bioluminescent cell viability assays quantitate the free ATP present in metabolically active cells using ATP-dependent luciferases. As a cell population proliferates, the amount of available ATP increases, resulting in a concomitant increase in the bioluminescent signal of the population. Commonly used non-bioluminescent methods to measure cell proliferation include:\n- Quantitation of DNA synthesis by measuring tritiated thymidine (3H-thymidine) or bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) uptake\n- Identification of dead cells using propidium iodide, a membrane-impermeable DNA-intercalating dye\n- Quantitation of the reduction of the intracellular environment by tetrazolium salt reduction (MTT)\n- AlamarBlue reduction and quantitation of intracellular ATP concentration.\nReporter Gene Assays\nReporter gene assays are used to investigate the genetic regulatory elements that control the expression of genes of interest. A gene consists of multiple functional parts, including the coding region that specifies the protein to be made and regulatory elements that control the transcription of the coding region.\nThe reporter gene assay centers around fusing the putative regulatory elements to a reporter gene and monitoring the amount of the reporter protein expressed. Because reporter expression is under the control of the fused genetic elements, reporter expression is directly correlated with the activity of the regulatory elements. These elements could be promoters, enhancers or 5' or 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) that control either the transcription or translation events in the cell.\nThe characteristic of good a reporter protein is that it should be easy to assay or detect and is not present normally in the test system. Selection of the reporter system also depends on the experimental system, sensitivity needs and the available detection strategy, be it absorbance, fluorescence or bioluminescence. The proteins that have been traditionally used as reporters include β-galactosidase (lacZ), chloramphenyl acetyltransferase (CAT), β-glucuronidase (GUS) and fluorescent proteins (green, yellow or red fluorescent protein [GFP, YFP or RFP, respectively) and secretory alkaline phosphatase (SEAP).\nLuciferase Reporter Assays\nLuciferase-based reporter gene assays are widely used because of their ultrasensitive detection capacity and wide dynamic range. These assays involve placing a genetic regulatory element upstream of a luciferase gene and then transferring the resulting reporter construct into animal cells, plant cells or bacteria through transfection, transformation or injection. Expression of the luciferase reporter gene is then measured to quantify the activity of the regulatory element (cis-acting) or proteins (trans-acting) in the biological pathway affected by the target element.\nSingle- vs. Dual-Spectral Assays\nLuciferase enzymes can be used as single reporters to study one biological event in a given experiment, but because of their different spectral properties and/or substrates, multiple luciferase enzymes can be combined for multiplex luciferase experiments. With these types of experiments, called dual-spectral luciferase reporter assays, two luciferase enzymes are simultaneously expressed and detected in a single sample. Dual-spectral luciferase reporter assays are ideal for:\n- Analyzing more than one target per screen\n- Minimizing off-target effects\n- Identifying crosstalk between two or more pathways\n- Normalizing data to eliminate experimental artifacts\nFor data normalization experiments, one reporter generally functions as an experimental reporter and the second as an internal control to account for non-specific experimental variations due to operator error or as a result of non-specific effects of biological manipulations or cell treatments. Additional experimental variations include:\n- Differences in cell plating\n- Differences in cell viability or proliferation due to an experimental treatment\n- Edge effects caused by uneven environmental conditions in the cell culture incubator\n- Non-specific effects of the treatment compound on the function of the reporter itself\nDual-spectral luciferase reporter assays using luciferase enzymes with non-overlapping luminescence spectra can be measured simultaneously by filter-based detection in a single sample using a single reagent. Dual reporter assays like this that use either the same or different substrates are commercially available.\nWhen using luciferases with overlapping spectra, the luciferases can be measured sequentially in two steps using two reagents if they have different substrate specificities. In the two-step method, the luminescence from the first luciferase is measured, and the enzyme is then inactivated. A second reagent containing the substrate for the second luciferase is then added and the activity measured. Theoretically, more than two enzymes can be multiplexed in this way as long as they have different substrate specificities.\n|Luciferase Combinations||Multiplex Detection Strategies|\n|Renilla/Red Firefly||Coelenterazine/Luciferin||460 nm BP/615 nm LP|\n|Green Renilla/Red Firefly||Coelenterazine/Luciferin||525 nm BP/640 nm LP|\n|Gaussia/Renilla||Difficult but possible with coelenterazine analogs||N/A|\n|Gaussia/Green Renilla||Difficult but possible with coelenterazine analogs||N/A|\n|Gaussia/Red Firefly||Coelenterazine/Luciferin||470 nm BP/640 nm LP|\n|Cypridina/Red Firefly||Vargulin/Luciferin||470 nm BP/640 nm LP|\n|BP: band pass; LP: long pass|\nTime-Course Assays Using Dual-spectral Luciferase Assays\nDual-spectral luciferase assays are ideal for performing time-course assays using a secreted luciferase to measure the experimental promoter activity and an intracellular luciferase under the control of a housekeeping gene promoter to measure cell viability. As shown in the video animation below, experimental promoter activity results in luciferase secretion into the culture medium, which is collected at various time points throughout the experiment. The cells are then lysed at the completion of the time-course, and the lysate is measured for intracellular luciferase activity as the control for cell viability.\nNot all commercially available dual-spectral luciferase assays are compatible with time-course assays because of the requirement for a secreted luciferase reporter. For example, Renilla luciferase is not secreted, and thus the Pierce Renilla-Firefly Luciferase Dual Reporter Assay Kit will not work for this type of time-course assay. However, Cypridina and Gaussia luciferases are secreted; therefore, Pierce Cypridina-Firefly and Gaussia-Firefly dual-spectral luciferase kits are compatible with time-course assays.\n- Keilin D.

With Salesforce, businesses can access data from anywhere and leverage it to make informed decisions. As an organization's largest container of data, Salesforce is also a target for cybercriminals. In this blog, we will explore the threats to Salesforce data and the steps organizations can take to safeguard their most valuable asset.\nUnderstanding Salesforce Data Threats\nSalesforce data threats come in many forms, including:\n- Malware and Ransomware: Malware can infect Salesforce accounts through email phishing or by downloading malicious software. Ransomware can encrypt files and demand payment in exchange for the decryption key.\n- Data Leakage: Data leakage occurs when sensitive information is disclosed to unauthorized parties. Data breaches can occur due to human error, such as misconfiguration, or malicious attacks.\n- Account Hijacking: Account hijacking occurs when an attacker gains unauthorized access to a Salesforce account. This can be done through password cracking, social engineering, or exploiting vulnerabilities.\n- Insider Threats: Insider threats occur when employees, contractors, or partners with access to Salesforce data misuse or leak data. Insider threats can be accidental or intentional.\nBest Practices for Securing Salesforce Data\nTo protect Salesforce data, organizations should implement the following best practices:\n- Use Multi-Factor Authentication: Multi-factor authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security to Salesforce logins. With MFA, users must provide additional authentication factors, such as a one-time password or biometric authentication.\n- Restrict Access: Limit access to Salesforce data to only those who need it. Implement role-based access controls (RBAC) to restrict access based on job function.\n- Encrypt Data: Encryption is the process of encoding data to protect it from unauthorized access. Salesforce offers encryption at rest and in transit, which ensures that data is protected both while it's being stored and when it's being transmitted.\n- Implement Monitoring and Alerting: Monitor Salesforce activity for suspicious behavior, such as failed login attempts, and set up alerts to notify administrators of potential threats.\n- Conduct Regular Audits: Conduct regular audits of Salesforce data to ensure that access is restricted appropriately and that sensitive data is not being leaked.\n2Partnering with a Salesforce Security Expert\nPartnering with a Salesforce security expert can help organizations protect their data by:\n- Conducting Risk Assessments: Salesforce security experts can assess an organization's security posture and identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.\n- Providing Guidance on Best Practices: Salesforce security experts can provide guidance on best practices for securing Salesforce data, such as implementing MFA, restricting access, and encrypting data.\n- Implementing Security Controls: Salesforce security experts can help organizations implement security controls, such as RBAC and monitoring and alerting.\n- Providing Incident Response: In the event of a security breach, a Salesforce security expert can provide incident response services, such as containing the breach, investigating the incident, and restoring data.\nAdditional Considerations for Salesforce Data Security\n- Data Backup and Recovery: While preventive measures are essential for protecting Salesforce data, it's also critical to have a data backup and recovery plan in place. This ensures that organizations can quickly recover from a data breach or loss.\n- Regular Software Updates: Regularly updating Salesforce software is crucial for maintaining data security. Software updates often include security patches that address known vulnerabilities and protect against new threats.\n- User Training and Awareness: Educating users on Salesforce security best practices and potential threats is essential. This includes training on password hygiene, recognizing phishing emails, and reporting suspicious activity.\n- Third-Party Integrations: Many organizations integrate third-party applications with Salesforce to enhance functionality. However, these integrations can pose security risks if not adequately vetted. Organizations should ensure that all third-party applications are properly assessed for security risks before integrating them into Salesforce.\n- Compliance with Regulations: Organizations must comply with industry regulations, such as GDPR and HIPAA, that govern the handling and protection of customer data. Compliance requirements vary depending on the industry and location, so organizations must understand the regulations that apply to them and implement necessary security measures.\nIn today's digital landscape, data security is a top concern for organizations of all sizes. Salesforce is an essential tool for managing customer data, but it's also a target for cybercriminals. By understanding the threats to Salesforce data and implementing best practices for securing it, organizations can minimize the risk of a data breach. Additionally, partnering with a Salesforce security expert can provide additional protection and ensure that organizations are fully prepared to respond to a security incident. With a comprehensive security strategy in place, organizations can leverage Salesforce to drive business success while keeping their data safe.\nSalesforce data is an organization's most valuable asset, and protecting it should be a top priority. By understanding the threats to Salesforce data and implementing best practices for securing it, organizations can minimize the risk of a data breach. Partnering with a Salesforce security expert can provide additional protection and ensure that organizations are fully prepared to respond to a security incident."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:7b3d90a2-d7c0-431b-9121-ddc2f8c18921>","<urn:uuid:550212e7-78a8-4d95-a363-d153ba636e4c>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the productivity differences between various coffee certification standards, and how do they integrate with broader sustainable food sourcing initiatives?","answer":"Different coffee certification standards show varying productivity levels, with Fair Trade achieving 6.38 kg cherry per tree, UTZ reaching 5.21 kg, and Rainforest Alliance at 4.11 kg. Moreover, combining certifications like Fair Trade with Rainforest Alliance creates synergistic effects, increasing productivity to 6.78kg per tree. These certification standards align with broader sustainable food sourcing initiatives, as demonstrated by companies like Xanterra, which has implemented comprehensive sustainable cuisine programs including certified sustainable seafood, hormone-free meats, organic produce, and Fair Trade coffee - showing how certification standards can be integrated into larger sustainability efforts in the food industry.","context":["Eating for a Healthy Planet\nThere is no human activity that has a greater impact on the environment than food production. Our species consumes half of the planets available fresh water (mostly for food production) and consumes half of the Earth’s annual biomass (plants and animals). To this can be added tons of toxic chemicals, dams and diversions which have done serious damage to the world’s river systems and coastal areas, soil loss, and deforestation. A major energy consumer, the average food item travels 1400 miles to reach an American citizen’s table. On the flip side, both sustainable agriculture, organic gardening, and farmer’s markets are experiencing rapid growth. Xanterra, Zion’s concessionaire, has set the pace for purchasing local, organic food wherever possible. There story is given below. You can make a huge difference by growing your own garden and shopping for locally produced food. Of course organic produce and hormone free, humanely treated animal products are highly desirable when available.\nSee more at\nWhat began in 2000 with a company wide seafood policy—to ensure Xanterra serves only sustainable seafood in its 64 restaurants—has grown into a nationally acclaimed sustainable-cuisine program.\nIn 2000, Xanterra began recommending fish from Marine Stewardship Council-certified sustainable fisheries and those that were harvested using sustainable practices, following guidelines developed by the Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch protocol and the Audubon Society’s Living Oceans Seafood Guide. The company also stopped serving four species of seafood—Chilean sea bass, Atlantic swordfish, blue fin tuna and shark—because the survival of those species is threatened by over-fishing, or they are harvested in ways that damage the environment.\nXanterra then became the first U.S. hospitality company to be granted the “Chain of Custody” certification from the Marine Stewardship Council. Xanterra also joined the Chef’s Collaborative, a national network of more than 1,000 members of the food community who promote sustainable cuisine.\nSince then, Xanterra’s sustainable cuisine menu offerings at many locations have grown substantially, including the additions of:\n- Oregon Country Natural Beef, a cooperative of family-run ranches where cattle are raised using the most sustainable practices possible, including eliminating growth hormones and feed additives and maximizing the use of natural resources like water and vegetation.\n- Niman Ranch pork and Montana Legends beef, produced from hormone-free animals fed natural feeds and grazed using low-impact methods.\n- Wine produced from organically grown grapes or by using other sustainable agricultural practices. A full one-third of the wine list at the Grand Canyon Lodge is comprised of wines produced using sustainable agriculture or organic farming techniques.\n- Marine Stewardship Council Certified Wild Alaskan, sustainably harvested salmon.\n- Organic produce, grass-fed beef and local Ohio-raised chicken.\n- Farm-raised trout, tilapia, bison, elk and venison.\n- Abalone produced by Abalone Farm, a California facility that uses state-of-the-art sustainable practices. Due to the rapid decline in the coastal wild abalone population, commercial abalone diving is illegal in U.S. waters. Abalone Farm operates an aquaculture facility that grows abalone without harming resources.\n- Silk brand organic soy milk.\n- Organic Fair Trade Certified Coffee, grown without pesticides and harvested in a way that supports wildlife and migratory bird habitats, using a shade growing method that requires only partial cutting of the rainforest.\nThe Fair Trade certificate means that it is purchased from local farmers at a fair price.","The Relationship between Adoption of Coffee Certification Standards and Productivity in Nyeri County in Kenya\nKeywords:strategy, productivity, planned change, standards, coffee\nStandards have been applied as strategic tools to help organizations increase productivity, and improve competitive advantage. They facilitate free and fair global trade, enhance customer satisfaction through improved quality, open new global markets by preventing trade barriers and increase market share. The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between adoption of coffee certification standards; Fairtrade, UTZ, and Rainforest Alliance on coffee productivity in Nyeri County. A cross-sectional study design was used to describe the current situation and establish any relationships between adoption of coffee certification standards and productivity. Researcher administered questionnaires were used to collect data from 270 coffee farmers. Stratified random sampling was used to sample the farmers in each agroecological zone. Productivity was defined as kilograms cherry produced per coffee tree. Data on coffee production and marketing activities for the 2013/2014 coffee year was collected and analyzed into descriptive and inferential statistics. Data was analyzed using non- parametric methods after subjecting it to normality test. The productivity populations were significantly different (p=0.008)with ac2 value of 13.82. Fairtrade was the most prevalent standard at 70.7% adoption rate. The mean coffee productivity resulting from adoption of Fairtrade, Rainforest Alliance and UTZ were 6.38, 4.11 and 5.21 kg cherry per tree respectively. The mean effect of certification to Fairtrade on productivity compared to Rainforest Alliance was significantly different (p=0.01). Agro-ecological zoning did not have a significant effect (p=0.67) on coffee productivity. The mean productivity rank for Fairtrade was significantly different (p=0.02) compared to that for non-Fairtrade with mean productivity of 6.21 and 4.39 kg cherry/tree respectively. Fairtrade combined with Rainforest Alliance had a synergistic effect resulting to increased productivity of 6.78kg per tree compared to the individual standards. The recommendations from the study are:promotion of coffee certification standardsto coffee farmersas a way of improving productivity and further researchon the effects of adoption ofothersustainability standards on coffee productivity and on other crops.\nâ€¢ Arnould, E., Plastina, A. and Ball, D.

{"question":"How do entity resolution and biometric recognition compare in terms of data standardization approaches?","answer":"Entity resolution and biometric recognition use different approaches to data standardization. Entity resolution uses fuzzy matching techniques like Jaro-Winkler and Levenshtein Edit Distance functions to standardize variations in text data, as shown in the World Bank case where it consolidated thousands of vendor records and standardized complex foreign addresses. In contrast, biometric recognition standardizes biological and behavioral data by translating traits into codes or graphs rather than storing complete images or recordings. Both systems aim to create standardized, comparable data points but work with fundamentally different types of information.","context":["What is Entity Resolution?\nEntity resolution, often called record linkage or de-duplication, is a set of algorithms and fuzzy-matching techniques that consolidates data into higher-level categories. Identity resolution, for example, would be consolidating data from either one or multiple sources, so that all data is tied to one person’s identity. Entity resolution applies the same concept but typically to an entity or corporation name.\nFor example, suppose you have several vendors with different spellings of HP (Hewlett-Packard), and you want to aggregate annual spend for the entire umbrella vendor.\nAfter Entity Resolution is applied to the HP problem, all of the vendors are consolidated to one standard vendor name.\nBenefits of Entity Resolution\nEntity resolution is useful in many industries. In accounting, cleansing and de-duping the master vendor file is a form of entity resolution, and helps to eliminate duplicate vendors. You can also use Entity Resolution to cleanse customer data bases and mailing data bases, keeping the most accurate and active record. This cleansing exercise will save time and money by eliminating potential duplicate payments and duplicate mailings.\nBut perhaps the most interesting use of Entity Resolution is to find FRAUD.\nEntity Resolution can be implemented to uncover hidden relationships to detect fraud. For example, if you have the following table of vendor records, you can see with the human eye that pairs of records are related, but actually all of the records are related to one another indirectly.\nUsing your own eye, you can tell that the first 3 rows are linked via address even though the addresses differ slightly. Rows D and E are related via address, and rows F and G are related via similar phone number. If family members purchase cell phone service at the same time, they are often given sequential cell phone numbers. This scenario could be an actual case where Dr. Abdel is the founder of “Happy Home Care”, a fictitious home health care clinic. Walker Associates is a legitimate business that is fronting for Happy Home Care, and owns suites A and B in the same building. John Walker owns Walker Associates and their daughter is married to Mohammed Abdel, and they live in the basement apartment of 237 S. Ridgeway, which is a single family home.\nThis kind of linkage mechanism is very useful, especially when you can control the fuzzy matching underlying each individual match.\nAutomated Auditors, LLC, has developed proprietary entity resolution software called AnyConnection that employs several fuzzy matching techniques such as Jaro-Winkler and Levenshtein Edit Distance functions, proprietary edit distance matching functions, and can funnel the matches into AnyConnection to develop a broad umbrella “family” ID for the above 5 seemingly unrelated records. This allows investigators to pro-actively identify fraud issues, in any industry.\nWorld Bank Case Study\nAutomated Auditors, LLC was retained to complete a Vendor File de-duplication and cleansing project for The World Bank. With a vendor file with over 300,000 records, containing many foreign and duplicate names and addresses, this project was the perfect match for Automated Auditor’s fuzzy matching logic and entity resolution techniques. Using our proprietary TriGram and PctTriGram functions and fuzzy matching logic, we were able to identify that (for example) the following two addresses were the same, despite the many different spellings and different order of the word sequence\n|Complex Foreign Address Matching|\n|Calle 3 villa santa la central canovanas pr 00729 buzon 2311|\n|La central canovanes Calle 3, Villa Sant, Buzon 2311 PR 00729|\nThe Vendor File cleansing and de-duplication effort resulted in the identification of many thousands of duplicate records and the consolidation of many records into a single record per vendor.\nCustoms and Border Patrol Case Study\nCustoms and Border Protection (CBP) contains several shipping manifests for inbound and outbound cargo. The city name field on the manifests is an open-text field in which the sender can write anything – there is no “drop down box” to help standardize the city name. CBP had a need to standardize city names so they could identify whether a package was going to a large city or a rural area, and without name standardization, they couldn’t properly identify the city or the size of the city. For example: an extract of the shipping manifest data showed over 8,000 different variations of “Buenos Aires”! It sounds impossible that there could be this many variations, but because each province had a certain mailing number, and because of the misspellings, it was indeed possible. This bottleneck was delaying their efforts to develop accurate predictive models whose purpose was to isolate suspicious packages. Automated Auditors, LLC developed SAS algorithms to consolidate and standardize the city name, using fuzzy matching logic and entity resolution algorithms. Our proprietary software was able to standardize almost all of the variations to a single city name, allowing Customs and Border Protection to isolate the shipping send-to address more accurately.","What is meant by biometric recognition?\nBiometric recognition (also known as biometrics) refers to the automated recognition of individuals based on their biological and behavioral traits. It is based on hardware systems for data acquisition that integrate the software components that allow, through mathematical algorithms, to perform data analysis and reconstruct the identity of a person and recognize it.\nHow does biometric recognition work?\nInstead of using something you have (like a key) or something you know (like a password), biometrics uses who you are to identify you. Biometrics can use physical characteristics, like your face, fingerprints, irises or veins, or behavioral characteristics like your voice, handwriting or typing rhythm. Unlike keys and passwords, your personal traits are extremely difficult to lose or forget. They can also be very difficult to copy. For this reason, many people consider them to be safer and more secure than keys or passwords.\nBiometric systems can seem complicated, but they all use the same three steps:\nThe first time you use a biometric system, it records basic information about you, like your name or an identification number. It then captures an image or recording of your specific trait.\nContrary to what you may see in movies, most systems don't store the complete image or recording. They instead analyze your trait and translate it into a code or graph. Some systems also record this data onto a smart card that you carry with you.\nThe next time you use the system, it compares the trait you present to the information on file. Then, it either accepts or rejects that you are who you claim to be.\nSystems also use the same three components:\n- A sensor that detects the characteristic being used for identification\n- A computer that reads and stores the information\n- Software that analyzes the characteristic, translates it into a graph or code and performs the actual comparisons\nWhat are the goals of biometric recognition for authentication?\nThe functioning of the biometric recognition systems varies according to the objective, which can be the verification or identification of a person:\nA person declares his identity so his recognition becomes a verification process (one by one) that requires a match between the detected image (or the acquired data) in real-time from the sensors and that present in an archive;\nThe biometric recognition is done by matching the image, the data, the information acquired in real-time with all the images and information present in an archive (one to many verifications). The biometric recognition system will associate identity by comparing and identifying the most similar and consistent physiological and behavioral characteristics between those in the archive and those collected in real-time.\nThe biometric system is showing its full potential not only because it reaches higher levels of protection than the password method, but above all, because it opens the door to new services that are able to integrate security and a better user experience for users.\nWhat are the benefits of biometric recognition?\n1. Security and Profitability\nOnce the biometric verification system is integrated, there’s no need to invest in additional capital. This significantly cuts upfront and ongoing investment costs. These systems are also critical to preventing loss due to fraud and illegal entries. That benefit alone saves money and drives profitability.\n2. Easy to Operate and User Friendly\nManaging, fitting, and even analyzing biometric verification is very user-friendly – providing technological and accurate results with minimal need for intervention. New data can be entered quickly and logs analyzed fast. Once the table of entries and exits is created, it’s easy to study and manage.\n3. Highly Efficient\nEvery company demands highly efficient security systems. Biometric verification systems not only enhance security but make it is easier and more efficient to manage key functions such as attendance tracking for payroll. It is even helpful for employees as they don't need to carry cards everywhere.\n4. Convenience is Key\nOne key advantage of a biometric verification system is convenience. There’s just no need to reset the passwords. Once the biometric test is activated, all fingerprints, iris, and facial recognition are done - and employees are good to go. It is even convenient to log the data and audit it accordingly.\n5. Quick and Accurate Identification and Authentication\nUsing passwords and codes for security access is pretty straightforward but generic. Anyone with a card or pass can gain access. But biometric security technology refers to the biological passcodes that cannot be forged - meaning accurate identification and authentication of the specific individual. Iris or facial recognition is more often becoming integrated as part of the security process, as scanning is a quick and easy process.\nThis menu allows you to set up answers to probable queries by setting up FAQs, defining Entities, uploading questions, and responses in a Tabular Input format or uploading relevant documents in Document Lookup. Engati NLP engine has been set up and has the intelligence to search across the four types and match the most relevant response according to the query asked, further users, have the control to change most of the settings and search preference according to their requirements.\nWhat are the biometric recognition characteristics?\nBiometric characteristics are typically divided into two categories: physiological biometrics and behavioral biometrics.\nThese are features that can be notably identified through the five senses and could be processed finite calculable differences: sight (the colour of a person’s hair and eyes, their teeth, their facial features, etc.), sound (the pitch of a person’s voice), smell (their odor or scent), taste (the composition of a person’s saliva or DNA), and touch (like the person’s fingerprints or handprints).\nThese are all about the manner in which people behave and conduct themselves.

{"question":"How do vector paths work differently in PaintShop Pro vs Adobe Illustrator for creating artistic effects?","answer":"In PaintShop Pro, vector paths are primarily used to place picture tubes and text along them using specific tools like the VectorTube script, and only the Preset Shape tool and Pen tool create 'real paths'. Other vector objects need conversion to paths first. Meanwhile, Adobe Illustrator, as a dedicated vector graphics app, offers more comprehensive vector capabilities for creating logos, complex illustrations, patterns, and drawings that remain crisp when scaled. Illustrator's vector features include powerful brush effects, text effects, and pattern creation tools that work with precision for professional design work.","context":["In PaintShop Pro, you can place text along a vector path for some very creative effects, but what about picture tubes? Can you place them along a path quickly without having the move elements one by one and measure the spacing every time? Of course! There is a better way, and that is by using the VectorTube script. This scripts is quite old (2003!) but still works with the newest versions of PaintShop Pro. This script, coded by Joe Fromm, Peter Ward, is available for download HERE. Let's look at how it is used in various types of projects.\nSetting your tube\nSince the script will apply the picture tube to a vector path, you need to set the tube the way you want. On a raster layer, test the tube, the scale, the step, and the placement mode. Is it what you want? If not, adjust those settings before running the script.\nSetting your path\nAlthough you can place text on path on ANY vector line, they are not always considered PATHS. That seems odd, I agree, and I got fooled more than once when I started using this script. There are 6 ways you can create a vector object: Ellipse tool, Rectangle tool, Preset Shape tool, Symmetric Shape tool, Pen tool, and Text tool. Among them, only 2 will be a \"real path\" as needed for the VectorTube script: the Preset Shape tool and the Pen tool. This means that for the other vector objects, you will need to convert them to a path.\nThere are two ways you can convert the vector object to a path:\n- right-click on the vector object on your project, and select Convert to Path\n- go to Objects > Convert to Path\n- if you have an older version of PSP (X2 and older) you can also right-click on the vector object in the layer palette, and select Convert to Path\nIf the Convert to Path is greyed out, it is because it is already a path, so you are ok. If you run the script and nothing seems to happen, check to make sure the object was converted to a path. If it was not, no stroking will happen and you won't have any warning or message; you will just think it is not working.\nRunning the script\nMaking sure that the picture tube is set the way you want, activate the vector object (that has been converted to a path), and run the script. You will then see the tubes being placed along that path automatically. Notice that this is created on a separate raster layer called \"Stroked object\" and your vector object is untouched. This allows you to run the script multiple times, on the same vector path, using different tubes, or different settings of the same tube. This also means that you can, in the end, delete or hide the vector object if you don't need it in your project.\nUsing single image tube\nIf your tube has only a single image, it will be repeated along the path as often as needed. The advantage of this is that if you are using an element that has an obvious direction, or light source, that will stay identical on each copy of the tube, making the whole montage more realistic than if you had the light source or the shadow rotating in different angles.\nUsing a directional tube\nUsing directional tubes means that the tube image will be rotated based on the direction of the cursor movement. In the case of this script, it will determine the angle of the path and choose the image accordingly, making the applied tube as if it were hand-drawn and following the cursor. With any shape you want, you can use a rope, string, or chain tube to create a fun frame.\nThere is one rope tube included with PaintShop Pro, but you can also get an array of rope/string/chain tubes HERE too.\nThis is also perfect if you want to place a string in a particular way in order to attach tags, banners or decorative elements. Since you can tweak the vector path, you can be more precise in its placement, and end up with a string that is exactly where you want it, without having to draw it by hand.\nUsing scattered tubes\nIn addition to having tubes placed exactly ON the path, you might want to have some tubes scattered along the path, but not necessarily on a narrow path. This can be achieved if you have picture tubes that are looking like they are scattered around, like confetti or spilled, like beads or sprinkles.\nA set of sprinkle tubes (in 12 colors) is available HERE.\nAs you can see, there is a lot of creativity that is unleashed when combining vector path, picture tubes and a super-smart script called VectorTube. I have used this script hundreds (if not thousands) of times for various projects. It makes the end result so great looking, in just a fraction of the time it would take to place the tubes manually, and it is so much more accurate than I could ever hope to do by hand.\nWhat will you use this script for? Show us your project using the VectorTube by linking in the comments below.","What is Adobe Illustrator used for, and how can you use it in your design work?

In 2015, 113 million health records were exposed in the U.S. An additional 16 million American health records were exposed in 2016, per the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\nWhy Cyberattackers Target the Healthcare Industry\nThe numbers show the devastating impact of cyberattacks in the healthcare industry. It’s worth pointing out that the recent rise in healthcare data breaches comes as other industries have increased their investment in cybersecurity systems that detect, block, and mitigate attacks. Hackers searching out new targets turned to industries they previously ignored, such as healthcare. It’s much easier to apply the same strategies to a new industry than invest time in developing new hacks for the latest cyber security, after all.\nOnce cyber thieves get healthcare data, what do they do with it? The black market has many uses for medical records. Cyber criminals can harvest the data to conduct “medical identity theft.” From the harvested data, they can create false or synthetic identities.\nThey can glean enough raw data from an individual’s medical record to perform traditional identity theft. From a medical record, they may be able to open a bank account or credit card, take out a business loan, and more.\nMedical identity theft is more complex than credit card theft. While a consumer can detect and dispute a credit card charge fairly quickly, it is more difficult to resolve medical identity theft.\nCyber criminals have begun using ransomware to extract money from healthcare organizations. Criminals steal the data then promise to return access to the data or systems if a ransom is paid.\nSince healthcare organizations have been slow to adopt cybersecurity best practices, medical staff may be unaware of the risks to patient data. The average cybersecurity budget for a healthcare organization is a fraction of the budget for a financial firm.\nRecommendations for Cybersecurity\nBoth provincial and federal governments set laws regarding privacy of data. These laws indicate who can access medical information, how data must be stored and managed, and what protocol to follow if there is a breach. If you’re not sure what the privacy laws are, or how they apply to healthcare data security, this is the place to start. If it’s been a while since you’ve reviewed the privacy laws, look for recent, relevant findings and rulings that could apply to your business.\nSince many healthcare workers do not know the risks of cyberattack, it’s important to educate staff. Not only should IT workers understand cybersecurity threats and protection, but medical workers should know how their roles pertain to data management. In particular, staff should understand how to properly handle confidential information including patient data. Staff should know how to recognize common types of cyberattacks, such as phishing emails. By training your employees on cybersecurity, you can cut the risk of an attack from 70 percent to 45 percent.\nIndustry Best Practices\nBest practices that combine the particular needs of the healthcare sector with practical cybersecurity solutions do exist. They include strong encryption of data, strong authentication requirements for data, strict access control of data, and regular monitoring of searches and downloads. If a large batch of sensitive data is downloaded or transferred, it should trigger an alarm. Along with implementing best practices, healthcare businesses should research newer technologies that may offer additional levels of protection. These include biometric security, tokenization, and blockchains to record transactions.\nDisaster recovery planning is essential for the healthcare businesses. Comprehensive planning includes defining what needs to be protected, implementing a DR plan, and testing the plan. The growth of DRaaS or disaster recovery as a service allows a healthcare businesses to invest in the disaster recovery they need while keeping costs affordable.\nCyber Insurance A cyber insurance policy can help protect your business from a data breach and many other IT disasters. A comprehensive insurance policy will cover claims made against your business by victims of the breach as well as direct losses you experience.\nIT Service Providers\nIf all of this sounds like a lot to handle on your own, consider turning to the cloud for help. Healthcare organizations are increasingly using the cloud to store data and share data while controlling cost. Cloud service providers offer scalable solutions for healthcare, so your business can access the protections you need now and change your plan as you grow. Many service providers understand the regulations, risks, and needs of the healthcare industry and act as supportive partners.\nGiven the gap between healthcare cybersecurity and the security of other industries, it is critical that healthcare organizations make it a priority to protect their data. As long as the healthcare sectors uses vulnerable hardware and software for transactions and does not move toward stronger cybersecurity practices, organizations will continue to face staggering risk.\nProtecting health data will take a coordinated effort among healthcare companies, care providers, insurance companies, and IT partners who can provide solutions and experience. By adopting the lessons learned by other industries — namely financial and legal — healthcare companies can reduce their risk and protect their patient data before “the worst” happens."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"advanced_reasoning"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:4e29c631-14ee-4da5-90a9-d145a5a4dfda>","<urn:uuid:24b7fcad-d28b-4d04-850a-afb34ef33bb0>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What's the key difference between CPAP therapy vs oral appliance therapy for treating sleep apnea? Need detailed comparison!","answer":"CPAP therapy works by maintaining upper airway patency through constant air pressure (typically 8-10 cmH2O) delivered via a mask, forming a pneumatic splint that prevents airway collapse. While CPAP is considered the most effective treatment for severe OSA, long-term compliance remains low. In contrast, oral appliance therapy works by holding the lower jaw forward to prevent the tongue and soft tissues from collapsing. Oral appliances are indicated for mild to moderate OSA and can be used when patients cannot tolerate CPAP. They are more convenient, easier to travel with, and don't require electricity, but are limited in effectiveness for severe cases due to restrictions on how far the jaw can be pulled forward without causing temporomandibular joint problems.","context":["Insomnia is characterized by difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep. People suffering from insomnia will usually experience some or all of the following symptoms:\n- Difficulty falling asleep, inability to relax the mind enough for sleep to take over.\n- Restless sleep and/or waking up often during the night and having trouble going back to sleep.\n- Not feeling rested or refreshed from a night’s rest.\n- Waking up too early in the morning.\n- Daytime problems with fatigue, sleepiness, moodiness, lack of focus, clumsiness or accidents while at work or driving.\nInsomnia can vary in duration and frequency and may either be short-term (acute insomnia) or long-term (chronic insomnia). It can also be intermittent, with extended periods of time where a person experiences no sleep problems. Acute insomnia may last from one night to a few weeks. Experiencing insomnia consistently at least three nights a week for thirty days or more would be considered chronic insomnia.\nInsomnia is often treated with a combination of sedative hypnotics (sleeping pills) and a behavioral program called cognitive behavioral therapy. If you think you have acute or chronic insomnia, talk to your health care provider, and ask to be referred to our sleep center for special tests.\nInterrupting a person’s breathing during sleep is considered a serious sleep disorder. Untreated, sleep apnea may stop breathing repeatedly during a person’s sleep as often as hundreds of times during the night.\nOf the two types of sleep apnea, obstructive and central, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the more common of the two. OSA is caused by a blockage of the airway, causing a temporary cessation of breathing, usually as a result of soft tissue in the rear of the throat collapsing during sleep. These brief obstructions result in many sleep interruptions each hour, drastically affecting the quality of sleep. Since these interruptions are rarely remembered, sleep apnea sufferers are often unaware of the cause of their symptoms. OSA may cause daytime drowsiness, increased irritability or depression, decreased concentration, reduced work productivity and even frequent accidents or mishaps, including serious traffic accidents. Loud, consistent snoring is a hallmark of obstructive sleep apnea as well.\nDuring central sleep apnea, the airway remains clear and unblocked. The brain, however, fails to signal the muscles to breathe properly due to instability in the respiratory control center. It is called central sleep apnea because it results from a failure in the function and communication of the central nervous system.\nDue to the debilitating effects of this disorder, if you believe you, a friend or family members suffers from these symptoms, consult your primary physician, or schedule a consultation with Mountain View Sleep Lab.\nRestless leg syndrome (RLS) is characterized by tingling, pulling, creeping, or painful sensations in the legs at night. This sensation is brought on by resting such as lying down in bed, sitting for prolonged periods such as while driving or at a theater. The aching may also be accompanied by periodic limb movements that may continue for minutes or hours. RLS typically occurs in the evening, making it difficult to fall asleep.\nSnoring happens when you are unable to move air freely through your nose and mouth during sleep. Many factors, such as the anatomy of your mouth and sinuses, alcohol consumption, allergies, a cold, and your weight can lead to snoring. It is normally caused by a narrowing of your airway, resulting from poor sleep posture or abnormalities of the soft tissues in your throat. A narrow airway gets in the way of smooth breathing and creates the sound of snoring.\nAs you progress from light to deep sleep, the muscles in the roof of your mouth (soft palate), tongue, and throat relax. The tissues in your throat can relax enough that they partially block your airway and vibrate. And, the more narrowed your airway, the more force required to flow air. This increases tissue vibration and consequently raises the volume of snoring.\nCommon causes of snoring:\n- Your Age. As you reach middle age and beyond, your throat becomes narrower, and the muscle tone in your throat decreases.\n- Your mouth anatomy. Men usually have narrower air passages than women and are more likely to snore. A low, thick, soft palate can narrow your airway or an elongated uvula obstruction may cause increased vibrations.\n- Alcohol consumption. Snoring also can be brought on by consuming too much alcohol before bedtime. Alcohol relaxes throat muscles and decreases your natural defenses against airway obstruction.\n- Being overweight or out of shape. Excess fatty tissue and poor muscle tone contribute to snoring.\n- Nasal and sinus problems. Blocked airways such as deviated septum make inhalation difficult and create a vacuum in the throat, leading to snoring.\n- Sleep apnea. Snoring also may be associated with obstructive sleep apnea. In this serious condition, your throat tissues partially or completely block your airway, preventing you from breathing. Sleep apnea often is characterized by loud snoring followed by periods of silence when breathing stops or nearly stops. Eventually, this reduction or pause in breathing may signal you to wake up, and you may awaken with a loud snort or gasping sound. You may sleep lightly due to disrupted sleep. This pattern of breathing pauses may be repeated many times during the night.\n- Sleep posture. Sleeping flat on your back causes the flesh of your throat to relax and block the airway.\nNarcolepsy is a neurological disorder that affects the control of sleep and wakefulness. People with narcolepsy experience excessive daytime lethargy and intermittent, uncontrollable episodes of falling asleep. These sudden sleep attacks may occur during any activity at any time of the day during mid-sentence, while at work, or possibly behind the wheel of a car. Other symptoms of narcolepsy include the sudden loss of muscle tone while awake when surprised or upset, vivid hallucinations as they fall asleep, and sleep paralysis, a condition where normal paralysis of large muscles during REM sleep fails to end upon waking.\nNarcolepsy usually begins between the ages of 15 and 25. However, it can become apparent at any age and appears to run in families.\nSymptoms and diagnosis:\nSince the symptoms of narcolepsy can be found in several other conditions, including obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), accurate diagnosis is critical. Many researchers now believe that narcolepsy is caused by the lack of receptors for the neurotransmitter hypocretin, which regulates the sleeping and waking states. If you believe you or someone you know suffers from narcolepsy, talk to your health care provider, and ask to be referred to our sleep center for special tests.\nSleepwalking is mostly common in children and tends to occur within an hour or two of falling asleep and may last on average between 5 and 15 minutes. While the child’s brainwaves are in those of a deep sleep, the sleepwalker moves as though awake. The sleepwalker usually has no recollection of the event the next morning.\nSleepwalking occurs in more than 10% of children, however, most will outgrow it. It also appears to be genetics. Sleepwalking episodes may be triggered by fever or some medications, unpredictable sleep schedules, sleep deprivation, and stress.\nThe child’s safety during these episodes is the primary concern. Parents should ensure that doors and windows are locked and that no obstructions could cause a fall or other injuries. When a child is sleepwalking, gently guide the child back into bed. Don’t try to awaken them.\nCPAP is considered the best sleep apnea treatment. However, CPAP is not the only sleep apnea treatment. There are three other options to treat sleep apnea. Depending on the individual's anatomy, and unique set of conditions, one of these other options may prove to be optimal.\nContinuous positive airway pressure therapy (CPAP) requires the use of a machine to help a person breathe more easily during sleep suffering from obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). A CPAP machine creates increased (positive) air pressure in your throat preventing your airway from collapsing while breathing during sleep. The use of a CPAP will likely help your bed partner sleep better, as well.\nTypically once you begin the use of a CPAP, it will be every night. A CPAP machine will normally be one of the following types:\n- A mask that covers your nose and mouth.\n- A mask that covers your nose only: nasal continuous positive airway pressure, or NCPAP.\n- Prongs that fit into your nose.\nThere are a few types of surgeries for the treatment of sleep apnea. The most popular is Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP). A UPPP procedure involves the surgical trimming (shortening) of the uvula dangling in the back of your throat and the floppy tissue on either side of it. After removing this excess floppy tissue the airway is able to move air freely with less chance of collapsing. If UPPP is successful there normally is no need for a CPAP machine, and the need to carry it with you at all times. Unfortunately, UPPP has a success rate of only 30% to 50% and often it is not effective enough to cure severe cases of sleep apnea.\nOral appliance therapy involves the use of a dentist who specializes in oral appliance therapy for sleep apnea, taking impressions of your teeth, and custom fitting a plastic device that fits tightly on the upper and lower teeth. This device “juts” the lower jaw forward during sleep. By pulling the jaw forward, the tongue is moved forward and is pulled away from the back of the throat, opening the airway and decreasing the probability of airway collapse.\nThey are convenient, easy to travel with, and do not require the use of an electrical receptacle. Unfortunately oral appliance therapy is limited in how far it can pull the jaw forward before leading to temporomandibular joint problems (jaw joint). Therefore it is only considered effective for mild to moderate cases of sleep apnea.\nMedical management primarily consists of three techniques: weight loss, avoiding certain medications, sedatives, avoidance of alcohol prior to sleeping or as a sleep aid, and positional therapy (sleeping on your side or with the head of bed elevated). Depending on the root cause and the severity of OSA symptoms, medical management may not have a significant enough impact on sleep apnea to be a reliable treatment option.\n- Weight loss or management is a healthy thing to do, in general. Alone, it often does not have enough impact on sleep apnea to be a reliable treatment option. For some very overweight patients with only mild sleep apnea, significant weight loss may be enough. However, someone with severe sleep apnea whoich is only moderately overweight, weight loss alone may not be a viable sleep apnea treatment.\n- Alcohol and sedating medications can aggravate make sleep apnea worse. However, it is rarely the sole cause of sleep apnea.\n- Positional therapy can be helpful for some patients, but in general moderate to severe cases of sleep apnea do not respond.","If an internet search is performed using the string ‘snoring’ or ‘obstructive sleep apnoea / apnea (OSA)’ you will be swamped with treatment options for these two conditions that range from pillows, nasal sprays, breathing exercises, weight-loss pills, over the counter nose strips, and meditation CD’s, to the more scientifically and researched evidence-based treatments such as Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP), mandibular advancement appliances, and surgery.\nThe treatment of snoring and Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA) is not performed in a ‘One Stop Shop’ or by purchasing a product from the Internet. It is often a condition that occurs from a multifactorial cause i.e. from a combination of weight gain, genetics, throat tissue architecture, nasal obstructions, diet, allergies, medical conditions, and so forth. Therefore, in many cases, only addressing one of the causes is not enough to treat the snoring or OSA. Often, a combination of treatments is required to achieve maximum medical improvement of a person suffering from a sleep disorder.\n“There ain’t no way to find out why a snorer can’t hear himself snore.”\n– Mark Twain\nOral Sleep Appliances\nThe use of oral appliances to hold the mandible (lower jaw) forward during sleep for the treatment of snoring and mild to moderate OSA is a scientifically proven and effective method. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) recently reviewed its 1995 practice parameter guidelines on the use of Oral Appliance Therapy (OAT) recommending it as a first line of treatment in specific circumstances of Snoring and OSA. These updated guidelines by Kushida et. al. appeared in the February 2006 issue of the journal Sleep.\nAlthough they may not always be as efficacious as CPAP for severe OSA, according to these guidelines, for patients with snoring or mild to moderate OSA, those who cannot tolerate CPAP, fail treatment attempts with CPAP, are unwilling to use it, or do not respond to CPAP, and those who fail treatment attempts at weight loss and changes in sleeping position, oral appliances may certainly be indicated in all of these people.\nIn more severe cases of OSA when CPAP cannot be tolerated or very high pressures are required, OAT may be used as a replacement for or in conjunction with CPAP. The decision to cease using CPAP however, and the benefits of its use compared with the adverse health effects of severe sleep apnoea should always be considered very carefully.\nHow Do Oral Appliances Work?\nOral appliances (or Mandibular Advancement Splints) are worn on the upper and lower teeth during sleep and hold the lower jaw forward thereby helping to prevent the tongue and the soft tissues of the mouth and throat from collapsing.\nBy wearing the appliance during sleep, adequate air intake occurs and helps provide normal regular sleep that is free from snoring, obstructions, and respiratory related arousals. Appliances can be used by themselves or in conjunction with other treatments such as surgery or Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) systems. Designed properly for each individual patient and their specific circumstance, oral appliances are safe, effective, comfortable, and have very few side effects.\nThere are basically two types of oral appliances on the market.\n1. Non-adjustable: These are essentially two mouthguards joined together that fit over the upper and lower teeth and hold the jaw forward in one position only. Many variations of one-piece oral appliances are available on the market and these are most often sold over the Internet or constructed by denture technicians and denture prosthetists.\nBoil & Bite non-adjustable.\n“Boil and Bite” appliances, and one-piece appliances are cheap and often the optimal position of the lower jaw is a pure guess for patients and dentists. It is these types of appliances that most of the problems with jaw joints, muscle pain, and poor efficacy result from, as fitting and function is not professionally and expertly carried out. Many people may then give up on OAT without seeking a proper assessment and appliance.\n2. Adjustable: Current research has proven that adjustable appliances are far more superior, effective, and comfortable in the treatment of snoring and OSA. The most comfortable appliances are constructed by taking impressions of the patient’s teeth and positioning the jaw forward slowly in increments until the ideal position is achieved. Often movements of only 1mm are required to bring the patient from “I am still snoring with this appliance” to “I feel great in the morning and my partner is very happy”.\nSomnomed MAS fully-adjustable. Appliances can also be constructed for patients with no upper teeth.\nAdjustable appliances also have the added benefit of protecting the teeth from bruxing and being customisable to include additional components and design for retention, tongue positioning, lip seal, and jaw joint problems. These appliances can also be used in the simultaneous treatment of severe TMD cases when the practitioner has considerable experience in this area. Dr Eldridge has successfully treated many hundreds of people with severe TMJ disorders and OSA when other specialists have told them that an oral appliance is contraindicated.\n3. Tongue Retaining Devices: These appliances are designed to allow the tongue to remain in a forward position between the anterior teeth by holding the tongue in an anterior bulb with negative pressure, during sleep. This pulls the tongue forward to enlarge the volume of the upper airway and to reduce upper airway resistance. Tongue retaining devices are used mainly for people with no natural teeth. Results vary greatly between different people due to comfort factors.\nTreatment with Oral Appliances\nOral appliance therapy for the treatment of Snoring and OSA is a very reliable and efficacious mode of therapy when carried out professionally and with expert knowledge. Initial consultations and assessments when performed properly and thoroughly take around 1 hour on average. Successful snoring and OSA treatment is typically not isolated to just mandibular advancement devices, or a ‘magic plastic cure’ using a one size fits all approach such as ‘off the shelf boil and bite’ appliances.\nSleep disorders must always be considered and assessed intimately with lifestyle issues such as diet, weight – loss and exercise, soft-tissue architecture, the temporomandibular joints, oral health, the occlusion, and general health including any existing medical conditions and medications. A working relationship therefore between Respiratory Physicians, Ear Nose and Throat surgeons, General Medical Practitioners, and a Dentist who has specific knowledge, training, and experience in treating sleep disorders is essential to successful team management of patients with snoring and OSA and returning the person a much improved quality of life.\nWhen designed and used correctly, oral appliances function by advancing the mandible and pulling the tongue off the back of the throat. Simultaneously, by advancing the mandible the muscles of the back of the throat open by tightening width ways. The result is that the tongue, soft palate, and the walls of the throat tighten and open to allow more air to enter through the nose and mouth by reducing or removing the blockage that was causing snoring and sleep apnoea.\nPatients treated with oral appliances should return at strict regular scheduled intervals to monitor patient adherence, allow adjustment of and evaluate deterioration of the appliance, and to evaluate the oral tissues, joint structures, and occlusion. Regular follow up is also needed to assess the patient for signs and symptoms of worsening OSA.\nSleep breathing disorders can contribute to severe life threatening medical complications and so it is our priority to provide you with a ‘Long-term Treatment Plan’, and not just a treatment.\nPositive airway pressure systems maintain the upper airway patency during sleep by forming a pneumatic ‘splint’. This pressure prevents the airway from collapsing by pumping air via a mask attached to the machine by a hose.\nThe constant air pressure, usually around 5-20 cmH20 (centimeters of water) is delivered throughout the breathing cycle. Most patients do well with 8-10 cmH20 air pressure. The exact pressure required for each individual patient is normally assessed in the first instance during an overnight Polysomnograph (sleep study). Newer machines are also available in auto-titrating models that allow computer-controlled pressures to be delivered that are automatically adjusted as required during sleep.\nRecent advances in masks, humidification, pressure delivery systems, and patient education have greatly improved comfort and adherence to CPAP machines and they are still rated as the most effective medical treatment for severe OSA. Long term compliance with CPAP (>5 years) remains low however, and therefore any person contemplating CPAP should trial or hire a unit for several months before committing to purchase. Places like Gumtree and Ebay are flooded with second hand CPAP units with many still brand new sitting in people’s cupboards.\nThe strategy behind surgical intervention for the treatment of snoring and obstructive sleep apnoea is to open the site of anatomical blockage. The actual blockage site however, may be in more than one place and they are typically found at the nose, soft palate, or base of the tongue. Therefore, some of the better-known procedures such as removal of tonsils, straightening a crooked septum, and trimming of the soft palate (removal of the fleshy bit of the roof of the mouth – UPPP) are routinely carried out.\nOther less well known techniques may also be employed such as enlargement of the breathing space behind the tongue, implants into the soft palate, surgical advancement of the mandible or maxilla (lower or upper jaw), or an operation directly on the tongue tendons or the tongue itself. Recent advancements in tongue coblation surgical techniques have helped many people where reduction of the size of the tongue is required to treat OSA.\nSurgical techniques are:\n– Rhinoplasty, Septoplasty, and Turbinectomy or submucous resection of the turbinates.\n– Adenoid and Tonsillectomy.\n– Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP).\n– Somnoplasty, tongue coblation surgery, and Pillar-palato implants.\n– Genioglossus advancement.\n– Hyoid Suspension.\n– Maxillo-mandibular advancement.\nThe majority of these surgical techniques are carried out by an Ear, Nose, and Throat surgeon (ENT), whilst an Oral and Maxillofacial surgeon will perform the jaw advancement surgery. In many cases, surgery alone will not provide complete relief from snoring and OSA symptoms but is often required as a very important part of a comprehensive treatment plan."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:9a09225d-c350-46b6-9755-d5c7d75477d3>","<urn:uuid:1cebd980-c482-4de6-8505-12aa844bcdea>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What's the connection between successful urban placemaking and modern computational design tools in creating sustainable cities? 🌆","answer":"Successful urban placemaking relies on five key elements: context integration, gateway connections, spatial layout design, land use distribution, and landscape treatment. The spatial layout is particularly crucial as it's the most permanent and expensive to alter, carrying major services like energy and water. Modern computational design tools, particularly AI-powered platforms like Spacemaker, enhance this process by enabling architects and planners to simulate and analyze factors like sunlight and wind flow, generate multiple site planning options, and optimize building performance. These tools allow for fact-based discussions early in the process and help create more sustainable developments through features like daylight optimization and passive airflow analysis.","context":["We are what we street. The elements of successful #urban placemaking\nPART ONE – THE ELEMENTS OF SUCCESSFUL URBAN PLACEMAKING\nHow the site fits into its context, including complementary and competitive attractions; in other words, what else is nearby to which the design should respond? The success of any development, no matter how large, is a function of the wider setting.\nThe specific points at which connections can be made into this context, including public transport connections; in other words the “gateways” into the design.\nThe spatial layout design of the project itself in terms of its streets and spaces, whether public/private or open/covered, and the importance of:\n– first, encouraging through movement connections between gateways\n– second, providing a simple, intelligible internal circulation network through a grid of streets and other connections.\nThis is the most important of the five elements since the spatial layout, once created, tends to be the most permanent part of the development. It is the most expensive to alter once constructed since it sets out the footprints of buildings and, importantly, since it carries the bulk of major services such as energy, water and data supply as well as waste handling.\nThe quantum of different land use attractions and the disposition of these within the spatial layout both in two and three dimensions; in other words where uses are and how they stack up, especially the land uses that occur at street level and any other principal pedestrian levels.\nThe location of land uses should follow the hierarchy of spatial connections created by the spatial layout design, with the most movement-sensitive land uses located on the most spatially important connections and so on. This alignment of land use attraction with spatial layout attraction is a fundamental property of both historic cities and successful modern places.\nHow the spatial layout is “dressed” both in terms of the “green/blue” landscape of planting and water and the “architectural” landscape of building frontages at the principal pedestrian levels.\nHere what matters is that the spatial layout is not overly fragmented or dispersed by planting and that the principal pedestrian levels are lined with open, active frontages.\nPART TWO – THE DESIGN\nThe five elements of successful placemaking establish a framework for design practice. What matters next is the way in which these generic principles are translated into a specific design proposal. This is a creative step, which relies on a blend of imagination and craft, honed by experience.\nThe challenge for future urban practice is that the five elements are not commonly appreciated in the field of retail development, which has instead adopted principles of gravitational attraction that tend to create anchored, inward-facing, covered malls rather than open, street-based shopping streets, whether we call such streets “high streets” or “souqs”.\nPART THREE – THE WAY FORWARD\nIt has been, and will continue to be, down to pioneering organisations to point out what is increasingly obvious to all but those who are too immersed in it: that anchored malls create sterile places; and then for these pioneers to deliver new places that work because they employ the timeless elements of successful placemaking.\nFortunately, this challenge is facilitated by the continued emergence of technology-based tools for analysing location, identifying points of linkage, testing different layout concepts and modelling the interaction of these with different land use and landscape treatments.","When you’re planning a new construction project—whether it’s a single building, a complex, or a whole community—there’s a lot to consider. The terrain and how to use it. Surrounding structures and how new buildings will fit in. Density, traffic, sunlight, views, and noise. Zoning codes and other regulations. Cost and schedule. And last but far from least, the project’s impact on the environment, both local and global.\nThat’s a lot to manage. How can we hope to create an “optimal” plan? At AU 2020, Autodesk announced the acquisition of Spacemaker, a start-up based in Oslo, Norway whose cloud-based AI platform enables architects, developers, and city planners to generate, evaluate, iterate, and optimize site planning options during early-stage design.\nThis use of generative design in the early site design process opens important new possibilities for the AEC industry, enabling us to create buildings and communities that are better for people and the planet. It can help optimize building height, materials, environmental impacts, and much more.\n“Spacemaker stands out in terms of applying cloud computing, artificial intelligence, [and] data science, to really helping people explore multiple options and come up with better decisions,” Autodesk CEO and President Andrew Anagnost said in a recent TechCrunch piece.

{"question":"How do security arrangements in the Asia-Pacific region compare to NATO's structure?","answer":"The Asia-Pacific security arrangements, while appearing looser than NATO's structure, actually have two key advantages. First, they can expand more easily without institutional hurdles, as demonstrated by arrangements like AUKUS between Australia, the UK, and the US. Second, these flexible arrangements allow countries to cooperate despite fundamental disagreements - for example, the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue functions well despite India's different approach toward Russia. Unlike NATO's formal membership structure, the Asia-Pacific system features strategic ambiguity in its security guarantees, making it more adaptable to regional complexities.","context":["Conflict in Two Theaters?\nRussia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine is being heralded as a moment of strategic clarity for Europe about the return of revisionist power politics. While the immediate neighborhood remains the main concern, European strategists are worried about a second source of risk: violent revisionism in the Asia-Pacific. The United States has already shifted its center of strategic gravity to the Pacific, but conflicts brewing there also require a European response.\n|Europe has a major stake in the stability of the Asia-Pacific region. It is therefore important for a wider European public to pay more attention to regional stakeholders.|\n|Assessing risks in the Asia-Pacific requires a careful analysis of revisionist signaling, regional security arrangements, and the role of middle-sized powers. European experiences and parameters do not fully apply|\n|This paper draws on case studies of the security and defense policies of Australia, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. All four countries shape regional security significantly by engaging in assertive defense planning and diversifying their security relations.|\n|Important European stakeholders – NATO, the European Union, individual European states – can contribute to deterring violent revisionism in the region by deepening relations with AsianPacific partners.|\nRead all Country Reports from the project here:\nIn the spring of 2022, shortly after Russia began its invasion of Ukraine, speculation arose about various “two-front” scenarios. Analysts in Europe feared that China might exploit the situation in Eastern Europe to force Taiwan into “unification,” which would draw the United States into a second conflict and also require a European response. China’s August 2022 military exercises – the largest in the Taiwan Strait since 1995/96 – have fueled such fears.\nThe Korean Peninsula makes for a second hotspot in the region: Large-scale war could erupt if the paranoid regime in Pyongyang launched a preemptive nuclear attack in response to real or imagined US attempts at regime change. On the peninsula, as in the Taiwan Strait, fundamental strategic interests are at stake – conflicts there will not stay local, but involve the United States and its regional partners as well as inflict massive damage on the global economy.\nUS President Joe Biden, who has been so explicit about not getting directly involved in Ukraine, has unequivocally stated that the United States would come to Taiwan’s defense if it was attacked by China. The reason is simple: From a US perspective, an independent Taiwan is essential to containing China and denying it direct access to the Western Pacific. This asymmetry – neither Ukraine nor Taiwan has a defense agreement with Washington, but the United States would be ready to defend the latter – reflects Taiwan’s higher strategic value.\nChina is aware of this and might be tempted to draw a simple parallel of its own from the Ukraine conflict: that raising the specter of nuclear war is a powerful tool to deter the United States from intervening in an invasion. In Pyongyang’s calculus, similarly, nuclear weapons represent the ultimate shield against any invasion. This is a problem of global consequence.\nEven without envisaging nuclear conflict, the worsening security situation in the Asia-Pacific is a difficult challenge for Europe: While Europeans continue to depend on the United States for their own deterrence and defense, they realize that the center of gravity for US and global security has shifted toward the Asia-Pacific.7 And even as Europeans are sending military support to Ukraine and stepping up on territorial defense within NATO, they find themselves under pressure to bring at least a symbolic military presence to the Asia-Pacific to signal their commitment to the Free and Open Indo-Pacific.\nAnd yet, Europeans must resist the temptation to directly apply lessons from Ukraine and the transatlantic theater to the Asia-Pacific, even if Japan’s Prime Minister Fumio Kishida warned that “Ukraine today may be East Asia tomorrow.” Fighting a war in a maritime theatre like the Asia-Pacific requires a far greater set of military capabilities and planning than does action on the European mainland. Russia was readily able to amass ground forces along its own as well as the Belarussian border with Ukraine over the course of several months. Though Chinese forces practiced the encirclement and blockade of Taiwan, they cannot easily do so under wartime conditions: Taiwan is part of the “first island chain” lining China’s coast, with US assets for military reconnaissance stationed close by. Should China bar foreign military vessels and aircraft from transiting the narrow Taiwan Strait, it would initiate war right then and there. Moreover, China may still be short of the amphibious capabilities needed to invade and conquer Taiwan.\nAs Europeans assess the risk of conflict in the Asia-Pacific, this paper aims to warn against three possible misperceptions:\n- That China and North Korea actually mean what they so loudly say;\n- That the institutions and states around them are too weak to deter them;\n- And that European engagement should focus almost exclusively on the United States.\nRevisionist Signaling in the Asia-Pacific\nChina has stepped up its signaling in sync with its mantra of national rejuvenation by 2050 – a goal that includes unification with Taiwan. Chinese aircraft conducted over 300 intrusions into Taiwan’s Air Identification Zone between September 2021 and January 2022. Similarly, China’s military exercises in August 2022 aimed to demonstrate Beijing’s „new normal” of assertiveness. North Korea, in the meantime, is making less use of its conventional forces than it used to but has accelerated its nuclear weapons and missile development campaigns. In 2022, the regime in Pyongyang oversaw a double-digit number of test events – approaching the record-setting intensity of 2016/2017 – to improve its new missile technologies.\nChina and North Korea are thus both sending loud signals of revisionism. But these must be seen in context: China’s belligerent rhetoric in large part reflects the domestic pressure under which the Communist Party is acting, with the 95th anniversary of the People’s Liberation Army in August, President Xi Jinping’s reelection scheduled for the party congress in October, and ongoing military reforms. All three elements have likely shaped the scale of China’s military exercises in August, while the visit of US Congress leader Nancy Pelosi provided a convenient smokescreen.18 China’s maneuvers in the Taiwan Strait should be seen as political signals and operational probes, not as war rehearsals. That does not mean that the risk of war is zero, but Beijing was careful to announce its military exercises well ahead of time in order to avoid misperceptions. And the United States has been careful, too, by ordering its warships to “stay on station” in the waters east of Taiwan. North Korea likes to present itself as having a strong stomach for provocations. In fact, it has been careful to manage risks – by closely controlling, for example, where its missiles land. The regime in Pyongyang has long emphasized that its nuclear weapons serve the purpose of deterrence and self-defense. Even its posture of early nuclear use and preemptive escalation mainly serves the purpose of deterrence. North Korea’s propaganda includes revisionist demands for reuniting the peninsula under Pyongyang’s rule, but given that the regime’s priority is to ensure its own survival, maintaining the status quo serves North Korea’s interests best, as it does for South Korea, Japan, and the United States.\nMilitary exercises may signal intent but should not be seen as an immediate precursor of action. In fact, neither China nor North Korea can overtly move to change the status quo without incurring immense costs. Nor would success be guaranteed. As a result, they are more likely to engage in gradual revisionism by means of cyber activities, disinformation campaigns, and coercive measures that fall short of the use of force. After all, China and North Korea are already at home in this grey zone of hybrid warfare.\nSecurity Arrangements in the Asia-Pacific\nDefense alliances contribute to deterring violent revisionism because they increase the costs of an attack and make success more difficult or even impossible. NATO security assurances are assumed to be a major factor in Russia’s decision to stop short of military conflict with the Baltic States. Following this same rationale, Australia, Japan, and South Korea are stepping up military exercises and deployments to strengthen their joint deterrence postures with the United States. Particularly Japan and South Korea seek to present the nuclear deterrence posture that Washington has extended to them as reliable.\nThe United States maintains a network of bilateral alliances and partnerships in Asia and the Indo-Pacific region. At first sight, this web of security arrangements seems rather loose, but in fact it compares favorably to NATO for two reasons. First, it has room to grow without having to overcome institutional hurdles: Just take the AUKUS arrangement, which put Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States on track to tightening their defense relations and cooperation, including the joint development of strategic assets. Similar undertakings within EU and NATO frameworks involve far more actors and bureaucracy. Second, flexible arrangements can help countries to sidestep fundamental disagreements: The Quadrilateral Security Dialogue between Australia, India, Japan, and the United States functions quite well despite India’s different approach toward Russia. The Quad recently extended cooperation to the field of maritime security and reconnaissance. Even Japan and South Korea, despite deep-seated grievances on both sides, cooperate on security.\nTaiwan enjoys the United States’ active protection against a Chinese invasion even without a formal defense arrangement. The same is true for Taiwan’s relations with its neighbors, which are also likely to come to its aid as they have a vital interest in containing China. Japan and Australia accept that there is a high probability of becoming entangled in any conflict in the Taiwan Strait, given the US military assets deployed in both countries. Furthermore, Japan is worried that China could attack its remote Okinawa islands because of their proximity to Taiwan. In contrast, the majority of US forces in South Korea would probably remain stationary to be available for contingencies on the Korean peninsula. Unlike a formal membership body like NATO, there is no hard dividing line in the Asia-Pacific between those who are protected and those who are not. Strategic ambiguity is a feature, not a bug.\nThe Importance of Regional Players\nIn this web of relations and absence of clear obligations, each protagonist – however small – has the potential to spoil regional security arrangements, as the Solomon Islands’ cooperation with China illustrates. But China, too, is struggling with the potential of countries in the region to spoil its plans. China is surrounded by frenemies – part friends, part enemies. Countries like Australia, Japan, and South Korea are engaged in a tug of war with China, wishing, on the one hand, to maintain good commercial relations with Beijing while trying to safeguard their economic and military security on the other hand. Moreover, Australia, Japan, South Korea, and Japan play an increasingly important role for security and defense in the region as they expand their military capabilities and step up on expenditure, planning, and posture. This is why the DGAP commissioned detailed reports on all four countries, with very short summaries presented here:\nAustralia is embracing its role in regional security. Canberra has shifted its focus back to territorial defense since 2016 because of two insights: First, Australia’s traditional advantage of being located at great distance from any potential adversary is being eroded by technological progress in weaponry; and second, China’s assertiveness and military modernization now pose a direct threat to Australia. As a result, Canberra is acquiring strategic assets for deterrence and reconnaissance. It is also fostering local manufacturing capabilities and diversifying its defense relations.\nJapan is grappling with its frontline status vis-à-vis China, North Korea, and Russia. The government appears set to transition the country toward a more assertive defense and deterrence posture as the ruling party’s proposal to build up capabilities suitable for counterstrikes against an enemy’s military assets illustrates. While close cooperation with the US defense industry remains crucial, Japan is pushing for more jointly developed and domestically produced systems. It is also diversifying its defense relations within the region.\nSouth Korea is making headlines as a rising global arms exporter. Seoul has long nurtured its domestic defense industry to be able to research, develop, and manufacture a wide array of weapon systems without depending on overseas partners. Such defense industrial policies are part of South Korea’s comprehensive force enhancement and defense reform program. Seoul remains focused on North Korea as the key military threat but also looks at China when it speaks of “omni-directional challenges”. Given its location in a dangerous neighborhood, South Korea’s joint deterrence posture and defense cooperation with the United States remain crucial.\nTaiwan remains focused on preventing escalation with China, deterring Beijing from using force, and defending itself should conflict erupt. Discussions evolve primarily around what type of capabilities Taiwan should buy or develop – whether to privilege large and showy capabilities for deterrence or smaller and more mobile assets for area denial. China’s most recent military exercises are likely to push the discussion toward strengthening the country’s air defense systems as well as its coastal defense through asymmetric capabilities such as unmanned aerial vehicles.\nHow to Deal with Conflict in the Asia-Pacific\nHow best to use these country analyses? Australia, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan are key stakeholders in the Asia-Pacific. They have no interest in acting as spoilers for regional security, and they also try to keep other regional states from doing so. It is these regional stakeholders – in addition to the United States – which shape relations and thereby structures in the region. Each of the four is walking a tightrope vis-à-vis China in order to safeguard its national security interests, which makes for a complex web of economic, military, and political interests. So what can Europeans, given their limited resources and focus on the conflict in Europe, do to support stability in the region?\nFirst, European governments need to dial down their military signaling. Joining exercises in the region invites counter-signaling and is counterproductive if the objective is to reduce the risk of conflict and maintain relative stability within the Asia-Pacific region. Instead of engaging in military symbolism, Europe should call China out on the challenges it poses, as was done in NATO’s latest Strategic Concept. A similar approach should be chosen for the threats issued by North Korea. This will prove more helpful, particularly if combined with leaving the door open for constructive engagement. To that end, Europe should also suggest measures that facilitate crisis communication and reduce risks of escalation.\nSecond, European governments need to deepen their economic and diplomatic relations with Asian-Pacific states. Interconnectedness helps both groupings of US allies to reduce their dependence on China. It will also protect them against the use of economic leverage and provide some deterrence against actual use of force. While closer relations do create risks for European governments, making an active decision to embrace these stakes – rather than sending the occasional frigate or Eurofighter to the Pacific – increases the credibility of Europe’s commitment to stability in the Asia-Pacific. NATO is already planning to increase issue-specific cooperation with its Asia-Pacific partners. The EU can similarly expand its bilateral cooperation with Australia, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan on issues like the use of hydrogen energy, climate resilience, and cyber security.36 It could also engage its partners in an exchange on the risk of conflict and other aspects of military security. Individual European states can follow suit. Finally, it would be desirable to also involve private actors for multi-stakeholder exchanges on science and technology.\nThird, Europe’s stakeholders – its governments and international bodies – need to engage in contingency planning. They should consider how conflict in the Asia-Pacific could erupt, how it could escalate, and how NATO, the European Union, and individual European states would react. As with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, policymakers in Europe need to consider deterrence failure and escalation in the Asia-Pacific. European stakeholders can harness their existing presence in the region and expand relations to other states in the region in order to update their situational awareness. Until now, Europeans have largely held this conversation amongst themselves and, within NATO, with the United States. A multi-stakeholder approach to scenario building and wargaming will allow for more complexity and help Europe’s understanding of the conditions and repercussions of conflict in the Asia-Pacific.\nABOUT THE PROJECT\nThe DGAP’s project on “Risk Reduction and Arms Control in the Asia-Pacific Region” aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the security dynamics in the Indo-Pacific and East Asia, with a focus on important players including Australia, China, Japan, North Korea, Russia, South Korea, Taiwan, and the United States. The objective is to foster understanding in Germany and Europe of the risk of conflict in the Asia-Pacific and suggest possible steps to mitigate this risk and safeguard stability in and beyond the region. The project starts with taking stock of security developments in the Asia-Pacific.\nAll information and country reports can be accessed at https://on.dgap.org/3f35EBO.\nThis Policy Brief was published on September 19, 2022 in the project “Risk Reduction and Arms Control in the Asia-Pacific Region”.

{"question":"Could you explain the role of composting in reducing environmental waste and its specific requirements for pathogen control in animal carcass disposal?","answer":"Composting plays a dual role in waste reduction and pathogen control. For environmental impact, composting helps reduce landfill waste since organic food waste comprises 20-30% of US garbage. In terms of pathogen control, particularly for animal carcass composting, specific conditions must be maintained: a carbon to nitrogen ratio of 25:1 to 30:1, moisture content of 50-60%, and temperatures between 43-65°C. When properly conducted, the composting process eliminates most pathogens and reduces levels of spore-forming bacteria, prions, and viruses, though additional research is needed on spore-forming bacteria and prion agents' fate in carcass composting.","context":["by Saffyre Falkenberg\nWhat is compost? Compost is decomposed organic matter that gardeners can add to their garden soil. This organic matter brings a whole host of benefits to a home garden, providing valuable nutrients for growing plants and adding additional structure to the soil. The structure that compost provides helps the soil retain moisture and enables the roots of the plants to grow stronger and more quickly.\nThe Environmental Protection Agency recommends composting at home, as organic food waste makes up approximately 20 to 30 percent of the garbage in the United States. By composting organic materials instead of throwing them away, you can keep waste out of landfills.\nCompost is a vital ingredient in any home garden, and fall is the perfect time to begin building a compost pile for next year’s soil. Creating a fall compost pile will enable the organic material to decompose by the spring planting season. This way, you will have compost ready and waiting when you begin your spring garden. Having compost ready saves valuable time and will increase the health of your plants. Additionally, composting in the fall is easy, as the season brings plenty of beneficial ingredients for nutritious compost.\nLeaves are probably the most obvious source for a fall compost pile because of their sheer abundance. When composting leaves, make sure to shred them finely so they will decompose faster. Whole leaves will end up sticking together and can take up to a year to fully decompose. If you don’t have access to a shredder, a lawnmower will do just as well. Simply run over the leaf pile a few times in order to achieve finely shredded, compostable leaves.\nWhile any leaves will work in a fall compost pile, some types of leaves are especially beneficial. The leaves from wild cherry, ash, beech, maple, and fruit trees are the best options for a fall compost system. Although oak leaves will work, be careful not to use too many, as they will make your compost more acidic. If you happen to have an overabundance of oak leaves, make sure to use that compost with plants that love acid, such as strawberries and blueberries.\nOne of the easiest ways to begin a fall compost pile is to add the waste from your garden as it dies out for the winter. Acceptable waste materials include the leaves, stems, and roots of your annual plants. As with fallen leaves, make sure to shred any garden waste before composting it in order to speed up the decomposition process. Avoid using any plant remains that look diseased, as they could ruin your entire compost pile by spreading the disease to your garden next year.\nWhile any annual plants will work for composting, certain plants act as exceptional sources of nutrients. These plants include corn, green beans, and pumpkins. Do not compost your leftover tomato plants or tomatoes, however. The chance for disease with composting tomatoes is too great, and tomatoes bring too many extra seeds into the mix.\nTo make a good compost, you will need a mixture of both brown and green materials, Brown materials contain carbon, while green materials contain nitrogen. Both of these chemicals are necessary to the decomposition process.\nGrass clippings from fresh, green grass provide a valuable source of nitrogen that will help your compost break down. If you allow your grass to dry out before composting it, then it becomes a source of carbon instead of nitrogen. Either way works for a compost pile, depending on the other ingredients you’ve included. Make sure the clippings you use for compost come from grass that has not been treated. Grass treated with herbicides and then made into compost can be detrimental to a growing garden.\nAs the days and nights get colder while the crisp autumns transition to cold winters, everyone loves a nice, warm fire. If you have a fireplace or even a wood-burning stove, save the ash when you clean it out. The ash from wood makes a great ingredient in a compost pile because it adds carbon. Make sure to only use ash burned from clean materials, and avoid using the remnants from chimney sweepings. To add the ash to your compost pile, sprinkle it around in order to prevent clumping.\nFood waste from holidays such as Thanksgiving can go right into the compost heap. Many classic celebratory dishes require ingredients that produce waste perfect for composting. Go ahead and save those carrot and potato peels, eggshells, celery tops, broccoli stems, apple cores, tea bags, and coffee grounds. This abundance of holiday waste can be put to great use in your compost pile instead of taking up space in your garbage can. If you can, make sure to chop these ingredients very finely before adding them to the compost heap. As with other materials we’ve discussed, the more finely the ingredients are chopped, the faster they will decompose. All of these ingredients will provide beneficial nutrients that will help your futures gardens grow strong and healthy.\nCompost is a necessary aspect to maximize any home garden. Not only does compost help the environment by cutting down on food waste, compost provides nutrients and structure to the soil that helps plants grow. Fall is the perfect time of year to begin composting, as there are plenty of natural ingredients available that enable you to have compost ready to use in next year’s garden. Adding leaves, garden waste, grass clippings, wood ash, and waste from holiday ingredients can create a compost pile ideal to help your garden thrive.\nWant to learn more about creating fall compost for the New Year?\nEPA covers Composting at Home\nOld World Garden Farms covers How To Create A Great Fall Compost Pile For Next Year’s Garden\nEarth Easy covers Autumn Composting Tips\nBurpee covers Easy Fall Composting\nOld World Garden Farms covers Composting Leaves – 4 Simple Tips To Making Great Compost With Leaves\nGardening Know How covers Grass Clipping Composting: Making Compost With Grass Clippings","|Berge, Anna Catharina - WASHINGTON STATE UNIV|\n|Glanville, Thomas - IOWA STATE UNIV|\n|Klingborg, Donald - UNIV OF CALIFORNIA|\nSubmitted to: Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association\nPublication Type: Peer Reviewed Journal\nPublication Acceptance Date: November 11, 2008\nPublication Date: January 1, 2009\nRepository URL: http://hdl.handle.net/27173\nCitation: Berge, A.B., Glanville, T.D., Millner, P.D., Klingborg, D.J. 2009. A review of methods and microbial risks associated with composting of animal carcasses in the United States. Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association. 234:47-56. Interpretive Summary: Most livestock and poultry production operations result in few mortalities, particularly with young animals or birds. In cases of epidemics or adverse weather, large numbers of mortalities may occur within a short period of time. Whatever the cause or extent, all mortalities must be managed to reduce pathogens and their spread, to protect the environment, and to reduce negative aesthetic impacts. Typical options for dealing with carcasses have included: Rendering, Composting, Incineration, Landfilling, and Burial (in soil or pits). The latter three options are increasingly limited. Furthermore, in situations involving catastrophic mortalities, existing rendering capacity may be exceeded. For these reasons, carcass composting, when properly conducted, has been used in many places in the U.S. to successfully manage on-farm animal mortalities. Carcass composting differs from composting manure and green waste because carcasses are typically composted whole and piles are not turned until self-heating has subsided. The overall strategies for constructing and managing carcass compost piles are described in this report. Based on extensive published results from livestock and poultry carcass composting studies, it is clear that proper composting eliminates most pathogens and reduces the number of spore-forming bacteria, prions, and viruses. The disinfection capacity of carcass composting helps protect public health and the environment by substantially reducing the pathogen load in material that is ultimately land applied. This is an important element in reducing the source of food and water contamination. Soil contaminated with pathogenic bacteria from improperly managed mortalities may contaminate water sources or runoff from pastureland. A risk assessment approach which includes all stages of disposal of animal mortality, such as handling, transportation, processing, storage and disposal, would provide a useful perspective for decision-makers who want to compare composting with other means of mortality management. The information in this report will help inform livestock and poultry producers, scientists, regulators, and others interested in evaluating the use of carcass composting as an animal mortality management and carcass/bedding disinfection tool.\nTechnical Abstract: Animal carcass composting for both routine and emergency management of food animal mortalities is an alternative method of carcass disposal in those situations where conventional methods are inadequate. Carcass composting has been referred to as ‘above ground burial in a bio-filter with pathogen kill by high temperature.’ In most composting systems a carbon to nitrogen ratio of 25:1 to 30:1, moisture content of 50-60 percent and a temperature in the range 43-65°C are considered optimal for supporting the performance of the microorganisms that drive the composting process. Carcass composting differs from composting other materials such as manure and green waste and present some unique challenges. Carcasses are typically composted whole and do not present uniformly chopped substrate for microbial action, nor are these compost piles turned as frequently. Both of these factors contribute to a non-uniform compost composition at the end of the process. While allowances for this non-uniformity need to be made in the criteria, it has been demonstrated that well designed carcass compost systems with proper maintenance and monitoring do result in a safe and efficient method of disposing of animal mortalities with minimal environmental impacts. Studies demonstrate proper composting eliminates most pathogens and reduces spore-forming bacteria, prions and other selected pathogen levels. Additional studies are needed to determine the fate of spore-forming bacteria and prion agents in carcass composting. Regulatory agencies are encouraged to evaluate carcass composting by using a risk assessment approach which includes all stages of disposal of animal mortality, such as handling, transportation, processing, storage and disposal. Risk comparisons need to account for the sum of risks from the point of death to sequestration or destruction of potential animal mortality threats associated in the various disposal systems under consideration."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"advanced_reasoning"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:823cc7a8-0ddc-4534-b59f-8e412f35f007>","<urn:uuid:5cca6571-a099-4b5e-b673-55370cdeac1a>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How does the adoption of online grocery shopping technology compare to food subscription services in terms of convenience and cost effectiveness?","answer":"Online Grocery Shopping (OGS) services enable customers to purchase groceries online from supermarkets, offering various benefits despite low adoption rates in some regions. In contrast, food subscription services provide a different type of convenience by delivering pre-portioned ingredients or prepared meals directly to customers' homes. While OGS focuses on traditional grocery shopping translated to digital format, food subscription services cost about $10 per meal, which is more expensive than traditional home-cooking (which can cost as little as one or two dollars per serving). However, both services aim to save time on meal planning and grocery shopping. Food subscription services offer additional benefits like precise portion control and step-by-step recipe instructions, but come with concerns about packaging waste and environmental impact from delivery.","context":["The Intention to Adopt Online Grocery Shopping: Extending Technology Acceptance Model\nKeywords:technology adoption, compatibility, social influence, risk, TAM\nThe purpose of this paper is to study factors affecting customer intention to adopt Online Grocery Shopping (OGS) technology. OGS is a service provided by supermarket which enables customers to purchase groceries online. While OGS services offer various benefits, the adoption in Indonesia is still low. The proposed model is developed by extending Technology Acceptance Model with compatibility, visibility, social influence and perceived risk. The model is evaluated using partial least square structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) based on 108 valid data collected from supermarket customers. The findings show that the customers’ intention to adopt OGS is significantly affected by perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. Based on total effect analysis, it was found that the intention to adopt OGS is determined by compatibility, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, social influence and perceived risk.

They are intended to help you plan and prepare meals at home with ease by providing all of the ingredients and instructions you need to prepare a complete meal.\nIn some cases you can follow along and cook the recipe yourself, while other subscriptions provide entirely premade meals. Ideally, this could cut down on the time you spend planning and shopping for your meals, as well as help you to make healthier choices.\nWhile food subscriptions are relatively recent, they have been quickly growing in popularity. Many companies across the U.S. now offer their own versions of this service. Subscribers can make selections for their dietary and health preferences, as well as choose options suitable for families with children. However, this meal planning approach is not always suitable for everyone. The expense, the potential environmental impact and other factors could turn you away from the idea. Make sure to consider all the pros and cons of these services before deciding if they could work for you.\nEach meal subscription service requires you to sign up on a website or app. To get you started, many offer a free or discounted trial before you commit to a full subscription. When you are ready to sign up, you get to choose the plan you want, depending on your dietary or palate preferences. For example, you might select an option such as vegetarian, vegan or child-friendly. Certain food preferences such as a particular cultural cuisine may also be available.\nDifferent services offer a variety of weekly plans to choose from based on the amount of meals you want to purchase. Some might bring you meals for the entire week, while others provide an option for meals every two or three days. The delivery may depend on the available schedule.\nRelated article: Improving Energy Efficiency in the Kitchen\nThe food will be delivered to you in the freshest and most convenient way possible. Refrigerated items should arrive in a cool box. For meal preparation kits, every ingredient is divided up into the amounts you will need to prepare the selected recipes. There should also be a recipe card or pamphlet with the information required to cook the meal step by step.\nThe cost of a food subscription varies depending on the service you use, though most come out to about $10 per meal. Factors such as ingredients, subscription levels and meal types can all affect the price you pay. For example, meals that have been prepared for you will cost more than meal preparation subscriptions.\nFor a meal preparation kit, all the ingredients for your meals are included, except some base items such as oil or salt. However, the cost of a food subscription plan covers more than the ingredients themselves. Depending on the service, the following may also be included:\nWhen compared to planning and preparing meals yourself, food subscription services are generally more expensive. Depending on your budget and cooking habits, one serving of a home-cooked meal could be as little as one or two dollars.\nHowever, you may also consider the cost of your time when calculating the price of a home-cooked meal. If you have to travel far to reach a grocery store, you might consider food subscription services to be more affordable. However, with other conveniences such as local grocery deliveries and online retailers, these tasks may not be as difficult as they once were. This can lessen the overall timesaving factor of a subscription service.\nAnother potential benefit to using a food subscription service is in meal planning. If you have to spend hours planning your weekly meals, or are in the habit of forgetting to purchase key ingredients, a food subscription could be a solution to your needs.\nRelated article: Tips to Save Money on Household Costs\nOn the other hand, those who use home cooking as a way to experiment in the kitchen may not enjoy the prescriptive nature of food subscription services, even those that require preparation. However, you may choose to have only a few meals a week through a subscription service, leaving the rest of the week for your own ideas. Some cooks might also like the challenge of recreating certain subscription recipes on their own.\nDining at a restaurant or getting takeout are other popular and convenient meal options. However, these are likely to be more expensive than the meal you might make with a food subscription. If you find yourself relying on restaurant-prepared food every night when you are too tired to cook, food subscriptions could be a preferable option.\nWith many of the more affordable food subscription services, you must still prepare the meal yourself. While the tasks of planning and shopping for the ingredients are taken care of for you, it might be difficult to choose a food subscription meal over takeout when you are in need of the quickest possible option.\nThose who are conscious of their health might consider food subscription to be a better alternative to eating out as well, as many of the services focus on providing healthy meals. If you do not have many healthy dining options in your area, food subscriptions could meet your needs.\nFor those who are worried about their environmental impact, it is important to weigh the benefits and drawbacks of food subscription services. While the carbon footprint of the deliveries may be a concern, for example, you should compare this to your carbon footprint when traveling to purchase the groceries yourself.\nOne downside to food subscriptions is the use of packaging. Generally, the items are pre-measured and pre-packaged. While some ingredients may require less packaging, using a subscription does mean there is more packaging involved than there would be if you purchased your ingredients in bulk.\nIt is also important to consider the problem of food waste. Food waste accounts for a large part of household waste, which contributes to your carbon footprint as well as wastes money. By having the ingredients for your meals pre-planned, you may find there are fewer items left to go bad in your refrigerator.\nRelated article: The Benefits of Making a Compost Pile"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:e7f2f93f-401d-4352-83f3-1bdfdaa92bb8>","<urn:uuid:586221bb-3b9f-4734-80ff-1028cc6c9eab>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are legal requirements for medical warnings in Texas, and what ethical concerns exist with digital health research?","answer":"In Texas, medical warnings have specific legal requirements under the learned intermediary doctrine: manufacturers must show warnings were adequate and prove that adequate warnings would have changed the physician's decision to use the device. The physician's testimony about informed consent is legally irrelevant - only their prescribing decision matters. Meanwhile, digital health research faces ethical concerns regarding privacy and regulation. Commercial health products and social media data collection operate in a largely unregulated environment, raising concerns about potential privacy breaches. Federal regulations for human subjects protection don't consistently apply to tech companies involved in biomedical research, leading to calls for common standards and federal regulations on social media data use in research.","context":["Today’s case was decided back on April 23rd, but just showed up on our radar. That made us look back to see first what we were posting about on that date (answer: Lone Pine) and second, what was the world talking about on that date (answer: Chauvin guilty verdict, surging Covid-19 cases in India, vaccinations; the DC statehood bill; and hate crimes against Asian Americans). Gutierrez v. Ethicon, Inc., 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 113262 (W.D. Tex Apr. 23, 2021) might not have made headlines like those other events/issues, but it’s a significant pelvic mesh win out of Texas and that warrants a little love from the DDL blog.\nAfter voluntarily dropping some claims, plaintiff’s causes of action could basically be divided into claims based on a (1) failure to warn: failure to warn, fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and violation of consumer protection laws and (2) design defect. Defendant moved to dismiss all claims as barred by the statute of limitations which the court denied finding a genuine issue of material fact as to when plaintiff’s cause of action accrued. Id. at *17-35. As it’s a fact intensive discussion, we will not address it here.\nDefendant also moved to dismiss both the failure to warn and the design defect claims on causation grounds. On these arguments, the court agreed with defendant. Texas has adopted the learned intermediary doctrine and in the case of a prescription pharmaceutical or medical device Texas has interpreted that to place two burdens on plaintiff. First, plaintiff must demonstrate that the warnings were inadequate. Second, plaintiff must show that had her physician received the alleged adequate warning, he would have changed his decision to use the device. Id. at *38-39. To establish the second prong, the causation prong, plaintiff in Gutierrez relied on the implanting surgeon’s testimony that had he been given additional information, he would have shared it with plaintiff as part of the informed consent process. But under Texas law, that is a “legally irrelevant point.” Id. at *47. It does not matter whether the plaintiff would have changed her mind, only whether a different warning “would have changed the decision of the intermediary to prescribe the product.” Id. at *48. On that question, the evidence was clear. Plaintiff’s surgeon testified that defendant’s device has fewer complications than other devices; that knowing what he knows today he would still prescribe the device; that he does not second guess his decision; that he would still present it as a viable option and would still do the procedure today; and that he has no reason to conclude the device is not the gold standard for treating plaintiff’s condition. Id. at *47.\nPlaintiff tried to get the court to follow the reasoning of the Fifth Circuit in McNeil v. Wyeth, 462 F.3d 364 (5th Cir. 2006) which allowed an informed consent-based way for plaintiff to prove warning causation (finding inadequate labeling could be a producing cause of injury if given more information the plaintiff would have rejected the drug). But relying on McNeil’s prediction of Texas law overlooks that subsequent to that ruling, the Texas Supreme Court decided the issue and opted not to adopt the Fifth Circuit’s interpretation. In fact, in Centocor, Inc. v. Hamilton, 372 S.W.3d 140 (Tex. 2012), the Texas Supreme Court cited McNeil as standing for a “different proposition” from Texas law. Gutierrez, at *51. As a court sitting in diversity, the Gutierrez court was obligated to follow the law as announced by the highest court in the state. Therefore, plaintiff’s failure to warn claims were dismissed. The same logic dictated dismissal of plaintiff’s fraud, misrepresentation, and consumer protection claims as they were all premised on defendant’s alleged failure to provide adequate and/or accurate information to the public. Id. at *53-54.\nTexas law forecloses the deployment of creative pleading to circumvent the learned intermediary doctrine. . . . Texas courts must discern the “gravamen” of claims to determine whether they, in truth, simply rehash failure-to-warn theories. Doing so is necessary because if the learned intermediary doctrine could be avoided by casting what is essentially a failure-to-warn claim under a different cause of action such as the DTPA [i.e., a consumer-protection law] or a claim for misrepresentation, then the doctrine would be rendered meaningless.\nId. at *54-55. Therefore, because the “crux” of plaintiff’s fraud and misrepresentation claims “is really a failure-to-warn theory, the learned intermediary doctrine applies with equal force.” Id. at *55.\nThat left plaintiff’s design defect claim. To prove this claim under Texas law, plaintiff bears the burden of proving there was a safer alternative design and that the defect caused plaintiff’s injury. Id. at *58. Texas law further requires that plaintiff prove the safer alternative design reasonably would have “prevented or significantly reduced the risk of plaintiff’s injury and that it was economically and technologically feasible at the time the product left the control of the manufacturer. Id. at *58-59. Here, plaintiff lacked the necessary case-specific causation expert evidence that a safer alternative design, in reasonable probability, would have prevented plaintiff’s injuries. Id. at *60.\nNeither of plaintiff’s case-specific experts addressed the issue. Id. at *61-64. While the reports talked about plaintiff’s injuries, there was nothing to suggest that an alternative design would have prevented or lessened those injuries. Evidence that the product injured plaintiff is not evidence that an alternative design would have prevented those injuries. Plaintiff attempted to rely on her generic experts, but\n[s]uch generalized opinions that apply to the entire MDL suit obviously do not suffice to show that alternative designs would have prevented specifically Mrs. Gutierrez’s injuries. Thus, the plaintiffs have failed to put forth evidence supporting the “necessary” showing that alternative designs could have prevented the harms to Mrs. Gutierrez.\nId. at *64. In fact, plaintiff’s case-specific expert reports point to numerous comorbidities such as age, smoking, prior surgeries, and diabetes. All factors that complicate her medical history, making proof that a different design would have led to a better outcome especially important in this case. Id. at *65.\nWith the underlying claims gone, so too go loss of consortium and punitive damages. Definitely a case worthy of the blog, even two months later.","Direct-to-consumer wellness products, location-tracking apps, and access to personal data on social networks present both exciting opportunities and significant ethical worries for researchers.\n“The digital revolution is rapidly influencing how health research is conducted. We can now passively observe and record people ‘in the wild’ and 24/7,” says Camille Nebeker, EdD, MS, founder and director of UC San Diego’s Research Center for Optimal Data Ethics.\nThe use of artificial intelligence and active assisted living robots in the health sector also is increasing. “While there is amazing potential, the digital health ecosystem is not consistently regulated. We are in the Wild West of digital health research,” says Nebeker.\nThe authors of a recent paper proposed steps the scientific community can take to ensure social media data are used ethically.1 The paper was prompted in part by the recent Cambridge Analytica scandal, involving allegations that the firm used data improperly obtained from Facebook to build voter profiles.\n“Many of my colleagues are conducting research using social media platforms,” says Nebeker, one of the paper’s authors.\nIRBs and researchers are struggling to navigate this new territory, sometimes unsuccessfully.\n“When something goes wrong, as it did with Cambridge Analytica, it compromises public trust and jeopardizes research that is in progress,” says Nebeker.\nThe following are two central ethical concerns:\n• Researchers may need to cover additional information during the informed consent process.\nCommercial products — such as fitness tracking devices — are used as measurement tools. This means privacy policies and terms of service should be considered.\n“These terms might influence the study risk assessment,” explains Nebeker. Potential research participants also need to factor in this information to make informed decisions.\n“In many cases, the terms of service directly conflict with the federal regulations for human subjects protections in that a participant, if harmed by the product, must agree to arbitration,” notes Nebeker.\n• Not all tech companies comply with federal requirements for research.\nFederal regulations for human subjects protections must be followed if research is funded by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. However, many tech companies that are involved in biomedical research are not regulated. “We need to develop common standards that govern digital health research,” says Nebeker.\nResearchers using social media data are operating in an unregulated environment. Thus, there is growing concern about potential harms. “This is another case of how technology has evolved faster than regulations,” says Sherry Pagoto, PhD, director at the University of Connecticut Center for mHealth and Social Media.\nPrivacy breaches are possible — intentional or not. “This poses risks to everyone involved: researchers, social media companies, and, most importantly, the general public,” says Pagoto.\nFor example, few Twitter users are aware that public social media posts can be used by researchers.2 Notably, the majority believe that researchers should not be able to use their tweets without consent. Also, users of commercial products do not always understand privacy implications.\n“We cannot fault them, though. These policies are very lengthy, and written in ways that are difficult to understand,” says Pagoto.\nThe following changes are needed, according to the study authors:\n• Public education on the research performed with social media data, why it is important, and how researchers protect user privacy.\n“Consultation with an expert in health tech ethics is critical if being proactive and diligent about human research protections,” says Nebeker.\nStakeholders — including researchers, IRBs, potential participants, or policymakers — may not be fully aware of how data are collected, used, or shared by social media platforms. “This lack of knowledge will influence risk assessment and information included in the informed consent process,” notes Nebeker.\n• Federal regulations on the use of social media data in research.\n“We can anticipate that the technology and research landscape will only continue to evolve, and rapidly,” says Pagoto. IRBs rely on federal regulations for guidance on the ethical conduct of research. These regulations are outdated as they pertain to the use of data generated by new technologies like social media. Thus, says Pagoto, “universities, funders, and researchers need to be more vigilant about potential harms and begin to craft guidelines for the purpose of self-policing. We need a code of conduct.”\n• “Tech ethicists” working alongside researchers as they attempt to use social media data.\nSomeone with tech ethics expertise could comment on the ethical implications specific to technology used in studies and conduct training for clinicians. “It would also be useful for these folks to advise on grant applications, even serving as consultants or co-investigators,” says Pagoto.\nSomeone on the IRB could take on this role. “But if limited expertise is available on campus, external expertise should be commissioned,” says Pagoto.\nIRBs also should have the expertise to properly review social media research. “Adequately attending to research ethics will require an investment,” says Pagoto. “We want to nudge institutions to make this investment.”\n- Pagoto S, Nebeker C.

{"question":"How do the largest stadiums en Afrique comparent-ils to recommended facility planning principles for post-event sustainability and community impact?","answer":"The largest African stadiums like FNB Stadium (94,736 capacity) and Borg El Arab Stadium (86,000 capacity) represent different alignment with sustainable facility planning principles. While these massive venues serve as cultural monuments and unifying facilities, they must carefully balance their size against the key planning principle of avoiding 'white elephant' facilities where maintenance costs exceed usefulness. Successful facilities need clear legacy plans from inception, viable long-term business cases, and flexibility to adapt to changing community needs while promoting inclusion and social cohesion. The sustainability of such large capacities depends on having strong post-event uses and community integration.","context":["Building a legacy: Designing sports facilities that serve communities for decades\nDecember 10, 2020\nDecember 10, 2020\nWhat to consider when designing infrastructure for a major sporting event—and how to make sure it flourishes afterwards\nI love the feeling in the air during a large, multi-day sporting event. There’s the anticipation of intense competition, the buzz of spectators finding their seats, the non-stop sports news coverage, the unveiling of fresh infrastructure and new sports facilities, and the excitement from athletes as they walk into a new facility and prepare to compete.\nAs a senior designer and avid cyclist—I currently serve as the Director of Coaching for Bicycle Newfoundland and Labrador, the provincial sports organization—the point about new sports facilities interests me the most. It’s fascinating to explore spaces created for a sports event. I’m looking forward to visiting the Niagara, Ontario region for the 2022 Canada Summer Games, and I’m excited for two other events closer to home on Canada’s east coast: The 2023 Canada Winter Games in Prince Edward Island, and the 2025 Canada Summer Games in Newfoundland and Labrador. I’m providing technical input on the 2025 cycling venues to ensure the optimum athlete and spectator experience.\nWhen it comes to designing new infrastructure for large sporting events like the Canada Games—or even bigger ones like the Olympics—it’s important to focus on the legacy outcomes. What impact will new infrastructure or facilities have on your area’s master planning, long-term athletic development, and the health of residents?\nI brought this thinking to my work in the Middle East a few years ago while acting as the project manager design lead for a FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022™ project, the Al Thumama Stadium and Precinct in Qatar. This 40,000-seat venue will host matches up to the quarter-final stage—and it has a strong sports legacy. After the tournament, the stadium capacity will be reduced and it will become a mixed sporting facility that features a boutique hotel and sports clinic, among other amenities.\nSo, how can you embed that idea of sports legacy into the design of your infrastructure and facilities? Here are a few pointers:\nEmbed the idea of legacy into the base build design from inception. It’s critical to have a clear idea from the outset as to how the design will actively support the transformation to a sustainable and vibrant post-event sports and recreation facility. This requires a clear understanding of the needs of the community and elite athletes.\nDesigners should be mindful to avoid duplication of facilities and seek to ensure that there is a viable long-term business case to support ongoing delivery. You don’t want to create a “white elephant” situation, where the cost and maintenance of a facility dramatically exceeds its usefulness. Unfortunately, there are well-known examples of facilities built for major sporting events—which I won’t mention here—that sit languishing, underutilized, unloved, and slowly deteriorating.\nWe know that providing accessible, easy-to-operate, and well-maintained places will get more people involved in sport.\nOnce the legacy masterplan has been decided, the design and engineering impact this has on the base build needs to be clearly established. How will the facility transform after the major sporting event, over what period, and what impact does this have on community athletics and elite sports? For example, smart engineering decisions about the structural design can be made early in the design, which enable the upper tiers to be easily demountable.\nThe overall engineering infrastructure is likely to be reconfigured to deal with different legacy sporting scenarios, including significantly reduced loads and demand. Ideally, the dismantled building elements can be repurposed in a sustainable manner. For example, the Ras Abu Aboud Stadium, a 2022 FIFA World Cup™ venue, is currently being constructed using shipping containers and removable seats. After the tournament, the venue will be dismantled, and the parts will be used for future sports events and other projects.\nIt’s also essential to test the design and identify how you’re going to manage the future construction logistics to get the redundant structure and infrastructure out of the building efficiently.\nEven with a clear legacy plan, there’s a need for the design to be sufficiently agile and flexible. The planning period for major events spans many years and circumstances, and it’s normal for requirements and expectations to change during the process. Typically, the building infrastructure is designed and committed as a base build facility, with a plan for event overlay—the temporary architectural elements added for an event—before the preceding major sporting event.\nLarge events such as the Olympics are hosted on a four-year cycle, and there’s a need to accommodate changes in regulations, threat and risk assessments, crowd management, media requirements, and lessons learned from the most recent events. This thinking is particularly appropriate to the legacy planning with facilities realized a decade or so in the future. What are the future socio-economic justifications going to be for the major-event venues that we are providing now, and how will they meet future stakeholder requirements and create more impact?\nThe current COVID-19 pandemic brings this sharply into focus. With some sporting and concert events on hold, stadiums are being repurposed to provide emergency hospitals, community facilities, and controlled social spaces. Other venues are preparing for the return of spectators and addressing issues around ticketing, transport, arrival spaces, concourse circulation, sanitary controls, and minimizing contact. What’s clear is that there’s likely to be a significant reduction in capacity, and the need for this building typology to be flexible, sustainable, and viable over the long-term is even more critical.\nThe successful reconfiguration of these spectacular sporting venues into lasting, high-quality legacy facilities can deliver increased participation in sport, healthier communities, and lasting change. My colleague Scott Klaus has written about how investments in athletic facilities improve communities—and how these facilities are a point of pride for many people. Flourishing community sports infrastructure promotes inclusion, social cohesion, and a sense of identity. Plus, it can bring significant economic benefits.\nThese beacons of sporting excellence can be a catalyst for wider community regeneration, and there are many examples of how this investment has been a key part of the strategy for urban development. For instance, the 2012 London Olympics bid was partly awarded because of the urban regeneration potential for Stratford and the Lower Lea Valley. As a result of the investment, these areas have undergone significant development building on the Olympic infrastructure—although there have been challenges in providing sufficient and suitable affordable housing as areas undergo gentrification.\nWe know that providing accessible, easy-to-operate, and well-maintained places will get more people involved in sport, inspire young people, and provide new opportunities. At the core, they are places to share experiences and athletic prowess. Embedding this thinking and ambition into projects helps long-term athlete development and ensures that the next generation of elite athletes—across Canada and the globe—will have somewhere to thrive for decades to come.\nIt’s interesting to look at previous editions of the Canada Games across the country and their resulting legacies. The City of Kamloops, British Columbia hosted the games in 1993, leaving a legacy of new and upgraded facilities valued at over C$11 million, new equipment (like kayaks, sailboats, sports medicine equipment, and more), a boost in tourism from media coverage of the Games, and strong community pride from 8,500 volunteers and staff. Stantec provided engineering services for the Canada Games Stadium and Canada Games Pool. In the years since the Games, Stantec has worked with the City of Kamloops on several exciting sports facilities that benefit athletes and their families in the community, including work on the Tournament Capital of Canada Facility, Hillside Stadium, and the McArthur Island Sport and Event Centre.\nThe most recent Canada Games, held in Red Deer, Alberta, supported C$110 million of economic activity in the province (according to the Canadian Sport Tourism Alliance), drew 26,000 visitors, and left a legacy of first-class facilities and a trained volunteer base for future events. One of Stantec’s projects for the 2019 Games, the Gary W. Harris Canada Games Centre at Red Deer College, currently has several post-Games uses, as it accommodates tradeshows and dry land events, skating, minor sport usage, and Hockey Alberta usage. It also serves as home ice for the Red Deer College Kings and Queens hockey teams.\nIn 2013, the International Olympic Committee defined legacy as the “lasting benefits which can considerably change a community, its image, and its infrastructure.” In my work on sports infrastructure design, I always keep legacy top of mind. I encourage all municipalities that are considering hosting a multi-sport event to seriously analyze the long-term impacts of that event—and to build that legacy thinking into their plan.","Top 20 Biggest Stadiums in Africa (2023)\nSports transcend just competing for laurels; it is all about passion and bringing people together to cheer in unity. Any person who is familiar with Africa, therefore, understands that the biggest stadiums in Africa are more than sports complexes; they are important unifying facilities that are necessary to hold the people together.\nDespite the apparent shortage of resources, Africa has gone out of its way to building stadiums so large that they compete with the biggest in the world. These stadiums are cultural monuments for the present time, and will certainly be objects of wonder when they are unearthed by archeologists in future ages.\nThey vary in size and design but serve the common purpose of bringing people from their individual countries, Africa, and the world at large, together to appreciate sporting greatness.\nTop 20 Biggest Stadiums in Africa By Capacity\n|1.||FNB Stadium||94,736||Johannesburg, South Africa|\n|2.||Borg El Arab Stadium||86,000||Alexandria, Egypt|\n|3.||Stade 5 Juillet 1962||85,000||Algiers, Algeria|\n|4.||Stade des Martyrs||80,000||Kinshasa, Dr Congo|\n|5.||Cairo International Stadium||75,000||Cairo, Egypt|\n|6.||Stade Mohamed V||67,000||Casablanca, Morocco|\n|7.||Tripoli International Stadium||65,000||Tripoli, Libya|\n|8.||Mogadishu Stadium||65,000||Mogadishu, Somalia|\n|9.||Ellis Park Stadium||62,567||Johannesburg, South Africa|\n|10.||Moshood Abiola Stadium Abuja||60,491||Abuja, Nigeria|\n|11.||Stade Olympique de Radès||60,000||Radès, Tunisia|\n|12.||Bahir Dar Stadium||60,000||Bahir Dar, Ethiopia|\n|13.||National Sports Stadium (Zimbabwe)||60,000||Harare, Zimbabwe|\n|14.||Moi International Sports Centre||60,000||Nairobi, Kenya|\n|15.||Tanzania National Main Stadium (Mkapa)||60,000||Dar es Salaam|\n|16.||Stade Léopold Sédar Senghor||60,000||Dakar, Senegal|\n|17.||Heroes National Stadium||60,000||Lusaka, Zambia|\n|17.||Stade Municipal de Kintélé||60,000||Brazzaville, Congo|\n|19.||Stade 19 Mai 1956||56,000||Annaba, Algeria|\n|20.||Cape Town Stadium||55,000||Cape Town, Stadium|\n|21.||Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium||52,000||Rabat, Morocco|\nDetails Of The Largest Stadiums In Africa By Capacity\n1.

{"question":"What's interesting about blood transfusions and blood types - when were they discovered and what are the risks of getting the wrong type?","answer":"Blood types were first discovered by Karl Landsteiner in 1901. Blood is classified into types A, B, AB, and O, plus Rh factors (positive or negative). If someone receives incompatible blood, their immune system produces antibodies that attack and destroy the donated blood cells, causing a hemolytic transfusion reaction. This reaction can be very serious and life-threatening. Today, blood is carefully screened and crossmatched before transfusion to ensure compatibility between donor and recipient, making severe reactions very rare.","context":["1901 in science\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n- Okapi, a relative of the Giraffe found in the rainforests around the Congo River in north east Zaire, is discovered (previously known only to local natives).\n- Publication of Robert Ridgway's The Birds of North and Middle America by the Smithsonian Institution begins.\n- Edmund Selous publishes the book Bird Watching in the U.K., giving rise to the term birdwatching.\n- May 27 – The Edison Storage Battery Company is founded in New Jersey.\n- Europium is discovered by Eugène-Anatole Demarçay.\n- Emil Fischer, in collaboration with Ernest Fourneau, synthesizes the dipeptide, glycylglycine, and also publishes his work on the hydrolysis of casein.\n- Edith Humphrey becomes (probably) the first British woman to obtain a doctorate in chemistry, at the University of Zurich.\n- December 13 (20:45:52) – Retrospectively, this becomes the earliest date representable with a signed 32-bit integer on digital computer systems that reference time in seconds since the Unix epoch.\n- August 6 – Discovery Expedition: Robert Falcon Scott sets sail on the RRS Discovery to explore the Ross Sea in Antarctica.\nHistory of Science\n- September 25 – Establishment of Deutsche Gesellschaft für Geschichte der Medizin und der Naturwissenschaften, the world's first history of science society.\n- May/June – Russell's paradox: Bertrand Russell shows that Georg Cantor's naive set theory leads to a contradiction.\n- Élie Cartan develops the exterior derivative.\n- Leonard Eugene Dickson publishes Linear groups with an exposition of the Galois field theory in Leipzig, advancing the classification of finite simple groups and listing almost all non-abelian simple groups having order less than one billion.\n- Aleksandr Lyapunov proves the central limit theorem rigorously using characteristic functions.\n- Publication begins of A Monograph of British Graptolites by Gertrude L.

The red blood cells that were given to the patient are destroyed by the patient's immune system.\nThere are other types of allergic transfusion reactions that do not cause hemolysis.\nBlood transfusion reaction\nBlood is classified into different blood types called A, B, AB, and O.\nYour immune system can usually tell its own blood cells from blood cells from another person. If other blood cells enter your body, your immune system may make antibodies against them. These antibodies will work to destroy the blood cells that your immune system does not recognize.\nAnother way blood cells may be classified is by Rh factors. People who have Rh factors in their blood are called \"Rh positive.\" People without these factors are called \"Rh negative.\" Rh negative people form antibodies against Rh factor if they receive Rh positive blood.\nThere are also other factors to identify blood cells, in addition to ABO and Rh.\nBlood that you receive in a transfusion must be compatible with your own blood. Being compatible means that your body will not form antibodies against the blood you receive.\nBlood transfusion between compatible groups (such as O+ to O+) usually causes no problem. Blood transfusion between incompatible groups (such as A+ to O-) causes an immune response. This can lead to a very serious transfusion reaction. The immune system attacks the donated blood cells, causing them to burst.\nToday, all blood is carefully screened. Modern lab methods and many checks have helped make these transfusion reactions very rare.\nSymptoms of a hemolytic transfusion reaction usually appear during or right after the transfusion. Sometimes, they may develop after several days (delayed reaction).\nThis disease may change the results of these tests:\nTherapy can prevent or treat the severe effects of a hemolytic transfusion reaction. If symptoms occur during the transfusion, the transfusion must be stopped immediately. Blood samples from the person getting the transfusion and from the donor may be tested to tell whether symptoms are being caused by a transfusion reaction.\nMild symptoms may be treated with the following:\nThe outcome depends on the severity of the reaction. The disorder may disappear without problems. Or, it may be severe and life threatening.\nTell your health care provider if you are having a blood transfusion and you have had a reaction before.\nDonated blood is put into ABO and Rh groups to reduce the risk of transfusion reaction.\nBefore a transfusion, patient and donor blood are tested (crossmatched) to see if they are compatible with each other. A small amount of donor blood is mixed with a small amount of patient blood. The mixture is checked under a microscope for signs of antibody reaction.\nBefore the transfusion is given, the health care provider will usually check again to make sure you are receiving the right unit of blood.\nGoodnough L.

{"question":"How do vitamins help maintain health, and what specific benefits does vitamin E provide?","answer":"Vitamins are essential nutrients that perform hundreds of vital roles in maintaining health, including strengthening bones, healing wounds, bolstering the immune system, converting food into energy, and repairing cellular damage. Even small deficiencies can lead to disease and illness. Specifically, vitamin E provides protection against various health conditions such as heart disease, arthritis, and cancer through its antioxidant properties. It's also believed to play a role in encouraging skin healing and reducing scarring after injuries, which is why it's commonly added to skin creams and lotions. Additionally, consuming vitamin E-rich foods can help prevent conditions like cardiovascular disease, cataracts, and impaired immune function.","context":["What are vitamins and minerals?\nVitamins and minerals are considered essential nutrients because they perform hundreds of vital roles that keep our bodies healthy. They help shore up bones, heal wounds and bolster our immune system. They also convert food into energy, and repair cellular damage.\nVitamins and Minerals are often called Micronutrients because our bodies only need tiny amounts of them however failing to get even these small quantities virtually guarantees disease and illness.\nWhich vitamins and minerals are found in Chia seed?\nChia is full of vitamins and minerals, and includes high levels of all the following:\nImportant for bone and teeth structure, helps with blood clotting and assists with cellular processes.\nInvolved in red blood cell formation and the transportation and utilisation of oxygen.\nZinc aids in the metabolism of proteins, carbohydrates and fats. It helps to heal wounds, assists the immune system and is needed for building cells.\nSelenium is a potent antioxidant that helps prevent inflammation, as well as boosting the immune system function.\nCopper is a mineral that helps the body utilise iron. It maintains the health of bones, connective tissues and skin. It also helps the thyroid gland function normally.\nManganese assists your body to utilise many key nutrients, including biotin, thiamine and vitamin C. It maintains normal sugar levels, protect cells from free radical damage and supports bone health.\nVitamin A is essential for healthy vision, but is also necessary for keeping the immune system working efficiently, maintaining skin tissues and protecting fertility.\nVitamin B1 (Thiamine) forms a co-enzyme essential for the conversion of carbohydrates into energy.\nIt is required for the conversation of carbohydrates to energy, it also promotes healthy skin and eyes as well as normal nerve functions.\nAs with all B vitamins, Niacin helps the body to convert food (carbohydrates) into fuel (glucose), which is used to produce energy. These B vitamins, often referred to as B complex vitamins, also help the body use fats and protein. B complex vitamins are needed for healthy skin, hair, eyes, and liver. They also help the nervous and digestion system function properly.\nVitamins C helps with the growth and repair of our bodies cells, promotes healthy blood vessels, gums and teeth.\nVitamin E is another nutrient that is a potent antioxidant. It protects tissues against free radical damage and it helps in normal red blood cell formation.\nFolic Acid (Vitamin B9)\nIs essential in the formation of DNA and is necessary for red blood cell manufacture.\nInvolved in the metabolism of fats, proteins and carbohydrates. It helps in the manufacture of hormones and antibodies which help fight infection.\nChia is famous for its phytonutrients, plant chemicals that contain protective and disease preventing compounds. Phytonutrients founding Chia include quercetin, kaempferol, myricetin, chlorogenic acid and caffeic acid. Their role is to protect the plant from disease, injuries, insects, drought, excessive heat, ultraviolet rays and poisons or pollutants in the air or soil. They prevent disease and have been shown to ward off at least four of the leading causes of modern death in Western countries, including cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and hypertension.Return to top of page","Function of Vitamin E:\nVitamin E is essential for it's antioxidant properties. Antioxidants are nutrients that\nprovide some protection against various health conditions such as heart disease,\narthritis, and cancer. Like other antioxidants, vitamin E blocks some of the damage\nthat is caused by free radicals. Free radicals are by-products that occur when our\nbodies transform food into energy. Antioxidants also help to reduce damage to the\nbody that is caused by toxic chemicals and pollutants such as cigarette smoke.\nCosmetic manufactures commonly add vitamin E to skin creams and lotions, because\nthey believe that it plays a role in encouraging skin healing and reducing scarring after\ninjuries such as burns.\nDeficiency of Vitamin E:\nVitamin E deficiency is common in people who are unable to absorb fat properly.\nSome conditions that inhibit proper fat absorption include, pancreatitis, cystic fibrosis,\nand biliary diseases (illnesses of the gallbladder and biliary ducts).\nSymptoms of vitamin E deficiency include loss of muscle mass, muscle weakness,\nabnormal eye movements, impaired balance and coordination, unsteady gait, and\nNote: A variety of medical conditions can lead to the symptoms mentioned above. Therefore, it is\nimportant to have a physician evaluate them so that appropriate medical care can be given.\nToxicity (Vitamin E Overdose):\nMost studies of toxicity or side effects regarding high doses of vitamin E\nsupplementation have not been adequately studied. There is concern for individuals\nwho have impaired blood clotting, because vitamin E supplementation can increase\nthe likelihood of hemorrhage. Some physicians recommend that high doses of\nvitamin E supplements should be discontinued one month before elective surgery in\norder to decrease the risk of hemorrhage.\nCaution: Eating natural foods that are high in vitamin E is the safest and healthiest\nway to get an adequate supply of the nutrient. Due to risk of toxicity, individuals\nshould always consult with a knowledgeable health care provider before starting\ndoses of supplements. Before giving supplements to children, it is recommended that\nyou first consult with their pediatrician. Also, some supplements may interfere with\nmedications. If you are taking medication, it is recommended that you consult with\nyour physician before taking any supplements. All supplements should be kept in\nchildproof bottles and out of children's reach.\nVitamin E Food Chart (List of Foods High in Vitamin E):\n*Alpha-tocopherol and Gamma-tocopherol*\nAlmonds 1 ounce - (Alpha 7.4 mg) (Gamma 0.2 mg)\nSunflower oil 1 tablespoon - (Alpha 5.6 mg) (Gamma 0.7 mg)\nSafflower oil 1 tablespoon - (Alpha 4.6 mg) (Gamma 0.1 mg)\nHazelnuts 1 ounce - (Alpha 4.3 mg) (Gamma 0 mg)\nAvocado,California, 1 fruit - (Alpha 2.7 mg) (Gamma 0.4 mg)\nCanola oil 1 tablespoon - (Alpha 2.4 mg) (Gamma 3.8 mg)\nPeanuts 1 ounce - (Alpha 2.4 mg) (Gamma 2.4 mg)\nOlive oil 1 tablespoon - (Alpha 1.9 mg) (Gamma 0.1 mg)\nCorn oil 1 tablespoon - (Alpha 1.9 mg) (Gamma 8.2 mg)\nSoybean oil 1 tablespoon - (Alpha 1.1 mg) (Gamma 8.7 mg)\nCarrots, raw, chopped, ½ cup - (Alpha 0.4 mg) (Gamma 0 mg)\nSpinach, raw, ½ cup - (Alpha 0.3 mg) (Gamma 0 mg)\nAmerican Dietetic Association: Complete Food And Nutrition Guide (2nd Edition)\nRoberta Larson Duyff, MS, RD, FADA, CFCS\nVitamins, Minerals, Herbs and More\nPamela Wartian Smith, MD, MPH\nUniversity of Maryland Medical Center - umm.edu\nLinus Pauling Institute - oregonstate.edu\nWikipedia The Free Encyclopedia\nEating foods that are high in\nvitamin E can help prevent\nconditions such as cardiovascular\ndisease, cataracts, impaired\nimmune function, and cancer.\nFoods high in vitamin E include:\nolive oil, canola oil, almonds,\npeanuts, hazelnuts, avocados,\nspinach, and carrots.\nWhat is Vitamin E?\nVitamin E, also known as\nTocopherol, is a fat-soluble\nvitamin and also an antioxidant.\n|Copyright © EveryNutrient.com\n|These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

{"question":"How do the feeding mechanisms differ between antlion larvae and monarch caterpillars in terms of their specialized anatomical features?","answer":"Antlion larvae and monarch caterpillars have vastly different feeding mechanisms. Antlion larvae possess specialized jaws with a C-shaped food canal that allows them to consume liquified prey, with upper and lower jaws that rapidly slide past each other to prevent clogging. Their jaws are designed to channel fluid meals while keeping sand out. In contrast, monarch caterpillars have three pairs of true legs on their thorax and multiple pairs of prolegs on their abdomen with tacky pads called crochets, which help them grip and move on milkweed plants while feeding on solid leaves. Their feeding is focused on consuming and processing solid plant material, specifically milkweed leaves, which allows them to grow up to 2,000 times their original mass.","context":["Sitting at the bottom of a sandy pit with only their head exposed, waiting for prey to tumble in, larval antlions (Myrmeleon crudelis) are reminiscent of a monster straight out of science fiction. Looks aside, these young antlions have a potential problem caused by their sandy surroundings: how do they consume their liquified prey without their mouthparts becoming blocked with sand? Matthew Lehnert, from Kent State University, USA, thought that parts of their jaws must naturally repel water and dirt, while other parts attract their fluid feast towards their mouth, which would allow antlions to eat without getting sand-clogged mouthparts.\nBut first, Lehnert needed to see just how the juvenile antlions fed on the pre-digested dinner. Working with Kristen Reiter, Rena Fonseca and Jordan Minninger, also from Kent State University, Lehnert videoed the antlions eating some blue-dyed fruit flies to track where the liquid meal was going; the fluid seemed to be moving up the inside of the antlions’ large jaws. Lehnert and Asheesh Lanba, Benjamin Hall and Wesley Huff, from Lasers for Innovative Solutions, USA, then used lasers to help them reconstruct the internal three-dimensional head structures and discovered a small, C-shaped canal between the upper and lower part of the jaws that fluid passes through on its way towards the mouth. To make sure that the food was passing through this ‘food canal’, the researchers placed the tip of the upper jaw at the surface of some blue-tinted water and watched as the fluid flowed up the canal like a drink through a straw.\nSurely this is how the antlions are eating, but having this canal exposed to the elements all the time could cause the canals to clog when living in such sandy conditions. Watching the videos, Lehnert noticed that the upper and lower jaws rapidly slide past one another, exposing the food canal for only short periods of time, preventing sand from getting in. This had Lehnert and the team wondering what would happen if some of the liquid food escaped the food canal and got the outside of the mouthparts wet; would they just get covered in sand?\nTo test this, Lehnert and colleagues sprayed the antlion's jaws with small droplets of water and measured how waterproof the jaws were. The researchers noticed that these appendages had a waxy waterproof coating which was causing the water to bead up along the length of the jaws. The team also noted that sand had trouble sticking to the mouthparts (only about 5% of the top jaw had sand on it) but had no problem sticking to other parts of the antlion, such as the top of its head – 45% of which got covered in sand when the researchers shook the head in the sand. The waxy coating essentially makes the mouthparts self-cleaning. And Lehnert adds, ‘Unlike other fluid-feeding insects [such as bees or flies], antlion larvae are unable to use their legs to clean their mouthparts', going on to discuss why having self-cleaning jaws is important for larval antlions.\nClearly, being a predator at the bottom of a sandy funnel comes with some challenges; and that's without factoring in the challenge of feeding exclusively on a liquid diet and the need for self-cleaning mouthparts. But larval antlions seem to have mastered this particular problem in a way that allows them to rest easy at the bottom of their pit, waiting for their next meal to come tumbling in.","Summary: Unlike many damaging caterpillars, the Monarch caterpillar's diet consists almost entirely of milkweed leaves, so they will not pose a threat to your garden or yard.\nHooray for small favors! At last a caterpillar that won't destroy my landscape plants and trees. The Monarch caterpillar eats milkweed leaves and nothing else. Farmers love having the Monarch as a guest to rid fields of the persistent milkweed plant.\nThe leaf sap of some milkweed plants contain a chemical called cardiac glycoside. This chemical is stored in the caterpillar's body. If a predator tries to attack the monarch caterpillar, it will taste this repulsive, poisonous chemical. Ingestion of the Monarch caterpillar usually results in illness.\nThe day before the monarch caterpillar emerges the egg turns black. After the caterpillar emerges from its shell, it eats it! It grows and grows during its time in the larval stage of its life, which is about 14 days. In fact, a monarch caterpillar can grow over 2,000 times its original mass! Its main responsibility\nduring this time is to eat plenty of food. This weight gain is important in determining how big the monarch will be as a full-grown butterfly. The large amount of milkweed leaves allows the insect to store a lot of lipids that are useful when it is an adult trying to survive the winter.\nA monarch caterpillar goes through five different stages called “instars.” The caterpillar grows bigger and molts its skin throughout each stage. The official term for a caterpillar's skin is “cuticle.” The caterpillar also has an exocuticle, which is a waxy substance that protects the insect from losing water.\nThe body of a monarch caterpillar is fascinating. It has three pairs of true legs connected to its thorax, and it also has a few pairs of prolegs connected to its abdomen. The prolegs have tacky pads called crochets attached at the bottom.\nMonarch caterpillar predators have a special technique for finding their prey. They observe milkweed leaves for damage giving a good indication that the Monarch caterpillar is present. However, the caterpillars also know how predators can find them, so they do a lot of moving from leaf to leaf, leaving no forwarding address.\nAnother escape tactic for the Monarch caterpillar is to use silk as a type of rope. If it senses a predator nearby, the caterpillar can crawl down to the ground by dispensing a string of silk. Like many other types of caterpillars, it will curl up into a ball and do the “play dead” routine when touched.\nA Monarch caterpillar will give off certain clues when it is ready to pupate. First, it will stop eating. Second, it will move from the milkweed leaf it was living on, moving to a safer place. Finally, it will hang off a twig or leaf in the shape of a “J”. Within a day, the monarch caterpillar will form into a chrysalis. (Interesting fact of the day: A butterfly develops from a chrysalis, but a moth develops from a cocoon.)\nBecause Monarch caterpillars have a diet that entirely consists of milkweed leaves, they will not pose a threat to your garden or yard. They are also relatively harmless to humans. These unique caterpillars grow into beautiful butterflies, so if you see them near your home, they will be fun to observe as they go through the stages of metamorphosis."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"language-ambiguous"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:4a05beaa-3e01-4ec7-8e47-8d9c5da9aa5e>","<urn:uuid:a9b521f5-9761-4b3f-a833-99eabcd130af>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How has workplace robotics safety evolved from factory settings to modern cleaning applications?","answer":"Workplace robotics safety has evolved significantly from factory settings to modern cleaning applications. Initially, robots were isolated in manufacturing roles and segregated from workers to avoid accidents. Now, with autonomous cleaning robots, new safety standards have been developed, including ANSI requirements for features like parking brakes, maximum speed limits, obstacle detection, and machine start audio signals. The evolution is driven by the need to handle more complex environments - while factory robots worked in controlled settings, cleaning robots must navigate around people and obstacles, requiring advanced sensors and navigation technology to operate within centimeters of obstacles and detect hazards like water or fallen materials.","context":["EU-OSHA BlogBack to latest posts\nThe Future of Work in the spotlight of the World OSH Day\nInspired by the ILO centenary anniversary, the world day for safety and health at work on 28 April 2019 looks to the future or work and its impact on occupational safety and health. In particular, the ILO has identified four areas: Technology, demographics, sustainable development, and work organisation.\nWe are seeing rapidly advancing technologies affect almost every aspect in the world of work. Digitalization, robotics, and the use of nanotechnology, among others, have revolutionized the workplace but have simultaneously raised serious OSH concerns.\nThe global workforce is in constant flux. In certain regions, youth populations are expanding, while in others, populations are ageing. Gender gaps in the labour market persist in both developed and developing countries, and women are more likely to work in non-standard work arrangements and in home-based platform work.\nHuman induced climate change is a major driver transforming the world of work. Air pollution from coal mining, for example, directly impacts the health of miners, but also indirectly affects workers’ health in other industries around them, as well as the general public. While the increase of green jobs and industries will promote low-carbon societies and may reduce hazardous work in traditional sectors such as mining, green jobs may also give rise to emerging and unknown risks, such as exposure to chemicals in the recycling sector.\nThe demands of an increasingly globalized world have led to a growing number of workers involved in excessive hours of work and non-standard forms of employment. The growth of the globalized platform economy has blurred the lines between home and work – on one hand reducing the stress associated with commuting and increasing self-reliance, while on the other hand, creating unique psychosocial pressures for workers attempting to balance the demands of work life and home based responsibilities.\nLike the ILO, EU-OSHA is also looking at the future of work, although this may be a misnomer as these changes are happening now. Occupational safety and health bodies and professionals have to adapt to these changes and act to ensure that the changes do not have a negative impact on workers’ health and safety.\nThis is not to say that change is only negative. Technological change may remove workers from dangerous situations, may improve job quality (by reducing the number of monotonous tasks), and can improve work/life balance (e.g. by working from home using ICT).\nLabour inspectorates may see benefits, through the effective use of aggregated data, implementing non-traditional compliance approaches, offering digital access to training (e.g. webinars), providing tools for compliance monitoring (risk assessment tools), better environmental monitoring, and improved work recording (using laptops/tablets) to record inspections.\nHowever, all too often changes in the workplace do not stop the worker from paying the price for poor prevention. This is tragic and regrettable because, as research and practice over the past century has repeatedly demonstrated, this suffering is largely preventable.\nEU-OSHA has carried out much work relating to the future of work. In particular, the Agency has been looking at digitalisation and the impact of the platform “gig” economy.\nRobotics, is a rapidly changing topic as we are now letting the robots “out of the cage”. Until recently, robots were isolated in their manufacturing role, segregated from workers to avoid accidents. Now the robot (AI) may be your boss or co-worker! This change may have a benefit to workers’ safety and health (e.g. by removing the worker from a confined or otherwise dangerous location) but also may have an impact on the psychosocial wellbeing of the worker.\nOther areas of work by EU OSHA include:\n- Performance enhancing drugs\n- Monitoring technologies\n- 3D printing\n- Nanotechnologies, and\nA more general theme that needs further investigation is the use of “big data”. This offers great potential for organisations to become more effective, but there are downsides depending on how it is used. Not only privacy issues, but there are dangers in information overload and a potential impact on critical decision-making.\nWork is ever-changing and the need to protect workers is not going to go away. The work of the ILO and EU-OSHA will continue to examine how we can gain the benefits of work without paying for it in human lives and human health.","When it comes to trends in the professional cleaning industry, robotic technology is the talk of the town. But industry robots are not an entirely new phenomenon, especially not in the workplace. They have worked alongside people in factories and warehouses for decades, and the Robotic Industries Association estimates more than 250,000 industrial robots had been installed across the United States by the end of 2017.\nHowever, while robots in the workplace aren’t new, as technology advances, we are beginning to see a greater diversity of sophisticated robotics systems. In the cleaning industry, those systems can be seen tackling monotonous or dangerous tasks in factory or large warehouse and commercial environments.\nAutonomous cleaning solutions that operate in complex environments like these regularly encounter people, obstacles, and rapidly changing conditions, and as a result, demand new and different safety standards from previous, simpler industrial robots to ensure smooth and safe operation. As managers, it’s critical to ensure employees are aware of these standards and know how they will impact staff training, responsibilities, and work environments.\nSensor Advancements Bring New Solutions\nWhile traditional industrial robots often perform monotonous tasks in unobstructed environments such as an assembly line, new self-operating cleaning machines are designed to operate in much more complex environments.\n“Robots working collaboratively with humans present a new workplace risk profile that is not yet well understood,” explained Dr. John Howard, director for the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), when the organization announced the launch of its Center for Occupational Robotics Research in 2017.\nNaturally, this new risk profile raises the stakes when it comes to safety. The presence of people, obstacles, and constantly changing conditions is a challenge, but also an opportunity to bring technology up to par with the operating conditions of autonomous cleaning solutions. The below developments in self-operating machines are helping industrial and high-traffic facilities to function more safely and efficiently:\nHazard avoidance: Advanced sensors allow self-operating cleaning machines to sense and avoid hazards such as water, expensive machinery, or materials that may have fallen somewhere other than where the self-operating cleaning machine “expects” them to be. Machine sensors can feed input into an independent safety board, thereby detecting potential hazards, overriding the machine’s intended path, and stopping an accident before it can occur.\nBetter precision: In addition to sensing and avoiding hazards, advanced sensors and navigation technology allow newer autonomous machines to operate within just a few centimeters of obstacles. This means they can work around items such as desks, retail shelving, or machinery with less risk of collision or damage to both the machine and the obstacles themselves. This navigation technology also allows autonomous machines to clean extremely closely to furniture, shelving, and other items on the floor of the spaces they are cleaning.\nEnhanced navigation solutions: Another navigation development is the option to create a cleaning path two different ways. With some machines, the operator can drive a particular path, enabling the machine to recreate that path on its own later, or the machine can run independently to determine the best path to clean a space. The more options a machine provides to detect obstacles and set cleaning paths, the better chance it has to operate safely.\nNew Safety Standards\nTechnological improvements are helping autonomous cleaning solutions operate with less risk in complex environments, but that alone is not enough to ensure safety as self-operating cleaning machines become more commonplace. Industry-wide standards are needed, and in January 2018, the first safety standard specifically targeting robotic floor treatments came into effect.\nDeveloped by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the Canadian Standards Association, the new standard requires all robotic floor care machines that are sold in the United States and Canada to live up to both the basic safety requirements of a floor care machine in addition to a standard that specifically regulates the robotic part of the machine. These regulations are required for manufacturers of robotic floor care machines that want their products to be safety certified under the new standard.\nThe new safety standard for robotic floor treatment machines will also create more transparency, especially for customers. Compliance with the standard provides peace of mind for facility service providers who might be introducing autonomous cleaning solutions into the workplace for the first time. The standard was a great step in the right direction, but the professional cleaning industry still has a long way to go before safety is the norm.\nHow Will New Robotic Safety Standards Apply to Your Equipment?\nThe new safety requirements for robotic floor treatment equipment includes machines that take on:\n- Wet or dry pickup\n- Wax application\n- Sealing products\n- Powder-based detergents or shampooing.\nThe requirements also focus on the following equipment features:\n- Parking brakes\n- Maximum speed\n- Stopping distance\n- Obstacle detection\n- Abrupt surface fall detection\n- Critical zone detection\n- Obstacle avoidance\n- Machine start audio signal.\nSignificance of Equipment Certification\nAccording to ANSI, a third-party certification “provides unique credibility” and is an independent ruling—like a stamp of approval—that the product is safe. In some markets, such as the United States, employers are legally obligated to only use third-party certified equipment at their facilities. Failing to comply can lead to product recall, market withdrawal, or fines.\nOf course, complying with legal obligations is a must. But manufacturers of autonomous cleaning solutions should want to be at the forefront when it comes to safety standards, particularly because it is their responsibility to ensure safety does not take a back seat to rapidly advancing technology. To ensure the success of autonomous cleaning solutions, safety must be a top consideration during the engineering process.\n“In general, the most effective designs and most successful companies base their products around a well-designed safety architecture that gives them flexibility to provide excellent user features without compromising safety,” said Jonathan Moore of Exida Consulting, in an article on Robotics.org.\nAs of now, the safety standard applies to the United States and Canada, but experts say that a similar standard is being developed for the European markets. Based on industry trends, these safety standards will soon be commonplace in major markets. Manufacturers that want to be on the cutting edge of technology in the professional cleaning industry should put as much stock in the safety of their autonomous cleaning solutions as they do the robotics that make them run."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:bb2df0ad-b9a3-40d8-8420-c7adc24049b8>","<urn:uuid:a613d5d8-5ba9-42b0-ae52-8183737f51d3>"],"error":null}

The rs34623097-A allele increases serum triglyceride levels by 70.1 mg/dL independent of body mass index in Tongan populations. This occurs because the A-allele reduces ADRB2 transcriptional activity, which may decrease lipolysis in adipocytes. In contrast, APOE variants (ε2, ε3, ε4) primarily affect cholesterol metabolism and transport, with different variants being associated with altered cholesterol levels and cardiovascular disease risk.

Variations in ApoE are also associated with altered odds of having Alzheimer's disease and other diseases.\nThere are three relatively common allelic variants of ApoE, as defined by two SNPs, rs429358 and rs7412 known as ApoE-ε2, ApoE-ε3, and ApoE-ε4. The proteins produced by these genes are called ApoE2, ApoE3, and ApoE4.

Note: Although ApoE status is technically defined by these two SNPs, rs429358 and rs7412, a SNP in the adjacent ApoC1 gene, rs4420638, is co-inherited with ApoE and thus often - though not completely - predictive of it.\nWord of caution to those with data from Ancestry.com: in our experience, based on data in OpenSNP and from Promethease users since 2006, Ancestry data always reports rs429358 as (T;T), even for people who's data from other sources indicates they are (C;T). Therefore, until Ancestry corrects this false negative problem, be aware that the ApoE genosets defined by the genotypes listed above (and therefore assigned by Promethease) will be inaccurate if they are based on (inaccurate) Ancestry data. Specifically, some percentage of Ancestry users who are supposedly gs246 positive (Apo-ε3/ε3) are actually either gs141 (Apo-ε3/ε4) or gs216 (Apo-ε4/ε4).\nNote: Although ApoE status is technically defined by these two SNPs, rs429358 and rs7412, a SNP in the adjacent ApoC1 gene, rs4420638, is co-inherited with ApoE and thus predictive of it, as published in the following report:\n- [PMID 17192785] The researchers found that on testing DNA samples from 1,086 well-characterized Alzheimer's disease cases, a single SNP (rs4420638) lying 14 kb distal to the ApoE locus has a powerful association with late-onset AD (corrected p value was 5.3 x 10 e-34). No other SNP showed as robust an association. The authors estimated that people with two ApoE-ε4 copies (i.e. presumably indicated by having either the rs4420638(G;G) or rs429358(C;C) genotypes) have a 25-fold increased risk for developing the disease compared to Apo-ε3/Apo-ε3 carriers.\nAPOE-ε4 carriers may have their risk of developing Alzheimer's disease modified by SNPs elsewhere in their genomes.

A copy of the rs34623097-A allele increased serum triglyceride levels by 70.1 mg/dL (0.791 mmol/L). None of the ADRB2 SNPs showed a significant association with total-cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.\nIn a Tongan population, a SNP located in the upstream region of ADRB2 is associated with triglyceride levels independent of body mass index.\nThe β2 adrenergic receptor (ADRB2), a class of G protein-coupled receptor for catecholamines, plays an important role in regulating energy expenditure and lipolysis in adipose tissue. Therefore, polymorphisms in the ADRB2 gene (OMIM*109690) may explain part of the individual differences in lipid profiles. The 27Glu allele at the Glu27Gln polymorphism of ADRB2 has been significantly associated with increased triglyceride levels [1–6], although there is a conflicting report that demonstrated a significant increase in triglyceride levels in individuals with the Gln/Glngenotype as compared to those with the Glu/Glugenotype .\nMost studies have examined the association of three non synonymous ADRB2 SNPs, rs1042711 (5’LC-Arg19Cys in the 5’ upstream region), rs1042713 (Gly16Arg) and rs1042714 (Glu27Gln), with lipid profiles (i.e., total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein [HDL] cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol and triglyceride levels). However, ourrecent study showed that rs34623097 located in the upstream region of ADRB2 is more strongly associated with obesity than non synonymous SNPs in Oceanic populations. A functional analysis suggested that rs34623097-A, a risk allele for obesity, reduces the transcriptional activity of ADRB2 as compared with rs34623097-G . The aim of the present study is to further explore the association of ADRB2 SNPs including rs34623097 with lipid profiles independent of body mass index (BMI) in adult Tongan subjects.\nClinical characteristics of subjects\n(n = 128)\n(n = 40)\n(n = 88)\nTotal cholesterol (mg/dL)\nHDL cholesterol (mg/dL)\nLDL cholesterol (mg/dL)\nAssociation of age, sex and BMI with lipid traits\nTotal cholesterol (mg/dL)\nHDL cholesterol (mg/dL)\nLDL cholesterol (mg/dL)\n1.0 x 10 -3\n8.6 x 10 -3\nSex (Male = 0, Female = 1)\n8.9 x 10 -4\n6.6 x 1 -6\n3.0 x 10 -4\nAssociation of ADRB2 polymorphisms with lipid profiles\nAssociation of each ADRB2 polymorphism with lipid traits\nTotal cholesterol (mg/dL)\nHDL cholesterol (mg/dL)\nLDL cholesterol (mg/dL)\nIn this study, besides nine tag SNPs (rs17778257, rs34623097, rs2895795, rs2053044, rs11959427, rs1042711, rs1042713, rs1042714, and rs1042720) of ADRB2, the rs1042719 SNP was further evaluated becausers 1042720, being in LD with rs1042719 in the Oceanic populations , showed a small P-value for triglyceride (P-value = 0.059; Table 3); however, the rs1042719 SNP was also not significantly associated with the level of triglycerides (P-value = 0.057).\nThe present results indicate that rs34623097-A is associated with increased serum triglyceride levels. Our previous luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that rs34623097-A reduces the transcriptional activity of ADRB2 as compared with rs34623097-G, and an electrophoretic mobility shift assay suggested that rs34623097 modulates the binding affinity with nuclear factors . Taken together, these results indicate that the reduced expression of ADRB2 caused by rs34623097-A on adipocytes might contribute, in part, to increased serum triglyceride levels. One possible mechanism is that the activation of β adrenergic receptors such as ADRB2 expressed in adipocytes leads to the breakdown of triglycerides stored in adipocytes and the release of free fatty acids and glycerol [10–12]. Thus, the decreased lipolytic function in adipocytes is due to the lower expression of ADRB2 that would result in the accumulation of triglycerides within adipocytes. If triglycerides accumulate in adipocytes, the cellular uptake of the major component of triglycerides (i.e., free fatty acids) by adipocytes would be reduced. This mechanism would reduce the lipolysis of circulating lipoprotein-triglycerides. Accordingly, the level of serum triglycerides would be increased in individuals with rs34623097-A.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to report that rs34623097 is a major ADRB2 polymorphism that influences the serum triglyceride level, although the possibility that the lack of association of the other ADRB2 polymorphisms with lipid profiles comes from the small sample size (n = 128) should not be excluded. Previous studies have revealed that the 27Glu allele (rs1042714-G) of ADRB2 significantly increases the serum triglyceride levels [1–6]. In the present study, 27Glu also showed the same tendency (i.e., the β coefficient of 27Gln, an alternative allele at Glu27Gln, was a negative value in Table 3). This tendency is because rs34623097-A, which is significantly associated with increased triglycerides, is in positive LD with 27Glu in the Tongan subjects (D’ = 1 and r2 = 0.62). The rs34623097-A allele is observed mainly in Asians and Pacific Islanders and is in LD with 27Glu . However, rs34623097-A had never previously been examined in the association studies on lipid traits including triglycerides. The significant association of 27Glu found in previous studies may merely reflect the LD with rs34623097-A. Further studies are required to clarify this issue in various ethnic groups.\nSubjects and methods\nA total of 128 healthy adult subjects (18 years old or older) were recruited from Nuku’alofa, Tonga. Patients with diabetes and subjects who had any treatment known to interfere with metabolic syndrome-related parameters were excluded. A blood sample was collected from each subject after obtaining a written consent to participate in the study. This study was approved by the National Health Ethics & Research Committee of Tonga and the Research Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba.\nAnthropomorphic phenotypes were directly measured in field settings. Measurements were taken of subjects dressed in light clothing. Body height was measured to the nearest 1 mm by using a field anthropometer (GPM, Zurich, Switzerland), and weight was recorded to the nearest 0.1 kg by using a portable digital scale (Tanita model BC-518, Tokyo, Japan). BMI was calculated by dividing the weight in kg by the height in meters squared.\nBlood samples were obtained on the morning following a 12-hour fast. Serum lipids including total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides were measured at SRL Inc. (Tokyo, Japan) by using standard laboratory protocols.\nGenomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood by using a QIAamp Blood Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Nine tag SNPs (rs17778257, rs34623097, rs2895795, rs2053044, rs11959427, rs1042711, rs1042713, rs1042714, and rs1042720) of ADRB2, which were in LD (r2 > 0.8) with the other ADRB2 SNPs in the Oceanic populations, were genotyped in our previous study . The rs1042719 SNP was genotyped by using a TaqMan SNP genotyping assay in the present study because rs1042720, being in LD with rs1042719, showed not a significant but a small P-value in the association analyses of triglycerides in a Tongan population.\nAssociations of age, sex, and BMI with total-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol or triglyceride levels were assessed by a multiple regression analysis. The genotypes of rs11959427, rs1042713, and rs1042714 were not determined by a molecular biology-based technique for some subjects; instead, their genotypes were imputed by the MACH software . Deviation of genotype frequencies from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was examined by chi-square test. Pairwise linkage disequilibrium (LD) parameters, D’ and r2, were estimated by using Haploview software . The association of each polymorphism with total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol or triglyceride levels was assessed by a multiple regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, and BMI. In the regression analysis, the number of copies of a derived allele at each SNP was used as an independent variable (i.e., homozygotes of an ancestral allele, homozygotes of a derived allele, and heterozygotes were coded as 0, 2, and 1, respectively). The genotypes of SNPs with minor allele frequency (MAF) of ≥ 0.05 spanning a 200 kb genomic region containing the entire ADRB2 gene were retrieved from the HapMap JPT (Japanese in Tokyo, Japan) and CHB (Han Chinese in Beijing, China) populations [14, 15]. Furthermore, genomic DNA samples from 43 JPT and 45 CHB subjects were obtained from the Coriell Cell Repository and subjected to rs34623097 genotyping . By using the genotype data of JPT and CHB subjects as a reference, the genotypes of Tongan subjects were imputed by the MACH software . The imputed genotypes of SNPs showing an Rsq value (a measure which estimates the squared correlation between imputed and true genotypes) of more than 0.5 were used for the association test. Accordingly, seven imputed SNPs were further subjected to single-point association analysis. P-values less than 0.05 were regarded as statistically significant.\nIn a Tongan population, the rs34623097-A allele at a SNP located in the upstream region of ADRB2 is significantly associated with increased serum triglyceride levels independent of BMI.\nWe sincerely thank the people of Tonga for their kind approval and support of our research.

{"question":"¿Cómo se comparan las tendencias de emisiones de CO2 entre Malasia/Indonesia y China durante los confinamientos por COVID-19 en 2020? Por favor proporcione una comparación estructurada.","answer":"In Malaysia and Indonesia, CO2 emissions showed a clear decreasing trend after September 2019 and maintained low levels during the dry season (July to October) of 2020, due to both COVID-19 lockdowns and wetter weather conditions. In contrast, China's emissions followed a different pattern - while they dropped by 10% during the initial lockdown in February-March 2020, they quickly rebounded and surged in the second half of the year, resulting in an overall 1.5% increase compared to 2019. China's emissions increase was driven by stimulus measures focusing on construction and heavy industry, including a 7% increase in steel production.","context":["Main Article Content\nAn increase in Indonesian forest fires has infuriated Malaysia and Indonesia, where residents are inhaling smoke from peat and trees burned hundreds of miles away. The global COVID-19 lockdowns caused carbon monoxide (CO) emissions decreased seen over Malaysia and Indonesia regions. The main objective of this study is to investigate the CO distribution over Malaysia and Indonesia, within the period of January 2011 to December 2021. The impact of lockdown due to COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021 to CO concentration over Malaysia and Indonesia also was reviewed. This study utilizes MERRA-2 dataset provided by Giovanni interface. Five areas were found to be affected the most during the study period which is Kuala Lumpur, Jambi, Riau, Palembang, and Jakarta. Carbon monoxide concentration over the studied region exhibits a strong seasonality showing maximum value in dry season (July to October). September 2019 is found to have the highest trend of CO concentration affected Jambi region. As COVID-19 pandemic hit the whole world by end of year 2019, all the studied regions shown the decreasing trend after September 2019 and no high peak was observed during dry season (July to October) in 2020 and 2021. This is the combined effect of wetter dry season and an impact of lockdown implemented by government of Malaysia and Indonesia.\nAndriani, H. (2020).

In total across 2020, CO2 emissions increased by 1.5 per cent compared with 2019, based on analysis of the country’s annual statistical communique.\nChina’s return to economic growth after its first Covid-19 lockdown has relied on stimulating polluting sectors, such as construction and heavy industry. This saw the country’s consumption of coal, oil and gas all growing dramatically in the second half of the year, despite the pandemic and the government’s new pledge to target carbon neutrality by 2060.\nThe new data highlights the significance of China’s new five-year plan targets, due to be released at the annual legislative session starting on Friday. The plan is unlikely to set targets that would stop the growth in CO2 emissions, but is likely to slow it down.\nIn early 2020, severe lockdown measures to tackle the unfolding coronavirus pandemic saw China’s CO2 emissions drop by 10 per cent year-on-year during February and March. As restrictions were lifted, however, emissions quickly surged past pre-Covid levels, going on to record an estimated 3 per cent year-on-year increase in the third quarter of 2020.\nAnalysis of the full-year data in China’s new statistical release points to an even larger increase in the fourth quarter, pushing the overall total for 2020 to 1.5 per cent above that seen in 2019. This emissions surge is shown in the chart below, with the change during the first half of 2020 marked yellow and the second half in red.\nWhereas the annual increase of just 1.5 per cent continues the recent downward trend in China’s emissions growth, the surge in the second half of the year points in a different direction.\nOn the surface, the annual increase in China’s coal consumption also looks modest, at just 0.6 per cent across 2020 — compared to growth of 1 per cent in 2018 and 2019. Yet this, too, hides a rapid uptick in coal demand during the second half of 2020.\nSince coal demand reportedly fell 2.3 per cent in the first half of the year, full-year growth of 0.6 per cent implies that consumption in the second half must have been approximately 3.2 per cent, shown in the chart below alongside other key indicators of China’s energy and emissions.\nSimilarly, oil demand fell by at least 7 per cent in the first half of the year (and demand for refined oil products fell 15 per cent), according to official data – and OPEC estimates a 7.1 per cent fall in crude demand. The second half of 2020 then saw a rebound of 6.5 per cent.\nCement output contracted by almost 5 per cent in the six months to June before increasing dramatically, by 8 per cent, in the second half of the year.\nThere are major uncertainties about the economic and industrial data for the first half of the year, with official statistics appearing to understate the contraction in activity. However, the rebound in emissions in the second half of 2020 is in line with other data sources.\nAcross the full year of 2020, the communique suggests electricity demand grew by 3.1 per cent and thermal generation (predominantly coal and gas) by 2.1 per cent, so the generation mix became modestly cleaner even as power-sector emissions continued to increase. Power generation from wind and solar grew about 15 per cent, nuclear 5 per cent, solar 9 per cent and hydro 4 per cent.\nTotal energy use grew by 2.2 per cent in 2020, according to the statistical communique. Even taking the official GDP number at face value, this means the country achieved a mere 0.1 per cent improvement in energy intensity and a very modest 0.8 per cent gain in CO2 intensity of the economy. (These are the energy use and emissions per unit of GDP, respectively.)\nThe communique reports the improvement in CO2 intensity as a round number, at 1 per cent, but a more precise figure can be worked out from the reported increases in the consumption of coal, oil and fossil gas.\nWhat drove the emissions increase?\nThe sharp rebound in China’s energy use and emissions output reflects the pattern of “dirty recovery” that has been emerging since mid-2020. Policymakers doubled down on the old playbook of stimulating the dirtiest and most energy-intensive sectors – construction, heavy manufacturing – to offset weakness elsewhere.\nThis pattern is readily apparent from the statistics on steel production: crude steel output grew 7 per cent in 2020 and steel products by 10 per cent, some four times as fast as GDP.\nSteel production is the largest emitting sector for CO2, as well as air pollutants. It is also a key indicator of construction volumes as most steel is used for construction projects.\nChina’s policy response towards post-pandemic recovery has, thus, been distinctly different from other countries, which supported household incomes and consumption through income transfers. This, in turn, has served to boost China’s export manufacturing industry.\nChina’s approach helped deliver a positive GDP number, but is a further setback to efforts to pursue “high quality” growth or green the economy.\nA contributing factor to the surge is the failure of many local governments to enforce controls on coal power and steelmaking capacity. Enforcing the 2020 steel capacity targets alone would have avoided 300m tonnes of CO2 emissions (MtCO2) per year, by a conservative estimate, equivalent to the overall 4 per cent increase in China’s CO2 emissions in the second half of 2020.\n(A recent, unprecedented environmental inspection of the National Energy Administration heavily criticised the regulators for expansion of coal power and energy-intensive industries in the eastern part of the country, where new capacity is supposed to be strictly controlled under the country’s air quality policies. See Carbon Brief’s detailed Q&A explaining the potential significance of the criticism for China’s climate policies.)\nThe pattern of China’s rebound differed starkly from expectations. The IEA had projected in April that China’s energy consumption would fall 4 per cent in 2020, implying an even larger fall in CO2 emissions. However, the agency noted in November, that emissions were on track to increase.\nWhat does the emissions surge mean for China’s climate targets?\nThe modest 0.8 per cent improvement in CO2 intensity during 2020 means China has comfortably exceeded its Copenhagen accord target of a 40-45 per cent reduction from 2005 to 2020, as reported CO2 intensity had already fallen 48 per cent by 2019.\nThis means the increase in overall CO2 emissions in 2020 remains consistent with China’s international climate commitments, under which it has left room for emissions to continue growing until the late 2020s.\nHowever, an acceleration in the emissions growth rate in the second half of the year is poorly aligned with the target of peaking emissions before 2030, especially as the pledge to reach carbon neutrality before 2060 requires rapid reductions in emissions after the peak.\nFurthermore, fossil fuel growth goes beyond limited short-term increases in demand as it is built on the continued expansion of long-lived infrastructure.\nChina dominated investments in new coal power plants in 2020, opening three-quarters of the world’s newly funded capacity. It also accounted for more than four-fifths of newly announced coal power projects.\nA total of 38 gigawatts (GW) of new coal – about one large coal plant per week – was added to the grid and a total of 73GW of planned new projects were announced, while less than 9GW was retired. Meanwhile, new projects in the rest of the world contracted sharply.\nAll eyes on the five-year plan\nBoth the ongoing and accelerating emissions growth and the accelerating investment in fossil-fuel infrastructure are facts that Chinese leader Xi Jinping must have been well aware of when making the pledge to target carbon neutrality by 2060.\nTherefore, Xi’s pledge could be read either as a domestic signal to turn around these trends – or an international one to put a green veneer on an economy that he thinks will continue to increase emissions until late in the decade.\nThe key indication of which way the leadership leans will be the energy targets for 2025 that will be released as a part of China’s 14th five-year plan.\nThe overarching plan will be released at the annual session of China’s largely ceremonial legislature, starting on Friday. This will include a limit on total energy consumption and a target for the share of non-fossil energy – the sum of renewable energy and nuclear.\nTogether, these two targets will largely determine the maximum level for China’s CO2 emissions in 2025, with a bit of give depending on the exact mix of fossil fuels.\nA range of more specific targets will be released in late 2021 or early 2022, as the specific plans for energy, renewable energy, coal and other sectors, as well as the CO2 peaking action plan being developed by the environmental ministry, are rolled out.\nThis story was published with permission from Carbon Brief.\nThanks for reading to the end of this story!\nWe would be grateful if you would consider joining as a member of The EB Circle.

{"question":"What makes robotic knee replacement surgery more effective for achieving proper alignment and balance?","answer":"Robotic knee replacement surgery achieves better alignment and balance through precise surgical planning and execution. The technology uses robotics, computer-assisted surgical tools, and pressure sensor technology to deliver crucial information during surgery, ensuring walking weight is distributed evenly. Proper alignment requires precise surgical planning that robotic techniques deliver, while correct balancing with pressure sensors results in a natural-feeling joint that functions well during recreational activities. This precision is particularly important since minor instability, common with traditional techniques, has been identified as a main source of patient dissatisfaction and early failure.","context":["Robotic Orthopedic Surgery\nNYU Langone orthopedic surgeons specialize in the latest, cutting-edge, robotic and computer-assisted surgical techniques for hip and knee replacement procedures.\nIn these procedures, evidence-based pain management and rapid recovery protocols are combined with robotic and computer-assisted surgical tools. Robotic tools make precise movements that preserve bone and tissue and often result in a faster recovery and less muscle and soft tissue damage. Computer-assisted surgery uses technology such as robots, accelerometers, gyroscopes, and pressure sensors, which help doctors properly position implants.\nOur focus on enhanced recovery and a personalized approach to pain management—that may include a combination of opioid and non-opioid pain relievers and topical medications—enables many of our patients to return home the same day of their robotic or computer-assisted surgery.\nRobotic Hip Replacement Surgery\nOur doctors use robotic hip replacement surgery to treat osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, developmental hip dysplasia, hip impingement syndrome, and conditions causing severe joint damage. The goal of the surgery is to relieve pain and improve mobility.\nThe most important factor in hip replacement surgery, in terms of pain, function, and recovery, is surgical technique. Precise surgical techniques that limit soft tissue damage are key to a rapid recovery. Accurate bone surface preparation with customized biomechanical restoration of the hip determines the function, comfort, and longevity of your implant. Robotic surgical techniques allow surgeons to remove only as much bone as is necessary. The robot system also ensures that the new replacement parts are aligned at the correct angles, which vary with every patient.\nHip replacement surgery requires a surgeon to remove damaged bone and cartilage and replace these with synthetic materials, which can affect limb length. Using robotic and computer-assisted tools helps restore your leg length and preserves your comfort and gait.\nRobotic Knee Replacement Surgery\nTotal knee replacement or partial knee replacement is a common treatment for severe knee pain resulting from osteoarthritis, osteonecrosis, and rheumatoid arthritis. Partial knee replacements are a less invasive alternative for people who have experienced damage to one area of their knee as a result of arthritis.\nTotal or partial knee replacement surgery is a technically demanding surgery. Minor instability, common with traditional surgical techniques, has been recognized as a main source of patient dissatisfaction and early failure. Alignment and balance are the two main requirements for clinical success in knee replacement surgery.\nProper alignment requires precise surgical planning and execution, such as those that robotic techniques deliver. Correct balancing with pressure sensors results in a natural-feeling joint that functions well during recreational sports and activities.\nRobotics, computer-assisted surgical tools, and pressure sensor technology deliver information our surgeons need during total and partial knee replacement surgery to ensure your walking weight is distributed evenly.\nNYU Langone experts have been key developers of these technologies and continue to work toward advancing this field, while training fellows and visiting surgeons in the safe adoption of these innovative techniques.\nRobotic and computer-assisted surgeries for bone and joint conditions take place at NYU Langone Orthopedic Hospital, NYU Langone Ambulatory Care Center East 38th Street, and Tisch Hospital.\nRobotic orthopedic surgery is performed by the following doctors:"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:eee928fc-c90c-4ee8-81e6-dfe392b5dde1>"],"error":null}
{"question":"what musical geometry patterns characterize the harmonic table layout of this instrument?","answer":"The harmonic table layout is arranged in a hexagonal lattice with vertical rows following specific interval patterns: along the 30 degree axis, notes ascend by major third; along the 150 degree axis, notes ascend by minor third; and along the 90 degree (vertical) axis, notes ascend by perfect fifth. The user can modify intervals along the 30 and 150 degree axes between 1-11 semitones, ascending or descending. The vertical axis interval is always the sum of these two defined intervals to maintain pattern tessellation. This layout makes tertial chords particularly easy to visualize - three keys forming a rightward-pointing triangle create a major triad, while the overlapping leftward-pointing triangle below forms the relative minor triad.","context":["Ben's Final Project: New Look => Same Great Notes!\nExploring 2D musical space, armed with sixteen square waves and a saw.\nIs that a Honeycomb or a Musical Instrument?\nThe short answer is, both. But the bees are dying, leaving behind only their tiny apian instruments, expertly hewn from multicolored beeswax and (lucky for us) MIDI-enabled.\nThe instrument's design is adapted from the Axis MIDI controller, which has a unique key layout based on a musical geometry that the designers call the “harmonic table.” The keys are arranged as a hexagonal lattice with vertical rows. Along the 30 degree axis the notes ascend by major third, along the 150 degree axis the notes ascend by minor third, and along the 90 degree (vertical) axis the notes ascend by a perfect fifth. This two-dimensional layout can make playing scales a little cumbersome, but it offers an interesting and intuitive way to visualize chord structures and harmonic relationships. Tertial chords are particularly easy to see and play on this layout. For instance, any three keys forming a rightward-pointing triangle form a major triad, while the overlapping leftward-pointing triangle below forms the relative minor triad.\nI added flexibility and interest to the instrument by allowing the user to change the musical geometry on the fly. Stepwise intervals along the 30 degree and 150 degree axes can be defined between 1 and 11 semitones, ascending or descending. The vertical axis is always the sum of the two defined intervals (this is required to tessellate the pattern of intervals across the lattice). The range of the instrument is also adjustable on the fly, and can slide up or down by semitones.\nTo aid the user in performance, the note name and octave appears on each key. The color of the key border is drawn on a red-to-blue scale according to the octave, and this color scheme will adapt to any range of notes. As on a piano, the \"black keys\" are shaded darker than the \"white keys.\"\nThere are three play modes. \"Press\" mode allows the user to play notes by pressing keys in the parallelogram-shaped region on the computer keyboard that is bounded by Z, V, 7, and 4. The position of the mouse on the virtual keyboard controls the active region of notes controlled by these keys. \"Toggle\" mode is similar, but keys are pressed to arm or disarm notes, and armed notes are played when the mouse is pressed. \"Seq\" mode allows the user to define a sequence of notes that will be looped upon launch. Press \"Set Seq\" and then select the notes in order. Press \"Play Seq\" to begin playback. Press \"Reset\" to stop playback and pick a new sequence. Try changing the interval patterns while a sequence is playing!\nSlider controls are included to set the speed of the sequencer instrument, as well as the glide amount and lowpass filter cutoff of both the sequencer and the chordal instruments.\nHow to Run\nYou will need Processing, along with the OscP5 library, and the latest version of ChucK, preferably the special PLOrk edition if available. To run New Look simply run the Processing sketch and the ChucK code in either order. If you encounter misaligned text in the GUI, try closing the window and running the sketch again.\nNote that several parameters of the GUI are easily changed at the top of the Processing code; these include the dimensions of the key space (in number of rows and columns) and the size of the individual keys (in pixels). Everything will scale in proportion to key size (window size, layout, text size), so don't make your key size too big.\nChanges for Future Versions\n- Ability to select which note remains unchanged when intervals are updated (is currently upper left)\n- Greater control over parameters of the sound synthesis (my emphasis thus far has been on the GUI and note control)\n- Perhaps a fun rolling ball mode to trigger keys (controlled by motion sensors or just arrow keys)\n- More intelligent gliding (i.e. glide only when pressed notes are moved, not when there is separation between triggered notes)\n- In Toggle mode:\n- Ability to store and recall chord patterns, selectable on the fly with a single keystroke\n- In Sequence mode:\n- Ability to change sequences on the fly\n- Ability to assign relative durations to individual notes in a sequence\n- Ability to store and recall sequences\n- Multiple voices with different sequences"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"advanced_reasoning"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:be50eaea-09b3-4b75-bca8-a309d52147a5>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What economic challenges do both the Twa people and the Sacred Headwaters indigenous communities face regarding their traditional lands?","answer":"Both groups face challenges related to land access and resource control. The Twa people historically lacked access to farmland, forcing them to work on others' farms, until Barefoot Artists helped them acquire farmland to increase their food self-sufficiency. They also struggled with primitive pottery production conditions until receiving support for a proper art center. Similarly, the Sacred Headwaters indigenous communities face threats from industrial-scale mega-projects and extractive industries in their ancestral territories, leading them to form alliances to protect their lands and seek alternatives to extractive economic models.","context":["Twa Village, Rugerero, Rwanda (2011)\n(Left) Firing pots in an open fire, (Right) High-fired large pots in front of the Twa Pottery Rugerero, photo by Jean Bosco Musana\nThe Twa are a pygmy people who were the original inhabitants of the Great Lakes region of central Africa.\nMoved by their talent, energy, and desperate situation, Barefoot Artists began assisting the Twa in 2009 through a goat project. At the beginning, only half of the village families were given goats. Goats multiplied. Within a few months, the other half of the families received goats too. This way, no one sold or ate the goat for a short term gain. This was the first step in organizing the community and encouraging them to think of their future and to generate assets.\nThe Twa people have been scattered throughout the region. Most of them make pottery to earn a living. Due to the lack of resources, they fired their pots in the most primitive manner – with assorted tree leaves in the open air. Their products sold for pittance. They asked for help to build an art house where their work could be properly displayed and better priced.\nBarefoot Artists organized a series of workshops where men, women, and children were encouraged to design the art house. Through the process, their dream for one art house expanded into the desire for a community art center containing a communal workspace, a large kiln, a storage room, an exhibition space, a shower, and a toilet in a spacious compound.\nResponding to their request, Barefoot Artists acquired a piece of land for them, where they could erect the communal art center. It would be a place where the whole community could work together and fire their pottery in a well-built communal kiln. The community mobilized, men, women, and children, to build their art center. Artist Lily Yeh guided them in mural painting and mosaic making. The beauty and uniqueness of the new art center now attracts visitors. The Twa are now producing high quality wares, and selling them at four times the price of their old wares.\nInsufficient food supply had been an on-going problem with the Twa. Although they are good farmers, they had no land. They were lending themselves out to farm for other people. During our visit in 2010, Barefoot Artists succeeded in acquiring a piece of farmland for the Twa. They now have increased self-sufficiency in their food supply.\nThe Twa are natural dancers. They readily express their emotions through dance and songs. Often, during our workshops, they would spontaneously break into song and dance. When they are happy, they dance with terrific energy and abandon.\nIn the spring of 2011, Barefoot Artists collaborated with the University of Florida’s Center for the Arts in Healthcare to equip the Twa with training, costumes and musical instruments to help to establish them as professional performers. The forty-plus members named their team “Amahoro Dance Troupe.” Amahoro means peace in Kinyarwande, the Rwandan language. The Troupe gave its first professional performance at the East-Central Africa Arts & Health International Forum in Kigali on May 13th, 2011. For many of the dancers and musicians, the four-hour trip to Kigali was their first ever in a motor vehicle. What a huge milestone in their lives!\n“There is a big change in their attitude toward themselves and their sense of the future. They are now hopeful and proud,” commented Jean Bosco Musana, Barefoot Artists Rwandan Program Coordinator.","In March, leaders from the two most important Amazonian Indigenous organizations of Ecuador and Peru (CONFENIAE and AIDESEP) were joined by nearly 100 indigenous representatives from the Achuar, Shuar, Wampis, Awajun and Kichwa people in a historic Sacred Headwaters summit in the town of Santa Maria de Nieva in the heart of the territories of the Awajun nation of Peru.\nIndigenous leaders from the Achuar, Shuar, Wampis, Awajun, Shiwiar, and Kichwa hold historic summit in Santa Maria Nieva, Peru.\nThe Sacred Headwaters region of the Amazon, which the indigenous people are now also referring to as Territories for Life, is made up of 60 million acres of tropical rainforest in Ecuador and Peru in the very headwaters of the Amazon River—the most biodiverse region of the planet.

{"question":"What are the cleaning requirements for acrylic baths, and what safety measures should be taken to prevent slipping in bathtubs?","answer":"Acrylic baths require simple cleaning with a soft cloth and soapy water, followed by rinsing with clean water and wiping dry. No special cleaning agents are needed. For safety in bathtubs, several measures should be taken: skid-proofing the bathtub, ensuring bath mats have non-slip bottoms, adding grab bars to the bathtub/shower, and using a shower seat or bathtub transfer bench if necessary. Additionally, hot and cold faucets should be clearly marked to prevent accidents.","context":["Choosing a bathroom suite very often depends on the type of bath you want and this page is designed to answer the most common questions asked by people visiting bathroom showrooms.\nChoosing between acrylic baths, steel baths or cast iron baths is not simply a matter of cost and knowing about the material your bath is made from can help you in many ways. Not least on installation.\nI Want a Bath Which Allows me to Fit the Taps on the Wall\nNo problem. Most manufacturers have a range of baths with no pre cut tap holes. This will allow you to not only fit wall mounted taps, but cut your own tap holes if you would like to and have the taps anywhere you like.\nHow do I Fit Taps in a Bath With no Tap Holes?\nSee our project on using a hole saw and buy a hole saw of the correct size. 35mm is the most common size for taps in the UK. You will need an arbor for your hole saw. This is the small drill bit which acts as a guide and is fixed inside the centre of the hole saw. You can find out more about how to use a holesaw by clicking through to our project on using holesaws.\nWhat is the Best Way to Clean an Acrylic Bath?\nUse a soft cloth and some soapy water. Then rinse with clean water and wipe dry. No special agents are required to get a good clean acrylic bath.\nAre Acrylic Baths as Good as Other Types?\nAll baths should meet BS 4305 part 1/EN198. This ensures that their quality is guaranteed. The process of manufacturing and the cost of the materials usually makes acrylic baths cheaper than others but this does not mean they are inferior. To learn more about acrylic baths check out our project page.\nIf I Buy a Cast Iron Bath, can I Paint it?\nIn short, yes you can but there is some preparation work needed first to ensure that the finish is as good as it possibly can be. See our project on painting cast iron baths for more information and also check out our project on cast iron baths for general information.\nDo all Types of Bath Come in Different Colours?\nYes but the range of different colours in acrylic is much greater that that of cast iron and steel. This is because of the process required to colour porcelain enamel and its difficulty compared to colouring acrylic sheets.\nWhich Type of Bath Gives me the Greater Range of Styles?\nAgain, acrylic baths have a much greater range of styles because of the ease of moulding an acrylic sheet compared to shaping steel or cast iron moulds. More information on baths and bathrooms can be found in our bathroom projects section.\nIs a Special Water Supply Necessary for a Whirlpool Bath?\nNo a normal hot and cold water supply can be used for a whirlpool bath which, if installed correctly, should be quiet and efficient.\nDon't I need a Huge Bathroom for a Whirlpool Bath?\nNo, as the majority of whirlpool baths are acrylic they are made in all shapes and sizes and there are manufacturers about who specialise in producing goods for smaller bathrooms.\nHow do I Resurface an old Bath?\nTo find out how to repair or resurface an old bath and give it a new lease of life take a look at our project on bath repairs and resurfacing.\nDo I Need to Buy a Complete Suite From one Supplier or can I Buy the Different Parts From Different People?\nIts recommended that you buy bathroom suites from a single manufacturer. Bathroom suites can vary in shade and buying from different suppliers can lead to different colours. If you have no wish for everything to be the same however, you can buy from as many different people as you like.","Where are the HIDDEN HAZARDS for at home seniors?\nThere could be hidden hazards to your aging loved one in their home.

{"question":"How has South African activism evolved from anti-apartheid literary protest to modern environmental conservation, such as in protected areas and climate change initiatives?","answer":"South African activism has transformed from Nadine Gordimer's anti-apartheid literary protest, where she used her writing to expose the moral and psychological tensions of a racially-divided country, to modern environmental conservation efforts. While Gordimer focused on documenting political oppression and racial inequality through her novels like 'Burger's Daughter' and 'The Conservationist', contemporary activism has expanded to include environmental protection through initiatives like the Climate Action Partnership (CAP). CAP works to address climate change threats to South Africa's biodiversity and social communities, predicting temperature increases of 1-3°C by mid-21st century and advocating for ecosystem protection. This evolution shows how social justice activism in South Africa has broadened to encompass environmental concerns while maintaining a focus on community welfare.","context":["Nadine Gordimer was born in Springs, Transvaal, South Africa in 1923.\nShe remained in South Africa, living in Johannesburg from 1948 onwards. She was educated at a convent school and spent a year at Witwaterstrand University. Since then, her life was devoted to her writing. She travelled extensively, wrote non-fiction on South African subjects and made TV documentaries, collaborating with her son Hugo Cassirer on the television film Choosing Justice: Allan Boesak. She was responsible for the script of the 1989 BBC film, Frontiers, and for four of the seven screenplays for a television drama based on her own short stories, entitled The Gordimer Stories 1981-82. She also published, in forty languages, fifteen novels and many short story collections.\nHer first short story was published at the age of fifteen in the liberal Johannesburg magazine, Forum, and during her twenties, her stories appeared in many local magazines. In 1951 the New Yorker took one of her short stories. Her short story collections include A Soldier's Embrace (1980); Something Out There (1984); and Jump and Other Stories (1991). Loot (2003) is a collection of ten short stories widely varied in theme and place.\nNadine Gordimer's subject matter in the past has been the effect of apartheid on the lives of South Africans and the moral and psychological tensions of life in a racially-divided country, which she often wrote about by focusing on oppressed non-white characters. She was an ardent opponent of apartheid and refused to accommodate the system, despite growing up in a community in which it was accepted as normal. Her work has therefore served to chart, over a number of years, the changing response to apartheid in South Africa. Her first novel, The Lying Days (1953), was based largely on her own life and set in her home town. Her next three novels, A World of Strangers (1958), Occasion for Loving (1963), which focuses on an illicit love affair between a black man and a white woman, and The Late Bourgeois World (1966), deal with master-servant relations in South African life. In 1974, her novel The Conservationist, was joint winner of the Booker Prize for Fiction. Burger's Daughter (1979) was written during the aftermath of the Soweto uprising, and was banned, along with other books she has written. The House Gun (1998) explores, through a murder trial, the complexities of violence-ridden post-apartheid South Africa. The Pickup (2001) is set in South Africa and Saudi Arabia, and its theme is the tragedy of forced emigration. Her last novel to appear in her lifetime was No Time Like the Present (2012). Nadine Gordimer died in 2014.\nNadine Gordimer has been awarded honorary degrees from universities in USA, Belgium, South Africa, and from York, Oxford and Cambridge Universities in the UK. She was made a Commandeur de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres (France), Vice President of International PEN, and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. She was also a founder of the Congress of South African Writers.\nIn 1991 she was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature, and in 2007, the Chevalier de la Légion d'Honneur (France).\nNadine Gordimer is a towering figure of world literature.\nShe exemplifies a belief, now seemingly forgotten in a literary culture which has been under attack by the ubiquity of the superficial, that a writer can be the mouthpiece of a time, a spokesperson for a crusade, and a tireless examiner of moral and psychological truth. She has been a fervent campaigner against racism in South Africa and has long held an iconic status there as a champion of tolerance, free speech and understanding. She has also displayed great conviction and self-belief in refusing to become an exile, despite the banning of three of her works by the South African regime.\n‘Learning to write sent me falling, falling through the surface of the South African way of life,’ Gordimer has said. In her work there is affection for her homeland, its people, epic landscapes and potent past. This is juxtaposed with an examination of the devastating psychological effects of political persecution on the lives of ordinary South Africans, and it is this which gives her work its moral force and imaginative richness. Like compatriots Alan Paton and J.M. Coetzee, Gordimer has dramatised the history of her country. She has addressed the violence of Apartheid, the duplicity, tension and perversion of normalcy of the totalitarian state. In novels such as The Conservationist (1974) and Burger’s Daughter (1979) her characters deal with exile, compromise, exploitation and alienation - themes Gordimer explores against the growth of black consciousness. She examines the complexity of white privilege, inviting us to see the weakness of the liberal response to Apartheid. She also investigates its attempts at self-justification, and finds that even in benevolence there can be an ugly egotism.\nLike Alice Munro, Gordimer has a detached, fractured, concise style. At its best this is compelling and affecting, although there are moments when her pushing against the constraints of grammar threatens to undermine her sentences. In a later collection of short fiction, Beethoven Was One-Sixteenth Black (2007), her increasing sparseness can frustrate, but there are many stories here that surprise with their depth of feeling and cool irony. ‘Allesverloren’, the stand-out story, which means ‘everything lost’ in Afrikaans, is about a widow who goes looking for the gay lover of her former husband. It begins: ‘Whom to talk to? Grief is boring after a while, burdensome even to close confidants. After a very short while, for them. The long whole continues. A cord that won’t come full circle, doesn’t know how to tie a knot in a resolution. So whom to talk to. Speak.’ This story, with so little wasted, with such a controlled, precise tone, is a beautiful meditation on bereavement. What is lost in death? And what is now possible?\nGordimer is a writer of extraordinary power and acuity. Her voice is remarkably controlled and restrained, in contrast with the subject matter of much of her work: the way people go about their daily lives and interactions with one another in the myriad tensions of a brutal police state. Like Toni Morrison and Alice Walker, Gordimer is adept at delineating the relationship between the personal and the political. In her long career she has charted each stage of South Africa’s history with a daring refusal to compromise. She deals with the problem of belonging in a segregated society. She shows us place as prison. How do you feel a part of a society which is founded upon the wilful mistreatment of millions of its citizens? What do you do when your very country has been stolen from you? Nadine Gordimer’s stories are testament to her belief in the redemptive power of humanity; its ability to overcome what she has called ‘the violence of pain,’ even if that pain is inflicted by the state. The individual, if brave and willing enough, is able to triumph against seemingly insurmountable odds. The only hope available to humanity is to have hope. While Gordimer shares Kafka’s interest in abandonment and metaphysical confusion, she finds space for the possibility of optimism. ‘Art defies defeat by its very existence,’ she has said, ‘representing the celebration of life, in spite of all attempts to degrade and destroy it.’\nGordimer has been criticised for writing from a position of privilege, of suffering from what she has described as ‘the languid evasions of liberal guilt’. This is unfair. You are not denied a voice and a perspective simply because you have not suffered for your skin colour. Furthermore, this form of criticism negates Gordimer’s position as a staunch defender of a free South Africa, and of her right to be a literary witness to her country’s tragedies. Some it would seem are frustrated that the writing career of Nadine Gordimer has outlived Apartheid. In the mid-1990s several critics questioned whether there was a place for her after the fall of the regime. These were the sort of people who saw her as a ‘protest’ writer, whose work was done the moment Nelson Mandela was elected. This is an absurd attempt to reduce Gordimer as a writer. Gordimer has, with great wit, skill, and formal control, explored the attenuation of morality in political systems which distort human interaction. Her work explores intimacies, the depths of yearning, the multiple betrayals of human relationship, and the many ways people learn to cope in a world which has lost its head. She has always been more than a purveyor of fictional objections to the many distortions of repressive governments. In her recent fiction she has demonstrated that her powers are undiminished. She is more than able to meet the challenges of documenting a troubled post-Apartheid society. In The Pickup (2001), a chance encounter between the privileged daughter of an investment banker and a mechanic from an unnamed Arab-African state allows the author to examine immigration, cultural conflict and – an ever-popular Gordimer theme – redemption. The House Gun (1998) deals with the emotional and legal consequences of a murder committed by the son of elite white parents; it examines the bonds of familial love, and asks whether they are capable of withstanding even the most powerful of tests. These novels recall July’s People (1981), one of Gordimer’s finest works, in which a family of white liberals flee a violence stricken Johannesburg for the country, where they seek refuge with their African servant. They are also reminiscent of the Burger’s Daughter (1979), written during the aftermath of the Soweto uprising, in which a daughter examines her relationship with her father, one of the many martyrs to the anti-Apartheid movement.\nGordimer’s recent work has been as controlled, powerful and affecting as anything she has written. Get a Life (2005), written after the death of Gordimer’s partner, is the story of Paul Bannerman, an ecologist who becomes strangely radioactive after receiving treatment for thyroid cancer. Forced to move back in with his parents, a move which will force his mother to confront her past, Bannerman, with sudden distance from his wife and child, comes to question his own life, marriage and beliefs. This is a novel about the fragility of many different types of environment: Gordimer juxtaposes the cancerous attack on Bannerman’s body with the rabid exploitation of the South African ecosystem.\nGaran Holcombe, 2008","Advocacy & Awareness\nWilderness Foundation Africa believes that government and business leaders have an inherent responsibility to act as responsible custodians of the environment through best practice. Sustained economic growth is seen as a necessary priority, but it will continue to put pressure on the Earth’s natural resources unless it is carefully managed and monitored.\nWilderness Foundation Africa develops environmental standards and information which is used to brief and motivate individuals, governments and society at large towards the higher ideal of conservation and its role in the 21st century.\nThe Advocacy and Awareness programme focuses on the following key areas:\n- Participation in Conservation forums (World Wilderness Congress; Conservation NGO alliance; IUCN, the Living Lakes Network, International Conservation Caucaus Foundation)\n- Green Leaf Environmental Accreditation Standard\n- Campaigns, Protected Area and Environmental Compliance (Mapumgubwe mining threat; Okavango Delta World heritage listing)\n- Actively advocate for the expansion and protection of protected areas.\nSince May 2020, Wilderness Foundation Africa in collaboration with the International Conservation Caucus Foundation (ICCF) has been hosting virtual briefings for South African parliamentarians on a wide range of environmental topics. By hosting these briefings we are aiming to build political will in order to improve global environmental governance and coordinate interactions between policymakers, environmental experts and the private sector.\nThrough fostering collaboration and cohesion between these role-players, the briefings will provide positive and sustainable solutions to a range of environmental issues. Covering topics such as funding the green economy and abating the risk of zoonotic diseases, a number of experts have engaged with MPs, with the most recent briefing involving Dr Jane Goodall DBE - Founder of the Jane Goodall Foundation and UN Messenger of Peace. The briefings have each been streamed live on Youtube and - in addition to MPs actively participating each time - they have attracted thousands of views from both a national and international audience.\nThrough supporting our MPs with knowledge sharing and productive discussions, we hope to emphasise the importance of conserving the environment and securing socioeconomic development for generations to come.\nBelow are links to the various briefings:\nEstablished in August 2012, the SAFE (Sustainable Alternatives to Fracking and Exploration) Alliance includes the Wilderness Foundation Africa, Treasure the Karoo Action Group (TKAG), the Endangered Wildlife Trust (EWT) and the African Conservation Trust (ACT); and will act as a platform to oppose fracking and seek alternative, more sustainable development options for the targeted fracking areas.\nThe Alliance adds momentum to the growing opposition to the controversial method of shale gas mining - which has been banned in more than 150 jurisdictions around the world.\nThe view of the Alliance is informed by fundamental arguments which present obstacles to licensing the technology in South Africa. Some of these arguments rest on insurmountable obstacles on a global scale. Others are germane to the South African context of culture, geology, biodiversity, water scarcity, and gas reticulation.\nMEC for Finance, Economic Development, Environmental Affairs and Tourism, Honourable Lubabalo Mabuyane, announced on 8 June 2018 the enactment of Protected Environment status for the Indalo Game Reserves Protected Environment, through the Eastern Cape Parks and Tourism Agency (ECPTA) under the Eastern Cape Biodiversity Stewardship Programme.\nIndalo, meaning “creation”, is a voluntary collaboration of Eastern Cape private game reserves who support biodiversity based eco-tourism, strive for sound ecological management and commit to the promotion of positive socio-economic upliftment. Indalo reserves employ around 1 079 people and support an additional 3 992 dependents.\nThe newly enacted Indalo Game Reserves Protected Environment, covering 68 075 hectares, spans three local municipalities, namely: Sundays River Valley Local Municipality, Ndlambe Local Municipality and Makana Local Municipality, all located in the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa.\nThe Indalo Game Reserves Protected Environment is comprised of eight private game reserves, including Amakhala Game Reserve, Hopewell Private Game Reserve, Kariega Game Reserve, Kwandwe Game Reserve, Oceana Beach and Wildlife Reserve, Pumba Game Reserve, Shamwari Game Reserve and Sibuya Game Reserve.\n“We recognize the need to work in partnership with all sectors of our society to meet our conservation commitments.It is encouraging to see how private land owners are prepared to work with government to expand the protected area state for the benefit of all people and greater socio economic impact” states MEC Mabuyane.\nDr Andrew Muir, CEO of Wilderness Foundation Africa who is also an ECPTA board member comments that “68 075 hectares is a significant contribution to the protected area estate of South Africa. In particular as this includes two global biodiversity hotspots of Fynbos and Albany thicket. We believe that the future of conservation is in meaningful partnerships and beyond the reserve boundaries and stewardship is a very powerful tool that the state has to achieve this end”.\nMark Palmer, Chairman of Indalo notes “this as a historic achievement for the 8 private reserves that see the value of working together to a greater conservation goal. At the same time, we believe that this will attract more tourists to our lodges, and our region as a whole. We are encouraged that other reserves such as Lalibela Game Reserve have indicated their intention to join the Indalo Game Reserves Protected Environment authority.\nTHE STORY OF INDALOINDALO, meaning creation, was pioneered by Wilderness Foundation Africa in the Eastern Cape in 2002 and is made up of members representing a number of private nature reserves/game reserves in the Eastern Cape. These are as follows: Amakhala Game Reserve, Hopewell Private Game Reserve, Kariega Game Reserve, Kwandwe Game Reserve, Oceana Beach and Wildlife Reserve, Pumba Game Reserve, Shamwari Game Reserve, Lalibela Game Reserve, Bergplaas Nature Reserve and Sibuya Game Reserve.\nOriginally formed in order to focus on promoting socially responsible, ecologically sound land use among its members, INDALO supports non-consumptive wildlife and biodiversity based tourism.\nThe purpose of INDALO is to create a forum for its members to: Identify and address threats to biodiversity and ecological sustainability, and identify appropriate solutions; identify and develop programmes to enhance social sustainability and community involvement and development; be educated in biodiversity conservation and sustainable development; and develop cooperative environmental management strategies and plans.\nINDALO has been involved in a number of projects including:\nIn 2004, the Wilderness Foundation commissioned a ground breaking study looking at the socio-economic impact of the private game reserve industry in the Eastern Cape. The first study was done by the Terrestrial Ecology Unit at UPE (now known as African Centre for Ecology at Nelson Mandela Metro University) and clearly showed the positive socio-economic impacts that the shift to private conservation was having in the region. INDALO commissioned an update in 2006, 2008 and 2010. This series of studies is a very powerful tool for researchers and for lobbying government to acknowledge the positive socio-economic impact that private conservation can have. For more information and access to the reports please contact the INDALO secretariat.\nIn 2008 Conservation International and the Wilderness Foundation Africa developed a project to pilot stewardship in the Eastern Cape’s Albany Biodiversity Hotspot. Two years worth of funding was secured from Michael Hainebach and supported by conservation International. The objective of the INDALO - Albany Stewardship Project, which was implemented by Wilderness Foundation, was to investigate ways of improving and securing biodiversity conservation in the private game reserves of the Eastern Cape. The principal product of the project is a conservation assessment of the 11 member reserves, and two years worth of ecological advice and support to various reserve management teams, aimed at improving biodiversity conservation.\nThe INDALO Wildlife Colloquium was started in 2004 by INDALO member Angus Sholto-Douglas. The aim is to bring together students, researchers and wildlife managers to discuss and learn more about a range of subjects including: tick bore diseases in wildlife and species management research, anti-poaching and financial incentives for biodiversity conservation. The colloquium usually takes place at Rhodes University in July.\nThe INDALO members support scientific research in a wide range of fields. There are students and researchers working on most of the INDALO member reserves. Research subjects include wildlife behaviour, biodiversity inventories, plant ecology, socio-economics, etho-botany, genetics, and veterinary studies. The Research Centre at Amakhala Game Reserve keeps a list of past and active research projects on the INDALO reserves. Interested parties can contact the individual reserves or the INDALO secretariat.\nPoaching of wildlife, whether it’s for “bush meat” or high value ivory or rhino horn, is a challenge faced by most protected areas in Africa. The members of INDALO collaborate in the field of anti-poaching and security. Although each reserve usually has its own anti-poaching units, there is an excellent communication network and common strategic approach. An experienced and highly competent team is in place to proactively deal with poaching and security.\nThe Wilderness Foundation Africa is a founding member of the Climate Action Partnership (CAP), a powerful alliance of South African environmental NGO’s that recognise that climate change is not just an environmental challenge, but a political, social and economic challenge.\nThe members of the CAP believe that by working together, they can help advocate for the reduction of green house gas emissions and the protection of the country’s valuable natural resources.\nPredictions show that South Africa has the potential to be one of the countries worst affected by the impacts of climate change. According to statistics, South Africa can expect average temperature increases between 1°C and 3°C by the mid-21st century, accompanied by an up to 30% reduction in rainfall, an increased incidence of droughts, floods and intense storms as well as a predicted rise in sea levels of up to 1 metre.\nThe social, economic and environmental impacts of these changes in South Africa’s climate could be devastating. Decreasing agricultural, forestry, livestock and fish stock yields could greatly threaten food and job security. The collapse of South Africa’s unique ecosystems could mean extinction for many of the country’s magnificent plant and animal species.\nIn recognition of the threat that climate change poses to South Africa, eight of the country’s largest and most influential conservation NGO’s have joined together to help reduce the impact of climate change on, and increase the resilience of, South Africa’s biodiversity and social communities.\nThe Climate Action Partnership advocates for intact ecosystems that are connected at a landscape level; building human capacity; and implementing climate change adaptation and mitigation.\nCAP’s objectives are to:\n- Raise awareness around climate change and the links between climate change and the conservation of natural habitat\n- Promote the integrity of climate change projects by promoting the adoption of globally accepted standards, with an emphasis on the Climate, Community and Biodiversity Standards (CCBS)\n- Advise on and support Southern African solutions for mitigation and adaptation to climate change with a biodiversity conservation outcome\n- Promote cross-sectoral policy that supports climate change mitigation and adaptation activities with a biodiversity conservation outcome\n- Achieve carbon reductions for the head offices of the CAP partner organizations\nCAP recognizes that:\n- Climate change is among the most pervasive threats to biodiversity today, which, without action, will cause the extinction of countless species and destroy some of the world's most precious ecosystems\n- Climate change is a major threat to South African biodiversity, particularly in the hotspots of the Succulent Karoo; Cape Floral Kingdom and the Maputoland-Pondoland Albany\n- The impact of climate change on biodiversity is a focus of CAP’s partner civil society organizations (see below) and their objectives and interests in this regard are largely compatible\n- The potential for the benefits of collaboration is greater than for the sum of the work carried out by the above-mentioned organizations individually\n- The organizations have a common desire to collaborate in the field of climate change and biodiversity conservation\nCAP partners include:\n- BirdLife South Africa\n- The Botanical Society of South Africa\n- Conservation South Africa (CSA)\n- The Endangered Wildlife Trust (EWT)\n- The Wilderness Foundation\n- The Wildlands Conservation Trust\n- The Wildlife and Environment Society of South Africa (WESSA)\n- World Wide Fund for Nature South Africa (WWF-SA)"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"content_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:ef21cc66-04c4-4546-8413-2a3dc5bb83a4>","<urn:uuid:82853375-c136-4769-a699-015139e72594>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do the entrepreneurship support initiatives in Harlem compare with Columbia's Community Outreach programs in terms of their approaches to serving communities of color?","answer":"Both initiatives focus on serving communities of color but take different approaches. In Harlem, business incubators like the Lillian Project and Cofound Harlem provide direct entrepreneurial support through intensive programs, free space, and mentorship specifically for African-American entrepreneurs. The Lillian Project offers a 12-week program for African-American women, while Cofound provides $50,000 of in-kind services and requires businesses to stay in Harlem for four years. In contrast, Columbia's Community Outreach and Translation Core (COTC) focuses on environmental health improvements through bi-directional community-academic partnerships, developing educational materials, and facilitating research translation. They work with a Community Advisory and Stakeholders Board representing Northern Manhattan and Bronx residents, including healthcare professionals, advocates, and local government representatives, to address environmental health concerns in low-income urban communities of color.","context":["Editor’s Note: This is the first of a two-part series that examines entrepreneurship in Harlem, where NewsOne looks inside a few of the community’s business incubators. In Part 2, NewsOne explores how gentrification is helping to shape that growth.\nPromptly at 7 p.m., Gina Ramcharan started a marketing lesson for her class of African-American female entrepreneurs.\nThe group of 25 women, from Millennials to Baby Boomers, filled a nicely renovated co-working space on Lenox Avenue in Harlem. Many of them, after a full day of work, arrived with cups of coffee and snacks to help energize them through the evening.\nThey meet every Monday night for an intensive 12-week business incubator program for African-American women called the Lillian Project, organized by the Harlem Business Alliance. These businesswomen are part of the wave of entrepreneurs in Harlem who are revitalizing the historic mecca of African-American culture.\nFollowing The Steps Of ‘Pig Foot Mary’\nHarlem Business Alliance, which has fostered and advocated for Harlem’s Black-owned businesses for three decades, is a cornerstone in the business community.\nThe Lillian Project is named for Lillian Harris Dean, aka “pig foot Mary,” an entrepreneur who came to Harlem in 1901 from Mississippi and built a successful soul food business on her meager wages as a maid.\nThe first cohort, which graduates in December, is learning the nuts and bolts of starting and operating a successful business. It’s also a sisterhood in which the businesswomen encourage each other and share ideas.\nThe businesses range from an environmentally conscious entrepreneur building a clothing line from recycled fabrics to another who plans to launch an alcohol-infused cupcake business.\nA few of them, like Agzja Carey and Deondra Carter, plan to launch B Corps, a new category for companies that have a core social mission while also making profit.\nRamcharan said the selection committee chose Carter and Carey from among more than 100 applicants, in part, for their vision to create unique businesses that also fill community needs.\nCarey said she created the Sanaa Project LLC, an umbrella company for her education services, to deliver quality, innovative, cultural content that’s tailored to students and families of color.\nShe’s successfully provided programming under one of her brands, Crayons & Culture, in the Bedford Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn. With a new contract for services in Harlem, Carey said the Lillian Project is helping her to design an effective business model and to formulate a strategic plan for her expansion.\nCary, an experienced entrepreneur and social activist since 13, said education is her profession, but community organizing is at the core of what she does. The company’s mission is to “build institutions that redistribute the wealth and power among the Black community.”\nAccording to Ramcharan, many of Harlem’s growing number of affluent Black residents take their children outside the community for school and have to look elsewhere for the cultural context of their education.\nServices And Products Tailored For People Of Color\nCarter, a real estate agent, wants to tackle the housing affordability problem—a growing challenge not just in Harlem, but also throughout New York City.\n“I sell luxury condos and multi-million dollar renovated houses. But I see the need to help keep longtime residents in the community,” she said.\nCarter’s company, Co-Own Inc., will offer clients affordable housing options through collective purchasing power.\nShe has an “entrepreneurial gene,” inherited from her mother, experience operating small businesses, and has worked in marketing and financial services. The Lillian Project is helping her flesh out the details of her business plan.\nIn another part of the community, John Henry, managing director of Cofound Harlem, one of the community’s newest business incubators, is planting the seeds to create not just new businesses in Harlem, but also jobs and economic growth.\nHe negotiated a deal with a Harlem developer, who was committed to the community’s business development, to provide free space for the incubator and the new companies. In addition to rent-free space, Cofound offers its participants $50,000 of in-kind services and mentorship. Henry said he was able to get large companies, like Amazon and Google, to buy into their vision.\nIn exchange, the businesses in Cofound’s incubator must commit to staying in Harlem for at least four years.\nThe first cohort completed the 9-month program, which Henry calls a work in progress that he and his partners are fine-tuning. They selected just four companies out of about 150 applicants.\nHenry said Cofound selected Creatr as one of the four companies in the incubator for a few reasons: team dynamics, great concept and proven track record.\nCreatr is an online education platform, currently for photography but with a vision for additional virtual training in more intricate online design tools.\nStrategy Is The Name Of The Game\nJamall Oluokun, CEO of Creatr, told NewsOne that the idea came from the experience of operating Papercutmag.com, in which users submit photographs. He and his partners noticed that the quality of uploaded photographs was poor and decided to offer training through a membership-based site.\n“We’re at the launch stage,” said Oluokun, who has years of experience working in the technology media space and is optimistic about his company’s future. “Our mentors have been instrumental in the areas of networking and guiding us in marketing and distribution.”\nSilicon Harlem is also nurturing business growth in the community. It’s a for-profit company that is laying the infrastructure—both human and technological—to transform Harlem into an attractive venue for the tech industry.\nCofounder and CEO Clayton Banks explained that his company offers a virtual program. The organization advises companies, sits on their boards and helps them attract capital. Companies in its incubator range from financial technology to Internet of Things and digital education platforms.\nTogether, these incubators—and others scattered throughout the community—are nurturing the next generation of Harlem’s business leaders.\nPHOTO CREDIT: Getty, Nigel Roberts\nHarlem Incubators Nurturing Vibrant Start-Up Scene was originally published on newsone.com","Community Outreach and Translation Core\nThe Community Outreach and Translation Core (COTC) provides a community context for the environmental health sciences research occurring within the Center and supports the Center’s goal to translate its research into public health policy and community capacity. The mission is to improve environmental health of children in low-income, urban communities of color, such as those served by the Columbia Center for Children’s Environmental Health (The Center) This is achieved through the development of bi-directional community-academic partnerships. These partnerships communicate environmental health research to community groups, policy makers, healthcare professionals and voice the community’s needs and concerns within the Center. The COTC continually raises awareness of environmental health beyond the academic community and provides an avenue for researchers to understand the environmental health needs and concerns of the community. COTC provides four essential functions for the Center: oversee Community Advisory and Stakeholders Board, provide Community Outreach and Engagement, develop Health Education materials, and facilitate Research Translation which influences Policy Impact.\nSpecific aims of the COTC are to:\n- Engage and expand the CASB (formerly the CAB) to include community-based organizations, NYC local community boards, environmental organizations, and NYC government agencies.\n- Develop new educational materials that present current knowledge about the risks of endocrine disruptors and communicate the Center’s research findings through educational materials designed for local residents, community organizations, healthcare providers, and policymakers.\n- In collaboration with the Center’s Pediatric Health Specialist, facilitate education of public health and clinical professionals working in low-income communities of color.\n- Disseminate the Center’s findings using several communication methods.\n- Through our partnership with WE ACT, expand the capacity of low-income communities of color to advocate for improved environmental conditions by using the Center’s scientific findings and related findings by other investigators.\nCOMMUNITY OUTREACH & TRANSLATION CORE\nDAVID EVANS, PH.D.\nCOTC Co-Principal Investigator*\nProfessor Emeritus and Special Lecturer of Clinical Sociomedical Sciences, Columbia University College of Physicians & Surgeons and Joseph L.

{"question":"How do internal quality checks and customer surveys complement each other in measuring customer service quality, and what metrics should they track?","answer":"Internal quality checks and customer surveys complement each other by providing different perspectives on service quality. Internal quality checks measure agents' interactions through Internal Quality Score (IQS), rating performance against quality standards, while customer surveys like CSAT, NPS, or CES reveal customer perceptions of the product, support, and company overall. This dual approach is necessary because customers might focus on product features rather than service quality in surveys, while analyzing support interactions without customer feedback could be misleading. These metrics should be tracked alongside other indicators like Average Response Time, Average Resolution Time, First Response Time, and resolution rates (1, 2, and 3+ touch) to provide a comprehensive view of service quality.","context":["If you’re not exactly sure how to improve customer service — and how to measure it in the first place — you’re about to find the answers below.\nHow to measure customer support quality\nMost companies keep an eye on certain customer service metrics to see how well they’re doing. But if you’re specifically checking how high your support quality is, you need to look at a couple of different things:\n- Customer surveys: Think CSAT, NPS, or CES. They tell you what customers think about your product, support, and company overall.\n- Internal quality checks: This is where you measure your agents’ interactions and calculate the Internal Quality Score. IQS rates how well your agents are doing based on your quality standards.\nWhy bother with both? Well, customers might not know all the things you’re looking for in good customer service. Sometimes, when filling out surveys, they talk about other stuff like the product itself or features it’s missing.\nOn the other hand, analyzing your support interactions without taking into account how your customers feel might mislead you. Customer surveys help you stay on track toward your end goal: keeping customers satisfied.\nKeep in mind that you can only improve what you measure. So, if you analyze your agents’ interactions and give feedback to them, your support team will become better at what they do and your support quality will improve.\nHow to improve customer service quality\nIf you’ve just measured your support quality and it leaves a lot to be desired, here’s more about improving customer service:\nDefine your customer service strategy and vision\nEvery company has its own idea of what’s most important for its business and customers. Some are all about giving personalized assistance to boost product engagement and upsell, while others prefer quick and to-the-point interactions.\nStart by figuring out what you want your customer service to be like before diving into analyzing your support interactions. Basically, nail down what “quality” means for your team first.\nAsk yourself these questions to figure out your support vision and goals:\n- What do we do? Decide how much support you want to provide — whether it’s minimal support (like what Facebook offers, for example) or going the extra mile to ensure your support team improves customer loyalty and revenue.\n- Whom do we serve? Determine if you’re helping all customers equally or focusing on paying or premium ones.\n- How do we serve them? Choose your approach, whether it’s a self-help focus or aiming to provide excellent customer service.\nOnce you know what you want, it becomes easier to set achievable goals. After setting your support goals, check again if they align with your vision.\nHere are some examples of customer service goals:\n- Improve customer service quality by getting both IQS and CSAT above 90% by year-end (check out how Pipedrive did it using Klaus).\n- Respond to all tickets and keep First Response Times under 2 hours every month.\n- Maintain consistent support levels via phone and live chat with IQS over 90% across channels.\n- Upsell products in every interaction possible, scoring at least 80% in the “Upselling products” category in quality assurance reviews.\nCustomer service teams that set goals improve faster than those that don’t. Customer service goals will elevate your customer service experience. Read more about setting the right goals for your customer support team →\nGive your customer service representatives the tools and training they need\nIf you want your customers to have great experiences, your agents need to be set up for success. This means:\n- When choosing customer service software, consider your budget and the features you need. But also, make sure your agents like using it because that affects how well they interact with customers.\n- Involve your support agents in decisions, not just about tools but everything. Don’t just give orders.\n- Keep in touch with your team regularly. Provide resources through customer service training, team meetings, and one-on-one sessions with your agents.\n- Keep an eye on motivation levels. Make sure your support team feels appreciated — use shout-out channels on Slack, have fun group activities, and give out swag packages or surprise gifts.\nIn simple terms, making things better for your agents and helping them continuously improve customer service skills, usually makes customers happier and boosts customer service overall.\nMake sure your customer service team has the answers ready\nFirst things first, good training is a must if you want your team to do well. If they don’t really know your products or services, they can’t help customers fast.\nBut training just covers the basics. Your support reps should be ready to handle all sorts of questions about features, functions, and situations on the spot. Even with proper training, it’s hard for all your customer service agents to have all this info at their fingertips.\nThat’s why a knowledge base is a must-have for any successful support team. Here’s what to think about when setting one up:\n- Central repository: Put all the info your team needs in one place. Agents don’t have time to search through different knowledge bases during a chat.\n- Information structure: Keep your data neat and easy to search. A clear structure saves time instead of trying to figure out how to navigate the knowledge base.\n- Search functionality: Searching by keyword might take a bit longer, but it’s a game-changer with a huge knowledge base. Add a keyword-based search function to help agents out when they’re feeling a bit lost.\n- Up-to-date information: Check and update the info regularly. Your agents are your best resource for keeping your internal documents in good shape. Let them point out old articles and suggest new ones.\nBonus tip: Mix real-life customer scenarios into your training and knowledge base. It helps agents use what they’ve learned in actual customer interactions.\nEncourage your agents to respond quickly to customer questions\nBeing speedy is crucial, and how fast your team responds really affects the quality of service. Your customers want quick, helpful answers with a personal touch. Anything less might show up as negative in customer surveys.\n- Break down the average response time for each customer service rep to spot those not hitting their targets. Figure out what’s slowing them down and suggest ways they can work more efficiently.\n- If a group of agents is having trouble, think about having a training session. It’ll get everyone on the same page about when and how to respond to customer submissions and emphasize that response time is a metric you want to improve.\n- To speed things up, consider adding faster customer service channels (like live chat) on your website to give customers more choices. Just be careful not to overextend by being on too many channels if your team can’t handle it.\n- If you’re getting a lot of cases submitted outside of regular hours and on weekends, think about adjusting shifts. This is especially useful if you’re dealing with customers in different time zones.\n- Encourage the use of canned responses, templates, and shortcuts. They help avoid coming up with custom responses to the same questions each time and also reduce the number of keystrokes needed to send a reply.\nHave a feeling that your team is not fast enough? Before jumping to conclusions, make sure your customer service team has enough people, everyone is trained, and they have the right tools to get the job done. Only after confirming this should you start looking at how each individual is performing based on key indicators.\nFind out who might be taking a bit more time to respond to customers and how well they handle support requests. The goal is to figure out what might be slowing them down and suggest ways to speed things up. However, if they’re not the fastest but provide great customer service, it could be that your team is dealing with a lot of support requests, or maybe your expectations for response speed are a bit too high.\nProactively tackle potential customer issues before they arise\nEven if your product and service are top-notch, customer dissatisfaction can still happen. But there are ways to deal with these problems and provide proactive customer service before you start seeing a drop in support quality:\n- Map out the customer journey: Identify all the possible challenges customers might face, and create a plan to improve customer satisfaction that prevents those hypothetical issues.\n- Build a customer community: Create a space for your customers to connect and share experiences. Use this community to gain insights into how customers use your product and what they think about upcoming features.\n- Review interactions with churned customers: Take a close look at the support interactions and notes from customers who have churned to prevent similar issues with other customers.\n- Keep tabs on reviews and social media: Stay updated on what customers are saying on review sites and social media. You can even go a step further and identify areas where your competitors are falling short, turning it into an opportunity for your business.\nPromote a culture of empathy in your organization\nEmpathy is probably the most important skill you should be looking for when hiring for customer service – and for good reason.\nWhen customers feel heard and understood, they’re more likely to trust you. This, in turn, leads to better ratings on the customer satisfaction (CSAT) surveys you send out.\nBut for empathy to really work, it has to be a part of your company’s culture. Here are some tips to help make that happen:\n- Hire people who love helping: Look for individuals who are passionate about helping and share the same mission and values as your company.\n- Include empathy in onboarding: Make sure your onboarding process for new agents covers how you expect them to communicate with customers, including voice and tone, language, structure, and formatting.\n- Focus on client conversations: Dedicate early conversations with new clients to understand their needs, workflows, and the customers they serve.\n- Measure empathy: Create a separate quality assurance scorecard category to measure the empathy displayed by your team. You can give it more weight or mark it as a critical category, meaning a negative rating in this area could lead to the entire conversation being considered unsuccessful.\nWe use KHC (Kind, Honest, Confident) as our categories in the QA program. IQS gives us the space to learn how to help customers feel the love. CSAT just tells us if it’s working — and it does! This paradigm has powered several customer support teams from the high 70s for CSAT into the upper 90s.\nBuild a feedback loop to show you care\nWe’ve emphasized how crucial it is to let your customers know they’re being heard.\nThis involves not just collecting customer feedback through various methods but also having an efficient way to communicate it internally and represent the customer’s voice.\nYou can also systematically review support interactions to create a positive feedback loop, for example:\n- Review a random sample of your support interactions (or let Klaus identify and score the most relevant conversations automatically).\n- Evaluate support conversations based on your internal quality standards — or check AutoQA scores if applicable.\n- Give data-driven feedback to help improve the customer support team’s performance during coaching sessions.\n- Repeat the process consistently.\nThere’s no better way to show your customers you’re listening than by integrating their requests into your product.\nNow, granted, this won’t always be feasible. But even in such instances, you can still demonstrate that you’re paying attention by having one of your Product Managers directly explain why a specific feature, for instance, isn’t being developed.\nTrack customer service quality continuously\nBy reviewing all your customer interactions, you can spot and proactively address support quality issues, including agent burnout. Remember — leaving a customer service agent alone with their negative emotions is one of the worst solutions in this situation. Even the most hardened people can sometimes feel down about awkward conversations with customers and need someone to help overcome these bad days.\nSo you should always review the troublesome conversations and provide proper feedback to the affected agents. Customers do not know your quality standards, and you should not let them be the sole judges of the quality of your service. If a case receives a negative rating, analyze it from your perspective to understand if it was handled correctly according to your quality standards.\nDon’t forget to balance those negative cases by looking at the conversations that received remarkably good scores from the customers. Find the interactions that everyone in your team could learn from and give the agents the praise they deserve.","How to measure CSAT in Zendesk using AirOps\nCustomer Satisfaction Score (CSAT): What it is, why it’s important, and how to (easily) measure it.\nWhat is customer satisfaction score (CSAT)?\nA customer satisfaction score (CSAT) is a measurement of how satisfied customers are with a product, service, or encounter. While CSAT is a metric that can be heavily influenced by the customer service function, these scores aren’t always explicitly related to service.\nCSAT can be calculated in various ways, but the most common way is to ask customers to respond on a scale of 1-5 about their experience. The more satisfied your customer is, the higher your CSAT.\nWhen using a 5-point scale, 4 and 5 are typically considered satisfied. Sometimes, a simple thumbs up / thumbs down scale is used, especially for support interactions (e.g., “Did we fully resolve your concern today?”)\nHow to calculate your organization's CSAT\nMost organizations will track CSAT in a customer support tool like Zendesk (or another ticketing tool), which streamlines the measurement process and makes staying up-to-date a lot easier. You can also use this basic formula to calculate CSAT:\nCSAT = Number of satisfied respondents ÷ Number of total respondents\nSo, if 75 respondents answered with a 4 or 5, and you received 100 total responses, your CSAT score would be 75.\nHow to set up and calculate CSAT in Zendesk\nIn order to track CSAT in Zendesk, you need to enable CSAT within the platform:\n- Navigate to the Admin section of Zendesk\n- Click on the \"CSAT\" tab\n- Follow the prompts to set up your CSAT survey\nCSAT surveys for Zendesk Support are sent via email one day after the ticket is marked as solved. For Zendesk web, mobile, and social messaging, CSAT surveys are presented in the messaging interface immediately after the ticket is set to solved.\nTo calculate CSAT in Zendesk, you will need to:\n- Go to the \"Reports\" tab\n- Select the \"CSAT\" report\n- Select the date range you want to measure\n- Select the \"Export\" button\nYou will then be able to see the percentage of customers who rated their experience as \"Good\" or \"Excellent\".\nCSAT alone won’t provide a complete picture of your organization’s customer service, though. While it’s a helpful metric, you need to assess it alongside other data points if you want to measure overall performance and effectiveness.\nTrack CSAT scores alongside other important metrics\nOn its own, CSAT doesn’t provide a complete picture of customer satisfaction. If you want to get a real handle on how your customers feel (and why they feel how they feel), CSAT should be tracked alongside other metrics.\nAnd while tools like Zendesk are powerful, our experience has shown that customer service reps (CSRs) and managers find it way more convenient and powerful to access and analyze data in operating documents that they already know and love, like Google Sheets ❤️.\nGetting high-quality data into an operating document like a GSheet isn’t necessarily easy, though. Especially if it requires you to spend hours manually downloading CSVs from different sources and copying the data into a rickety, VLOOKUP-filled spreadsheet 👎.\nLuckily, there’s an easier way: AirOps.\nWith AirOps, business teams can create amazing sheets, docs, and tools using data from Zendesk, Hubspot, and countless other data sources. In addition to CSAT, AirOps makes it easy to track and assess other service-related metrics such as:\n- Open tickets\n- Pending tickets\n- On hold tickets\n- Average Response Time\n- Average Resolution Time\n- Customer Satisfaction (CSAT)\n- 1, 2, and 3+ touch resolution rates\n- Median first reply time\n… and more! Get in touch with our team to learn more and get started.\nFrequently asked questions about CSAT\nShould my organization measure CSAT?\nLike so many data-related questions, the answer to this one is “Yes, and… ”\nThere's no single answer to whether or not your organization should measure CSAT. Ultimately, it depends on your specific goals and needs. Measuring CSAT can be a helpful way to gauge customer satisfaction and track progress over time, but this metric alone isn’t going to provide a comprehensive overview of your customer service team’s performance.\nHere’s an example: All too often, it’s the angriest customers that are the most vocal and opinionated. If you’re seeing low CSAT scores and high Net Promoter Scores (NPS), figure out how to encourage more happy customers to fill out your surveys, too.\nBasically, CSAT is a helpful metric that can help you begin to assess how customers feel about your organization. It should always be considered alongside other customer service-related metrics, like Average Response Time and Average Resolution Time, because these metrics can have a direct impact on your CSAT.\nWhy measure CSAT – what are the benefits?\nThere are many benefits of measuring CSAT.\nFor starters, it’s a handy metric that helps customer service teams track performance and identify areas for improvement. When you track customer satisfaction over time, it’s also easier to gauge the success (or failure) of any changes that have been made to your customer service function. CSAT can also help your team determine which channels are most effective for customer service and engagement.\nUltimately, the goal of most customer support teams is to provide excellent customer service. CSAT is a solid KPI for measuring the quality of the service being provided and tracking how your team is performing against its goals.\nWhat is a good CSAT score?\nWhat constitutes a “good” CSAT score varies by industry. Generally, CSAT scores can be categorized into these ranges:\n😬 Below 50% – Needs improvement\n😐 50-70% – Fair\n😊 70-90% – Good\n🥇 Above 90% – Excellent\nBecause CSAT scores vary by industry, it's important to benchmark your score against others in your same field. For example, a score of 80% would be average for a restaurant, but an internet service provider with the same score would be knocking it out of the park.\nThe good news is that CSAT is a popular metric for customer service teams to track, so benchmark reports tend to be widely available. A good place to look for these reports is the American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI). The ACSI measures customer satisfaction across the U.S. economy for a wide range of industries. You can also check out Zendesk’s Industry Benchmark Analysis on Customer Service and Freshdesk’s Customer Happiness Benchmark Report.\nThere’s an important caveat to keep in mind when benchmarking your CSAT scores against peers, though: While industry benchmarks are great for getting a general idea of how your customer service stacks up, every business is unique. Every organization has different customers, different systems, and different products. These factors, and others, all play a role in customer satisfaction.\nAdditionally, benchmark reports generally don’t include information about how teams measure CSAT – survey methodology has a big impact on the type of responses you’ll receive. For example, if you only survey customers when they're having a support interaction, your CSAT score might skew lower because you're only reaching customers who have experienced an issue.\nTLDR; Take CSAT industry benchmarks with a grain of salt. They’re certainly useful, but they’re just one piece of the puzzle when determining what a “good” CSAT score is.\nWhat are the limitations of CSAT?\nCSAT can be a valuable metric for measuring customer satisfaction, but it’s not without limitations:\n- Not all tools track CSAT in the same way, which can lead to artificially inflated (or deflated) scores.\n- Getting customers to respond to your CSAT surveys can be difficult. Since you’ll always have customers who don’t respond, it’s difficult to get a complete picture of how satisfied they are.\n- People who do respond are often outliers, meaning they’re either incredibly happy or incredibly unhappy. Generally, people who are in the middle aren’t as likely to respond.\n- Customers sometimes misinterpret the questions being asked and/or the scale being used. For example, a customer might use the survey to rate the whole brand, not just their most recent interaction with your customer support team.\n- CSAT isn’t directly linked to business outcomes and correlating CSAT scores to revenue (or other metrics directly linked to business outcomes) can be quite tenuous, at best.\nAdditionally, a customer might feel frustrated because it was difficult to reach support in the first place… even if the service they eventually received was great. In this case, there’s another metric that can help you understand whether your customers are able to get the help they need when they need it: Customer Effort Score (CES).\nWhat are the differences between CSAT, Customer Effort Score (CES), and Net Promoter Score (NPS)?\nCSAT isn’t the only metric that measures customer satisfaction, CES and NPS also help organizations measure the customer experience. And while all three metrics rely on customer surveys, each one focuses on a different aspect of the customer’s experience:\n- Customer effort score, aka CES, is a measure of how easy it is for customers to use your product or service. Customers are asked to rate their level of effort on a scale from 1 to 5, with 1 being the easiest and 5 being the most difficult.\n- Net Promoter Score, aka NPS, is a measure of how likely customers are to recommend your product or service to others. Customers are generally asked to rate their level of recommendation on a scale from 1 to 10, with 1 being the least likely and 10 being the most likely.\nSo, which metric should you use to measure the experience that customers have with your brand? Like so many other data-related questions, it all depends on your goals. If your goal is to make your product or service easier to use, CES is a good choice. If you want to focus on customer loyalty and word-of-mouth marketing, then the NPS will be a better fit for your goals.\nHow can organizations improve their CSAT?\nIf you want to improve a low CSAT score, here are some things you can do:\nFocus on employee training\nSometimes, low CSAT scores are the result of an issue with training. If you suspect this could be the case, review negative scores in greater detail and see if you can identify any trends. For example, you might learn that your customer service team needs some extra training on how to properly handle customer complaints.\nCommunicate your goals\nIf you want to improve your CSAT score, one of the best things you can do is communicate this goal to your team. Make sure everyone is on the same page and knows what you're trying to achieve in terms of customer satisfaction. Once your team is aware of your goals, everyone can work together to come up with a plan to improve your CSAT score.\nAssess related metrics\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that your CSAT score is not the only metric you should be focusing on. While it's important to have a good score, you should also be looking at other metrics like Average Response Time, Average Resolution Time, and other metrics related to customer service. By improving these areas, you'll likely see an improvement in your CSAT score as well.\nAutomate as much of your customer support process as possible – this will free up your team's time so they can focus on delivering excellent support. (Within reason, of course… chatbots can only take you so far before customers become frustrated, after all.)\nAny automations that you implement should also fit into the wider customer support process. Organizations should have a clear, concise, and well-documented process for handling customer support issues. This will help to ensure that each issue is resolved in a timely and efficient manner, which improves customer satisfaction.\nImprove First Response Time (FRT)\nThere are a number of things you can do to improve your CSAT score, but one of the most important is to focus on reducing your First Response Time (FRT).\nFRT is the amount of time it takes for a support representative to respond to a customer's initial contact. The faster the response, the better your CSAT score will (theoretically) be – a positive first experience with your brand can be a powerful differentiating factor that entices customers to stay loyal and spend more.\nThere are a number of ways to reduce your FRT. One is to make sure you have enough staff on hand to handle customer inquiries in a timely manner. Another is to use automation to triage inquiries and route them to the appropriate team member.\nBear in mind that one side effect of tracking FRT is that agents may be incentivized to respond to cases quickly to \"stop the clock\" without truly addressing a customer's concern. At the risk of sounding like a broken record, this underlies why it's important to not over-index on any one metric.\nPrioritize quality conversations with customers\nIf you're looking to improve your CSAT score, one of the best things you can do is to focus on having quality conversations with your customers. This means taking the time to really listen to what they have to say and then responding in a way that is helpful and professional.\nSome tips for having quality conversations:\n- Review negative CSAT responses (even better if you can convince the unsatisfied customer to share what went wrong)\n- Share details from customer chats with the broader customer service team so people understand what a high-quality conversation looks like\n- Remind customer service reps to be patient and respectful, no matter what (easier said than done sometimes!0\nIf you can focus on having quality conversations with your customers, you will be well on your way to improving your CSAT score.\nMeet your customer's expectations\nIt's important to remember that your customers are the ones who will be using your product or service, so it's crucial to make sure that you're meeting their expectations. There are a few key ways to do this:\n- Make sure you're providing quality products or services. This is the most important factor in determining whether or not your customers will be satisfied.\n- Be responsive to your customer's needs and concerns. If they're not happy with something, take the time to listen to their feedback and make changes accordingly.\n- Keep your promises. If you say you're going to do something, make sure you follow through.\nWhat are some best practices for measuring CSAT?\nSome best practices for measuring CSAT are:\n- Use a consistent scale (e.g., 1-5, 1-10, thumbs up/down)\n- Use the same question wording each time\n- Ask the question at the right time (e.g., after the customer has received service)\n- Make it easy for the customer to respond (e.g., via a link in an email)\n- Use multiple question types (e.g., multiple choice, Likert scale)\n- Analyze the results over time to identify trends\nWhat are some common mistakes in measuring CSAT?\nWhile customer satisfaction (CSAT) is a useful metric, it is important to avoid some common mistakes in measuring it. These include:\n- Asking leading or loaded questions\n- Asking for ratings too soon after an interaction\n- Not providing an adequate sample size\n- Not using consistent question wording\n- Not using a reliable or valid statistical method\nRecommended resources related to CSAT"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:f7033783-b9af-4d8b-8889-2a20e3dd3012>","<urn:uuid:5b059de9-c52d-45be-8d97-f83cfcdbb8cb>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Why is the mile run test not a relevant measure of basketball-specific endurance? Please explain using game statistics.","answer":"The mile run test is not relevant for basketball because during an NBA game, which lasts about 2.5 hours, video analysis shows that players rarely run more than one mile total. At the high school level, with only 32 minutes of playing time, players likely run even less than half a mile during an entire game. Therefore, testing players' ability to run these distances quickly doesn't reflect the actual endurance requirements of basketball, as players need to cover these distances over a much longer period with frequent stops and breaks.","context":["|a youth basketball coaching and athletic resource PowerBasketball.com | Site Map | About Us | Contact Us | Advertise|\n|Coach's Clinic||Coaching Tips||Fundamentals||Books||Videos||Resources|\nDo Basketball Players Need Aerobics?\nby Charles Poliquin www.CharlesPoliquin.com\nRecently a father asked me about the testing protocols used by his sonís high school basketball coach. The coach had been using a mile run to test for aerobic endurance but then switched to a half-mile run. The father wanted to know if this was a wise decision, but he also pointed out that his team had won the state championship the previous year. OK, we have some issues here.\nFirst, to fulfill the definition of sports specificity, an acceptable time for a high school basketball player to be able to run a half mile would be 1 Ĺ to 2 hours. Sound crazy? Letís do some math.\nAl Vermeil won several world championship rings when he was a strength coach for the Chicago Bulls. Vermeil says that during a basketball game, video analysis shows itís rare that a single player will run as much as one mile by the time the final buzzer sounds. There are 48 minutes of playing time in an NBA game, but add to that all the timeouts, fouls, out-of-bounds and halftime Ė as a result, a typical NBA game will last about 2 Ĺ hours. It doesnít take a highly developed aerobic system to cover a mile in 2 Ĺ hours. At the high school level, total playing time is only 32 minutes, so even if a player were on the court the entire game, it is doubtful he or she would run a half mile. These numbers should dispel any idea that an aerobic base is necessary for basketball.\nAs for high school student whose team won the state championship Ė congratulations! But consider that with about six high school sport classifications in most of our 50 states, every year there are approximately 300 state championship basketball teams. And in high school, itís possible that one dominant player can make a significant difference in how well that team performs.\nIn his freshman year in high school, for example, LeBron James averaged 21 points and six rebounds a game, and his team finished with a 23-1 record and a state championship. Guess how the team did during the rest of Jamesí high school career? My point is that at the high school level, there are many factors that determine success in basketball, and when you do the math, having extraordinary aerobic endurance is probably not one of those factors.\nFurther, consider that if strength is an important component in basketball (and consider that high school athletes often play other sports such as football that do require considerable strength), aerobic training may compromise this physical quality. Letís explore.\nFor starters, it has been shown that athletes who have focused on aerobic training have fast-twitch fibers that behave like slow-twitch fibers. In other words, their fast-twitch fibers have greater endurance and smaller diameters, have a slower time to peak force, and are weaker. The fast-twitch fibers normally have large diameters, have a shorter time to peak force, and are stronger; but because in this case they were exposed to high volumes of aerobic work, the fibers adapted themselves to the training response.\nNext, when an athlete performs slow cyclical-type activities, the brain tends to organize muscle contractions in that manner. In other words, it is harder for the brain to organize ballistic, high-force muscle contractions. A Japanese study done a few years ago showed that the more you increase your V02 max, the more your vertical jump actually decreases Ė not a desirable result for a basketball player. And a Finnish study showed that doing aerobic work for the upper body makes your legs slower, showing that the negative power adaptation did not come from the muscle itself but from the nervous system.\nThe bottom line here is that itís important for coaches to conduct physical fitness tests on their athletes, but there are far better tests of endurance for a basketball player than a half-mile run.\nCharles Poliquin is one of the most accomplished strength coaches in the world. He has designed workouts for Olympic medalists in 17 different sports, world record holders in 10 different sports, and professional athletes in the NBA, NFL, NHL, MLB, and UK Premier League.

{"question":"What's the link between mold exposure and Hashimoto's thyroiditis? Give me the key mechanisms.","answer":"Mold exposure can contribute to Hashimoto's thyroiditis through multiple mechanisms: 1) In immunosuppressed individuals, common molds like Aspergillus can cause thyroiditis, with studies showing 20% of mold-affected patients had Aspergillus-infected thyroids, 2) Mold infections in sinuses can travel to the gut and cause leaky gut syndrome, which contributes to autoimmune disorders like Hashimoto's, 3) Mycotoxins from toxic molds can damage the blood-brain barrier, leading to increased immune sensitivity and stress, which raises the risk of autoimmune disease.","context":["The body’s immune system is a highly integrated and influential regulator of wellness. As such, disruption of the immune system can result in widespread dysfunction and the development of serious health issues. One of particular note is Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. There are many contributing factors of Hashimoto’s but a frequently overlooked one is exposure to molds.\nExperts state that exposure to molds can disrupt immune function thereby increasing the risk of Hashimoto’s. Being familiar with the connection between mold and Hashimoto’s may help you better identify and resolve autoimmune thyroid issues.\nUnderstanding Toxic and Non-toxic Molds\nMold has earned a certain reputation. Many believe mold is entirely harmful with no redeeming qualities. However, it is important to note that not every member in the mold family is dangerous. Many molds are beneficial as nutrient-rich foods and for use in various pharmaceutical applications. That being said, some molds are highly damaging and toxic.\nToxigenic molds produce harmful metabolites called mycotoxins. Exposure to these toxins is associated with neurological dysfunction, immune malfunction, chronic inflammation, and even life-threatening conditions. Unfortunately, many individuals unwittingly come into contact with these toxins on a daily basis. Worse still, studies suggest that exposure to mycotoxins may increase the risk of autoimmune disorders including Hashimoto’s.\nAn Introduction to Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis\nHashimoto’s thyroiditis is an autoimmune thyroid disorder wherein the body’s immune system wrongfully identifies healthy thyroid tissue as a threat. It then releases antibodies to attack the thyroid gland. The result of this misguided assault is irreparable thyroid damage that facilitates the development of hypothyroidism. This is accompanied by symptoms such as weight gain, depression, difficulty thinking clearly, endless fatigue, and others – get a full list of thyroid disease symptoms here.\nHashimoto’s may also trigger symptoms more consistent with hyperthyroidism. When thyroid tissue is destroyed it releases the thyroid hormones it previously contained all at once. This surge of thyroid hormone triggers a temporary hastening of bodily function that may cause symptoms such as anxiety, jitteriness, sweating, and difficulty focusing. The occurrence of these inconsistent hyperthyroid-like symptoms is known as Hashitoxicosis.\nThe Connection Between Mold and Hashimoto’s\nExposure to substances that the body is not equipped to manage can put stress on the gastrointestinal tract and immune system. If sustained, this stress can trigger dysfunction and subsequent autoimmune disorders. A common but often overlooked autoimmune stressor is mold. However, mold does more than place strain on the immune system. Studies suggest that exposure to mold can contribute to the development of Hashimoto’s through multiple mechanisms.\nExposure to common molds such as Aspergillus may encourage thyroiditis (inflammation of the thyroid) in those suffering from immunosuppression. One study found that as much as 20 percent of the test participants affected by mold-related illness had thyroids infected with Aspergillus mold. Chronic inflammation of the thyroid facilitated by such an infection encourages Hashimoto’s development.\nEncouraging Leaky Gut\nMold infections of the sinus may contribute to leaky gut and subsequent Hashimoto’s. Sinus infections often travel to the gut where they may contribute to intestinal permeability or leaky gut syndrome. Leaky gut generated from mold exposure is recognized as a powerful contributor to autoimmune disorders like Hashimoto’s.\nIncreasing Immune Sensitivity\nMycotoxins, such as those released by toxigenic molds, are able to pass through and damage the blood-brain barrier. This can disrupt neurological function while also encouraging the development of new sensitivities and allergies. Greater sensitivity means increased immune activity and stress. As the immune system becomes increasingly taxed, the risk of autoimmune disease also increases.\nTesting for Mold in Your Environment and Body\nResolving mold-related autoimmune dysfunction requires thorough examination of both your environment and your body.\nMolds and their spores can be difficult or virtually impossible to identify with the naked eye. Therefore, it may be beneficial to enlist the aid of an expert who is equipped to test air quality and common mold habitats. You may also consider a home testing kit. This method allows you to gather and send out samples and receive results directly.\nComprehensive testing for mold in the body requires multiple tests. Ideally, testing includes areas prone to mold infection such as the intestines, sinuses, and thyroid. Depending on the type of test, stool, urine, or blood samples may be screened for signs of mold. Regardless of the test results, treatment of mold in the body should always involve reducing exposure to it.\nLimiting Mold Exposure\nEven if you don’t identify a mold issue in your immediate environment, it may be worthwhile to employ healthy mold managing techniques. Below are some effective ways of reducing your mold exposure in your home and elsewhere:\n- Eliminate uncontrolled sources of moisture such as leaks\n- Facilitate better airflow by eliminating clutter and giving enough space for air to pass around furniture\n- Invest in a high-quality air filter to eliminate airborne molds and allergens\n- Regularly clean duct work, at minimum every two years\n- Replace cardboard boxes with plastic containers\n- Use a dehumidifier to keep humidity levels below 40 percent\nIf mold is present in your home or workplace it is almost assured that you are exposed to mold on a regular basis. You can help reduce your exposure to molds by removing or cleaning the following mold-prone areas:\n- Cardboard boxes\n- HVAC filters\n- Under sinks\n- Washing machines\n- Water pipes\n- Any moist or poorly ventilated areas\nAlthough mold in our environment is a major source of exposure, a great deal of mold is actually introduced to the body via the foods we eat. Therefore, making dietary improvements can significantly reduce mold exposure. Many commonly consumed foods can carry difficult-to-sense molds that can be mistakenly consumed. If you want to limit your mold exposure, consider reducing intake or entirely eliminating the following foods from your diet:\n- Aged cheeses\n- Dried fruits\n- Over-ripened produce\n- Processed meats\n- Tomato products\n- Wine vinegar\nCombat Thyroid Disease by Doing Away with Mold\nAutoimmune disease such as Hashimoto’s can have a long-lasting and potentially devastating effect on your health. Although there are many factors involved in the development of this autoimmune thyroid disorder, perhaps one of the most insidious is mold.\nStudies suggest that regular exposure to even common molds can contribute to immune dysregulation and the development of Hashimoto’s. Fortunately, by employing mold-managing techniques and appreciating the influence of mold on immune function we can better protect ourselves from potential autoimmune disease like Hashimoto’s.\nResources1.

{"question":"What are the mandatory closure policies for wildlife areas during severe weather, and what specific precautions are needed to protect both humans and animals from heat-related risks?","answer":"NPWS properties in the Western Region, including Connemara National Park and Wild Nephin National Park, must close during Status Orange and Red warnings for wind, rain, snow, low temperatures, fog, thunderstorms, and coastal winds in Galway and Mayo counties. For protecting against heat-related risks, humans should stay hydrated, avoid sun exposure between 11 AM-3 PM, wear loose-fitting clothing, and use high SPF sunscreen. Animals require special attention - pets should never be left in cars during hot weather, must have plenty of clean fresh water, and need access to cool, shady resting places. Pet food dishes should be covered to prevent fly eggs, and owners should contact a vet if they suspect heatstroke in their animals.","context":["National Weather Warnings\nIn adverse weather conditions Weather Warnings may be issued by Met Éireann. The core rationale for issuing Weather Warnings is to protect the lives and livelihoods of all of the nation’s citizens, and to mitigate damage to property and disturbance to economic activity at times of severe weather.\nWeather Warnings are presented in three categories:\nA. STATUS YELLOW – Weather Alert – Be Aware. The concept behind YELLOW level weather alerts is to notify those who are at risk because of their location and/or activity, and to allow them to take preventative action. It is implicit that YELLOW level weather alerts are for weather conditions that do not pose an immediate threat to the general population, but only to those exposed to risk by nature of their location and/or activity.\nB. STATUS ORANGE – Weather Warning – Be Prepared. This category of ORANGE level weather warnings is for weather conditions which have the capacity to impact significantly on people in the affected areas. The issue of an Orange level weather warning implies that all recipients in the affected areas should prepare themselves in an appropriate way for the anticipated conditions.\nC. STATUS RED – Severe Weather Warning – Take Action. The issue of RED level severe weather warnings should be a comparatively rare event and implies that recipients take action to protect themselves and/or their properties; this could be by moving their families out of the danger zone temporarily; by staying indoors; or by other specific actions aimed at mitigating the effects of the weather conditions.\nHazards deriving from the following weather-related types are covered by Met Éireann’s weather warnings system:\n4. Low Temperatures\n6. High Temperatures\n8. Coastal Wind Warnings\nIn the event of STATUS ORANGE – Weather Warnings and STATUS RED – Severe Weather Warnings in relation to Wind, Rain, Snow, Low Temperatures, Fog, Thunderstorms and Coastal Winds for the Counties of Galway and Mayo, all National Parks & Wildlife Service (NPWS) properties in the Western Region will be closed for the duration of such warnings. Sites to be closed include:\nConnemara National Park\nWild Nephin National Park\nDerryclare Nature Reserve\nOld Head Nature Reserve\nKnockma Wood, near Tuam, Co. Galway\nLaughil Wood, near Pontoon, Co. Mayo\nPlease note for STATUS YELLOW – Weather Alerts, in relation to Wind, Rain, Snow Low Temperatures, Fog, Thunderstorms and Coastal Winds for the Counties of Galway and Mayo, all National Parks & Wildlife Service (NPWS) properties in the Western Region will remain open for the duration of the weather warnings, except where otherwise notified. However, the National Parks & Wildlife Service (NPWS) asks that any visitors and recreational users visiting our properties during these weather warnings, be aware of additional risks and hazards associated with the specific type of weather warning at our properties. Please be aware that there may be additional risk of falling/fallen trees, flying debris, trips/falls, being blown off exposed tracks and pathway, slips, hypothermia, flooding, etc.. Visitors and recreational users visiting our properties during these weather warnings should take the necessary preventative action, including avoidance, to minimise the risk of injury.\nAdditional information regarding Weather Warnings is available from Met Éireann (see https://www.met.ie/weather-warnings).","Be prepared for hot weather\nSummer temperatures in Northern Ireland can be a risk to health. It is important to make sure you and those you care for are suitably hydrated. Dehydration can cause significant health problems and lead to death in extreme cases. Young children and the elderly are most at risk. They may be unaware of becoming overheated and not drinking enough liquids to stay hydrated.\nIf you are worried about the summer heat you can find information on the Met Office website. Organisations like Age Concern Help the Aged NI have useful tips on how to stay cool in summer.\nYou can follow some simple guidelines to stay fit and well during a long warm spell:\n- try to stay out of the sun, particularly when it is at its highest between 11.00 am and 3.00 pm\n- stock up on supplies like medicines, food and non-alcoholic drinks, so you won’t have to go out in the heat\n- keep your home cool - shutting windows when it's hotter outside than inside may help\n- open your windows at night - when it's cooler\n- keep drinking fluids\n- do strenuous outdoor activities, like DIY or gardening during cooler parts of the day, like early morning\n- keep alcohol drinking to a minimum - it dehydrates the body\n- avoid heavy and hot food; modify your diet to include plenty of fruit and salad as this helps keep you hydrated\n- use a sun cream with a high sun protection factor - also known as 'SPF' - for protection from the sun's harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation\nSunscreen and sun safety\n- wear light, loose-fitting clothing, such as cotton, so sweat can evaporate\n- if you feel sick or dizzy, keep out of the sun and seek medical advice\nYou must also take care of pets during warm weather. Make sure they have plenty of ventilation and liquid to stay hydrated.\nKeep your house cool\nIn hot weather, stay inside the coolest rooms in your house as much as possible. These are probably the rooms that get little sun during the day. To help keep all rooms in your house cool, you can:\n- close pale-coloured curtains – closing dark curtains and metal blinds can make rooms hotter\n- keep windows closed when it’s hotter outside than inside, but open them if the room gets too hot\n- open windows at night when the air is cooler, but close ground floor windows when you leave the house or go to bed\nTake extra care with food in hot weather\nWhen it’s hot, bacteria on food can multiply very quickly, which increases the risk of food poisoning. So, it’s important to make sure food is:\n- kept in cooler bags when taking it home from the supermarket or out for a picnic\n- put in the fridge as soon as you get home - the temperature of the fridge should be between 0 and 5 degrees Celsius\n- kept out of the sun\n- only out of the fridge for the shortest time possible – no more than a couple of hours\nYou can find out more about food hygiene and how to avoid food poisoning at the following nidirect page:\nTake care with bins and waste\nBins and waste can attract flies and maggots and start to smell in the heat, so make sure you:\n- move bins out of direct sunlight and keep their lids closed at all times\n- double bag food waste and nappies and squeeze the air out of the top of the bags before you tie them\n- clean bins with disinfectant after they have been emptied – you can pour boiling water over them to kill any maggots\n- recycle as much as possible to reduce waste\nFor more information about bin and waste collection and recycling, contact your local council.\nLooking after pets\nYour pets and other animals can also suffer heatstroke in hot weather if they don’t keep cool. Never leave animals inside a car on a hot day and make sure they have:\n- plenty of clean, fresh water to drink\n- a cool and shady place to rest\nIt’s also important to cover pet food dishes to prevent flies laying eggs on the food.\nContact a vet if you are worried that an animal is suffering from heatstroke. More information about looking after pets in hot weather is on the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) website.\nDuring hot and dry weather, avoid bonfires and be extra careful with barbecues. Dry ground in the summer increases the risk of fire.

{"question":"What are the benefits of deep reinforcement learning for autonomous systems, and what are the key challenges in its practical implementation?","answer":"Deep reinforcement learning offers powerful capabilities for autonomous systems, serving as a strong alternative to traditional model-based approaches for decision-making, planning, and control. However, its practical implementation faces several significant challenges. The key benefits include the ability to solve complex decision-making problems through trial-and-error interactions with dynamic environments, and the capacity to perform tasks without explicit programming using neural networks that can encode complex behaviors. The main challenges include high sample complexity in large-scale problems, limited transferability, lack of robustness guarantees, and the difficulty in establishing formal performance guarantees due to the 'black box' nature of neural networks. Additionally, reinforcement learning requires extensive training time, potentially taking days even for relatively simple applications, and demands careful problem setup including architecture selection and hyperparameter tuning.","context":["IEEE.org | IEEE Xplore Digital Library | IEEE Standards | IEEE Spectrum | More Sites\nCall for Award Nominations\nMachine learning-based techniques have recently revolutionized nearly every aspect of autonomy. In particular, deep reinforcement learning (RL) has rapidly become a powerful alternative to classical model-based approaches to decision-making, planning, and control. Despite the well-publicized successes of deep RL, its adoption in complex and/or safety-critical tasks at scale and in real-world settings is hindered by several key issues, including high sample complexity in large-scale problems, limited transferability, and lack of robustness guarantees. This talk explores our recently developed solutions that address these fundamental challenges for both single and multiagent RL. In addition, this talk highlights the complementary role that classical model-based techniques can play in synergy with data-driven methods in overcoming these issues. Real experiments with ground and aerial robots will be used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques. The talk will conclude with an assessment of the state of the art and highlight important avenues for future research.\nThere are many interesting dynamical systems that can be regarded as hierarchically networked systems in a variety of fields including control. One of the ideas to treat those systems properly is \"Glocal (Global/Local) Control,\" which means that the global purpose is achieved by local actions of measurement and control cooperatively. The key for realization of glocal control is hierarchically networked dynamical systems with multiple resolutions in time and space depending on the layer, which introduce many new theoretical control challenges aiming at practical effectiveness in synthetic biology and engineering. The main issues may include how to achieve synchronization by decentralized control and how to make a compromise of two different objectives, one for global and the other for local operations. The background, the idea, and the concept of glocal control are addressed based on an understanding of Internet of Things (IoT) from the control perspective. This talk presents two research topics, namely, (1) hierarchically decentralized control for networked dynamical systems, and (2) robust instability analysis for a class of uncertain nonlinear networked systems.\nRegarding the first topic, we propose a theoretical framework for hierarchically decentralized control of networked dynamical systems that can take account of the tradeoff between the global and local objectives to achieve the desired harmony under change of the environments. Several new ideas, by exploiting the special structure of the target systems, enable us to develop scalable control design methods based on the powerful theory in classical, modern, and robust control. The effectiveness of the new theoretical foundations on the analysis and synthesis is experimentally confirmed by applications to electric vehicle control.\nThe second topic is quite new. It is on robust instability analysis for guaranteed persistence of nonlinear oscillations in the presence of a dynamic perturbation, which is important in synthetic biology. The problem of robust instability has a very different feature from that of robust stability, and hence a new theoretical setting is needed. We define the instability margin as the infimum of the H-infinity norm of the stable perturbation that stabilizes an equilibrium point for a class of nonlinear networked systems. To this end, we introduce a notion of the robust instability radius (RIR) for linear systems and provide a systematic way of finding the exact RIR. Based on this result, the instability margin can be analyzed exactly, with an additional theoretical investigation on how to properly treat the change of the equilibrium point due to the perturbation. The results are applied to the Repressilator in synthetic biology, and the effectiveness is confirmed by numerical simulations.\nMathematics plays a fundamental role in disciplines such as physics, engineering, computer science, and chemistry and has been more recently accepted as a suitable language for solving problems in biology, biochemistry, and medicine.\nControl theory is part of the mathematical world and has the peculiarity of borrowing tools from different branches of mathematics. Interestingly, many of the techniques conceived and routinely used to solve control problems can be quite successfully adapted to solve new relevant problems, both practical and curiosity-driven, in other fields.\nThis talk discusses the structural analysis of systems, aimed at explaining how mechanisms work, why they work in a certain way, and to which extent they perform their task properly even in the presence of perturbations and disturbances.\nThe first part of the talk briefly introduces some preliminary motivating examples of mechanisms, borrowed from other disciplines alien to control theory, to show how a control approach can be very powerful to understand fundamental principles.\nThe second part introduces the definitions of structural versus robust properties, discussing paradigmatic case studies from the literature. Robust stability analysis is presented in an inverse form: \"We know that this system is stable, but why is the system so incredibly stable?\". Other fundamental concepts such as (perfect) adaptation, structural steady-state analysis, graph loop analysis, and aggregation are considered.\nThe third part discusses application examples from biology and biochemistry, to showcase the potential impact that the mathematical approach of control theory, suitably revised, can have in these disciplines and how interdisciplinary research can bring fresh ideas to control theorists.\nExisting control design and verification methods are limited in their ability to address large numbers of interacting agents, multiple layers of feedback, and complex system-level requirements. This talk will demonstrate a strategy for overcoming this limitation with compositional and hierarchical approaches. The compositional approach exposes a complex system as an interconnection of smaller subsystems and derives system-level guarantees from subsystem properties. The hierarchical approach decomposes the synthesis and verification tasks into layers, from high-level decision making to low-level control synthesis. Taken together, these approaches break apart intractably large design and verification problems into subproblems of manageable size. In addition to broadly applicable methodology, the talk will present numerous motivating applications and experimental results, involving multicellular biological systems, fleets of autonomous vehicles, and a multiscale traffic management system.","Emmanouil Tzorakoleftherakis is the product manager for Reinforcement Learning and…\nIf you are following technology news, you have likely already read about how AI programs trained with reinforcement learning beat human players in board games like Go and chess, as well as video games. As an engineer, scientist, or researcher, you may want to take advantage of this new and growing technology, but where do you start? The best place to begin is to understand what the concept is, how to implement it, and whether it’s the right approach for a given problem.\nIf we simplify the concept, at its foundation, reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning that has the potential to solve tough decision-making problems. But to truly understand how it impacts us, we need to answer three key questions:\n- What is reinforcement learning and why should I consider it when solving my problem?\n- When is reinforcement learning the right approach?\n- What is the workflow I should follow to solve my reinforcement learning problem?\nWhat Is Reinforcement Learning?\nReinforcement learning is a type of machine learning in which a computer learns to perform a task through repeated trial-and-error interactions with a dynamic environment. This learning approach enables the computer to make a series of decisions that maximize a reward metric for the task without human intervention and without being explicitly programmed to achieve the task.\nTo better understand reinforcement learning, let’s look at a real-world equivalent situation. Figure 1 shows a general representation of training a dog using reinforcement learning.\nThe goal of reinforcement learning in this case is to train the dog (agent) to complete a task within an environment, which includes the surroundings of the dog as well as the trainer. First, the trainer issues a command or cue, which the dog observes (observation). The dog then responds by taking an action. If the action is close to the desired behavior, the trainer will likely provide a reward, such as a food treat or a toy; otherwise, no reward or a negative reward will be provided. At the beginning of training, the dog will likely take more random actions like rolling over when the command given is “sit,” as it is trying to associate specific observations with actions and rewards. This association, or mapping, between observations and actions is called policy. From the dog’s perspective, the ideal case would be one in which it would respond correctly to every cue, so that it gets as many treats as possible. So, the whole meaning of reinforcement learning training is to “tune” the dog’s policy so that it learns the desired behaviors that will maximize some reward. After training is complete, the dog should be able to observe the owner and take the appropriate action, for example, sitting when commanded to “sit” by using the internal policy it has developed. By this point, treats are welcome but shouldn’t be necessary (theoretically speaking!).\nBased on the dog training example, consider the task of parking a vehicle using an automated driving system (Figure 2). The goal of this task is for the vehicle computer (agent) to park the vehicle in the correct parking spot with the right orientation. Like the dog training case, the environment here is everything outside the agent and could include the dynamics of the vehicle, other vehicles that may be nearby, weather conditions, and so on. During training, the agent uses readings from sensors such as cameras, GPS, and lidar (observations) to generate steering, braking, and acceleration commands (actions). To learn how to generate the correct actions from the observations (policy tuning), the agent repeatedly tries to park the vehicle using a trial-and-error process. A reward signal can be provided to evaluate the goodness of a trial and to guide the learning process.\nIn the dog training example, training is happening inside the dog’s brain. In the autonomous parking example, training is supervised by a training algorithm. The training algorithm is responsible for tuning the agent’s policy based on the collected sensor readings, actions, and rewards. After training is complete, the vehicle’s computer should be able to park using only the tuned policy and sensor readings.\nWhen Is Reinforcement Learning the Right Approach?\nMany reinforcement learning training algorithms have been developed to date; this article does not cover training algorithms, but it is worth mentioning that some of the most popular ones rely on deep neural network policies. The biggest advantage of neural networks is that they can encode really complex behaviors, which opens up the use of reinforcement learning in applications that are otherwise intractable or very challenging to tackle with alternative methods, including traditional algorithms. For example, in autonomous driving, a neural network can replace the driver and decide how to turn the steering wheel by simultaneously looking at input from multiple sensors, such as camera frames and lidar measurements (end-to-end solution). Without neural networks, the problem would normally be broken down into smaller pieces: a module that analyzes the camera input to identify useful features, another module that filters the lidar measurements, possibly one component that would aim to paint the full picture of the vehicle’s surroundings by fusing the sensor outputs, a “driver” module, and more! However, the benefit of end-to-end solutions comes with a few drawbacks.\nA trained deep neural network policy is often treated as a “black box,” meaning that the internal structure of the neural network is so complex, often consisting of millions of parameters, that it is almost impossible to understand, explain, and evaluate the decisions taken by the network (left side of Figure 3). This makes it hard to establish formal performance guarantees with neural network policies. Think of it this way: Even if you train your pet, there will still be occasions when your commands will go unnoticed.\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that reinforcement learning is not sample efficient. This means that, in general, a lot of training is required in order to reach acceptable performance. As an example, AlphaGo, the first computer program to defeat a world champion at the game of Go, was trained nonstop for a period of a few days by playing millions of games, accumulating thousands of years of human knowledge. Even for relatively simple applications, training time can take anywhere from minutes to hours or days. Finally, setting up the problem correctly can be tricky; many design decisions need to be made, which may require a few iterations to get it right (right side of Figure 3). These decisions include, for example, selecting the appropriate architecture for the neural networks, tuning hyperparameters, and shaping the reward signal.\nIn summary, if you are working on a time- or safety-critical project that you could potentially approach with alternative, traditional ways, reinforcement learning may not be the best thing to try first. Otherwise, give it a go!\nReinforcement Learning Workflow\nThe general workflow for training an agent using reinforcement learning includes the following steps (Figure 4).\n1. Create the Environment\nFirst you need to define the environment within which the agent operates, including the interface between agent and environment. The environment can be either a simulation model or a real physical system. Simulated environments are usually a good first step since they are safer (real hardware is expensive!) and allow experimentation.\n2. Define the Reward\nNext, specify the reward signal that the agent uses to measure its performance against the task goals and how this signal is calculated from the environment. Reward shaping can be tricky and may require a few iterations to get right.\n3. Create the Agent\nIn this step, you create the agent. The agent consists of the policy and the training algorithm (refer back to Figure 2), so you need to:\na. Choose a way to represent the policy (e.g., using neural networks or look-up tables).\nb. Select the appropriate training algorithm. Different representations are often tied to specific categories of training algorithms, but in general, most modern algorithms rely on neural networks because they are good candidates for large state/action spaces and complex problems.\n4. Train and Validate the Agent\nSet up training options (e.g., stopping criteria) and train the agent to tune the policy. Make sure to validate the trained policy after training ends. Training can take anywhere from minutes to days depending on the application. For complex applications, parallelizing training on multiple CPUs, GPUs, and computer clusters will speed things up.\n5. Deploy the Policy\nDeploy the trained policy representation using, for example, generated C/C++ or CUDA code. No need to worry about agents and training algorithms at this point—the policy is a standalone decision-making system!\nTraining an agent using reinforcement learning is an iterative process. Decisions and results in later stages can require you to return to an earlier stage in the learning workflow. For example, if the training process does not converge on an optimal policy within a reasonable amount of time, you may have to update any of the following before retraining the agent:\n- Training settings\n- Learning algorithm configuration\n- Policy representation\n- Reward signal definition\n- Action and observation signals\n- Environment dynamics\nToday, tools like Reinforcement Learning Toolbox (Figure 5) can help you quickly learn and implement controllers and decision-making algorithms for complex systems such as robots and autonomous systems.\nRegardless of the choice of tool, before deciding to adopt reinforcement learning, do not forget to ask yourself: “Given the time and resources I have for this project, is reinforcement learning the right approach for me?”\nTo learn more about reinforcement learning, see the links below.\n- Reinforcement Learning (webpage): Learn about reinforcement learning and how MATLAB and Simulink can support the complete workflow for designing and deploying a reinforcement learning based controller.\n- Train DQN Agent to Balance Cart-Pole System (example): Find out how to train a deep Q-learning network (DQN) agent to balance a cart-pole system modeled in MATLAB.\n- Train Biped Robot to Walk Using DDPG Agent (example): Find out how to train a biped robot, modeled in Simscape Multibody, to walk using a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) agent.\n- Reinforcement Learning (video series): Watch an overview of reinforcement learning, a type of machine learning that has the potential to solve some control system problems that are too difficult to solve with traditional techniques.\nReinforcement Learning with MATLAB (ebook): Find out how to get started with reinforcement learning in MATLAB and Simulink by explaining the terminology and providing access to examples, tutorials, and trial software.\nSubscribe to our NewsletterGet the latest updates and relevant offers by sharing your email.\nYou can write for us and be one of the 500+ experts who have contributed stories at AIM.

{"question":"what's the main advantage of using DVCS over CVCS for offline development?","answer":"DVCS enables working offline - all operations except push and pull can be performed locally since developers have a complete copy of the repository on their hard drive. Only pushing and pulling activities require internet connectivity, while CVCS relies on internet connectivity for access to the server.","context":["Reading time: 30 minutes\nDistributed version control system (DVCS) is a type of version control system like Git that replicates the repository onto each user’s machine that is each user has a self-contained first-class repository. The other type is Centralised Version Control (CVCS).\nThere is no need for a privileged master repository, though teams have it by convention, for doing continuous integration.\nDVCS has emerged from the thought process that every developer has their own local repository, apart from the central repository. This way, they they don’t check out a snapshot of the source code, but they fully mirror the central repository. This means, DVCSs do not rely completely on the central server for all the versions of the source code, every developer has a clone of the source file that is available in the central repository, and the complete history of the project is available on their own hard drive. This clone has all the metadata of the original source file.\nA developer, by means of ‘pulling’, gets the new changes from the central repository to the local repository. Developer’s changes are then applied to the code in the local repository and then ‘pushed’ back to the central repository.\nAdvantages of Distributed Version Control System\n- Other than push and pull, all actions can be performed very quickly, since it is the hard drive, and not the remote server that is accessed every time.\n- Changesets can be committed to the local repository first and then a group of these changesets can be pushed to the central repository in a single shot.\n- Only the pushing and pulling activities need internet connectivity; everything else can be managed locally.\n- Every developer has a complete copy of the entire repository and the impact any change can be checked locally before the code is pushed to the central repository.\n- DVCS is built to handle changes efficiently, since every change has a Global Unique Identifier (GUID) that makes it easy to track.\n- Tasks like branching and merging can be done with ease, since every developer has their own branch and every shared change is like reverse integration\n- DVCS is very easy to manage compared to CVCS.\nDisadvantages of Distributed Version Control System\n- With many projects, large binary files that are difficult to compress, will occupy more space.\n- Projects with a long history, i.e., a large number of changesets may take a lot of time and occupy more disk space.\n- With DVCS, a backup is still needed, since the latest updated version may not be available to all the developers.\n- Though DVCS doesn’t prevent having a central server, not having a central server might cause confusions in identifying the right recent version.\n- Though every repo has its own revision numbers, releases have to be tagged with appropriate names to avoid confusions.\nDistributed Version Control (DVCS) vs Centralised Version Control (CVCS)\n- DVCS focuses on sharing changes; every change has a guid or unique id.\n- Every developer has one local copy of the source code repository, in addition to the central source code repository.\n- Distributed systems have no forced structure. You can create “centrally administered” locations or keep everyone as peers.\n- DVCS enables working offline. Apart from push and pull actions, everything is done locally.\n- CVCS focuses on synchronizing, tracking, and backing up files.\n- CVCS works based on a client-server relationship, with the source repository located on one single server, providing access to developers across the globe.\n- Recording/downloading and applying a change are separate steps in a centralized system, they happen together.\n- CVCS relies on internet connectivity for access to the server.\nDistributed Version Control Key Points\n1. Private Workspace\nAlmost all version control tools offer a private workspace. In CVCS, developers get a working copy of the files, which acts as the private space. With DVCS developers get the complete repository as a private copy, which is the most important point to note about DVCS.\nThis private workspace provides an added advantage in the sense that the developers never have to think about coordinating with others during the development. When there are multiple developers in a team, the situation becomes complex. Normally, version control systems take this responsibility of managing the complexities. With the private space in DVCS, a developer gets a feel that he/she is working alone on the project, for at least a while. Developers have the flexibility to do anything within their private workspace, without affecting the workflow of other developers.\n2. Easier Merging\nBranching is easy as compared to merging. Branching is like two people going off in their own directions and not collaborating.\nPeople using a CVCS usually avoid branching because most of the centralized tools aren’t good at merging. But on switching to a DVCS, they tend to bring that attitude with them, even though it’s not really necessary. Decentralized tools are better at merging.\nThe reasons are as follows:\n- They’re built on a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAGs). Merge algorithms need prior information about history. A DAG is a better way to represent that kind of information than the techniques used by most centralized tools.\n- DVCS keeps the developer’s changes distinct from the merge he/she had to do in order to get the changes committed. This approach is less error-prone, as the developer’s changes are already cleanly tucked away (during commit time) in an immutable changeset. As merge is the only thing that needs to be done, so it gets all the attention it needs. Also, while tracking down a problem, it is easier to figure out if the problem arrived during the changes or the merge, since those two things are distinct in the history.\n- They deal with whole-tree branches, not directory branches. The path names are independent for each branch of the tree which improves interoperability with other tooling.\n3. Easy to scale Horizontally\nFor CVCS, the server with the central repository needs to be powerful to serve needs of the entire team. For a team of 10 people, this is not an issue. For larger teams, the hardware limitations of the server can be a performance bottleneck. Some systems expect the server to do a lot of work. It can be challenging and expensive to set up a server to support thousands of users.\nA DVCS has much more modest hardware requirements for a central server. Users don’t interact with the server, they do so in case they need to push or pull. All the changes happens on the client side so the simple server hardware can serve it's purpose. In DVCS, it is also a possiblity to scale the central server(by turning it into a server farm). Instead of using one large server machine, we can add more capacity by adding small server machines, and then using scripts to keep them all in sync with each other.\nWith this, you have a good understanding of Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS).

{"question":"What's the proper way to secure pergola posts and beams for stability, and how should surrounding drainage be managed to protect the structure?","answer":"Pergola posts should be secured by digging holes at least 24 inches deep and 12 inches in diameter, setting 60-inch posts in concrete using forming tubes. The posts need to be plumbed and aligned before the concrete hardens. Beams should be fastened to the column tops using angle brackets with Simpson bracket screws. For drainage protection, the surrounding ground should be properly graded to divert water away from the structure. Storm water management systems should be implemented, including proper drainage for retaining walls if present, and ensuring any impervious surfaces like driveways have trench drains or area drains to prevent water pooling near the structure.","context":["1 of 1\nA beautiful addition to your yard\nBuilding the pergola over an existing patio (instead of building a new one) saves you a lot of time, money and work.\nHere’s a summer project designed to keep you cooler on even the hottest of days. The classical columns support an overhead wooden lattice that works like a big shade tree, letting only a portion of the sun’s radiance shine through.\nWhat looks like the toughest part of this project is actually the easiest—the graceful, solid-looking columns. They’re not wood at all but a hollow-core composite material with amazing structural strength and durability. We’ve designed the project so you simply slip these columns over treated 4x4 posts embedded in concrete. When screwed to the wooden posts, these columns provide a stable, solid base for the overhead lattice framework.\nThese paintable precast columns are available by special order at home centers. They come in a wide variety of diameters and heights and architectural styles.\nPressure-treated dimensional 2x8s and 2x10s make up the majority of the upper framework, and the decorative end pieces are cut with a jigsaw from our pattern. The whole project can be built in a couple of weekends, with another weekend for staining and painting.\nWe built our pergola over an existing stone patio; that saved a lot of patio work. If you’re planning to install a patio as part of your overall project, you’ll need to allow extra time.\nChoosing the Right Location\nBecause this project is made to stand independent of the house, you can either locate it right near your house as we did or let it stand alone in the garden. You can also consider using wood chips or gravel as a floor or even pour a concrete slab underneath. By keeping it unattached (about 4 in. from the eaves), you don’t have to deal with moving existing gutters or matching eaves. You also don’t have to mess with frost footings (in colder climates). However, if you have clay soil, it’s best to dig to frost depth (if greater than 24 in.) for your footings to prevent frost heave.\nOur existing patio was built over a sand and compacted gravel base, so we removed only the stones necessary to dig the 12-in. diameter holes to secure the posts. You’ll most likely have a different situation.\nIf you’ll be adding a patio later, be sure to pour all the footings at the finished patio height. Keep in mind any slope you’ll include in the patio. Most patios slope about 1/8 in. per foot to drain.\nPlan the post location to clear the eaves\n1 of 1\nPhoto 1: Measure your soffits to determine the pergola column centers\nMeasure the projection of your soffits and add 7 in. to accurately position the column centers near but not too close to the house. Drive remote stakes an equal distance from the house, attaching a string to help mark and align the outer post locations.\nIf you plan to build your pergola close to the house, first measure the projection of your eaves as shown in (Photo 1). Keep the center of the posts nearest the house at least 7 in. farther from the house than this measurement.\nTo keep the posts in alignment, stake your post locations using remote stakes with a string. With the stakes driven beyond the work area (Photo 2), you’ll be able to undo the string while you dig and then reattach it later to check for alignment. To check for left-to-right placement parallel to the house, just measure the distance from one of the remote stakes and write this measurement on a note pad. To make sure the layout is square, adjust the diagonal measurements of the postholes so they’re equal.\nAs you dig your holes, put the soil in a wheelbarrow and find a place to relocate it away from your site. Save any gravel or sand to reinstall pavers. Note: You may need to move a post slightly. We shifted one post near the house to create an entry along the steps.\nThis illustration shows how the pergola is\nFigure A: Pergola Details\nUse this illustration when building the pergola. It provides some dimensions and shows how each part is labeled.\nNote: To print out this illustration, go to Additional Information at the end of this story.\nHave your concrete delivered\n1 of 1\nPhoto 2: Set the posts in concrete\nDig the postholes a minimum of 2 ft. deep and 12 in. in diameter. Dig 24-in. tubes into the holes, add your 60-in. posts and pour concrete around them. Plumb your posts and align them with your outer string line. Allow the concrete to harden for a couple of days, then trim the posts to 32 in.\nBefore you dig any holes, call your local utilities or 411 to mark any buried cable or gas lines. Once you’re sure there are no buried utilities in the area, dig your holes with a hand-held posthole digger or rent a power auger. You’ll also need a shovel to widen the hole. Dig until it’s at least 24 in. deep.\nReconnect your layout string to make sure the holes are aligned. Cut your forming tubes (Photo 2) and insert them into the holes. Level the tops of the forming tubes until they’re flush with the patio surface. If you mix the concrete on site, you’ll need about five bags of Quikrete or Sakrete concrete mix per hole, for a total of 30 bags. (That’s enough to have your home center or lumberyard deliver it to the site. If you call for a ready-mixed delivery, ask for 1/2 cubic yard.)\nAs you set your posts, reposition your string line about 1-3/4 in. to allow for the post thickness and then align the posts with your string line (Photo 2) as you pour in the concrete.\nNote: If you have a post that’s 1/2 in. out of whack, don’t sweat it. You’ll be able to align the tops of the columns later when you install the overhead beam. Once the posts are embedded in concrete, let the concrete harden for a minimum of two days.\nCut the columns to length and fasten them to the posts\n1 of 6\nPhoto 3: Set the columns upside down on the posts\nLift the columns (upside down) over the 4x4 posts to mark the bottoms for trimming. Attach a story pole to the house to establish a reference point.\n2 of 6\nPhoto 4: Mark the posts for cutting.\nAttach a level to a straight 2x4 and mark the bottom of each post level with your height mark against the house. Remember, there's still 10-1/4 in. additional height going onto the tops of the posts.\n3 of 6\nPhoto 5: Cut the posts with a jigsaw\nTransfer your mark completely around the post using a combination square. Cut the post with a 10-teeth-per-inch wood blade in your jigsaw. You'll need a fresh blade for every post you cut.\n4 of 6\nPhoto 6: Install wood plugs in the columns\nCut 5-1/2 in. round treated wood plugs to fit the inside of your columns. Glue and screw together a pair for each column top, then glue the plugs flush into the top of each column. Secure the plugs to the columns with 2-in. deck screws. Note: Drive a screw into the top of each plug to use as a handle to position the plug.\n5 of 6\nPhoto 7: Attach 1x4 shims to the posts\nScrew 1x4 treated pine to the side of each 4x4. This will beef up the post so it meets the inside edge of the hollow column.\n6 of 6\nPhoto 8: Attach the columns to the posts\nPredrill and countersink eight screw holes in the sides of the columns: four 6 in. from the bottom and four 30 in. from the bottom. Use 3-in. No. 12 exterior wood screws to anchor the columns to the wood posts. Plumb the column as you screw it to the post. You’ll notice some play between the post and column. Opposing screws will tighten the entire assembly.\nWe wanted the roof of the pergola to align with the fascia of the house for a custom, fluid look. To keep the roof of the pergola even and level across the whole topside, you’ll need to cut each post exactly. Just clamp or nail a board temporarily to the fascia as shown in (Photo 4). Measure down 10-1/2 in. from the top of your fascia board for the cutoff height of your columns (95 in. for ours).\nTo make sure we cut the bottom only (we didn’t want to have to wait another two weeks for a new column), we flipped the columns end for end, slipped them over the posts and marked the bottoms of each column—and numbered them as well.\nNote: To make cutting the columns easier, lay them on sand bags or mulch bags to keep them from rolling or vibrating as you cut. Transfer your length mark completely around the column base with a combination square that’s set from the bottom of the post.\nI found the jigsaw a lot safer, quieter and less dusty than a circular saw. This composite polymer is only about 1/2 in. thick but pretty hard, so expect to eat up a new blade on each column.\nOnce you’ve cut each column, fatten the posts with 1x4s as shown in (Photo 7). Predrill each column with a combination pilot and countersink bit (three holes 6 in. from the bottom and another three 30 in. from the bottom). Also drill four evenly spaced holes 1-1/4 in. from the top of each column to secure the plugs (Photo 6). Now slip each column over its post. Strap a level near the base of each column (the column begins to taper slightly after 32 in. from the bottom) and screw into the wood beneath. Tighten or loosen opposing pairs to “plumb up” each column. Next, slip the molded base over the top of the column and then slip the capital on as well. It’s best not to fasten these in place until the project is nearly completed.\nFasten the beams to the top of the columns\n1 of 2\nPhoto 9: Set the beam over the columns\nSlide the column bases and capitals over the column shafts. Measure and cut the outer 2x10 beam and walk it up the ladders.\n2 of 2\nPhoto 10: Secure the beam in place with angle brackets\nScrew the beam (E) to the wood plug so it's flush with the front outside edge of the column. Use angle brackets as shown with 1-1/4 in. Simpson bracket screws. Screw the other beam in place and then the other three intermediate beams, F1 and F2.\nMeasure the length of the front and back 2x10 beams (E), making them 3 in. less than the outside of the column tops, and cut them to length.\nNote: If you have a column that won’t quite straighten up, you can have someone push it straight up and down and then fasten it in place with the steel brackets from above.\nNext, measure and cut the side beams (F1) and screw them to the ends of the front beams. Now cut the center beam (F2) 3 in. shorter than the side beams and fasten it to the posts and the front and back beams (E) with 3-in. deck screws.\nSlip the flat rafters onto ledgers\n1 of 4\nPhoto 11: Attach ledger strips to the beams\nScrew a treated wood 1x2 7-1/4 in. down from the top of each of the 2x10 beams running out from the house. These will act as ledgers for the 2x8 flat rafters.\n2 of 4\nPhoto 12: Place the rafters on the ledgers\nSet the 2x8 flat rafters onto the ledgers (hold them perfectly vertical) and screw each end to the 2x10 beams with three 3-in. deck screws.\n3 of 4\nPhoto 13: Fasten the rafters in place\nDrive screws at an angle to fasten opposing 2x8 flat rafters. Use three 3-in. screws per end.\n4 of 4\nPhoto 14: Attach the capitals\nPush the resin-cast capitals flush with the bottom of the 2x10 beams and screw them into place with 2-1/2 in. deck screws.\nOnce all the 2x10 beams are in place, cut your 1x2 ledgers and screw them 1/2 in. up from the bottom of each beam F1 and F2 with 2-in. deck screws every 8 in. Now measure each 2x8 flat rafter (referred to as “flat” because they have no pitch) and cut it to length. Ideally these should all be the same length, but if you had problems with your post positioning earlier, you may have to adjust them.\nMark 16-in. centers along the beams F1 and F2. Rest each rafter on the ledgers (Photo 12) and screw them in place one at a time from the backside of each beam, aligning them with your marks. Where the rafters meet the center beam (F2), angle the 3-in. deck screws through the beam and into the rafter (Photo 13). When you’ve finished the rafters, secure each capital to the underside of the beams with 2-1/2 in. deck screws (Photo 14). Predrill the capitals.\nPreassemble the rafter tails\n1 of 3\nPhoto 15: Mark and cut the rafter tails\nCut the decorative rafter tails from treated 2x10 pine. To avoid cupping, choose knot-free boards and keep them out of the sun until you paint or stain them.\n2 of 3\nPhoto 16: Attach the rafter tails\nRip strips of 5/4 treated decking to 3-in. widths to make parts J. Align and screw them to K and to the top of each 2x8 flat rafter. Then screw K in place from the backside of F1.\n3 of 3\nPhoto 17: Make the lattice strips\nRip 5/4 decking 3 in. wide and rout a 1/4-in. round-over on each edge to make the lattice strips.\nCut the decorative rafter tails (J) using the grid template shown in (Fig. A). For consistency, mark your first one as the pattern and trace this piece each time. Sand the gentle curves with a belt sander or portable drum sander.\nNow cut the tail tops (K) from 5/4 decking. Round over the cut ends with a hand plane or a router (Photo 17). Ease the edges of the tails and the tops with 100-grit sandpaper and then apply a solid-color stain. Make sure the treated wood pieces are dry to the touch before you prestain them. If they feel cool, let them dry in a shady spot for two days before applying the solid-color stain. Rushing the process could cause the stain to blister or roll off.\nOnce the stain is dry, screw the tops to the tails with 2-1/2 in. deck screws (allow the top to overhang 3/4 in.) and fasten them over the tops of each flat rafter and beam end as shown in (Photo 16) and (Fig. A).\nYou’ll need to cut the tail top short on the assemblies that project from the corners and screw them in place from the backside of the front beam.\nThe last details\n1 of 3\nPhoto18: Install PVC pieces to vent the columns\nDrill 3/4-in. holes and insert 6-in. long 1/2-in. PVC pieces with 90-degree fittings attached. These little pipes act as ventilators to help slough off any excess moisture that may get into the columns.\n2 of 3\nPhoto 19: Install PVC pieces to vent the columns. Fill holes with putty.\nFill the pilot holes and screwheads on each column with auto body fiberglass filler. Let the filler harden, then sand the areas flush. Now you’re ready to paint.\n3 of 3\nPhoto 20: Attach the lattice to finish the construction\nScrew the 5/4 lattice strips to the tops of the rafters. Evenly space them across each section. Add more if you'd like to increase the shade below.\nCut and nail (8d galvanized finish nails) the 1x4 fascia strips (M) flush to the top of the beams and in between each pair of tails (Photo 20). Next, screw the lattice strips across the rafter tops, letting them project 3 in. past the fascia.\nNow cut the sub-base pieces from treated 2x4. Screw the corners together with 3-in. deck screws. If you haven’t already done so, fit the patio stones back against the footings and glue the subbase to the patio surface. Then screw the molded base to the sub-base and caulk the seams with acrylic caulk.\nBefore you paint the columns, mix auto body filler and spread it over the screw holes along the column (Photo 19). Let the filler dry and then sand it flush. Prime the columns, and then paint them with a good-quality exterior trim paint. Don’t use paint on the rest of the pergola; instead roll and brush the wood portions with solid-color stain.","Protecting Your Home from Storm Water Damage\nA heavy rainstorm has finally stopped. Or maybe a long winter has finally ended, and the deep snows have begun to melt.\nWhile good weather may seem like a relief, the potential for water damage may just be beginning. Storm water runoff can quickly overwhelm natural and manmade systems, leading to flooding and property damage.\nThe steps you take today to prepare your home and yard for proper drainage can help avoid time-consuming and costly repairs when the bad weather does blow through.\nIn a natural environment, storm water runoff is absorbed by soil, evaporates into the atmosphere or flows into bodies of water, such as streams, lakes or rivers. Homeowners may need to recreate the natural environment on their property to address storm water runoff. This includes planting trees and other vegetation, building rain gardens and installing rain barrels or cisterns to collect roof water.\nHow Can You Protect Your Home from Storm Water?\n“The key to developing a yard drainage plan is to understand the specific characteristics of your property and implement the system that works best for you,” says Mike Koppang, a Travelers Risk Control professional. During a storm, you can go outside and observe how the water flows. Take note of the different grades and slopes and whether they divert the flowing water away from your home. Look for any low spots that collect or pool water and for any steep slopes that have indications of surface erosion.\nConsider the steps needed to protect your property from water runoff. Rain that falls on roofs, driveways, patios, roads and other impervious areas moves across the ground surface at greater speeds. The property adjacent to these areas could be more susceptible to damage. Frozen soil can also increase risk of damage by preventing water from being absorbed by the soil. Replacing impervious areas with pervious surfaces, such as permeable paving stones or pavers, can also help.\nOther questions you might consider:\nIs storm water that falls on impervious surfaces diverted away from your house? This is the work of things like roof gutter downspouts, driveways, walkways and patios. Runoff from these surfaces should be directed to an area that has the ability to absorb or slow the surface flow, such as landscaped areas, and away from your house.\nDoes your house have a stream, pond or lake close by? Consider the flood potential and how it may impact your property. You can research local flood maps that will detail flood water levels for various storm events and their flood potential.\nDoes your driveway or other impervious surface have a negative pitch back toward the house? Consider installing trench drains or area drains to help prevent pooling and divert water away from the house.\nDo you have retaining walls on your property? If so, it is important that the walls have a drainage system in place to alleviate pressure behind the wall. Periodically clean weep holes to ensure they are not clogged. Surface water should not be allowed to cascade over the top of the wall and instead should be diverted to the end of the wall or around it.\nIs a portion of your house below ground level, such as a basement? Make sure any sewer and water lines, or any other pipes or lines that penetrate subsurface walls, and foundation cracks are properly sealed. Basements that are prone to water intrusion should have a water collection system in place, such as a sump pump system. This system should be maintained with a battery backup for continued operation in the event of a power failure. Consider elevating mechanical systems or installing curbs around areas that need protecting but cannot be elevated, such as finished areas and storage areas. Exterior basement window wells should have covers and the ground surface of the well should be below the well rim.\nDo you have a sewer or septic system and property with known high water tables? Have the system checked by a professional. If the groundwater rises too high, it can affect the efficiency and operation of the system. In some cases, this may lead to sewer back up or waste leaching above the ground or back into the house.\nSurface storm water is not the only consideration for protecting your home. It is also important to assess the functionality of your whole home envelope system. Make sure that your house exterior is maintained, including roofing, flashings, weather barriers, windows, doors and sealants.\nWhile you cannot prevent against all damage from storm water runoff during large acts of nature, these steps can help protect your home when storms do hit."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"sensitive"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:ebf4049b-f79a-47d8-8412-082892ef98c3>","<urn:uuid:91b22023-08c4-4c03-ad32-b6c7a0123c66>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How has the role of corporate security evolved in the digital age, and what are the key cybersecurity measures needed to protect sensitive data?","answer":"The role of corporate security has evolved from primarily protecting physical assets to addressing both geopolitical and cybersecurity threats. Modern security officers must understand complex geopolitical dynamics and deal with borderless threats like cyberattacks, terrorism, and disinformation. On the cybersecurity front, organizations need multiple layers of defense including security management, identity and access management, business continuity plans, and software development security. These measures help protect sensitive data like social security numbers and credit card information stored in cloud services, prevent unauthorized access, improve breach recovery time, and ensure business continuity. Fifth-generation cyber threats now include large-scale, multi-vector attacks, with criminals using sophisticated methods like phishing, DDoS attacks, and malware, making strong cybersecurity strategy essential for organizational protection.","context":["The Chief Security Strategist in an Age of Uncertainty\nThe world is witnessing the decentralization of power structures from a multipolar world to regional powers. Hard power is being replaced by soft power, sharp power, and geopolitical risks, and due to interconnectedness and globalization, geopolitics has become one of the prime challenges for companies.\nDiverse transnational threats, including organized crime, cyberattacks, illegal immigration, and climate change, are affecting the world community. Regional powers are destabilizing the Middle East. Social unrest is interrupting companies’ investment plans. Terrorists are switching to smaller scale attacks like those on 26 November 2008 attacks in Mumbai, India, using AK-47s and vehicles instead of aircraft attacks.\nEach region has a unique set of risks, which often entangle and overlap with others. These threats create a spectrum of governments from Africa to Asia-Pacific that investors are left to grapple with—from autarkic communism to democracy, with the gaps filled in by capitalist communism, monarchies, aristocracies, and dictatorships. Companies investing in Mexico must mitigate threats like drug wars, kidnappings, extortion, and cartels eroding local governments. The Middle East is mired in anarchy, terrorism, conflicts, social unrest, and insurgencies. Europe is seeing social unrest stemming from illegal immigration. A trade war is brewing between China and the United States. Destabilization based on growing threats and pressure from China is leading to the militarization of the APAC region.\nAltogether, the tectonic shifts within the world community create a common facet for the chief security officer (CSO): dealing with the inextricable risks that tie companies and regions. The 20th century CSO was primarily concerned about protecting the physical assets of an organization from threats like theft, pilferage, and robbery. But as issues like emerging risks, regional instability, and local conflicts affect companies, the contemporary CSO must understand the geopolitical dynamics of the 21st century.\nRisks are no longer restricted to the physical and tangible; they have expanded to geopolitical and cybersecurity realms. Borderless threats—like cyberattacks, terrorism, disinformation, and more—can result in significant losses for companies. The dangers of increasing political instability, authoritarian rule, and bureaucratic meddling are compounding the worsening global business environment. Geopolitical risk is at a post-Cold War high, and everything is moving faster than before.\nAccording to the CFA Institute, 70 percent of investment returns may be compromised by geopolitical uncertainties. A crisis in one part of the world can have profound cascading effects on organizations on the other side of the globe.\nThe Changing Role of the CSO\nIn this rapidly evolving environment, contemporary CSOs must launch themselves into the new role of chief security strategist (CSS). Before investing in a foreign country, a CEO first needs a report on the country’s geopolitical and security climate. Throughout the report, the CSS can provide guidance on risks, vulnerabilities, and mitigation measures. The CSS must analyze the various geopolitical, security, regional, and emerging risks—such as regulatory compliance, disasters, local crime, civil unrest, populism, and terrorism—as well as measure their likely impact on investments and future business plans. The CSS can prepare geopolitical risk analysis scenarios to create and integrate appropriate reactions into the company’s enterprise risk management framework.\nCompared to a traditional CSO, the CSS requires a different skill set for risk assessment and mitigation. The CSS must perform research on trends, issues, and scenarios important to company priorities. The key responsibility is keeping the organization ahead of critical security risks, looking beyond the headlines to comprehend world events and their implications for the safety of its employees, processes, and other assets.\nThe CSS would benefit from a research team, which can provide information on options available to the security department. Skilled in conducting incisive research, providing penetrative insights, and suggesting effective mitigation measures, these analysts should conduct policy analysis at the strategic level and security assessments at the operational level.\nRisks and Consequences\nCompanies face reputational, operational, and legal risks if they don’t have security plans. Non-compliance, negligence, and other risks can lead to fines and revocation of licenses by regulatory authorities, enforcement action by law enforcement agencies, filing of suits by victims and shareholders, loss of profitable business, and loss of employees through death or injury. For instance, in 2019, hundreds of flights were suspended at Gatwick Airport near London, England, due to unauthorized drones near the runway, costing the airlines £28 million and the airport £20 million. Other costs include loss of time as senior management focuses on damage control.\nBeyond regulatory pitfalls, adverse geopolitical conditions can also trigger company losses—major upheavals like terrorist attacks, rampant disease, industrial strikes, and natural disasters can greatly affect operations in national and international markets. In 2019, Indonesia announced it would move the country’s capital from Jakarta to Borneo due to rising water levels and climate change. Before that, a 2011 tsunami and earthquake cost Japan approximately $235 billion USD in economic damage, according to a 2011 World Bank estimate. And across the world in Iceland, volcanic eruptions in 2010 disrupted international airline travel.\nGeo-Governmental Risks and Unrest\nCountries in the Middle East and South America are experiencing political and social instability, some of them for decades. Strains between the government and civil groups in Europe are leading to unrest and mass protests. Around 30 governments or leaders have fallen as a result of about 100 significant antigovernment protests worldwide since 2017, according to the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Anarchists and others seeking to cause property damage are intermingling with protestors and taking advantage of volatile situations, which can threaten company assets and employees and disrupt operations.\nBeyond civil unrest, some other geo-governmental risks that can disrupt or negatively impact businesses include military coups, domestic or political instability, lack of socio-economic governance, and economic crises.\nCompounding the fallout from regional or national issues, foreign companies are in some ways at an even greater disadvantage when competing with public-sector organizations. For example, in China, public-sector companies are provided with subsidies, giving them an edge over foreign companies. Another common problem for foreign businesses operating in socialist democracies is nationalization of assets. In countries like Venezuela, government intervention has resulted in the nationalization of foreign companies, leading to permanent termination of private operations.\nSouth American governmental institutions at the national, regional, and local levels are unable to perform their constitutional and legal functions as they operate in a democratic construct where the president is independent of the legislature. Austerity and low economic growth are producing autocrats like Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro. Companies operating in South America are further affected by risks like political uncertainty, court rulings favoring local companies, a lack of due process of commercial law, governance failure, labor laws stifling growth, and more. These risks are leading to uncertain investment climates.\nMeanwhile, governments in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia exemplify authoritarianism and populist rhetoric to stay in power. Geo-governmental risks arising out of government apathy and inefficiency will continue to increase in the future.\nCorporate Espionage and IP Theft\nAs in decades past, critical industries in the technology sector and their employees—scientists, researchers, and engineers—are prime targets of commercial competitors and foreign governments. While companies and the media focus on high-profile cyberattacks, the traditional methods of corporate espionage remain relevant in the age of cyber warfare, and social networking and engineering still offer vast opportunities for intelligence gathering.\nInternational conferences, conventions, and tradeshows host a wide array of speakers, presenters, contractors, and attendees. Technology can be accessed with ease and social interaction is common in a permissive environment, making these events key recruiting grounds for foreign intelligence agencies. Confidential information and IP must be safeguarded at international events, and a lack of security culture and awareness remain the biggest threat to any company.\nThe CSS can either create new or enhance existing security training for all employees, with briefings that will assist in ultimately protecting valuable information and complying with internal security requirements. Security briefings can be fun and engaging, such as during out-of-the-office meetings or get-togethers, and with games that disseminate security strategies and tactics. Security roundtable discussions can include pertinent topics such as geopolitical issues and global security events. It is vital that the CSS brings management into the security program framework so that the company’s top executives understand and support the programs.\nThe Spanish Flu in 1918 was a global event, and roughly 100 years later another pandemic has disrupted the entire world. Initially, companies were unaware and unable to deal with the onslaught of the COVID-19 pandemic. The business community at large did not have any plan to mitigate pandemic risks. Companies had to protect employees and restart production after a global supply chain disruption while creating SOPs and advisories for employees, vendors, and visitors.\nThe pandemic led to a decline in global GDP and notably caused enormous losses to the manufacturing, airline, and hospitality industries. Rising populism, protectionism, and anarchy—plus decreasing foreign direct investment, cyberattacks, and online frauds—are only some of the compounding risks associated with the pandemic.\nTravel Security and Globalization\nDue to globalization, employees are travelling to high-risk countries like Nigeria, Libya, Algeria, Afghanistan, and Iraq. Employees face several risks and threats, like unsafe food and water, travel disruptions from social unrest, disasters, terrorist attacks on soft targets, kidnappings, and local crime. Terrorists have also targeted hot spots and soft targets such as airports, train and bus stations, and stadiums.\nA variety of risks affect different countries and regions. The aftermath of the Arab Spring revolutions destabilized the Middle East. Afghanistan remains a high-risk country due to terrorist and insurgent attacks like car bombings, rocket attacks, kidnappings, and hostage taking. In Mexico, there is widespread violent crime—shootings, kidnapping, carjacking, and robbery—thanks to organized criminal organizations.\nThe CSS must customize general principles of protection and formulate specific protective measures to assist in preventing and preparing for emergencies in high-risk areas.\nCyber threats can have a debilitating effect on company finances. Fifth-generation cyber threats are characterized by large-scale, multi-vector attacks using advanced tools. Cyber criminals are targeting companies through phishing, distributed denial of service, and malware attacks. For companies working in the banking and financial sectors, cybercrime and fraud have increased in the past few years. Terrorists and extremists have improved their handle on emerging technology, and several terrorist attacks have been funded through online transactions. Chinese industrial espionage through cyber domain continues to be a major threat.\nEven isolated countries such as North Korea and Iran can attack companies like Sony and Saudi Aramco through cyber warfare, according to The Hacker and the State: Cyber Attacks and the New Normal of Geopolitics by Ben Buchanan. The United States has experienced cyberattacks on its intelligence community and other critical government departments. Technology will replace human beings in promoting disinformation campaigns, causing chaos across industry sectors.\nCompanies rely on security technologies like facial and voice recognition, which can be compromised by sophisticated face-swap technology and voice alteration techniques. For example, a CEO calls the finance manager and asks him to transfer millions of dollars to an anonymous account. The manager duly transfers the amount. But this was a fraud—the CEO’s voice was mimicked by synthetic speech production using advanced software.\nThe proliferation of cyber threats has made technology risk a key challenge across industry sectors. Cybersecurity may be handled by the CISO, but the CSS can provide strategic guidance and training to management and employees by preparing policies, developing SOPs, and disseminating information.\nROI as a Barometer for Security\nDue diligence must be conducted to estimate the potential losses from geopolitical events and security threats. For four days in November 2008, the Pakistani terrorist organization Lashkar-e-Taiba used urban warfare tactics to carry out coordinated attacks with assault rifles and bombs in Mumbai, India, resulting in the deaths of 164 people, 29 of them foreign nationals. Also among the dead was a chairman of a major Indian bank and other top management members of other companies. The attack on the Taj Mahal hotel caused an estimated loss of $38 million. The attacks affected the local industry, including transportation, finance, and hospitality. The cost of assets must be calculated and a security plan should be prepared based on the total cost of potential losses.\nSecurity management should be built into merger and acquisition deals. The lack of a protection plan may result in in lawsuits for a company if a terrorist attack takes place after a merger. The only way to effectively shield an organization from lawsuits and safeguard its reputation is to conduct a security assessment of the target company and a geopolitical risk analysis of the regions in which it is operating.\nThe cost of business disruption should be included while estimating the asset value of the company. A small security review up front might cost a few thousand dollars, but an emergency response to an incident and the fallout could run into the millions. The security plan is the manifestation of all the measures to be taken to prevent damage to the company. The ROI is high for an implemented security plan.\nThe 21st Century CSS\nThe world has entered an age of power shifts and competition. The CSS must address the diverse and interlocking areas of security and business. A successful CSS requires multifaceted competencies in international security, geopolitics, international business, economics, finance, and sociology. Considering the flux and turmoil in international relations, black swan and gray rhino events have to be factored into security planning. In the 21st century, there is no one-size-fits-all security plan.\nStrategic knowledge is a requirement to manage international and national issues vital to companies and national security. Assessing the implications of political, security, travel, compliance, and regulatory risks on the company is crucial. The CSS should be able to grasp complex and fast-changing geopolitical issues and quickly discern key patterns and trends. The CSS must know the likely trajectory of risks in key markets. One of the key responsibilities would be guiding companies in determining how varied risks affect operations in different countries. The security team, as the intellectual engine of company’s security and safety philosophy, should add unequaled value to the cause of organizational security.\nCompanies are operating from secure and stable democracies to volatile regions. An absence of global security strategy will undermine organizational stability and limit the capacity to respond to a crisis. Companies will have to grapple with geopolitical uncertainties and emerging threats which remain at the forefront of international security. Risks and threats to companies will expand and diversify across regions. Companies will be challenged by geopolitical risks. The contours of the world are changing. This requires a new commitment to strategic security.\nMangesh Sawant is a senior vice president at Riskpro.

The attackers nowadays employ new methods involving artificial intelligence to break traditional security controls. This makes Cyber-attacks more dangerous to sensitive data. Cybersecurity aims to prevent attacks that will disrupt a system's operations. A strong cybersecurity strategy has to provide good security against all attacks. The attacks are designed to access, alter, delete, destroy an organization's sensitive data.\nThe need to develop cybersecurity is on the rise. Currently, society is more technologically dependent than ever before. For example, sensitive information such as social security numbers, credit card information, and bank account details are stored in cloud storage services like Dropbox or Google Drive. Also, the increased number of users, devices, and programs in the present era, combined with the increased flow of confidential data makes the importance of cybersecurity grow.\nCybersecurity is critical to all domains across industries and institutions. Those who want to protect their respective cyber-IT ecosystem from threats like fraud, vandalism, exploits, and espionage. The following are the benefits of implementing and maintaining cybersecurity practices:\n· Protects data and networks\n· Prevents unauthorized user access\n· Improves recovery time after a breach\n· Protects end-users and endpoint devices\n· Leads to business continuity\n· Improves confidence and the company's reputation\n· Increase trust for developers, partners, customers, stakeholders, and employees\n· Improves security controls without compromising company credentials\nFollowing demands the need for Cyber Security Solution:\n1. To protect your business\n2. To protects personal data\n3. Safer employee workplace\n4. Improves productivity\n5. Support IT Experts\n6. Inspire confidence in customers\nCybersecurity risks can affect everyday consumers also, who can potentially fall prey to cybercrime schemes. It will only take five minutes to hack all the connected devices. Reports say that cyberattacks are happening every 14 seconds and you are likely to be affected by it eventually.\nUse of Cyber Security across Domains\nThe modern architecture of cybersecurity puts multiple layers of defense. This creates multiple domains of cybersecurity. A few of them are:\n· Security Management\nThis domain involves several tasks including risk assessment, overseeing security functions to ensure operational compliance, changing management procedures and processes, sensitizing users for awareness.\n· Identity and Access Management\nIAM comprises all processes, systems, and procedures used for managing authentication, assigning identities, and access controls.\n· Business Continuity\nThis domain studies and understands the central avenues that support the organization. It creates a procedure that inhabits all these critical functions and makes the organization operable with lesser data loss.\nCryptography is mainly used to protect the integrity, confidentiality, and authenticity of the information concerned.\n· Physical Security\nThis domain refers to the workflow associated with physical hardware. It provides a set of protocol that exists outside cyberspace but has a direct effect on cyberspace if breached.\n· Software Development Security\nThis domain provides security training for developers, performs code analysis, oversees the process and procedure development, and apprehends newer feature requirements of an application and its consequent effect on its security."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:93bda812-b2bc-4ba1-b785-102e702f6b5d>","<urn:uuid:09d41813-13cf-4391-9d31-08288ca6e501>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What were the operating hours and licensing status of Toronto's Voodoo nightclub during its years of operation?","answer":"Voodoo was an unlicensed after-hours dance club that operated Friday and Saturday nights from midnight until dawn. While it was unlicensed, patrons would sneak in alcohol and other 'party favours.' The club also occasionally hosted fashion shows, concerts, and special events before the dancing began or on different nights of the week.","context":["Photo of Voodoo coat check girls courtesy of Tracy Graham.\nArticle originally published November 16, 2011 by The Grid online (TheGridTO.com).\nIn this instalment of her nightclub-history series Then & Now, Denise Benson looks back to a time when Toronto nightlife orbited around Yonge and St. Joseph thanks to early ‘80s after-hours haunt Voodoo, which brought goths, gays and fashionistas together—only to be brought down, ironically, by Jack Layton.\nBY: DENISE BENSON\nClub: Voodoo, 9 St. Joseph\nYears in operation: 1981-1985\nHistory: To discuss this deeply influential alternative after-hours club space is to delve into a history of Toronto nightlife that was anchored around St. Joseph Street and the surrounding area from the late 1970s through the mid-’80s. It’s a history of emerging sounds and fashions, diverse sexualities and late-night community—all played out in a city centre then becoming increasingly residential.\nBefore Voodoo opened in August of 1981, the original Domino Klub on Isabella was home to punks, rockers and gays alike; there were boozecans along Yonge (most notably on the corner of Maitland Street, above vital clothing store South Pacific); and the addresses 5-9 St. Joseph housed rock bar The Forge at street level, with disco club Bellows above. St. Joseph was a key street for Toronto’s growing gay community; The Forge space became famed gay dance club Katrina’s, with neighbouring homo and mixed social spaces including Le Tube, St. Joseph Café, Stages and Club Manatee.\nAgainst this backdrop and above Katrina’s, Michael Gallow opened unlicensed, after-hours dance club Voodoo. He and DJ Dave Allen had already been involved in promoting Domino Klub and “a series of after-hours uptown warehouse events,” but wanted “to create our own environment for the emerging fashion/music culture of the late ’70s and early ’80s. The theme of the club was—as stated on the brass plaque at street level—‘Metal Music in the Modern Jungle.’”\nVoodoo was open Friday and Saturday nights from midnight to dawn, with occasional fashion shows, concerts and other special events taking place before the dancing began (or on different nights of the week). The approach was low budget, with most areas painted fully black amid a minimalist lighting system. No matter. The creative people who partied there—it may have been unlicensed, but plenty of patrons snuck in booze and other “party favours”—added colour to a club where the main door policy was “no blue jeans.”\nWhy it was important: Voodoo opened at a time when most licensed bars closed at 1 a.m. and crackdowns on boozecans meant that late-night dancing was mainly limited to gay discos. Voodoo added greatly to the musical soundscape of the day and became a hub for the fashion-minded, sexually adventurous avant-garde. Internationally renowned shoe designer Patrick Cox was Voodoo’s first doorman/greeter and many staff members were immersed in new design and music forms.\n“The uniqueness of Voodoo was its street-level vibe,” says owner Michael Gallow. “David Allen and Danny Regan [Voodoo’s lighting man] were part of the street scene in the neighbourhood and always kept everyone aware of happenings at the club. It was a very welcoming home for all those creative and fashion-forward individuals in the city. Many of the regulars were experimenting not only with their look, but their sexuality and relationships.”\n“I was a Voodoo regular and the inclusive attitude of the place is what made me dream of opening my own bar or club,” says Michael Sweenie (pictured above getting ready for a night out), now owner of Andy Poolhall on College Street. “Your sexuality was not what defined you at Voodoo, just the love of music and an individual fashion style or sense. It was also the first place I ever saw with washrooms that were gender neutral; there were just as many guys doing their makeup in the mirror as girls.”\nVoodoo was a key place to hear bold new sounds pouring out of Europe, America and Toronto itself. Music not heard on the radio had a home here.\n“I think Voodoo really made dance clubs that came after more open musically,” says Sweenie. “It brought new wave, punk and the New Romantic scene into other clubs that usually played disco only.”\n“Voodoo revived the post-bar dance scene and laid the groundwork for many of the late night places that came along,” Gallow summarizes, mentioning Biorhythm, Catwalk and Twilight Zone, of which he speaks highly.\n“I always think of the Twilight Zone as the yin to our yang,” says Gallow. “They helped introduce the emerging New York dance scene to the diverse people who were settling in Toronto from around the world. Our focus at Voodoo was very European and fashion-driven.”\nDJs, such as myself, who came up playing in the alternative clubs of the mid/late-’80s owe a great deal to Voodoo and its legacy.\n“Voodoo was the club that opened my mind to both the culture and music that was exploding in the underground at that time,” agrees Iain McPherson a.k.a. DJ Iain, a Voodoo regular who brought that influence with him as he got his start spinning at 1980s alt-club Nuts & Bolts. “Voodoo was groundbreaking and unique. It was unlike any of the mainstream clubs of its time or even the more ‘traditional’ underground clubs that followed.”\nWho played there: “Dave Allen was the spiritual soul of Voodoo,” says Michael Gallow of the DJ who shaped the club’s soundscape. Gallow may have purchased much of the club’s music—at the original Record Peddler, natch—but Allen broke ground with what he chose to highlight. He didn’t mix the songs—unlike jocks at Biorhythm and Twilight Zone, for example, who beat-matched—but Allen played the music first.\n“In my mind and, no doubt, all those who were fortunate enough to experience it, Voodoo was the first truly modern, post-disco ‘underground’ music venue,” writes McPherson.\n“Dave Allen was a truly fearless DJ. One of my favourite memories is the week that Simple Minds’ New Gold Dream album came out. Dave got on the mic at the height of prime time and announced, ‘This is the new Simple Minds album,’ put on side A and let it play straight through—while he joined everyone on the dancefloor. When the side came to an end, he ran back up the booth, flipped over the record, made a typically cryptic announcement, ‘Side B!,’ and played it through non-stop. The dancefloor remained packed throughout. Such was the adventurous, wonderfully musically open-minded nature of the crowd. This was a special venue at a special time in music. And we couldn’t get enough of it.”\nVoodoo also hosted fashion shows by Parachute Clothing, concerts promoted by The Garys (including A Certain Ratio, John Cooper Clarke, DNA, and The Professionals), and even plays like the Dora Award-winning musical Sid’s Kids. Cutting-edge guests often visited the club.\n“We had an excellent relationship with visiting bands and hosted great parties with Duran Duran, Spandau Ballet, Adam and the Ants, New Order, Flock of Seagulls, and others,” recalls Gallow. “In that sense, Voodoo was a great symbiosis between the music and fashion biz.”\nSadly, despite the fact that CKLN 88.1FM broadcast Radio Voodoo live from the club for many months, I couldn’t locate any audio or video recordings to share.\nWhat happened to it: Voodoo closed its doors on February 2, 1985. The area had become increasingly residential and neighbours were unhappy with the late-night revelry. Many venues on St. Joseph faced fines, noise complaints and challenges over issues like not providing enough parking for customers.\n“Interesting to note that our main adversary was Jack Layton, then the local Alderman,” says Gallow. “I understand his position in hindsight—he was acting on behalf of his constituents—but there were some acrimonious meetings about our existence. I felt that the energy that had driven the club was dissipating and it was better to go out on a high note.”\nGallow also opened trend-setting (and licensed) lounge/restaurant Century 66 at Yonge and Charles, and now owns marketing agency Benchmarx Data Services.\nSoon after Voodoo’s close, 9 St. Joseph opened as Backstreet, which drew a similarly mixed clientele, while Katrina’s continued downstairs at 5 St. Joseph. These addresses later went on to house a number of gay and after-hours spots, including Colby’s, Brooklyn and 5ive, with Level 3 Fitness also holding the lease at number 9 for years. Today, the entire corner of Yonge and St. Joseph is under construction to become FIVE Condominiums.\n“It is fascinating to see the space today,” Gallow says. “The huge metal structure securing the building’s facade is worthy of a photo essay. The whole district was zoned for condos back in 1984 and guess where we are today. I doubt anyone who buys there now will have been a nightly visitor back then, but how romantic a notion if they were.”\nThank you: to all who shared your thoughts and photos.

{"question":"What are the key differences between angel investors and savings account holders in terms of risk tolerance and fund accessibility?","answer":"Angel investors and savings account holders have significant differences. Angel investors make direct investments of personal funds into early-stage businesses and must be capable of taking a loss of their entire investment, indicating very high risk tolerance. In contrast, savings account holders typically have immediate access to their funds and face minimal risk, though they may earn minimal returns that often fail to keep up with inflation. While angel investors may have to wait extended periods to access their invested funds since selling investment stakes can take significant time, savings account holders can generally access their money anytime.","context":["WHAT IS AN ANGEL INVESTOR?\nAn angel investor is an individual who makes direct investments of personal funds into a venture, typically early-stage businesses. This is in contrast to venture capitalists who typically raise and invest third party funds.

At its easiest, investing is when you purchase assets you anticipate to earn a benefit from in the future. That could refer to buying a house (or other residential or commercial property) you believe will rise in value, though it frequently refers to buying stocks and bonds. How is investing different than saving? Saving and investing both include reserving money for future use, however there are a great deal of distinctions, too.\nHowever it probably will not be much and typically fails to keep up with inflation (the rate at which costs are increasing). Usually, it’s finest to just invest money you won’t need for a little while, as the stock market fluctuates and you don’t wish to be required to sell stocks that are down since you require the cash.\nPrior to you can spend any of the cash you have actually constructed up through financial investments, you’ll have to offer them. With stocks, it could take days before the proceeds are settled in your checking account, and offering property can take months (or longer). Generally speaking, you can access cash in your savings account anytime.\nYou don’t have to select simply one. You canand most likely shouldinvest for numerous goals simultaneously, though your method might require to be various. (More on that listed below.) 2. Nail down your timeline. Next, figure out how much time you need to reach your objectives. This is called your investment timeline, and it determines just how much risk (and for that reason the kinds of investments) you might have the ability to handle.\nSo for reasonably near-term objectives, like a wedding you wish to spend for in the next number of years, you might want to stick to a more conservative investing strategy. For longer-term objectives, however, like retirement, which might still be years away, you can presume more threat since you have actually got time to recuperate any losses.\nThere’s something you can do to alleviate that drawback. Enter diversity, or the process of varying your investments to manage threat. There are two main ways to diversify your portfolio: Diversifying between asset classes, like stocks and bonds. Typically, as you age (and closer to retirement) or are otherwise nearing the end of your investing timeline, professionals advise moving your possession allotment toward owning more bonds.\nTime is your greatest ally when it pertains to investing. Thanks to compoundingor when the returns on your money produce their own returns, therefore onthe longer your cash is in the market, the longer it needs to grow. Invest often. By investing even little quantities routinely in time, you’re practicing a practice that will help you construct wealth throughout your life called dollar-cost averaging.\nMake it automated. Automating any recurring job makes it easier to stick to over the long term. The very same applies for investing. Whether it’s by instantly contributing a portion of your income to a 401(k) or establishing automatic transfers from your monitoring account to a brokerage account, automating your investments can make it a lot much easier to strike your long-term goals.\nWhen you invest, you’re giving your cash the chance to work for you and your future goals. It’s more complex than direct transferring your paycheck into a savings account, however every saver can end up being an investor. What is investing? Investing is a method to possibly increase the amount of money you have.\n1. Start investing as soon as you can, The more time your cash needs to work for you, the more chance it’ll have for development. That’s why it is essential to start investing as early as possible. 2. Attempt to stay invested for as long as you can, When you remain invested and do not move in and out of the marketplaces, you could earn money on top of the cash you’ve currently made.\n3. Spread out your financial investments to handle threat. Putting all your money in one financial investment is riskyyou might lose cash if that investment falls in worth. But if you diversify your money throughout several investments, you can reduce the threat of losing cash. Start early, remain long, One important investing strategy is to begin quicker and stay invested longer, even if you start with a smaller sized amount than you hope to invest in the future.\nCompounding happens when profits from either capital gains or interest are reinvestedgenerating additional profits over time. How crucial is time when it concerns investing? Very. We’ll look at an example of a 25-year-old financier. She makes an initial investment of $10,000 and is able to earn a typical return of 6% each year.\n1But waiting ten years prior to starting to invest, which is something a young investor might do earlier in her working life, can have an impact on how much cash she will have at retirement. Instead of having more than $100,000 in cost savings by age 65, she would have just $57,000 nearly half as much.\n1Even if it’s early on in your profession and you just have a little amount to invest, it might be worth it. The power of time has prospective to work for itselfthe cash you do invest (even if it’s only a little) will intensify for as long as you keep it invested – Options Investing Strategies.\nBut your account would deserve over 3 times thatmore than $147,000. Diversify your financial investments to decrease risk, You normally can’t invest without coming in person with some threat. Nevertheless, there are ways to handle threat that can help you satisfy your long-lasting goals. The easiest method is through diversification and property allotment.\nOne investment might suffer a loss of worth, but those losses can be offseted by gains in others. It can be challenging to diversify when investing strictly in stocksespecially if you’re not beginning with a great deal of capital (Options Investing Strategies). This is where property allotment enters into play. Property allowance involves dividing your investment portfolio among various asset categorieslike stocks, bonds, and cash.\nSee what an IRA from Principal needs to provide. Already investing through your employer’s retirement account? Log in to review your existing choices and all the alternatives offered.\nInvesting is a way to reserve cash while you are hectic with life and have that money work for you so that you can totally enjoy the rewards of your labor in the future. Investing is a way to a better ending. Famous financier Warren Buffett defines investing as “the process of laying out money now to get more cash in the future.” The goal of investing is to put your money to operate in several kinds of investment automobiles in the hopes of growing your cash gradually.\nOnline Brokers Brokers are either full-service or discount rate. Full-service brokers, as the name implies, offer the full variety of traditional brokerage services, consisting of financial advice for retirement, healthcare, and everything associated to cash. They usually just deal with higher-net-worth customers, and they can charge substantial costs, including a portion of your transactions, a portion of your properties they manage, and in some cases, a yearly subscription charge.\nIn addition, although there are a variety of discount rate brokers without any (or very low) minimum deposit limitations, you might be confronted with other limitations, and particular fees are credited accounts that do not have a minimum deposit. This is something an investor need to take into consideration if they wish to invest in stocks.\nJon Stein and Eli Broverman of Betterment are typically credited as the very first in the space. Their objective was to utilize innovation to decrease costs for financiers and enhance investment recommendations – Options Investing Strategies. Because Improvement released, other robo-first companies have been founded, and even established online brokers like Charles Schwab have actually included robo-like advisory services.\nSome companies do not need minimum deposits. Others might typically reduce costs, like trading costs and account management charges, if you have a balance above a specific threshold. Still, others might provide a certain number of commission-free trades for opening an account. Commissions and Fees As economists like to state, there ain’t no such thing as a totally free lunch.\nYour broker will charge a commission every time you trade stock, either through buying or selling. Trading charges range from the low end of $2 per trade but can be as high as $10 for some discount brokers. Some brokers charge no trade commissions at all, however they offset it in other ways.\nNow, think of that you decide to buy the stocks of those 5 business with your $1,000. To do this, you will incur $50 in trading costsassuming the fee is $10which is comparable to 5% of your $1,000. If you were to fully invest the $1,000, your account would be minimized to $950 after trading expenses.\nShould you sell these five stocks, you would once again sustain the expenses of the trades, which would be another $50. To make the round trip (purchasing and selling) on these five stocks would cost you $100, or 10% of your preliminary deposit amount of $1,000 – Options Investing Strategies. If your financial investments do not make enough to cover this, you have actually lost money just by getting in and exiting positions.\nMutual Fund Loads Besides the trading charge to buy a mutual fund, there are other expenses associated with this type of financial investment. Shared funds are expertly managed swimming pools of financier funds that buy a focused way, such as large-cap U.S. stocks. There are numerous costs a financier will incur when buying mutual funds (Options Investing Strategies).\nThe MER ranges from 0. 05% to 0. 7% each year and differs depending on the type of fund. The higher the MER, the more it affects the fund’s general returns. You may see a number of sales charges called loads when you buy mutual funds. Some are front-end loads, but you will also see no-load and back-end load funds.\nTake a look at your broker’s list of no-load funds and no-transaction-fee funds if you want to avoid these extra charges. For the starting investor, shared fund costs are really an advantage compared to the commissions on stocks. The reason for this is that the fees are the exact same no matter the quantity you invest.\nThe term for this is called dollar-cost averaging (DCA), and it can be an excellent method to begin investing. Diversify and Lower Threats Diversification is thought about to be the only free lunch in investing. In a nutshell, by purchasing a variety of properties, you minimize the risk of one investment’s efficiency seriously hurting the return of your total investment.\nAs mentioned earlier, the expenses of investing in a a great deal of stocks could be destructive to the portfolio. With a $1,000 deposit, it is nearly difficult to have a well-diversified portfolio, so know that you might require to purchase one or two business (at the most) in the first location.\nThis is where the significant advantage of shared funds or ETFs enters focus. Both types of securities tend to have a big number of stocks and other financial investments within their funds, which makes them more diversified than a single stock. The Bottom Line It is possible to invest if you are simply beginning out with a small quantity of money.\nYou’ll have to do your homework to discover the minimum deposit requirements and after that compare the commissions to other brokers. Chances are you won’t have the ability to cost-effectively buy specific stocks and still diversify with a small quantity of money. You will also require to select the broker with which you would like to open an account.\nCheck the background of financial investment experts associated with this website on FINRA’S Broker, Check.

Golden Retrievers are specifically prone to cancer, Von Willebrand's disease, heart problems, and skin allergies. Border Collies are particularly susceptible to Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA) which causes blindness, Collie Eye Anomaly (CEA), and health problems associated with the merle gene pattern. Both breeds, however, can live healthy lives with proper care and health screening of parents.","context":["November is Canine Cancer Awareness month and in honor of sweet Bella the Golden Retriever who has been stricken with Canine Lymphoma, I chose to feature the Golden Retriever this week, along with some important information about Canine Cancer. Below information from http://www.caninecancer.com/\nWhat is Cancer?\nDog cancer, like human cancer, is the uncontrolled growth of cells on or within the body. Although there are many types of cancer, they all start because of out-of-control growth of abnormal cells. Normal body cells grow, divide, and die in an orderly fashion. During the early years of a dog's life, normal cells divide more rapidly until the dog becomes an adult. After that, cells in most parts of the body divide only to replace worn-out or dying cells and to repair injuries. Because cancer cells continue to grow and divide, they are different from normal cells. Instead of dying, they outlive normal cells and continue to form new abnormal cells.\nCancerous tumors can spread to other parts of the body where they begin to grow and replace normal tissue. This process is called metastasis. For example, breast cancer that spreads to the liver is still called breast cancer, not liver cancer. Regardless of where a cancer may spread, however, it is always named for the place it began.Not all tumors are cancerous. Benign (noncancerous) tumors do not spread (metastasize) to other parts of the body and, with very rare exceptions, are not life threatening.Different types of cancer can behave very differently. For example, bone cancer and breast cancer are very different diseases. They grow at different rates and respond to different treatments. That is why dogs with cancer need treatment that is aimed at their particular kind of cancer.Cancer rates increase in dogs with age. It is the leading cause of death in dogs over 10 years.\nIf cancer is suspected in your dog, a veterinarian may order x-rays, blood tests, ultrasounds. A biopsy (the removal of a piece of tissue) is frequently performed for confirmation that cancer exists and to determine the level of severity from benign to aggressively malignant (called grading).\nWe do not know how dogs get cancer most of the time. There are many types of cancer and many possible causes of cancer (chemicals in our environment, sun exposure, assorted viruses and infections). There are important genetic factors as well. Feeding your dog a healthy diet and keeping them away from known carcinogens will help. Spaying or neutering your dog will also reduce their risk for developing certain cancers.\nEach diagnosis of cancer requires individual care and treatment planning. Conventional treatment may include a combination of treatment therapies such as surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, cryosurgery (freezing), hyperthermia (heating) or immunotherapy.Complementary and alternative veterinary medicine (CAVM) therapies include acupuncture, behavior modification, homeopathy, herbal medicine, mega-nutrient augmentation therapy, nutritional therapy and chiropractic therapy. Once diagnosed, your veterinarian will discuss the best treatment option(s) for your dog. In some instances, your veterinarian may refer you to a board-certified oncologist (cancer specialist) depending upon the recommended course of treatment. It never hurts to get a second opinion and to research clinical trials for which you dog may be eligible.\nTreatment success depends upon the type and extent of the cancer, as well as the aggressiveness of therapy. Some cancers can be cured and almost all patients can be helped to some degree.Another critical point is to understand exactly what is meant when data on efficacy of treatment is presented. Useful terms include:Median - this is used in the context of survival, a median survival of three months means that 50% of the animals are alive at three months, but 50% have died. It does not give you any information of the range of survival of individuals from within the group. For example, individual animals may have survived for only a day to several years. A median survival is very useful to allow comparison between different types of treatment.Survival means just that: how long an animal stayed alive, usually from time of diagnosis, but it could also mean from time of treatment, or from time the owner first noticed signs of a problem. It does not give you any information on what the animal's quality of life was during that time.Progression free survival is the time the animal survived without progression of the clinical signs. This gives you a better idea of the quality of life.\nCommon Cancer Terms\nCancer: any malignant, cellular tumor; cancers are divided into two broad categories of carcinoma and sarcomas.\nNeoplasm: an abnormal new growth of tissue in animals or plants; a tumorTumor: 1.) a swelling; a cardinal sign of inflammation. 2.) neoplasm: a new growth of tissue in which cell multiplication is uncontrolled and progressive.\nBenign tumor: one lacking the properties of invasion and metastasis and showing a lesser degree of abnormal cellularity than do malignant tumors. These are usually surrounded by a fibrous capsule.\nMalignant tumor: has the properties of invasion and metastasis and displays cells with widely varying characteristicsCarcinoma: a malignant growth made up of epithelial cells tending to infiltrate surrounding tissues and gives rise to metastases.\nSarcoma: a malignant tumor originating from connective tissue or blood or lymphatic tissues.\nMetastasize: spread throughout the body, of cancer cells\nGrowth: can refer to any kind of an abnormal increase in size of tissue\nLump: can be a growth or fluid filled cyst or any structure raising above the normal surface of a tissue plane.\nAbout the Golden Retriever\nThe Golden Retriever is a sturdy, medium-large sized dog. The skull is broad and the muzzle is straight, tapering slightly with a well defined stop. The nose is black or a brownish black. The teeth meet in a scissors bite. The medium to large eyes are dark brown. The relatively short ears hang down close to the cheeks. When pulled forward the tip of the ear should just cover the eye. The tail is thick at the base with feathering along the underside. Dewclaws may be removed. The water-resistant coat is dense with a firm, straight, or wavy outer coat. There is an untrimmed feathering on the underbelly, back of the legs, front of the neck and underside of the tail. Coat color comes in cream to a rich golden.\nThese are lovable, well-mannered, intelligent dogs with a great charm. They are easily trained, and always patient and gentle with children. Charming, devoted and self-assured, they are a popular family dog. Energetic and loving, Golden Retrievers enjoy pleasing their masters, so obedience training can be very rewarding. They excel in competitions. Friendly with everyone, including other dogs, the Golden Retriever has very little, if any, guarding instincts. While unlikely to attack, Goldens make good watchdogs, loudly signaling a stranger's approach. This breed needs to be around people who display leadership to be happy. The Golden Retriever may become destructive and/or high-strung, over-exuberant and distractible if he is lacking in daily mental and physical exercise. Be sure to remain this dogs firm, but calm, confident, consistent pack leader to avoid behavioral issues. Some of the Golden's talents are hunting, tracking, retrieving, narcotics detection, agility, competitive obedience, and performing tricks. These dogs also love to swim.\nHeight: Dogs 22-24 inches (56-61cm.) Bitches 20-22 inches (51-56cm.)\nWeight: Dogs 60-80 pounds (27-36kg.) Bitches 55-70 pounds (25-32kg.)\nProne to cancer, hip dysplasia, Von Willebrand's disease, heart problems and congenital eye defects. Skin allergies are common in Golden Retrievers and often require veterinary attention. Gains weight easily, do not overfeed.\nThe Golden Retriever needs to be taken on a daily, brisk, long walk, jog or run alongside you when you bicycle, where the dog is made to heel beside or behind the person holding the lead, as instinct tells a dog that the leader leads the way and that leader needs to be the human. In addition, they like to retrieve balls and other toys. Be sure to exercise this dog well to avoid hyper activity.\nAbout 10-12 years\nThe smooth, medium-haired double coat is easy to groom. Comb and brush with a firm bristle brush, paying particular attention to the dense undercoat. Dry shampoo regularly, but bathe only when necessary. This breed is an average shedder.\nOriginating in the Scottish Highlands in the late 1800s, the Golden Retriever was developed by Lord Tweedmouth, by crossing the original yellow Flat-Coated Retriever, with the now extinct Tweed Water Spaniel. He later crossed in the bloodhound, Irish Setter, and more Tweed Water Spaniel. The dogs were called the Golden Flat-Coat and only later were they given the name Golden Retriever.","The Border Collie is a medium sized herding dog that grows to between 30 and 55 pounds as an adult.\nThis breed is alert, intelligent, and very active. They’re often black and white, but can actually come in a large variety of colors and markings,\nThis breed is generally healthy, but can display herding instincts that can be problematic if in a home with small animals and children.\nSo what else should we know about this energetic breed?\nWhat’s In This Guide\n- Border Collies At A Glance\n- In-depth Breed Review\n- Training And Care\n- Pros And Cons Of Getting A Border Collie\nThe distinctive and highly intelligent Border Collie is a breed that is popular with dog lovers everywhere.\nBorder Collie FAQs\nOur readers’ most popular and frequently asked questions about this breed.\n- Do Border Collies make good house pets?\n- Can Border Collies be aggressive?\n- What age do Border Collies live to?\nNot to mention their meteoric rise as dog agility performers.\nBreed At A Glance\n- Popularity: 35 of 193 on the American Kennel Club’s rankings\n- Purpose: Bred as a sheepdog by Scottish farmers in the 19th Century this is still the premier sheepdog in the world.

They were specifically bred for their obedience and ability to learn.\nThey are generally thought of as one of the most intelligent breeds of dog, and the most trainable.\nFun facts about Border Collies\nThis breed is something of a celebrity favorite.\nFrom famous owners like Paul McCartney and Grace Kelly to Jon Bon Jovi and Cheryl Cole, this dog keeps some illustrious company.\nActors and musicians however, are not this breed’s only claim to fame. Mary the Danish Crown Princess and even Queen Victoria made this pup their choice of companion.\nThese dogs are super bright. In fact, there is a Border Collie named Chaser who understands over 1,000 words of human vocabulary!\nTheir brightness might be why this breed is the go-to dogs for some film and television roles. You might know Shep from the television show Blue Peter. Or maybe Rex and Fly from the movie Babe.\nBorder Collie appearance\nBorder Collies are a striking breed. Despite being varied in appearance they are very distinctive and easy to identify.\nThey commonly have black and white, or blue merle, coats and a traditional wolf-like body and head shape. Their ears are semi-erect and their eyes are brown or blue. They are also known for occasionally having eyes of differing colors.\nTheir coats can be anything from smooth to rough, and long to short.\nAs they are mostly bred with work in mind rather than keeping to a specific look, they can vary fairly widely in appearance. Although they are still recognizable as a part of this breed.\nBorder Collie temperament\nThese dogs can make very loving family pets. However, as they have predominantly been bred for work they are not always naturally social. Having said that, they are eager to learn!\nIf you get a Border Collie puppy, it is very important to socialize him very well. This is especially true if he’ll be around young children and other animals.\nThis breed has inherited some natural herding instincts. This means that they might be inclined to nip. It also means that they could be prone to guarding behavior.\nGuarding behavior might mean some aggressive growling, barking or even snapping.\nWith that it mind this study ranks the the breed low on its list of dogs prone to aggressive tendencies. However, it does suggest that this breed is prone to display territorial aggression.\nPutting in some time and dedication when they are young, will mean that you will have a lifetime of happiness with a sociable and stress-free dog later on.\nTraining and exercise\nAs an intelligent, working breed Collies do require mental stimulation as well as exercise.\nThey are popularly used for agility and fly-ball training, as well as traditional sheepdog trials and obedience competitions. Their brilliant sense of smell also makes them great tracking dogs.\nHowever, due to this eagerness to learn and perform, Collies do not always make the best house pets. When bored they will have a tendency towards destructive behaviour such as chewing furniture and destroying your property.\nThey are best kept in an active household, where they can use their brains and their body on a regular basis.\nYou can read some of our training guides here:\n- Puppy Potty Training Schedule And Finishing Touches\n- The Evidence for Positive Reinforcement Training in Dogs\n- Crate Training A Puppy – The Ultimate Expert Guide\n- Dog Training Guides – Lessons And Exercises From Pippa Mattinson\nKeeping your dog occupied\nTo share a happy home with your Collie, you not only need to keep him clean but also occupy his brain.\nKeeping a collie busy, physically or mentally, is an important task too.\nYou don’t need to go for a forced march every day, but do make sure he gets a good daily walk or run. You can spend some time additional time teaching him a new skill or playing fetch in the garden.\nBorder Collie health and care\nThese dogs are a healthy bunch in general. Because they are bred to work and need to be fit to fulfill this role, they are generally in good physical shape. This said, there are some conditions and diseases they are more prone to.\n- Hip Dysplasia\n- Collie Eye Anomaly (CEA)\n- Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA) blindness\nThere are also health problems associated with the gene that causes the merle coat color pattern in dogs. These can be avoided by ensuring that two merle dogs are not mated to one another.\nYou can read about the complications associated with merle gene here. Also, you can find more information in the footnotes of this one.\nWhen choosing a Border Collie puppy, health testing is very important. Make sure the breeder provides you with the hip scores of their parents, and evidence of clear eye certificates as well.\nThis will seriously reduce the chance of your puppy having these particular genetic problems. For more information about the importance of health testing your pup you can consult the International Sheepdog Society here.\nGood news! Borders can live to a ripe old age! A study conducted in English found that this breed is among the dogs that live the longest.\nThe same study concluded that the average Border lifespan is 13.5 years. Some can live as long as 17 years!\nBorder Collie Grooming\nThese are not low maintenance dogs.\nAs most of them have fairly long coats, they will require regular grooming for all that shedding. Daily grooming can help to keep those tangles at bay.\nThe more regularly you groom your dog, and from an early age, the easier it will be for you both. So if you are thinking of getting a Border puppy, make brushing his fur a daily task from the word go.\nKeep it a part of your daily routine. That way you will find keeping his coat tangle free and manageable won’t take more than a couple of minutes a day.\nA dog who enjoys being brushed will also find this a very bonding experience with his owner.\nFeeding your Border Collie\nProviding your dog with the right kind of food is one of the best things you can do to keep him happy and healthy.\nWhat’s best to feed your dog depends on multiple factors. Older dogs for example, need approximately 20% less calories than younger dogs.\nBorder Pups need quite a lot more calories than other dogs. We have an entire guide to feeding Border Collie Pups here.\nThere are so many great options for feeding your adult dog. These include: kibble, wet-food, BARF and homemade diets. The amount of choice can be overwhelming.\nSo, be sure to check out our guides on the best way to food your Border.\n- Best Wet Dog Food – A Complete Guide to Finding What’s Best for Your Dog\n- Best Dog Food for Senior Dogs with Sensitive Stomachs\n- Feeding your puppy commercial dog food: the pros and cons of kibble\n- Raw Food for Puppies: How to Feed Your Puppy on Natural Raw Food\n- Best Inexpensive Dog Food\n- 9 Great ideas for natural raw dog food\nDo Border Collies make good family pets\nWhile Borders can make fantastic companions there are some things to consider before introducing one to your family. This is particularly true with young dogs or those who haven’t been properly socialized.\nIt is not uncommon to see a young Border Collie try to herd the children in his family. Whilst this might seem funny at first glance, remember that you don’t want to encourage this behaviour.\nYour children and your puppy both need to learn what is appropriate behaviour from the very beginning, so make sure to set boundaries. Let your children know that as soon as this behaviour begins, they are to leave the room or sit down and ignore him.\nHe may well also try and nip or bite children, as a part of this herding instinct. This can be upsetting to some children, who will emit high pitched noises that the dog finds stimulating, and so will encourage the negative behaviour.\nUnfortunately, for this reason if you have very young children this breed may not be an ideal choice for you at the moment.\nRescuing a Border Collie\nRescuing a dog can be a really rewarding experience for you and your new furry friend.\nThere are lots of great reasons to adopt a dog aside from the obvious benefit of giving a dog a new lease on life! For example, when you rescue a dog you can meet him and see if his personality matches with you and your family.\nAnother attractive reason to adopt is that the Border Collie price from reputable breeders is between $600-$800\nSome dog shelters will provide health testing, so be sure to ask that if have done all the proper health testing for these pups. They should be able to tell you about any pre-existing conditions a dog may have.\nYou can read our guide to adopting vs buying here.\nFinding a Border Collie puppy\nWhen beginning your search for a new companion we strongly advise that you avoid pet stores and puppy mills.\nPups that come from puppy farms will have no socialization. Not to mention the bitch you pup came from is almost certainly not receiving the care she needs. This might have a knock-on effect for your puppy.\nIf you see Border Collie puppies advertised and you think they may be from a farm, it’s best not to buy them. You can read our guide to spotting a puppy farm here.\nPet stores are somewhat in the same boat as puppy farms. Pups in these stores were likely sourced from puppy farms and do not receive the care they need.\nMany people are finding their new companion pooch in a mixed breed. Mixed breeds can be an excellent alternative to purebred dogs. Finding a mix may be a lot easier than finding a purebred too!\nThere is lots to consider and finding a puppy may seem daunting. Not to worry, here’s our complete guide to finding a puppy:\nRaising a Border Collie puppy\nCaring for a vulnerable puppy is a big responsibility.

{"question":"What are the potential health benefits of raw milk in preventing asthma, and what are the serious health risks associated with its consumption?","answer":"Raw milk shows potential benefits in reducing asthma risk, with studies indicating children who drink raw milk are 40-50% less likely to have asthma compared to those drinking pasteurized milk. This effect appears linked to raw milk's higher levels of whey proteins, particularly bovine serum albumin and beta-lactoglobulin, which boost glutathione levels that help protect against asthma. However, raw milk poses serious health risks as it can contain harmful bacteria that cause severe illness including vomiting, diarrhea, fever, and in some cases lead to pneumonia, blood-stream infections, kidney failure, and meningitis. Since 1993, over 70 outbreaks from raw milk consumption have been reported, affecting over 1,500 people, causing 185 hospitalizations and 2 deaths. These risks are especially severe for pregnant women, children, elderly, and people with weakened immune systems.","context":["Our valiant, cape-wearing, free radical-wrestling, toxicant-thwarting Raw Milk is back in town with his courageous army of raw food volunteers, and this time their mission is to get our good friend glutathione back in the bronchioles where this talented little tripeptide will make all things new, wiping away the wheeze and taking the anguish out of the asthma.\nChildren Who Drink Raw Milk Are Less Likely to Have Asthma\nIn October of last year, the investigators of the GABRIELA study published an analysis in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology showing that children who drink raw milk are less likely to have asthma (1). The investigators surveyed the parents of almost 35,000 children between the ages of six and twelve living in rural areas of Germany, Switzerland, and Austria to determine how likely they were to live on a farm or to have exposure to farms in some other way. They then selected a random sample of this population with similar rates of farm exposure, sending a much more detailed questionnaire to the parents of over 8,000 children, taking blood samples from over 7,500, and even taking samples of milk from the homes of 800.\nThe investigators reported the data after adjusting for farm status, specific location, age, sex, breastfeeding, family size, and the presence of asthma in the family tree. The results were impressive. Compared to children who drank only pasteurized milk from the local shop, children who drank raw milk from the local farm on a less than daily basis were forty percent less likely to have asthma while kids who reveled in this rawness on the daily were half as likely to be wrestling with the wheeze.\nBut wait, was it really the rawness that delivered them? Correlation is never causation no matter how cool the correlation can be, so we can’t attribute any saving grace to the creamy white stuff just yet. But there’s one thing we can say for sure: take out the rawness, and the correlation goes kaput. Children who drank only boiled milk from the farm were 60 percent more likely to have asthma as those who drank only pasteurized milk from the shop, but because there were only a sixth as many of these kids, the association just barely slithered under the statistical radar.\nIs there a nugget of causation lying somewhere deep within the heart of this correlation? If so, is it a nugget of sheer nastiness revealing nothing beautiful but only the hidden dangers of heat treatment, or is it a pearl of great price revealing the protective powers of unpasteurized goodness? We can get a glimpse of the likely explanation by putting on our “analytical chemistry” hats and peering into a few of the 800 glasses of milk the investigators collected from the homes of the study participants. Only through deep meditation and the assistance of modern laboratory equipment does the visible world begin to fade from our sight and the glory of our good friend glutathione come to light.\nThe Raw Whey Proteins Are Where It’s At\nAs we peer into these molecular mysteries in all their lactational luster, we should keep in mind that the shop milk and farm milk come from different sources, so differences in the data reflect more than the simple effect of heat treatment.* That caveat aside, let’s take a look.\nThe investigators divided the shop milk into two cateogories: milk that had only been heated to the minimum standards for pasteurization, and milk that had been heated with higher temperatures, for which I’ll use the term “ultra-high temperature (UHT) treatment” throughout the rest of this post.** Over 90 percent of the shop milk was UHT-treated, so this is the most important milk to look at when trying to solve the riddle of how rawness may have reduced the risk of asthma.\nWe’ll start with the obvious stuff. Surprise! Raw milk had more bacteria.\nA lot more! And believe it or not, that “c” above the invisible UHT bar means there’s even less bacteria in UHT milk than in the boiled and pasteurized milks and it’s statistically significant to boot!\nNow let’s look at transforming growth factor beta-2, a protein that is believed to suppress inappropriate immune responses. Raw milk was almost twice as high as UHT milk and almost four times as high as boiled milk, although the minimally pasteurized milk from the shop had the most.\nMoving on, we come to lactoferrin, a protein that inhibits the growth of pathogenic bacteria, encourages the growth of probiotic bacteria, acts as an antioxidant, and helps our intestinal cells make their own lactase, the enzyme that digests lactose.\nNo, I didn’t forget to draw the bars for the boiled and UHT milks. Both of these treatments obliterate lactoferrin. In fact, the raw milk was a whopping 2,866 times higher in lactoferrin than boiled milk and a mind-blowing 8,026 times higher than UHT milk! Minimal pasteurization caused a lesser loss of lactoferrin: raw milk was 36 percent higher, but the difference was not statistically significant.\nNot if you’ve been pasteurized.\nWhether cow antibodies play functional roles in humans is unclear, but, if they do, those roles must be altered or lost upon pasteurization.***\nAnd now we come to the milky, creamy part where things start to get whey cool. In “The Biochemical Magic of Raw Milk and Other Raw Foods: Glutathione,” I provided evidence that pasteurization not only lowers the total whey content of milk, but also selectively destroys bovine serum albumin and beta-lactoglobulin so that the remaining whey contains a lower proportion of these two proteins than it otherwise would. Throughout the food supply, only these whey proteins and the ovomucoid protein in egg white possess unique glutathione-boosting glutamyl-cysteine bonds (2).\nRaw milk had 56 percent more bovine serum albumin (BSA) than pasteurized milk. For boiled and UHT milk, well, you know the drill. These treatments obliterated the BSA.\nMinimally pasteurized milk fared better for beta-lactoglobulin than for BSA. It had only eight percent less of this protein than raw milk and the difference was not statistically significant. This conflicts with research I cited in “Biochemical Magic” showing that HTST pasteurized milk has thirty percent less total whey protein than raw milk (3), and that the remaining whey protein itself has 22 percent less beta-lactoglobulin (4), suggesting an overall 45 percent loss of this protein. UHT treatment and boiling nevertheless blew beta-lactoglobulin into oblivion, causing losses of about 85-95 percent, and these are the treatments most relevant to the riddle of asthma we are seeking to solve.\nAlpha-lactalbumin is the other major whey protein, but it doesn’t contain any glutathione-boosting glutamyl-cysteine bonds. It appears to survive minimal pasteurization quite well, although boiled and UHT milks had about 70 percent less than raw milk.**** Since alpha-lactalbumin lacks the special glutathione-boosting bonds possessed by BSA and beta-lactoglobulin, its greater heat-stability suggested by this study is consistent with the research I cited in “Biochemical Magic” showing that heat treatment not only depletes the total whey protein content of milk, but also renders the remaining whey protein less capable of boosting glutathione status.\nStatistically, kids who drank the milk richest in the major whey proteins had the lowest risk of asthma. None of the other milk components measured had statistically significant relationships with asthma risk. Lack of correlation doesn’t necessarily mean lack of causation, so we shouldn’t take this finding to mean that probiotic bacteria, IgG antibodies, lactoferrin, and TGF-β2 offer no protection. We should, however, begin to wonder whether our good friend glutathione might be lurking behind a powerful protection offered by raw milk whey proteins.\nHow Our Good Friend Glutathione Protects Against Asthma\nSerendipitously, while the GABRIELA investigators were studying the relationship between raw milk and asthma, researchers from the Emory University Departments of Medicine and Pediatrics and the Children’s Health Care of Atlanta Center for Developmental Lung Biology were preparing a massive 102-page tome reviewing the relationship between glutathione and asthma. They published it this March in the journal Antioxidants and Redox Signaling (5).\nGlutathione plays four major roles within the body:\n- Safe storage of the highly vulnerable and potentially toxic amino acid cysteine.\n- Protection against oxidative stress.\n- Cellular communication and regulation of protein function.\nGlutathione is generally present in the highest concentrations inside cells rather than outside. Indeed, most cells contain between a hundred and a thousand times more glutathione than is present in our blood. The extracellular fluid of the lungs, by contrast, is an exception to the rule. Glutathione concentrations there are a hundred times higher than in our blood, rivaling the concentrations within many cells. These high glutathione concentrations in lung fluid appear to have at least two special roles:\n- A high concentration of glutathione is necessary to maintain the fluidity of mucus.\n- Glutathione combines with another chemical called nitric oxide to produce nitrosoglutathione.\nNitric oxide is glutathione’s jet pack. When this G gets his nitrous on, he becomes a bronchodilator 100 times more supercharged than theophylline, a once-common asthma drug that has largely been abandoned because of its side effects. This means that nitrosoglutathione decreases resistance in the airway and increases the flow of air to the lungs — exactly what asthma drugs are designed to do! In fact, nitrosoglutathione dilates the bronchioles by stimulating the same receptors as albuterol, a common asthma drug (6). Inhaled corticosteroids synergize with albuterol by increasing the production of these receptors (7).\nCould asthma largely result from a deficiency of glutathione and nitrosoglutathione in the extracellular fluid of the lungs? Data presented in the recent review would suggest so (5). Among the most compelling of these data we find two startling facts:\n- Children with severe asthma have three times less glutathione in their lung fluid than healthy adults and two times less than children with moderate asthma, while they have two to four times as much oxidized glutathione. They also have 30 percent less cysteine in their blood, suggesting that they may not have enough cysteine to keep producing the glutathione they need.\n- Asthmatics have 70 to 90 percent less nitrosoglutathione in their lung fluid as healthy controls, and nitrosoglutathione becomes undetectable during severe asthma attacks.\nScientists are currently focusing on the role of an enzyme that destroys nitrosoglutathione. The activity of this enzyme is increased in asthma, and researchers are currently studying whether genetic variations or inflammatory insults are responsible for this increase. Test tube studies, however, suggest that glutathione itself suppresses the activity of this enzyme (8). Thus, the more glutathione we have, the more nitrosoglutathione we should have.\nIt may be the case, then, that asthma results largely from a deficiency of glutathione in the lung fluid while common asthma drugs like corticosteroids and albuterol are simply band-aid solutions aimed at replacing the natural effects of glutathione with cheap imitations.\nHelp Our Hero Save the Day!\nThere’s no better way we could help Raw Milk and his courageous army of raw food volunteers in their quest to abolish asthma than to do what any conscientious bystander would do when a panoply of edible superheroes parades through town: put them in our mouths. There are a number of other factors, however, that could help maintain robust glutathione status:\n- Eat enough protein, which supports glutathione synthesis and recycling.\n- Take in enough thiamin, niacin, riboflavin, vitamin B6, and magnesium, which support glutathione synthesis and recycling.\n- Maintain a high metabolic rate, which supports glutathione synthesis and recycling.\n- Consume collagen-rich animal parts and bone broth to obtain extra glycine, which is needed for glutathione synthesis and depleted in asthma patients.\n- Maintain an adequate intake of selenium, which helps glutathione protect against oxidative stress.\n- Maintain adequate intakes of vitamins C and E, iron, copper, zinc, and manganese, which contribute to the antioxidant defense system and thereby help spare glutathione.\n- Consume plenty of unrefined foods, especially fresh, raw fruits and vegetables. The polyphenols present in unrefined foods boost glutathione synthesis through hormesis, and raw fruits and vegetables contain large amounts of preformed dietary glutathione.\nGlutathione, moreover, is unlikely to be the be-all, end-all of asthma. In my article on vitamin D in infant nutrition, for example, I outlined evidence suggesting vitamin A deficiency is also involved.\nThe scientist in me hopes to see randomized, controlled trials comparing the ability of raw milk, pasteurized milk, UHT-treated milk, and milk-free diets to prevent and treat asthma, and comparing their effects with and without other nutritional treatments, such as the inclusion of liver, bone broth, and other nutrient-dense foods, and dietary or lifestyle interventions aimed at increasing the metabolic rate. In the mean time, self-experimentation using any of these approaches just might bring a breath of fresh air where it is most needed.\nRead more about the author, Chris Masterjohn, PhD, here.\n* We should also keep in mind that all of the proteins discussed herein were measured by antibody-based assays, and so I’ve called this “analytical chemistry” in part out of poetic license and in part out of generosity towards the researchers. The tests aren’t really measuring how much of a specific protein is there, but rather how much will bind to the antibodies they purchased. If there is a difference between milks, it shows that heat has somehow altered or destroyed the protein, but it doesn’t tell us which of these occurred, and it doesn’t tell us what the true effect of heat treatment would be on the biological activity of the protein. For the purpose of simplicity, however, I have reported the data as if they were measuring the presence of the protein.\n** The investigators measured two enzymes in the milk to determine how much heat treatment it had endured. If they found major destruction of alkaline phosphatase but only modest destruction of lactoperoxidase, they considered the milk to have been pasteurized using the high-temperature, short-time (HTST) method, which heats the milk to 72 degrees Celsius for 15 seconds. If they found major destruction of lactoperoxidase, they called it “high heat-treated,” which means the milk was brought to at least 85 degrees Celsius for at least 5 seconds, although lactoperoxidase destruction is also a feature of ultra-high temperature (UHT) treatment, which brings the milk to about 140 degrees Celsius for just a second or two. For the sake of simplicity, I have used the terms “pasteurized” and “ultra-high temperature-treated” (UHT) to describe these two treatments, but in reality the exact method used to treat each sample is unknown.\n*** Reference 2 lists the glutamyl-cysteine content of IgG as unknown. Unless this has been subsequently determined, it may remain a possibility that bovine IgG contributes to the glutathione-boosting properties of raw milk along with BSA and beta-lactoglobulin.\n**** As indicated by the “a” above the bar for boiled milk, the 70 percent lower alpha-lactalbumin content of boiled milk was not statistically significant. This is because of enormous variation among the different samples of boiled milk.\n1. Loss G, et al. The protective effect of farm milk consumption on childhood asthma and atopy: the GABRIELA study.

The New York State Department of Health recommends consuming only milk and milk products that have been pasteurized.\nWhat are the recommendations from other agencies about consuming raw milk or raw milk products?\nThe federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), the American Academy of Pediatrics and other medical, veterinary and scientific organizations recommend consuming only pasteurized milk and milk products.\nWhat is pasteurization?\nPasteurization is the process of heating milk to a high enough temperature for a long enough time to kill disease-causing bacteria contained in the milk and has been used safely for over 100 years. Pasteurization of milk became widespread in the United States by 1950. Pasteurization is the only way to ensure that milk products do not contain harmful bacteria.\nDo products made from raw milk carry dangerous bacteria?\nYes. Other foods made with raw milk include soft cheeses, sour cream, yogurt and ice cream. Any food made with raw milk can contain dangerous bacteria and consuming these foods can make you very sick.\nWhat kinds of harmful bacteria can raw milk contain?\nCan these bacteria be especially dangerous to certain people?\nYes. The bacteria in raw milk can seriously affect the health of anyone who drinks raw milk or eats foods made from raw milk. The bacteria can be especially dangerous to pregnant women, children, the elderly and people with weakened immune systems.\nWhat symptoms can people have if they become ill from drinking raw milk with these bacteria?\nMost commonly, bacteria in raw milk can cause vomiting, diarrhea (sometimes bloody), abdominal pain, fever, headache and body aches. In some instances, people can develop pneumonia, blood-stream infections, kidney failure, inflammation of the nervous system (meningitis), chronic liver disease or chronic heart disease from drinking raw milk. While some people will have mild illness from bacteria in raw milk, others are at much higher risk of life-threatening illness, especially pregnant women, children, the elderly and people with weakened immune systems (such as people with cancer or HIV infection or recipients of organ transplants).\nHow many people in the United States have become ill from consuming raw milk or raw milk products?\nSince 1993, over 70 outbreaks of human illness from consumption of raw milk have been reported nationwide, affecting over 1,500 people and causing 185 hospitalizations and 2 deaths. The actual number of illnesses associated with raw milk likely is far greater.\nWhat should I do if I become ill after drinking raw milk or eating a product made with raw milk?\nIf you or someone you know becomes ill after consuming raw milk or products made from raw milk, see a doctor or health care provider immediately, especially if you are pregnant or at higher risk for developing severe illness.\nDoes pasteurizing milk reduce its nutritional value?\nNo. The pasteurization process does not change the nutritional value of milk.\nDoes pasteurization cause disease, developmental problems or behavioral problems?\nNo. Pasteurization has never been shown to cause disease or other health problems.\nDoes pasteurization cause lactose intolerance or allergic reactions?\nNo. Pasteurization has never been shown to contribute to lactose intolerance or other allergic health problems.\nHow does New York State regulate the sale of raw milk?\nIn New York State, raw milk may only be sold at dairy farms that hold a permit from the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets. Permitted farms are required to maintain proper sanitation, animal health, packaging procedures, monthly inspections, routine sampling and testing and post signs that warn that raw milk does not provide the protection of pasteurization.\nWhere can I see a complete copy of the rules and regulations regarding raw milk sales in New York?\nRequirements for the Production, Processing, Manufacturing and Distribution of Milk and Milk Products: www.agriculture.ny.gov/DI/Laws%20in%20PDF/PART2_milk_control_law.pdf.\nWhere can I get additional information about the risks of consuming raw milk?\nVisit the following resources:\n- The Dangers of Raw Milk: Unpasteurized Milk Can Pose a Serious Health Risk - U.S. FDA\n- Raw Milk Fact Sheet - FDA & CDC\n- Health Benefits, Risks, and Regulations of Raw and Pasteurized Milk, Valente B.

In Tibet, these were usually made out of tsampa, roasted barley flour and butter. In the West we usually substitute wheat flour or oatmeal for the roasted barley flour, which is difficult and time-consuming to make. If you break down the word torma in Tibetan, tor literally means to scatter or toss out a small number of things or pieces. The suffix ma represents love. So you could say that the word torma means to offer something to someone with love. The torma is traditionally tossed outside after being used in a ritual, becoming food for insects and wild animals.\nIt is taught that in order to become enlightened, one needs to gather vast accumulations of both wisdom and merit. Wisdom is developed gradually through study and contemplation. Merit is achieved through making offerings and perfecting the practice of generosity. So tormas help us to develop the practice of generosity and are used in the ritual practices of Vajrayana Buddhism as a skillfull means of accumulating merit. They also help to relinquish attachment. Torma not only means to toss out an offering, but to give up attachment as well.\nYears ago, as an aspiring practitioner in the traditional three-year meditation retreat, I did not understand this very well and I struggled a lot with tormas. We had to make a great many of them, and our free time within the intensity of the three-year-retreat schedule was very limited. I would have preferred to study in my free time, rather than make a lot of tormas, so I felt somewhat resistant towards them. For one thing, they were difficult to make: while the geometrical shapes may have looked simple enough in the diagrams, they weren’t so easy to form in actual practice. The same with the disc-shaped decorations made out of butter: I have warm hands, so the butter melted as soon as my fingers came into contact with it. This meant immersing both hands into a big bowl of ice water to make the butter ornaments, all in all, a very unpleasant, even painful experience.\nI calculated that we spent nearly one quarter of our time in retreat making tormas, and while I could understand why we had to make them on an intellectual level, because we had been told that they were a necessary part of the practice, on a deeper level they did not make sense to me; I felt no intuitive or personal connection with them in relation to the elaborate visualization practices we were doing.\nI have often wondered why, as fledging practitioners, we weren’t given a better explanation of tormas from the very beginning, since they aren’t something we are familiar with in Western culture. There seemed to me to be something missing in the transmission. But maybe this is because the subject of tormas is actually quite complex; and the rather simple offering tormas that we made in retreat were just the tip of the iceberg, so to speak.\nEventually, I came to learn a great deal more about tormas. For one thing, merely by virtue of engaging in the practices over a long period of time, one comes to acquire a deeper appreciation of tormas and to feel that they are an integral part of the practice. But because that doesn’t usually happen in the beginning, you might say that there is a self-secret aspect to tormas, that their meaning can only be revealed gradually through extensive use.\nIn the deity practices of Tibetan Buddhism, tormas serve as a physical basis for the visualizations of offerings that are vast and limitless. But tormas do not only represent offerings to wisdom deities. There are also torma offerings made to the unenlightened spirits that wander hungry and confused in the bardo state between death and rebirth. There are tormas that are offered to harmful ghosts so that they will leave us alone and not hinder our spiritual progress. And there are also the torma offerings called tsok that we share with our vajra brothers and sisters in the context of a spiritual feast. Actually, the designation torma is not limited to offerings of any kind. The word torma can mean many things. Since there are many different kinds of tormas used in the practices of Tibetan Buddhism, there is not one, over-arching definition of the word. And in Tibet, tormas were not only made of perishable substances such as flour and butter, there were also permanent tormas made of gold, silver, clay and wood.\nSome tormas are made, not as offerings to, but as representations of deities and their retinues. Even though these may bear no physical resemblance to the depictions of deities that we see in the Tibetan Buddhist paintings, the torma’s abstract shapes and vivid colors nonetheless capture the essence of a particular deity’s enlightened qualities and thereby symbolize the deity.\nThere are tormas that represent the mandala palaces of particular deities. There are many other kinds of tormas too, depending upon the kind of practice one is doing. And there are outer, inner, secret, and ultimate meanings to them as well.\nIn 2007 I had the fortunate opportunity to discuss a torma film idea with the 17th Gyalwang Karmapa, Ogyen Trinley Dorje in Bodhgaya, India. He graciously answered many questions about tormas and out of that, a torma film project was born. The film evolved over the next few years involving many people, inspired by the fact that the Karmapa was creating a new torma tradition in the Karma Kagyu lineage. He was designing elaborate butter sculptures for the Kagyu Monlam Chenmo, the Great Prayer Festival for World Peace held annually in Bodhgaya. Monks and nuns from Karma Kagyu monasteries and nunneries throughout the Himalayan region were being trained extensively in the art of butter torma, under his direct supervision.\nDuring the course of making the film, Torma: the Ancient Art of Tibetan Butter Sculpture, which was completed in 2014, we were able to interview not only His Holiness the 17th Karmapa about tormas, but several other great masters of the Karma Kagyu Lineage as well. On a personal level, this project was a natural culmination of my early struggles with tormas and my subsequent life-long fascination with them.\nThe official trailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMSnL7pNCfs\nTo view the film online and for info about ordering the DVD: tormafilm.com\nTORMA: THE ANCIENT ART OF TIBETAN BUTTER SCULPTURE WILL BE SCREENED AT “LUNCH MATTERS,” on APRIL 22 from 1:00 – 2:30 PM.

The essence or nature of the dance is recognizing that the nature of all phenomena is the union of appearance and emptiness. One’s body, speech, and mind no longer remain ordinary, and one visualizes oneself as the form of the deity. The dance becomes a way to express this to other people. via Kagyu Monlam Chenmo 2014 News: The Benefits of the Tsechu Lama Dance.\nTwenty-nine year old Tibetan man, Orgyen Trinley Dorje – the 17th Karmapa – is currently on a two-month lecture tour of prestigious US universities, including Harvard, Princeton and Yale. Tickets for all events were immediately sold out. Who is this monk who, after visiting the headquarters of Google and Facebook, spoke about the need for a kinder internet culture? Why are so many people seeking his advice and inspiration in the 21st Century?\nLama Choenyi is a highly skilled torma artist and is responsible for many of the fancy tormas used at Karma Triyana Dharmachakra, the North American seat of His Holiness the 17th Gyalwang Karmapa, in Woodstock, New York. She recently sat down with me and graciously agreed to share her depth of knowledge and experience in the art of crafting “permanent tormas” out of clay and Fimo. She has spent many hours experimenting and over time has perfected techniques for working with the difficult-to-use materials.\nWhen did you start making big, fancy tormas out of clay? Lama Lodro (the women’s three-year-retreat master at Karme Ling Retreat) asked me to make a set of large Mahakala tormas for KTD because the ones they were using were very old and also too small. The initial problem was in finding the right materials, so I checked the art store in Woodstock for a suitable clay. I didn’t want to use Sculpey (a polymer clay) for the big tormas because Sculpey cracks, but once I experimented with natural, air-dry clay, I found that it works very nicely and smoothly.\nThe Mahakala tormas I made are very large, and I found that big tormas will shrink quite a lot as they dry, and if they aren’t hollowed out somewhat they will crack in the drying process. So after the torma is shaped and is partially dry, I hollow out the main body of the torma (but not the head). In the end, once the torma is completely dry, the hollow part will be filled up with blessed substances, and it will become very heavy again, but at least during the drying process it isn’t.\nAt what point in the shaping process do you hollow it out? First I make the whole shape as perfectly as possible. I wait a little bit and let it dry for about a week with a plastic bag over it before I hollow it out. This [hollowing out] will speed up the drying process.\nWhy use a plastic bag? The big tormas take several months to dry. So I leave the plastic bag on for a while, then take it off, and then put it back on. Taking the plastic on and off allows me to control the drying process so the clay doesn’t crack. During the drying process, the torma needs to be placed on a rack that will allow air to circulate underneath, like a cookie cooling rack. Once it starts to dry and harden, it’s easy to refine the shape because you can add a little more clay, or take some away. At the end when it is completely dry, you can smooth it with sand paper. And then you can fill it with blessed substances.\nKhenpo Karthar Rinpoche filled the tormas and I have the list here of what he put inside: in general he used damtsik (samaya substances), which include mani pills, rice blessed by the 16th and 17th Karmapa and the previous Kalu Rinpoche, (Khenpo Karthar Rinpoche has a collection of different kinds of rice blessed by holy beings), saffron, and a Tibetan text that he rolled up. For the Nyingzuk, because it represents the deity itself, Rinpoche put the body, speech and mind mantras of the deity inside, using the same text that he used when he filled the big Mahakala statue at KTD. Then he adds in fragrant substances like cloves, coriander seeds, and incense sticks, and then dried flower petals, five-colored silks, bits of paper printed with auspicious signs and symbols, and precious jewels. These are some of the same substances you would use to fill a statue since the Nyingzuk, like a statue, is a representation of the deity. Then once the hollow was filled, he sealed the bottom of the torma. Rinpoche used epoxy mixed with a little bit of powdered clay. Once that dried, Rinpoche sealed the torma further with an image of a double vajra and a red cloth glued over bottom of the torma.\nOnce the torma is all filled and ready to paint, you use a base coat of primer, let it dry, and then cover that with two or three coats of acrylic paint. When that is completely dry, you apply the glaze. The best glaze I found is the same glaze that they use on wood floors: a clear, water-based, high-gloss polyurethane. Be sure and use water-based polyurethane because it will not turn yellow over time. Oil-based polyurethane will yellow with age. You need at least two layers of this. The glaze dries fast; it only takes about two hours in between coats. After the last coat of glaze is completely dry, you can apply the norbus (jewels), marku (white lines), and gyens (ornaments) to the torma. For this I use Fimo polymer clay, (this is the name for a brand of polymer clay made by the German company Staedtler, and is found in art and craft stores in the U.S.) Here are the Fimo colors:\nAfter you apply the norbus, marku, and gyens, you have to bake it in the oven. The marku must be glued on though, and I use crazy glue for that. The instructions on the Fimo package are to bake it for 30 minutes, but because the torma itself is so big, once the decorations are applied to the torma, you have to bake it much longer than it indicates in the instructions. For instance, if you bake a flower gyen on its own in the oven, it doesn’t take more than 15 or 30 minutes. However, once you have applied the gyens to a large torma, you have to let it bake for at least 50 minutes. Follow the directions for the temperature on the Fimo package (230° F).\nI mix the colors with “Effect White” to get a translucent effect. The Fimo is very hard and you need to use a softener when you are mixing the colors for your palette. If you don’t use the softener it can take hours to knead. I found that a few drops of unscented baby oil per each block of Fimo works very well as a softener. I also pass the Fimo through a pasta machine many times to help with the kneading and softening process. This is a big time-saver but it is still a lot of work to mix the mother color with white to get the different shades of color. (You need many shades of the primary colors for the gyens). I mix the solid Fimo colors with a little bit of “soft white” Fimo plus “effect white” to get the varying shades of the colors I like to work with. Once the Fimo gyens are baked, they are very strong and will last a long time. One thing to keep in mind is that the Fimo colors darken as they bake, so you need to make samples to know what the color will look like after it bakes.

{"question":"How do the flowering times recorded at Walden Pond compare to the precision of the Blaschka glass flower models at Harvard?","answer":"The records from Walden Pond show significant changes in flowering times, with plants now blooming 20 days earlier than in 1852. Meanwhile, the Blaschka glass flower models at Harvard demonstrated remarkable precision - one model examined under microscope contained 2,500-3,000 individual buds, blooms, and developing fruit, with each flower having accurate numbers of petals and stamens, even on parts not visible during display. While the Walden records tracked temporal changes, the Blaschka models captured intricate botanical details at a specific moment with scientific accuracy.","context":["Record-Breaking Weather At Walden Pond Testing Limits Of Spring-Blooming Plants\nEmbargo expired: 16-Jan-2013 5:00 PM EST\nSource Newsroom: Boston University College of Arts and Sciences\nBoston University-initiated study shows spring ecosystems keeping pace with warming temps so far\nNewswise — (Boston) — With record-breaking warm spring weather in 2010 and 2012 resulting in the earliest known flowering times in 161 years of recorded history in two U.S. locations, according to a new Boston University-initiated study published today, scientists now are pondering if at some point plants will be unable to successfully keep adapting to a changing climate.\nRecords kept since 1852 by Henry David Thoreau near Walden Pond in Massachusetts and since 1935 by Aldo Leopold at his Sand County shack in Wisconsin, show that common wildflowers now blossom 20 days earlier and 24 days earlier respectively than in the past. Many plants need a long winter to undergo the physiological changes needed to bloom in the spring. While the researchers said there is no sign plants have hit the limit of their ability to respond to record-breaking warm temperatures, the consequences of earlier flowering for plant productivity, pollinators like bees, and ecosystems in general remain unknown and could be harmful.\n“In 2010, plants flowered three weeks earlier than in Thoreau’s time and we thought we’d never see another year like that,” said Boston University biology Prof. Richard Primack, who co-authored the paper, along with BU postdoctoral researcher Elizabeth Ellwood and colleagues Charles Davis at Harvard University and Stanley Temple at the University of Wisconsin. “But then two years later we had another record early flowering year both in Massachusetts and in Wisconsin.”\nThis new study showed that many plants – such as highbush blueberry and the pink lady’s slipper orchid – flowered up to 4.1 days earlier for every degree Celsius rise in mean spring temperatures (2.3 days earlier for every degree F rise in spring temperatures). Significantly, it showed that the historical patterns of early flowering in warm years and later in cold years can predict flowering times even in exceptionally warm years. It also found that the wildflowers just keep flowering earlier as the weather warms.\n“While these plants have shown remarkable resilience over decades of changing weather, it is unknown whether plant flowering times will continue on a linear trajectory of earlier flowering, or if at some point plants instead will be unable to keep pace with climate change and just start dying,” said Primack. “Thoreau and Leopold are icons of the American environmental movement and it is astonishing that the records both kept decades ago can be used today to demonstrate the impacts of climate change on plant flowering times.”\nThe study is published the open-access journal PLOS ONE.\nFounded in 1839, Boston University is an internationally recognized institution of higher education and research. With more than 33,000 students, it is the fourth-largest independent university in the United States. BU consists of 16 schools and colleges, along with a number of multi-disciplinary centers and institutes integral to the University’s research and teaching mission. In 2012, BU joined the Association of American Universities (AAU), a consortium of 62 leading research universities in the United States and Canada.","If you have ever pressed a flower in a book or observed a diaphanous jellyfish, you can grasp the difficulty of preserving their fragile beauty for later study. This is the story of a Czech/German glassworker and his son who, from 1863-1936, crafted thousands of beautiful and anatomically accurate glass models of hundreds of species of marine invertebrates and flowering plants.\nAn interest borne out of tragedy\nLeopold Blaschka was born into a family of glassworkers arising out of the Izera Mountains on the border between the modern-day Czech Republic and Poland, a region known for processing glass, metals, and gems. As a student, he loved natural history and painting. After being apprenticed as a goldsmith and gemcutter, Leopold joined his family’s business in Aicha, Bohemia, crafting costume jewelry and other fancy glasswork.\nIn 1846 Leopold married Caroline Zimmermann, the daughter of a local mill owner, and they had a son, Josef. But both Caroline and Josef died of cholera in 1850. Heartbroken, Leopold was depressed and in poor health, leading a reclusive existence. A local doctor, who had a large library of natural history books, encouraged Leopold to find solace by collecting, studying, and sketching the plants in the countryside around his home.\nThen Leopold’s father died in 1852. Further devastated by this loss, Leopold took time off in 1853 to visit the United States. On the outward journey from Europe, his ship was becalmed for two weeks near the Azores. Leopold spent the time collecting and drawing jellyfish and other marine invertebrates. He had never seen such animals before, except in book illustrations, and was fascinated by their glasslike transparency. He described observing their phosphorescence at night:\nIt is a beautiful night in May. Hopeful, we look out over the darkness of the sea, which is as smooth as a mirror; there emerges all around in various places a flashlike bundle of light beams, as if it surrounded by thousands of sparks, that form true bundles of fire and other bright spots of light, and the seemingly mirrored stars. There emerges close before us a small spot in a greenish light, which becomes ever larger and larger and finally becomes a bright shining sunlike figure.\nAfter arriving in New York, he stayed for a few months, supplying goods to wholesale jewelers. Then he returned home to Aicha, where he married Carolina Riegel in 1854, establishing a glass workshop in his father-in-law’s house. He supervised workmen in producing glass eyes, costume ornaments, lab equipment, and other goods. In his spare time, he began crafting glass models of plants as a seemingly profitless hobby, with no idea of where his idle artmaking would eventually lead him and their only child, Rudolf, who was born in 1857.\nFrom orchids to anemones\nLeopold’s hobby caught the attention of Prince Camille de Rohan, who invited Leopold to his castle. From 1860-1862 he commissioned Leopold to produce about 100 models of nearly fifty species of orchids based on specimens from the Prince’s greenhouses. The Prince then displayed them on two artificial tree trunks in his palace in Prague. The prince also introduced Leopold to Professor Ludwig Reichenbach, the director of Dresden’s Royal Natural History Museum and Botanical Garden, who displayed the models in the garden’s pavilion in 1863. The glass orchids were later lost in a Belgian museum fire, but a bouquet of flowers which Leopold crafted in that era, shown below, survives.\nLeopold moved his family to Dresden. While the glass flowers aroused little commercial interest, an Englishman living in Dresden remarked to Leopold how glass models of sea anemones, which are notoriously perishable, could adorn aquaria. He loaned Leopold a book with illustrations of sea anemones and corals.\nBuilding a business\nRemembering his own experience seeing sea invertebrates a decade earlier, Leopold used the illustrations to craft models which were purchased by museum director Reichenbach for display in dry aquaria. By 1871 Leopold had built the making of glass marine animals into a business, producing a mail order catalog that would offer hundreds of different models of anemones, worms, echinoderms, molluscs, and jellyfish. Reichenbach noted in the catalog how the glass models were better than specimens preserved in alcohol, as the glass models retained both their shape and color, while preserved invertebrate specimens inevitably subsided into dull shapeless masses at the bottom of their jars.\nLeopold and Caroline’s son, Rudolf, grew into a teenager who studied with his father and fully joined the family business by 1876 at age 19. They began maintaining living specimens in seawater aquaria, and Rudolf made a field trip to the Adriatic in 1879 to study more invertebrates.\nTheir work, a combination of both glassblowing and lampwork, steadily shifted from a more showy decorative style toward increased scientific accuracy. They sometimes incorporated the shells of terrestrial, freshwater, and marine gastropods and created glass bodies attached to the shells of bivalve molluscs. A fine speckled layer of pigment, often applied to the inner surface of the glass, conveyed a jelly-like translucence. Thicker skins and textures were crafted from deeper coats of paint or enamel, often mixed with a fine granular material.\nThey sold specimens to museums around the world, with some universities building up prodigious collections. They sold 784 models to a London museum, about 600 to Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, 530 to a Dublin museum, 350 to Harvard’s famed naturalist Louis Agassiz, and Boston University acquired 311 of them. Harvard still has 185 Blaschka models in its Natural History Museum.\nHenry Ward, a protégé of Harvard’s Agassiz, became a professor of natural science at the University of Rochester in 1860. After creating a superb teaching collection, he went into business in 1873. Ward’s Natural Science became the North American agent for Leopold Blaschka, issuing a 22-page catalog in 1878 of 630 different Blaschka models, which grew to 700 in Ward’s 1888 catalog.\nWard’s Natural Science continues to sell biological models of various materials to this day, and our own Bartlesville High school has some of them, but none of the Blaschka models. By the middle of the 20th century, Ward’s was able to build a thriving business shipping live specimens to schools, which seemed to render the glass marine models obsolete. However, the diminishing populations of these fragile creatures has renewed interest in the Blaschkas’ work, with Cornell offering online photographs of 250 Blaschka marine models and Harvard now restoring some of its models.\nFrench photographer Guido Mocafico was photographing jellyfish in aquaria. While researching jellyfish online, he kept stumbling across images of the glass models, mistaking them for the real thing. So he decided to travel across Europe, taking photos of Blaschka marine models, using an array of backlights to make the sculptures glow as if lit from within.\nHarvard’s Glass Flowers\nIn 1886, George Lincoln Goodale, a botany professor at Harvard, traveled to Germany to try to persuade Leopold to abandon making marine models and concentrate again on plants. Goodale had seen the marine models and knew that glass models would solve his problems with flower specimens which lost their dimensionality and eventually their color after pressing.\nLeopold was reluctant, given the general lack of appreciation for his earlier plant models and the loss of so many in a museum fire. But Goodale eventually persuaded Leopold to make a few samples. Even though they were badly damaged by U.S. Customs, Goodale appreciated the work and showed them widely, convincing his former student Mary Lee Ware and her mother Elizabeth, who were independently wealthy benefactors of Harvard’s botany department, to underwrite the commissioning of glass flowers from the Blaschkas. The Wares were descendants of the Cabots, a wealthy family of Massachusetts ship merchants since the 1700s.\nIn 1887 the Blaschkas agreed to spend half of their time on the glass flowers, but found it difficult to split their time between the marine models and the flowers, deciding by 1890 they must devote themselves to one or the other. Harvard signed them to a ten-year exclusive contract for 8,800 marks per year, with arrangements to ship the items directly to Harvard where Mary Lee Ware and museum staff could open them safely in the presence of Customs officials.\nHarvard sent the Blaschkas seeds, plant cuttings, and specimens, and the Blaschkas had their own greenhouse and garden in Dresden. The plant models were made with internal copper wire armatures with glass pieces slid onto them and attached with hide glue or melted glass sprit. The accuracy and skill of their work was amazing.\nIn 1894 several of the Blaschka plant models were subjected to microscopic examination by Harvard botanist Walter Deane. He documented their scientific accuracy: one model he examined had 2,500-3,000 individual buds, blooms, and developing fruit, with each flower having its five petals and five alternating stamens, and the back side, even though not visible when on display, he found to be equally complete and accurate.\nThe Blaschkas used a mixture of clear and colored glass, with Rudolf painting many of the works with watercolors and oil-based paints. Mary Ware took an avid interest in the work and personally unpacked each model and made arrangements for Rudolf’s fieldwork. Rudolf traveled to the United States in 1892 and Jamaica in 1895 to study additional plants, making extensive drawings and notes. At that point, the Blaschkas were sending about 120 glass models to Harvard annually. Upon meeting Mary Ware on his 1892 trip, Rudolf described her as “a large blond lady of very lively temperament.”\nThe Blaschkas plant models were crafted by lampwork. Instead of glassblowing with a furnace, they used the flame of a lamp to heat rods of glass which were softened and then pulled, shaped, and fused. Harvard has the lampworking table the Blaschkas used, with its foot-operated bellows providing a stream of air that intensified the lamp flame.\nA letter of Leopold’s remarked, “Many people think that we have some secret apparatus by which we can squeeze glass suddenly into these forms, but it is not so. We have tact. My son Rudolf has more than I have, because he is my son, and tact increases in every generation.”\nLeopold passed away in 1895, but Rudolf continued the work at a slower pace to achieve higher levels of perfection. By the early 20th century he could not buy glass of suitably high quality and started making his own, as well as the enamels which he powdered to use in paint and colored glass. Mary Ware encouraged him, supporting his glassmaking experiments.\nA lifetime of dedication and support\nRudolf married Frieda Richter in 1911, when he was in his mid-50s. Mary remained a generous benefactor and correspondent. Rudolf’s mother, Carolina, passed in 1923. When Mary Ware visited Rudolf for the third and final time in Dresden in 1928, with six years having passed since the last shipment, she wrote of the 71-year-old craftsman, “I was daunted to see what seemed a little old man, legs that were not strong, very rounded, stooped shoulders, and an exceedingly white face. He must have dropped nearly two inches in height, his hands were somewhat out of shape from rheumatism.” But she was reassured when he showed her his new techniques for enameling the models with his powdered glasses:\nHis movements are quiet, deft, soft in laying down or taking up where speed or a miscalculated movement might ruin the work of hours. It all leaves you breathless that anyone can and will do such work… Mr. Blaschka’s head and bearing are very expressive, and I wished I could catch a photograph of his profile as he stood for a few moments, a plaque with a model on it held in both hands. His whole expression of absorbed, concentrated study was worth keeping, had it been possible.\nRudolf continued making glass flowers for Harvard with a final series on rotting fruits and fungi that were shipped to Harvard in 1936. Mary Ware passed away the next year, leaving over one million dollars in assets. Her will bequeathed $600,000 to charity and education, with the largest single bequest in her will being $300,000 for completion and upkeep of the Glass Flowers and support of Rudolf and Frieda. She had supported the project for five decades.\nRudolf died on May 1, 1939. Unfinished models remained on his lampworking table. The Harvard collection had grown to 4,400 pieces representing more than 830 species of 164 taxonomic families. 780 species were modeled life-size with over 3,000 other models illustrating magnified details. They included a variety of plant parts such as flowers, leaves, fruits, and roots, including some showing pollination by insects.\nFrieda died in 1947. She and Rudolf had no children and neither Rudolf nor Leopold had taken on any apprentices. So their amazing skills were not passed on and their family’s glassmaking tradition was brought to an end. Together they had produced about 10,000 glass marine invertebrate models along with the 4,400 plant models at Harvard. Leopold and Carolina, together with Rudolf and Frieda, share a grave in the Hosterwitz cemetery in Dresden.\nHarvard is investing in restoring its famed glass flowers, some of which are now over 130 years old. A lasting legacy that has long preserved some of the world’s most ephemeral natural wonders."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"advanced_reasoning"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:cd130e7c-11fc-45d5-8788-f5e59d837290>","<urn:uuid:b32ca2d7-6176-4c95-bde2-a052d4ec37dc>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Can someone explain fundamental advantages of digital x-rays vs traditional percussion testing in dental diagnosis? Need step-by-step breakdown plz!","answer":"Digital X-rays and percussion testing serve different diagnostic roles. Digital X-rays provide immediate visual diagnostic information with 80% less radiation than traditional X-rays, allowing dentists to instantly view, adjust, and magnify images on screen to identify cavities and other concerns. Images can be easily shared with specialists for second opinions. Percussion testing, on the other hand, involves the dentist tapping on teeth to identify problematic teeth through pain response. The dentist assigns grades (TTP+, ++, +++) based on tenderness levels and compares responses between different teeth. While percussion testing helps identify specific painful teeth and inflammation, digital X-rays provide comprehensive visual information about tooth structure, bone condition, and underlying issues that aren't visible through percussion alone.","context":["What Special Tests does the Dentist do?\nThis is where the dentist feels the mucosa overlying the roots to see if any swelling is present. If a tooth is particularly infected or an abscess has formed, then there is likely to be some level of inflammation in the bone surrounding the tooth that the dentist can feel. In this case, we know the nerve in the tooth has died.\nThis is where the dentist taps gently on your tooth with either a finger or the handle of one of the instruments in order to try and identify the tooth causing the problems. If the nerve has become necrotic (died) and infection is around the end of one of the teeth, then one particular tooth is likely to stand out and be painful compared to the others. The dentist will often test the other side too for comparative purposes. We record each of the teeth tested in our notes and assign it a grade depending on your response. TTP (tender to percussion) + means a little more tender than normal, ++, definitely more tender and +++ if it is extremely tender.\nIf there is inflammation in the periodontal ligament surrounding the tooth or an acute apical abscess has formed, this can raise the tooth slightly in the socket and make it may appear slightly loose. It is important to rule out other possible causes of increased mobility such as periodontal disease. More information on the grading of mobility can be found in the assessment of gum disease.\n- Vitality testing\nSometimes called ‘pulp testing’, are tests done to try and determine the state of the nerve inside the tooth. On a very basic level we are trying to determine if it is alive or dead, but these tests aren’t totally accurate and really only give us an indication- a piece of the jigsaw- as we try to discover which tooth or teeth are causing the problem.\nWe have three main ways in which we do this:\n(i) Electric current- the dentist may hold a little probe against the tooth that sends out a small electric current of increasing strength to try and produce a response from the nerve. Don’t worry it doesn’t hurt- you won’t get an electric shock but you may feel a little tingle inside the tooth if it is alive. The technique for this is pretty sensitive and we sometimes get misleading results, as it is possible to stimulate nerves endings in the surrounding gum.\n(ii) Cold- various methods exist for applying cold to a tooth. The most common is ‘ethyl chloride’- a spray that is put on a cotton wool pledget and applied to the tooth, but ice sticks and other methods are also used. Whilst the spray is very cold (in the region of -30c), it is not like putting ice cream on your front teeth and the moment you feel anything, the dentist will withdraw and I suggest you just pop your tongue on the tooth to warm it up. If a tooth is already sensitive then this test would not be necessary and simply using air from the 3 in 1 syringe would be good to identify the problem tooth.\n(iii) Heat- if the tooth is painful to heat, the dentist may wish to confirm this by using a bit of Vaseline to make sure it doesn’t stick and a heated GP point-( this is the filling material used in root canals).\nThese form such an important part of a dentists’ armoury, that we have dedicated a whole section to the different types of dental X-rays that may be needed. The extra information that X-rays provide is crucial to working out what is wrong, what needs to be done and is an integral part of the examination procedure.\nThe X-ray (s) that the dentist will take depend on the problem they suspect. Listed below are the main views that may be needed and in what circumstances:\nPeri-apical X-ray– If you are having symptoms of irreversible pulpitis, it is important we are able to see if there are any changes around the tips of the roots and this won’t show on the bite-wing above, so we take this view instead. We would also take a peri-apical X-ray if any symptom or test suggests a problem in the tissues around the root such as pain on biting or tapping (percussion), if the tooth is loose, or if an abscess or swelling is present.\nOPG This X-ray is useful when there is range of problems and symptoms, or multiple broken teeth which could be causing the problem as it shows all the teeth and the entire jaw. It is good for identifying problems with wisdom teeth,or the jaw, or simply as a place to start when the history of the problem is particularly confusing.\nNote. Sometimes more than one view will be necessary.","CBCT scan (3D x-ray)\nVisual your problem more clearly. Help your doctor to provide more accurate treatment.\nCBCT scans capturing data using a cone-shaped X-ray beam. CBCT is used in dental profession. These data are used to reconstruct a three-dimensional (3D) image of the following regions of the patient’s anatomy: dental (teeth); oral and maxillofacial region (mouth, jaw, and neck); and ears, nose, and throat (“ENT”). Also, the CBCT data can create 3D volumetric rendering.\nWhat is the difference between dental CT (CBCT) and medical CT?\n- CBCT is better than the conventional CT used in medical field because it is less expensive and has lower doses of absorption.\n- The CBCT systems used by dental professionals rotate around the patient, capturing data using a cone-shaped X-ray beam.\nWhat is the benefits of CBCT?\n- dental CBCT, provides a fast, non-invasive way of answering several clinical questions.\n- Dental CBCT images provide three-dimensional (3-D) information, rather than the two-dimensional (2-D) information provided by a conventional X-ray image.\n- 2D imaging had some weakness such as image enlargement, elongated or shortened object, image distortion, superimposed structures. The real anatomy could be evaluated and analyzed better from three-dimensional (3D) image.\nWhat is the advantage of CBCT over 2D image?\n- reliable diagnosis tool for the detection and quantification of bone resorption in periodontal diseases.\n- Images without magnification\n- Better visualization of the defective\n- No distortion and overlapping of the images from CBCT.\nDue to present better detail, CBCT is used in many ways.\n- Locate the impacted or retained teeth.\n- Locate impacted tooth in order to place bracket for orthodontic treatment.\n- Treatment planning for dental implant\n- Surgical simulation for orthognathic surgery case (Surgery)\n- Find the amount of root canals.\n- Evaluate the bone height and thickness.\nDigital X- Ray\nA digital x-ray allows the dentist to take an image of the tooth or teeth and put it into an imaging program immediately. Within this imaging program, there are several tools that will allow the dentist to take a close look at the teeth and surrounding structures with amazing accuracy. As a benefit to the patient, the digital x-ray also provides nearly 80% less radiation than a standard x-ray. This is because the digital version of the x-ray is much more sensitive to this radiation and has been specifically designed with the patient in mind.\nProcedure of digital dental X-ray\nThe actual procedure for having a digital dental x-ray is very similar to a traditional x-ray. our highly trained dental team will carefully insert a sensor into your mouth, and which will capture the image of your teeth or jaws. This digital sensor sends the information directly to a computer so that the images taken can be instantly viewed on a screen in the treatment room. Alternatively, images may be taken using a specialized scanner, or we can use a combination of a sensor and a scanner to produce a digital image. The exact method used is dependent on the type of x-ray required.\nThe benefit of Digital X-rays\n- Once the digital image is on-screen, we can adjust it if necessary, enlarging or magnifying any areas which require close inspection. This makes it much more straightforward to identify any small cavities or other areas of concern.\n- Diagnose any problems more efficiently and more quickly,\n- Be available for viewing immediately since it does not have to be first developed like the old film x-rays.\n- It is also very straightforward for us to show you these images on-screen and to explain any problems and how best to treat them.\n- If a second opinion is required, these digital images can be emailed to a dental specialist, a process which is much faster and more efficient than having to mail conventional x-ray films.\n- Available for patient education\nWhat Are the Different Types of Digital Dental X-Rays?\nDigital dental x-rays can be taken inside your mouth (intraoral), or they may be taken outside your mouth (extraoral).\nIntraoral x-rays include:\n- Bite-wing X-Rays: You must bite down on a sensor for an x-ray can be taken in a specific part of the mouth. Bite-wing x-rays are frequently used for detecting decay in between teeth, to check the condition of bone around teeth and to assess the fit and integrity of dental restorations including crowns and fillings.\n- Periapical X-Rays: A periapical x-ray shows the entire tooth from its crown to the tip of the tooth root, as well as the bone surrounding the tooth. Periapical x-rays are useful in detecting periapical lesion and for assessing bone loss around the tooth which can occur if you have advanced gum disease.\nExtraoral x-rays include:\n- Panoramic X-Rays: A panoramic x-ray is taken by a machine that rotates around your head, providing a single detailed image of all your teeth in your upper and lower arch. Panoramic x-rays are particularly useful for assessing impacted wisdom teeth and other jaw problems, and for planning dental treatments including implants.\n- Lateral Cephalometric x-rays: is particularly useful for orthodontic treatment planning.\n- Postero-Anterior Cephalometric x-rays is particularly useful for identify facial asymmetry in orthognathic surgery case."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:ee403cd0-cd36-4999-bcc4-0bddea5f5f30>","<urn:uuid:b965a95f-13fe-4037-b378-b9d3606acbce>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Could you break down the key differences between African-American poets' focus on social issues vs W.H. Auden's view on poetry's social impact? This would make an interesting comparison!","answer":"African-American poets' works actively reflected and addressed social issues like discrimination, racism, slavery, and civil rights, with poets using their platform to create revolutionary thoughts that influenced social development. In contrast, W.H. Auden, despite writing politically-charged poems earlier in his career, later believed that poetry could not affect politics, stating that 'poetry makes nothing happen' and that social and political history would have been the same regardless of great artists' existence.","context":["The African-American culture is unique, with its own distinctive characteristics. This community has played a huge role in the overall development of every facet of the world including arts, science, music, history, and literature. In history, works of African-American poets reflected social issues like social discrimination, racism, slavery, and the civil war. Today, it has transformed into a full-fledged genre that concentrates on lighter issues like music, emotions, and contemporary social events. Over the course of time, a few poets of African-American descent created their own niche in the literary community.\nPhillis Wheatley (1753 - 1784)\nPhillis Wheatley was one of the pioneer African-American poet. She was born in Gambia, Senegal, in the year 1753, and was enslaved at the tender age of 8. She was brought to America in a ship named 'Phillis', and was purchased by the 'Wheatley' family of Boston. This tells us the precise story about her name. The poem that she wrote about the death of an evangelical preacher encouraged her to write more poems.\nLangston Hughes (1902 - 1967)\nJames Langston Hughes was an African-American poet, playwright, novelist, columnist, and short story writer. He was born in Joplin, Missouri, in the year 1902. Langston Hughes started to write poems at the age of 13. He is best known for his works during the Harlem Renaissance and his writing, 'Harlem was in Vogue'. His first poetry collection, 'The Weary Blues' was published in the year 1926. He played a huge role in garnering recognition for his community, and giving it the status that it possesses today.\nArna Bontemps (1902 - 1973)\nArna Bontemps was an honored member of the Harlem Renaissance. He was born in the city of Alexandria, Louisiana, in the year 1902. He began writing when he was a college student, and soon after, authored several books for children. Later, he collaborated with the contemporary poet Langston Hughes to co-author several books on African-American culture.\nDudley Randall (1914 - 2000)\nDudley Randall was born in the year 1914 in Washington DC. He showed keen interest in poetry since his early childhood. His very first poem appeared in the Detroit Free Press, when he was merely thirteen years of age. 'Ballad of Birmingham' is one of his famous poems which he wrote as a reaction to the 1963 bombing on a Baptist church. Some of his famous works include 'Booker T. and W.E.B.', 'A poet is not a Jukebox', and 'The Profile on the Pillow'.\nGwendolyn Brooks (1917 - 2000)\nGwendolyn Brooks was born in Topeka, Kansas, in the year 1917. Brooks' first book of poetry, 'A Street in Bronzeville', was published in the year 1945. She was the author of more than 20 books during her 50 years career as a poet. Some of her famous books include 'Riot', 'In The Mecca', and 'The Bean Eaters'. Her book 'Annie Allen' won her the Pulitzer Prize. She was nominated for many other honorable awards.\nMaya Angelou (Born: 1928)\nMaya Angelou was born in Saint Louis, Missouri, in the year 1928. She has been called 'America's most visible black female autobiographer'. Best known for her series of six autobiographical volumes of the book 'I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings'. She was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize for 'Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water 'Fore I Diiie'. Her book of poetry 'I Shall Not Be Moved' concentrates on racism while 'Phenomenal Women' deals with the place of women in the early 21st century.\nIshmael Reed (Born: 1938)\nIshmael Reed was born in Chattanooga, Tennessee, in the year 1938. He is a controversial poet, essayist, and novelist, who is known for his satirical poems that challenged American political and cultural oppressions. His first novel 'The Freelance Pallbearers' was published in the year 1963. His book 'Conjure' was nominated for the famous Pulitzer Prize, and he was also a finalist for the National Book Award, twice.\nNikki Giovanni (Born: 1943)\nNikki Giovanni was born in Knoxville, Tennessee, in the year 1943. She is a Grammy nominated poet, writer, and activist. She is the author of more than 17 books of poetry. Her work is often focused on the quest of social equality and black freedom movements. As a result, her first collection to be published in the year 1968 was named 'Black Feeling, Black Talk'. Many of her books are available in the spoken word recordings, including the famous 'Truth Is On Its Way'. She is a survivor of lung cancer and is currently teaching at Virginia Tech.\nAfrican-American poets were responsible for creating a major wave of revolutionary thoughts, that later proved to be the cornerstone in the development of today's social stratification.","Geographic Connection to Pennsylvania: Swarthmore, Delaware County\nAcclaimed Modernist poet W. H. Auden taught for a few years at Swarthmore College.\nW. H. Auden was born in York, England, in 1907. Early influences that would enter his poetry included his Anglo-Catholic household, his father's medical library, and his Icelandic background. After attending the University of Oxford he traveled around Europe writing poetry, plays, travel books, and libretti, and serving as tutor and schoolmaster at various small schools. He moved to the United States in 1939 and taught at the University of Michigan (and was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship) and Swarthmore College. Later in life, Auden gave lecture tours and readings as Professor of Poetry at Oxford, while continuing to write poetry until his death in 1973 in Austria.\nWystan Hugh (W. H.) Auden was born February 21, 1907, in York, England. He grew up in Birmingham, where his father, George Augustus Auden, was appointed School Medical Officer of Public Health. Wystan first became acquainted with psychoanalytic theory in his father's library. These concepts would show up later in his writings, and in 1940 he would write a poem entitled \"In Memory of Sigmund Freud.\" The family's Icelandic ancestry introduced the young Auden to the legends of Iceland and Old Norse sagas. These would both influence his later work.\nAuden was brought up in an Anglo-Catholic household, but his religious faith began to fade in his teenage years when he was enrolled in a succession of boarding schools. He became aware of his homosexuality at a young age and felt guilty about it, perhaps due to his mother's disapproval. At St. Edmund's School in Surrey, he first met future novelist Christopher Isherwood. Isherwood would become Auden's close friend and literary companion later in life.\nIt was at his next school that a friend asked Auden why he had never written poetry. Auden had no good answer, so he began to try his hand at emulating the poetry of William Wordsworth and Thomas Hardy.\nIn 1925, Auden attended Christ Church College at the University of Oxford, originally planning to study natural science but switching in his second year to English. Christopher Isherwood would later write of Auden's interest in science: \"Auden is essentially a scientist... He has acquired the scientific outlook and technique of approach; and this is really all he needs for his writing.\"\nAt Oxford, Auden became part of a group of left-wing poets that included Cecil Day-Lewis, Louis MacNeice, and Stephen Spender. This group would later be referred to as the \"Thirties Poets\" or the \"Auden group.\" It was also at Oxford that Auden discovered an affinity for the poetry of T.S. Eliot and immediately tried to replicate him. Isherwood wrote that Auden initially took Eliot's modernist allusions and discordant jargon too far, to the point where he sounded like \"a patient who has received an over-powerful inoculation.\" Though it took a few years, Auden eventually found his own—yet still distinctly modernist—style. In 1928, Stephen Spender hand-printed Auden's first collection, simply titled Poems.\nAfter graduation in 1928, Auden left for nine months with Isherwood in Berlin. This trip was later cited by Auden as the beginning of a concern for political and economic discord—a concern that would pervade his poetry. In Berlin, Auden began to write in German, maintaining his idiosyncratic style despite not knowing the finer points of German grammar. Isherwood would later receive critical acclaim for his novel The Berlin Stories, which was included on TIME magazine's list of 100 best American novels since 1923 and formed the basis for the musical Cabaret.\nIn 1930, T.S. Eliot accepted Auden's manuscript for the publisher Faber and Faber. This became Auden's first published work, again simply called Poems. It included his first play, Paid on Both Sides, a comedic drama that referenced the Icelandic sagas as well as Auden's experiences at boarding school.\nFrom 1930 to 1935, Auden worked temporary positions at several boys' schools in England, and wrote regularly. Much of his work at this time combined writing media, such as the mixed prose and poetry of The Orators, or the drama and poetry of The Ascent of F6 and The Dog Beneath the Skin, both plays co-written with Christopher Isherwood. The Ascent of F6 contained the first appearance of the poem \"Funeral Blues\" (also known as \"Stop all the clocks\" for its first line), one of Auden's best-known works. This poem was rewritten by Auden into the form of a cabaret song, and this version became widely known in contemporary pop culture when it was recited in its entirety in the 1994 British film Four Weddings and a Funeral.\nIn 1935, Auden married Erika Mann, daughter of German novelist Thomas Mann. Erika Mann was an openly anti-Fascist German who feared arrest from the Third Reich and was looking for British citizenship. She had first asked Isherwood for help, and he had suggested she ask Auden. Auden replied to her proposal with a one-word telegram: \"Delighted.\" Mann and Auden, both queer, remained technically married until Mann's death in 1969, but the two never actually lived together. Auden dedicated his 1937 collection, On This Island (known as Look, Stranger! in the U.S.) to Mann. His dedication included the lines \"What can truth treasure, or heart bless,/ But a narrow strictness?\" Peter Edgerly Firchow suggested in his book \"W.H. Auden: Contexts for Poetry\" that these lines pointed to a new \"preference for truth over art\" in Auden's poetry in the late thirties.\nFor the next five years Auden worked variably as a freelance reviewer, lecturer, and documentary filmmaker, and wrote plays, songs, and libretti. Resolving to combine journalistic reporting and art, Auden traveled to Iceland to write a travel book Letters from Iceland, and then to the fronts of the Spanish Civil War and the Sino-Japanese War. Auden and Isherwood's joint work of prose, verse, and photographs, called Journey to a War, was published in 1939.\nUpon return, Auden left Britain for New York, accompanied by Isherwood. This move was largely seen as a betrayal of England by one of the best-respected literary figures of the nation. But being queer and famous in England was risky, and Auden had long planned to permanently move to America. This was not, as some have speculated, a move to escape World War II. In fact, he wrote to an English friend that visiting the war was a reason to consider returning to England. In an essay titled \"W.H. Auden as a Social Poet,\" Frederick Buell speculated that Auden, by taking himself out of the spotlight and into the anonymity of New York, was \"doing what was necessary for his poetic growth, not only in disassociating himself from the moribund movement of the thirties in England, but also in schooling himself in a new privacy from which he could reevaluate both man's relation to society and man's relation to God.\"\nAnother major reason that Auden chose to remain in America during the war was his relationship with the poet Chester Kallman. Auden had fallen in love with Kallman and saw their relationship as an unofficial \"marriage.\" Though Kallman ended their sexual relations in 1941, the two would remain close friends and housemates for the rest of Auden's life.\nAuden rejoined the Anglican Church in 1940. Influenced by the writings of poet Charles Williams, philosopher S??ren Kierkegaard, and theologians Reinhold Niebuhr and Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Auden began to practice a worldly type of Christianity that focused on the body and suffering. Though many of his older poems contained recurring themes of the separation between humanity and nature, he started to emphasize a smooth continuity from humanity to nature through the body. Many of his poems now were long works, such as \"New Year Letter,\" a philosophical poem that makes up most of his 1941 collection The Double Man.\nAuden taught English at the University of Michigan from 1941 until 1942, when he was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship, which would provide him grant money to spend freely on creative pursuits. He chose not to use this money and instead moved to Swarthmore College to teach until 1945. Monroe K. Spears, a visiting professor of English to Swarthmore, detailed Auden's period at the college in a Swarthmore newsletter: \"He wrote frequently for the Phoenix [the school newspaper], lectured at various functions, reviewed the College plays, spoke at Collection, served on committees for the judgment of student poetry, and so on. \" He rarely spoke about his own poetry or gave readings, as he was only a lecturer in English, not a creative writing instructor or poet-in-residence. Spears also cites students reports on Auden's individualistic appearance: \"He is reported to have worn no socks, except occasionally on his head in bad weather, and no underwear; to have used a rope for a belt, worn bedroom slippers on the street, and often entertained in bathrobe and slippers.\" Auden was also noted for bringing suitcases full of private stores of alcohol to the dry campus.\nAfter World War II ended, Auden traveled once again to Germany, this time to study the psychological effects of Allied bombs on German troops. In 1946, he returned to America and finally became a naturalized U.S. citizen. He began to spend his summers in Ischia, Italy, which created the setting for many of his poems in his next collection, Nones. He summered there until he bought his first house, at the age of 51, in Kirchstetten, Austria.\nBeginning in 1949, he and Chester Kallman collaborated on several libretti, including that of Igor Stravinsky's opera The Rake's Progress, and two for Hans Werner Herze. On these and his earlier collaborations, Auden would later write: \"collaboration has brought me greater erotic joy ... than any sexual relations I have had.\"\nFrom 1956 until 1961, Auden held the position of Professor of Poetry at Oxford, a prestigious part-time position that only required he give three lectures per year. This gave him time to winter on St. Mark's Place, New York and continue to summer in Austria. For work he gave readings and lectures and wrote for the New Yorker. Several of his lectures from this period were collected in 1962 into The Dyer's Hand.\nThroughout the sixties and into the seventies, Auden wrote a book of poetry every three years. The last collection he completed in his lifetime was 1972's Epistle to a Godson. Some critics said that his poetry had declined since the 1940s and —50s, when highly-regarded modernist poet John Ashbery had called Auden \"the modern poet.\" But Edward Mendelson, literary executor of the estate of W.H. Auden, argued that this was not a decline, but just a change—perhaps a departure from the usual modernist style. Mendelson says in his introduction to Auden's Selected Poems that \"most critics of twentieth-century poetry judged poems by their conformity to modernist norms,\" and that \"except in his earliest and latest poems, there is virtually nothing modernist about [Auden].\"\nMendelson writes in an essay entitled \"Auden's Revision of Modernism\" that the poet \"welcomed into his poetry all the disordered conditions of his time, all its variety of language and event.\" This is in stark contrast to the nostalgia and aversion to the present of the major modernists like William Butler Yeats, D.H. Lawrence, T.S. Eliot, or Ezra Pound.\nRegardless of how his style is classified, Auden is known for being obscure and inaccessible at times. Isherwood says: \"When Auden was younger, he was very lazy. He hated polishing and making corrections. If I didn't like a poem, he threw it away and wrote another. If I liked one line, he would keep it and work it into a new poem. In this way, whole poems were consctructed which were simply anthologies of my favourite lines, entirely regardless of grammar or sense. This is the simple explanation of much of Auden's celebrated obscurity.\"\nThough it is common advice for poets to avoid abstract concepts and focus on concrete imagery, Harold Bloom quotes John Hollander as writing that \"It is a peculiarity of Auden's own kind of poetic modernity that he has never felt the concept to be the enemy of the image, or discourse to be destructive of poetry.\" Auden's scientific allusions and technical jargon contribute further to his inaccessibility.\nThough he wrote many politically-charged poems and associated himself with left-wing intellectuals like Stephen Spender, Cecil Day Lewis, Louis MacNeice, and Christopher Isherwood, Auden believed later in life that the arts could do nothing to affect politics. As he puts it in his elegiac poem \"In Memory of W.B. Yeats,\" \"poetry makes nothing happen: it survives/In the valley of its making where executives/Would never want to tamper.\" Auden told the Paris Review in 1972 that \"The social and political history of Europe would be what it has been if Dante, Shakespeare, Michelangelo, Mozart, et al., had never lived.\" Such art, he says, will merely \"enhance [a poet's] literary reputation among those who feel the same as he does.\"\nAuden was even known for going back and rejecting poems whose messages he no longer (or perhaps never) believed. The fact that \"Spain\" was widely regarded as one of the most important pieces of Spanish Civil War literature did not stop him from rejecting the poem, which he thought dishonest, in later collections. Auden did much the same with one of his other most popular works, \"September 1, 1939,\" a poem about the onset of World War II. One of the poem's stanzas ends with the line \"We must love one another or die\"; upon rereading this line Auden wrote that he said to himself: \"That's a damned lie! We must die anyway.\" This eventually led to him scrapping the entire poem.\nIn 1973, Auden died in his sleep in an old Vienna hotel, at the age of 66. He left an unfinished book of poems that was published posthumously under the title Thank You Fog. Included in this book were \"Shorts,\" three- or four-line poems that resembled proverbs, for example:\nMan must either fall in love\nwith Someone or Something,\nor else fall ill.\nAlong with several plays and libretti, W.H. Auden had published about four hundred poems in his lifetime, and an even larger number of essays and reviews. He was buried in Kirchstetten. His funeral procession began in his cottage on Audenstrasse, a street that had recently been renamed in his honor.\nPoems. London: Faber, 1930.\nThe Ascent of F6. (With Christopher Isherwood).
